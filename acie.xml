         <title>Plasma&#8208;Enabled Process with Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Sustainable Plastic Waste Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce a novel plasma&#8208;enabled strategy for rapidly decomposing various plastic wastes into high&#8208;value carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen. This innovative approach provides an attractive solution to the pressing issue of plastic waste accumulation, which poses significant environmental challenges and complicates waste management. Our method offers a cost&#8208;effective, efficient, and selective means of directly converting complex plastic wastes into valuable products, thereby supporting a circular plastic economy.







Abstract
The escalating issue of plastic waste generation has prompted the search for an effective solution to address these challenges. In this study, we present a novel plasma&#8208;enabled strategy for the rapid breakdown of various types of plastic wastes, including mixtures, into high&#8208;value carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen. The H2 yield and selectivity achieved through the implemented catalyst&#8208;free plasma&#8208;enabled strategy are 14.2 and 5.9&#8197;times higher, respectively, compared to those obtained with conventional thermal pyrolysis under similar conditions. It is noteworthy that this catalyst&#8208;free plasma alone approach yields a significantly higher energy yield of H2 (gH2/kWh) compared to other pyrolysis processes. By coupling plasma pyrolysis with thermal catalytic process, employing of 1&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% M/CeO2 (M=Fe, Co, and Ni) atomically dispersed catalysts can further enhance hydrogen production. Specifically, the 1&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% Co/CeO2 catalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic performance throughout the 10&#8197;cycles of plastic waste decomposition, achieving the highest H2 yield of 46.7&#8197;mmol/gplastic (equivalent to 64.4&#8201;% of theoretical H2 production) and nearly 100&#8201;% hydrogen atom recovery efficiency at the 7th cycle. Notably, the H2 yield achieved over the atomically dispersed Fe on CeO2 surface (1&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% Fe/CeO2) in the integrated plasma&#8208;thermal catalytic process is comparable to that obtained with Fe particles on CeO2 surface (10&#8197;wt&#8201;.&#8201;% Fe/CeO2). This outcome, demonstrated with single&#8208;atom catalysts, offers a promising avenue for cost&#8208;effective and efficient chemical plastic recycling. Through a combination of experimental and computational efforts, we have provided an in&#8208;depth understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of the investigated single atom catalysts in the developed plasma&#8208;enabled process. This innovative and straightforward approach provides a promising and expedient strategy for continuously converting diverse plastic waste streams, including mixed and contaminated sources, into high&#8208;value products conducive to a circular plastic economy.

         <title>A Highly Tumor&#8208;Permeating DNA Nanoplatform for Efficient Remodeling of Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA nanostructures have been widely employed as smart drug delivery systems. Now a tailored DNA structure&#8208;based nanoplatform with striking tumor&#8208;penetrating capability has been constructed to precisely load chemo&#8208;immunomodulators and photosensitizers for targeted remodeling of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This structurally and chemically well&#8208;defined DNA nanoplaform enabled pronounced tumor therapy in vivo.







Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and limited intratumoral permeation have largely constrained the outcome of tumor therapy. Herein, we report a tailored DNA structure&#8208;based nanoplatform with striking tumor&#8208;penetrating capability for targeted remodeling of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in vivo. In our design, chemo&#8208;immunomodulator (gemcitabine) can be precisely grafted on DNA sequences through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive linker. After self&#8208;assembly, the gemcitabine&#8208;grafted DNA structure can site&#8208;specifically organize legumain&#8208;activatable melittin pro&#8208;peptide (promelittin) on each vertex for intratumoral delivery and further function as the template to load photosensitizers (methylene blue) for ROS production. The tailored DNA nanoplatform can achieve targeted accumulation, highly improved intratumoral permeation, and efficient immunogenic cell death of tumor cells by laser irradiation. Finally, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment can be successfully remodeled by reducing multi&#8208;type immunosuppressive cells and enhancing the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes in the tumor. This rationally developed multifunctional DNA nanoplatform provides a new avenue for the development of tumor therapy.

         <title>Unlocking the Anion Effect on Steerable Production of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of THF/NaCl aq, which is attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. The anion promotes electron transfer through proximity effects and also induces a decrease in the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension, thereby increasing the HMF yield.







Abstract
Homogeneous metal salt catalysts play a pivotal role in industrial production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Herein, we first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/NaCl aqueous solution (NaCl aq). Notably, the anions affected the catalytic activity of the metal salts, leading to an order of magnitude difference in the HMF yields, i.e., AlBr3 (74.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;AlCl3 (60.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;Al2(SO4)3 (35.2&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;Al(NO3)3 (14.9&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The anion effect on steerable production of HMF could be attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. Anions form close&#8208;range interactions with glucose molecules by proximity effect to promote electron transfer, facilitating the isomerization of glucose to fructose. Besides, anions induce a reduction of the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension that rapidly transforms glucose from the ground state to the transition state, thereby increasing the HMF yield. Based on the revelation of anions effect and evaluation of techno&#8208;economic process, we expect to provides theoretical guidance for high&#8208;throughput screening of metal salt catalysts in industrial biorefinery.

         <title>Oriented Synthesis of Glycine from CO2, N2, and H2O via a Cascade Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete production chain was demonstrated for electrorefining glycine directly from air components containing CO2, N2, O2, and H2O. Such a prospective scheme was composed of three modules, linked by a spontaneous C&#8208;N formation process. The full&#8208;path design not only outlines a roadmap for selective C&#8208;N formation but also paves a perspective avenue for green manufacturing and origin&#8208;of&#8208;life research.







Abstract
Air contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen elements that are essential for the constitution of amino acids. Converting the air into amino acids, powered with renewable electricity, provides a green and sustainable alternative to petrochemical&#8208;based methods that produce waste and pollution. Here, taking glycine as an example, we demonstrated the complete production chain for electrorefining amino acids directly from CO2, N2, and H2O. Such a prospective Scheme was composed of three modules, linked by a spontaneous C&#8722;N bond formation process. The high&#8208;purity bridging intermediates, separated from the stepwise synthesis, boosted both the carbon selectivity from CO2 to glycine of 91.7&#8201;% and nitrogen selectivity from N2 to glycine of 98.7&#8201;%. Under the optimum condition, we obtained glycine with a partial current density of 160.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The high&#8208;purity solid glycine product was acquired with a separation efficiency of 98.4&#8201;%. This work unveils a green and sustainable method for the abiotic creation of amino acids from the air components.

Exchanging a sulfur atom against a methine group in a series of azaacene based diradicals furnishes non&#8208;Kekul&#233;, meta&#8208;quinodimethane based diradicals with singlet ground states and small singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Zwitterionic contributions are ruled out experimentally and quantum&#8208;chemically, and the diradicals display huge two&#8208;photon cross sections in the infrared spectral region.







Abstract
Non&#8208;Kekul&#233; quinoidal azaacences m&#8208;A (1&#8201;a,b) were synthesized and compared to their para&#8208; and ortho&#8208;quinodimethane analogues. m&#8208;A display high diradical characters (1&#8201;b: y0 = 0.88) due to their meta&#8208;quinodimethane (m&#8208;QDM) topology. Electron paramagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and supraquantum interference device measurements in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations revealed singlet ground states for m&#8208;A with singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST (0.13&#8211;0.25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and thermally populated triplet states. These non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structures are over all void of zwitterionic character and possess record high two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections over a broad spectral range in the near&#8208;infrared.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting with a Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion Efficiency Exceeding 2&#8201;% through Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic overall water splitting system is successfully developed using I3&#8722;/I&#8722; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of PMA2PbI4/MoS2 as the H2 evolution photocatalyst and theWO3/RuOx as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductors is a promising approach for converting solar energy to clean energy. However, challenges such as sluggish water oxidation kinetics and limited light absorption of photocatalyst cause low solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH). Herein, we develop a photocatalytic overall water splitting system using I3&#8722;/I&#8722; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of benzylammonium lead iodide (PMA2PbI4, PMA=C6H5CH2NH2) loaded with MoS2 (PMA2PbI4/MoS2) as the H2 evolution photocatalyst, and the RuOx&#8208;loaded WO3 (WO3/RuOx) as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07&#8201;%. This work provides a detour route for photocatalytic water splitting with the help of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; shuttle redox couple in the halide perovskite HI splitting system and enlightens one to integrate and utilize multi catalytic strategies for solar&#8208;driven water splitting.

         <title>Mesostructure&#8208;Specific Configuration of *CO Adsorption for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic ordered CuO mesostructures, specifically mesoporous m&#8208;CuO and cylindrical c&#8208;CuO, were rationally designed by templated routes, which exhibited favored adsorption for *CObridge and *COtop intermediates, respectively. Remarkably, the preferred *CObridge adsorption on the m&#8208;CuO catalyst promoted the selective generation of C2+ alcohols, whereas the *COtop intermediate on the c&#8208;CuO catalysts accelerated CO2 electroreduction to C2H4.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols produced by electrochemical CO2 reduction, such as ethanol and n&#8208;propanol, are considered as indispensable liquid energy carriers. In most C&#8722;C coupling cases, however, the concomitant gaseous C2H4 product results in the low selectivity of C2+ alcohols. Here, we report rational construction of mesostructured CuO electrocatalysts, specifically mesoporous CuO (m&#8208;CuO) and cylindrical CuO (c&#8208;CuO), enables selective distribution of C2+ products. The m&#8208;CuO and c&#8208;CuO show similar selectivity towards total C2+ products (&#8805;76&#8201;%), but the corresponding predominant products are C2+ alcohols (55&#8201;%) and C2H4 (52&#8201;%), respectively. The ordered mesostructure not only induces the surface hydrophobicity, but selectively tailors the adsorption configuration of *CO intermediate: m&#8208;CuO prefers bridged adsorption, whereas c&#8208;CuO favors top adsorption as revealed by in situ spectroscopies. Computational calculations unravel that bridged *CO adsorbate is prone to deep protonation into *OCH3 intermediate, thus accelerating the coupling of *CO and *OCH3 intermediates to generate C2+ alcohols; by contrast, top *CO adsorbate is apt to undergo conventional C&#8722;C coupling process to produce C2H4. This work illustrates selective C2+ products distribution via mesostructure manipulation, and paves a new path into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with tunable adsorption configuration of key intermediates for targeted products.

         <title>S&#8722;S Bond Strategy at Sulfide Heterointerface: Reversing Charge Transfer and Constructing Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuSx/NbS2 heterostructure was synthesized by the introducing of amorphous RuSx onto crystalline NbS2 surface. It shows a Pt&#8208;like HER activity with a low overpotential as 38&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is mainly benefit from hydrogen spillover caused by reversing charge transfer that induced by S&#8722;S bonds at RuSx/NbS2 heterointerface.







Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalyst in sulfides for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still poses challenges due to the lack of understanding the role of sulfide heterointerface. Here, we report a sulfide heterostructure RuSx/NbS2, which is composed of 3R&#8208;type NbS2 loaded by amorphous RuSx nanoparticles with S&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface. As HER electrocatalyst, the RuSx/NbS2 shows remarkable low overpotential of 38&#8197;mV to drive a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid, and also low Tafel slope of 51.05&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The intrinsic activity of RuSx/NbS2 is much higher than that of Ru/NbS2 reference as well as the commercial Pt/C. Both experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a reversed charge transfer at the interface from NbS2 to RuSx that driven by the formation of S&#8722;S bonds, resulting in electron&#8208;rich Ru configuration for strong hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, electronic redistribution induced by the sulfide heterostructure facilitates hydrogen spillover (HSo) effect in this system, leading to accelerated hydrogen desorption at the basal plane of NbS2. This study provides an effective S&#8722;S bond strategy in sulfide heterostructure to synergistically modulate the charge transfer and adsorption thermodynamics, which is very valuable for the development of efficient electrocatalysts in practical applications.

As HER electrocatalyst, the RuS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NbS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows remarkable low overpotential of 38&#8197;mV to drive a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in acid, and also low Tafel slope of 51.05&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The intrinsic activity of RuS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NbS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is much higher than that of Ru/NbS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reference as well as the commercial Pt/C. Both experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a reversed charge transfer at the interface from NbS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to RuS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; that driven by the formation of S&#8722;S bonds, resulting in electron-rich Ru configuration for strong hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, electronic redistribution induced by the sulfide heterostructure facilitates hydrogen spillover (HSo) effect in this system, leading to accelerated hydrogen desorption at the basal plane of NbS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This study provides an effective S&#8722;S bond strategy in sulfide heterostructure to synergistically modulate the charge transfer and adsorption thermodynamics, which is very valuable for the development of efficient electrocatalysts in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component vinylene&#8208;linked D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs)&#8208;based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) with reinforced intramolecular charge separation driving force was designed and prepared, achieving highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation efficiency and photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The Cu&#8208;CTUs active sites can effectively adsorb and activate CO2 to further enhance photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Intramolecular charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry between building blocks are critical factors for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) based photocatalyst. However, robust achieving both simultaneously has yet to be challenging despite ongoing efforts. Here we develop a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated vinylene&#8208;linked multivariate donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor MCOF (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A, termed UJN&#8208;1) by integrating benzyl cyanides linker with multiple functional building blocks of electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine and electron&#8208;deficient copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs) moieties, featuring with strong intramolecular charge separation driving force, extended conjugation degree of skeleton, and abundant active sites. The incorporation of Cu&#8208;CTUs acceptor with electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and concomitantly giant charge separation driving force can efficiently accelerate the photogenerated electrons transfer from triphenylamine to Cu&#8208;CTUs, revealing by experiments and theoretical calculations. Benefiting from the synergistically effect of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A configuration and vinylene linkage, the highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation is achieved. Consequently, UJN&#8208;1 exhibits an excellent CO formation rate of 114.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;h without any co&#8208;catalysts or sacrificial reagents under visible light, outperforming those analogous MCOFs with imine&#8208;linked (UJN&#8208;2, 28.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and vinylene&#8208;linked COF without Cu&#8208;CTU active sites (UJN&#8208;3, 50.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1), emphasizing the role of charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry in designing novel COFs&#8208;based photocatalyst.

         <title>Design of Ultra&#8208;Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for High&#8208;Sensitivity Flexible All&#8208;Polymer Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ultra&#8208;narrow&#8208;band gap polymer acceptors were synthesized for construction of all&#8208;polymer short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) photodetectors. The all&#8208;polymer photodetectors achieved a high specific detectivity (D*sh) over 1013 Jones from 610 (visible) to 1080&#8197;nm (SWIR) under zero bias. The all&#8208;polymer flexibe photodetectors were successfully applied in heart rate monitoring, optical communication and SWIR imaging.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer photodetectors possess unique mechanical flexibility and are ideally suitable for the application in next&#8208;generation flexible, wearable short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;2700&#8197;nm) photodetectors. However, all&#8208;polymer photodetectors commonly suffer from low sensitivity, high noise, and low photoresponse speed in the SWIR region, which significantly diminish their application potential in wearable electronics. Herein, two polymer acceptors with absorption beyond 1000&#8197;nm, namely P4TOC&#8208;DCBT and P4TOC&#8208;DCBSe, were designed and synthesized. The two polymers possess rigid structure and good conformational stability, which is beneficial for reducing energetic disorder and suppressing dark current. Owing to the efficient charge generation and ultralow noise current, the P4TOC&#8208;DCBT&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer photodetector achieved a specific detectivity (

) of over 1012 Jones from 650 (visible) to 1070&#8197;nm (SWIR) under zero bias, with a response time of 1.36&#8197;&#956;s. These are the best results for reported all&#8208;polymer SWIR photodetectors in photovoltaic mode. More significantly, the all&#8208;polymer blend films exhibit good mechanical durability, and hence the P4TOC&#8208;DCBT&#8208;based flexible all&#8208;polymer photodetectors show a small performance attenuation (&lt;4&#8201;%) after 2000&#8197;cycles of bending to a 3&#8197;mm radius. The all&#8208;polymer flexible SWIR organic photodetectors are successfully applied in pulse signal detection, optical communication and image capture.

         <title>Coupling Manipulation of Interfacial Chemistry and Coordination Structure in Vanadium Oxides Enables Rapid Magnesium Ion Diffusion Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed to synergistically manipulate the interfacial chemistry and coordination structure in oligolayered V2O5 (L&#8722;V2O5) for accelerating Mg2+ diffusion kinetics. The specific exposed crystal planes in L&#8722;V2O5 helps to establish the inorganic&#8208;organic interlocking CEI layer for accelerating Mg2+ diffusion. In addition, the straightened V&#8722;O structure in L&#8722;V2O5 provides fast Mg2+ diffusion path for developing high&#8208;kinetics magnesium batteries.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are a highly promising energy storage system due to their high volumetric capacity and intrinsic safety. However, the practical development of RMBs is hindered by the sluggish Mg2+ diffusion kinetics, including at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) and within the cathode bulk. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to manipulate the interfacial chemistry and coordination structure in oligolayered V2O5 (L&#8722;V2O5) for achieving rapid Mg2+ diffusion kinetics. In terms of the interfacial chemistry, the specific exposed crystal planes in L&#8722;V2O5 possess strong electron donating ability, which helps to promote the degradation dynamics of C&#8722;F/C&#8722;S bonds in the electrolyte, thereby establishing the inorganic&#8208;organic interlocking CEI layer for rapid Mg2+ diffusion. In terms of the coordination structure, the straightened V&#8722;O structure in L&#8722;V2O5 provides efficient ions diffusion path for accelerating Mg2+ diffusion in the cathode. As a result, the L&#8722;V2O5 delivers a high reversible capacity (355.3&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an excellent rate capability (161&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Impressively, the interdigital micro&#8208;RMBs is firstly assembled, exhibiting excellent flexibility and practicability. This work gives deeper insights into the interface and interior ions diffusion for developing high&#8208;kinetics RMBs.

         <title>Asymmetric Counteranion&#8208;Directed Electrocatalysis for Enantioselective Control of Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of enantioselectivity in radical cation reactions presents long&#8208;standing challenges. Here, we described a novel strategy of asymmetric counteranion&#8208;directed electrocatalysis to solve the enantioselectivity in radical cation chemistry. Examples of asymmetrical dehydrogenative indole&#8208;phenol [3+2] coupling and an atroposelective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H coupling reactions with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities demonstrated the great success of this strategy.

The control of enantioselectivity in radical cation reactions presents long&#8208;standing challenges, despite a few successful examples. We introduce a novel strategy of asymmetric counteranion&#8208;directed electrocatalysis to address enantioselectivity in radical cation chemistry. This concept has been successfully demonstrated in two reactions: an asymmetric dehydrogenative indole&#8208;phenol [3+2] coupling and an atroposelective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H dehydrogenative coupling. These reactions have enabled the synthesis of benzofuroindolines and C&#8722;N axially chiral indoles with high yields and excellent enantiomeric excesses. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed a radical&#8208;radical coupling mechanism. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the indole radical cation as the pivotal intermediate, rather than a neutral indolyl radical, shedding new light on the underlying processes driving these reactions.

         <title>Highly Selective Synthesis of Acetic Acid from Hydroxyl&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of Methane at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a hydroxyl&#8208;mediated route for methane oxidation to acetic acid with high selectivity using O2 and CO over Au&#8722;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. A high acetic acid selectivity of 92&#8201;% was achieved at the yield of 5.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 3.0&#8197;h. Au nanoparticles catalyzed hydroxyl species formation from CO, O2, and H2O, while atomically dispersed Fe species promoted the C&#8722;C coupling of CH4 and CO to produce acetic acid.







Abstract
Direct methane conversion and, in particular, the aerobic oxidation to acetic acid, remain an eminent challenge. Here, we reported a zeolite&#8208;supported Au&#8722;Fe catalyst (Au&#8722;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5) that converted methane to acetic acid with molecular oxygen as an oxidant in the presence of CO. Specifically, Au nanoparticles catalyzed the formation of hydroxyl species from the reaction of CO, O2, and H2O, meanwhile ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;supported atomically dispersed Fe species were responsible for the hydroxyl&#8208;mediated coupling of CH4 and CO to generate acetic acid. The reaction over 50&#8197;mg of Au&#8722;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 under 62&#8197;bar (CH4&#8201;:&#8201;CO&#8201;:&#8201;O2=14&#8201;:&#8201;14&#8201;:&#8201;3) at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 3.0&#8197;h yielded 5.7 millimoles of acetic acid per gram of the catalyst (mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1) with the selectivity of 92&#8201;%, outperformed most of reported catalysts. Significantly, the catalyst remained active even at 60&#8201;&#176;C. We anticipate that this hydroxyl&#8208;mediated route may guide the design of optimized catalysts for the direct methane functionalization at low temperatures.

         <title>Curvature&#8208;Induced Electron Spin Catalysis with Carbon Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid carbon spheres, synthesized by using molecular hexabromocyclopentadiene as a precursor molecule in a radical coupling reaction, exhibit curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis. Inverse Laplace transform of pulse&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance spectra show that the curvature spin of the carbon is an overlapping state of &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;radicals.







Abstract
Here, we report curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis by using solid carbon spheres as catalysts, which were synthesized using positive curvature molecular hexabromocyclopentadiene as a precursor molecule, following a radical coupling mechanism. The curvature spin of carbon is regarded as an overlapping state of &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;radical, which is identified by the inverse Laplace transform of pulse&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance. The growth mechanism of carbon spheres abiding by Kroto's model, is supported by the density functional theory study of thermodynamics and kinetics calculations. The solid carbon spheres present excellent catalytic behaviour of oxidation coupling of amines to form corresponding imines with the conversion of &gt;99&#8201;%, selectivity of 98.7&#8201;%, and yield of 97.7&#8201;%, which is attributed to the predominantly curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis of carbon, supported by the calculation of oxygen adsorption energy. This work proposes a view of curvature&#8208;induced spin catalysis of carbon, which opens up a research direction for curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis.

         <title>Supramolecular Modulation for Selective Mechanochemical Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical strategy used for the iron&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of aromatic and aliphatic olefins is developed. This combined catalytic system through the integration of Fe(III)/porphyrin and cyclodextrins under the optimal ball&#8208;milling conditions enables a collaborative oxidation process and provides a wide range of Markovnikov&#8208;selective ketone products with markedly enhanced catalytic efficiency compared to conventional batch procedures.







Abstract
The development of a mechanochemical Fe&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of olefins with a sustainable and benign procedure holds significant promise for industrial applications. However, navigating the intricate interactions inherent in ball&#8208;milling conditions to fine&#8208;tune reaction selectivity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, leveraging the dispersive and/or trapping properties of cyclodextrins, an innovative mechanochemical approach is developed through the integration of cyclodextrins into a Fe&#8208;catalyzed system, enabling a streamlined Wacker oxidation process from simple and/or commercially available alkenes. Our efforts have yielded optimized mechanochemical conditions demonstrating exceptional reactivity and selectivity in generating a diverse array of ketone products, markedly enhancing catalytic efficiency compared to conventional batch methods. Mechanistic investigations have revealed a predominantly Markovnikov&#8208;selective catalytic cycle, effectively minimizing undesired alcohol formation, hydrogenation, and the other competing pathways, boosting both reaction yield and selectivity.

         <title>A Bandgap&#8208;Tuned Tetragonal Perovskite as Zero&#8208;Strain Anode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to solve the bottleneck problem for PIBs anode with alloying element is to provide sufficient buffer and restraint for the unavoidable volume expansion and stabilized structure. Our work innovatively presented a new route to chemically confine alloying element in a cubic framework to effectively provide stable structure. Demonstrated by in situ XRD and other characterizations, owing to the stabilized structure, the rationally designed anode yields stable electrochemical performance and zero&#8208;strain potassium storage.







Abstract
PIBs are emerging as a promising energy storage system due to high abundance of potassium resources and theoretical energy density, however, progress of PIBs is severely hindered by structural instability and poor cycling of anode material during continual insertion and extraction of larger&#8208;sized K+. Hence, developing anode material with structural stability and stable cycling remains a great challenge. Herein, band gap&#8208;tuned Mo&#8208;doped and carbon&#8208;coated lead titanate (CMPTO) with zero&#8208;strain K+ storage is presented as ultra&#8208;stable PIBs anode. Mo doping introduces narrowed band gap and optimized crystal lattice for enhanced intrinsic electron and ion transfer. Demonstrated by in situ XRD characterizations, the crystal structure stays stable with unchanged peak positions, fully revealing zero&#8208;strain characteristic of CMPTO anode during potassium storage for stable cyclic capability. Ultimately, CMPTO anode achieved ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of 7000 cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with high capacity retention of 90&#8201;% and considerable specific capacity of 130.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1; with relatively large density, CMPTO realized eminent volumetric capacity of 1111.09&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 10000 cycles at 7041&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. This work introduces a promisingly new route into developing anode materials with ultra&#8208;stable performance for PIBs.

         <title>Perfect Is Perfect: Nickel Prussian Blue Analogue as A High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general solvent exchange induced reconstruction strategy is developed for the synthesis of unusual NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructures as a high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8208;ORR electrocatalyst. The perfect stoichiometric composition with saturated lattice water and {210} dominated facet exposure of NiNi&#8208;PBA collaborately lead to a high 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity of 100&#8201;% and H2O2 yield of 5.7&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are a large family of functional materials with diverse applications such as in electrochemical fields. However, their use in the emerging two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction for clean production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is lagging. Herein, a general solvent exchange induced reconstruction strategy is demonstrated, through which an abnormal NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructure is synthesized as a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for H2O2 generation. The resultant NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructure has a stoichiometric composition with saturated lattice water, and a leaf&#8208;like morphology composed of interconnected small&#8208;size nanosheets with identical orientation and predominate {210} side surface exposure. Our studies show that the Ni&#8722;N centers on {210} facets are the active sites, and the saturated lattice H2O favors a six&#8208;coordinated environment that results in high selectivity. The &#8220;perfect&#8221; structure including stoichiometric composition and ideal facet exposure leads to a high selectivity of ~100&#8201;% and H2O2 yield of 5.7&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, superior to the reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts and most other electrocatalysts.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Photo&#8208;Assisted Phase Switching of Antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;Ferroelectric Orders in an I3&#8722;&#8208;Intercalated 2D Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a new I3&#8722;&#8208;intercalated 2D perovskite antiferroelectric with an ultra&#8208;narrow band gap (~1.65&#8197;eV), of which AFE&#8208;to&#8208;FE phase switching is easily obtained upon visible light, due to the reduction of phase switching barrier caused by light&#8208;sensitive I3&#8722; anion. This work paves a pathway to develop future photoelectroactive materials with potential applications.







Abstract
Antiferroelectric (AFE) has emerged as a promising branch of electroactive materials, due to intriguing physical attributes stemming from the electric field&#8208;induced antipolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar phase transformation. However, the requirement of extremely high electric field strength to switch adjacent sublattice polarization poses great challenges for exploiting new molecular AFE system. Although photoirradiation is striking as a noncontact and nondestructive manipulation tool to optimize physical properties, optical control of antiferroelectricity still remains unexplored. Here, by adopting light&#8208;sensitive I3&#8722; anion into 2D perovskite family, we design a new I3&#8722;&#8208;intercalated molecular AFE of (t&#8208;ACH)2EA2Pb3I10(I3)0.5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;((H3O)(H2O))0.5 (1, t&#8208;ACH=trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclohexanecarboxylate, EA=ethylammonium). The I3&#8722;&#8208;intercalating gives an ultra&#8208;narrow band gap of 1.65&#8197;eV with strong absorption. In term of AFE structure, the anti&#8208;parallel alignment of electric dipoles results in a large spontaneous polarization of 4.3&#8197;&#956;C/cm2. Strikingly, 1 merely shows AFE behaviour in the dark even under ultrahigh voltage, while the field&#8208;induced ferroelectric state can be facilely obtained upon visible illumination. Such unprecedented visible&#8208;photo&#8208;assisted phase switching ascribes to the incorporation of photoactive I3&#8722; anions that reduces AFE&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric switching barrier. This pioneering work on the photo&#8208;assisting transformation of ferroic orders paves a way to develop future photoactive materials with potential applications.

         <title>Designing Cooperative Ion Transport Pathway in Ultra&#8208;Thin Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes toward Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was proposed to confine PVDF&#8722;HFP inside pores of fluorinated covalent organic frameworks (CF3&#8722;COF) to synergistically enhance ion transport within polymer matrices. The long&#8208;ordered ion transfer pathway can effective enhance ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The insights gained from this research could pave the way for the development of more efficient and stable solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries toward practicalization.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries due to their decent flexibility, safety, and interfacial stability. However, their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and limited conductivity, leading to inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we proposed to design ultra&#8208;thin solid&#8208;state electrolyte with long&#8208;range cooperative ion transport pathway to effectively increase the ionic conductivity and stability. The impregnation of PVDF&#8722;HFP inside pores of fluorinated covalent organic framework (CF3&#8722;COF) can disrupt its symmetry, rendering rapid ion transportation and inhibited anion immigration. The functional groups of CF3&#8722;COF can interact with PVDF&#8722;HFP to form fast Li+ transport channels, which enables the uniform and confined Li+ conduction within the electrolyte. The introduction of CF3&#8722;COF also enhances the mechanical strength and flexibility of SPEs, as well as ensures homogeneous Li deposition and inhibited dendrite growth. Hence, a remarkably high conductivity of 1.21&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 can be achieved. Finally, the ultra&#8208;thin SPEs with an extremely long cycle life exceed 9000&#8197;h can be obtained while the NCM523/Li pouch cell demonstrates a high capacity of 760&#8197;mAh and 96&#8201;% capacity retention after cycling, holding great promises to be utilized for practical solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>Nuclease&#8208;Resistant L&#8208;DNA Tension Probes Enable Long&#8208;Term Force Mapping of Single Cells and Cell Consortia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel class of DNA&#8208;based tension probes, L&#8208;DNA tension probes, based on the non&#8208;biological stereoisomer of D&#8208;DNA. These probes are exceptionally resistant to nuclease degradation and remarkably bioinert. Unlike conventional D&#8208;DNA probes, L&#8208;DNA probes can endure cell culture environments for several days, enabling long&#8208;term imaging of single cells as well as a group of cells.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based tension probes with precisely programmable force responses provide important insights into cellular mechanosensing. However, their degradability in cell culture limits their use for long&#8208;term imaging, for instance, when cells migrate, divide, and differentiate. This is a critical limitation for providing insights into mechanobiology for these longer&#8208;term processes. Here, we present DNA&#8208;based tension probes that are entirely designed based on the stereoisomer of biological D&#8208;DNA, i.e., L&#8208;DNA. We demonstrate that L&#8208;DNA tension probes are essentially indestructible by nucleases and provide days&#8208;long imaging without significant loss in image quality. We also show their superiority already for short imaging times commonly used for classical D&#8208;DNA tension probes. We showcase the potential of these resilient probes to image minute movements, and for generating long term force maps of single cells and of collectively migrating cell populations.

         <title>Synthesis and Solvent Free DLP 3D Printing of Degradable Poly(Allyl Glycidyl Ether Succinate)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of poly(allyl glycidyl ether succinate) (PAGES), a low viscosity, degradable polyester by ring opening copolymerization and its use in combination with degradable thiol crosslinkers to afford a solvent free resin yielding 3D printed parts with minimal shrinkage and residual stress.







Abstract
Digital light processing (DLP) printing forms solid constructs from fluidic resins by photochemically crosslinking polymeric resins with reactive functional groups. DLP is used widely due to its efficient, high&#8208;resolution printing, but its use and translational potential has been limited in some applications as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art resins experience unpredictable and anisotropic part shrinkage due to the use of solvent needed to reduce resin viscosity and layer dependent crosslinking. Herein, poly(allyl glycidyl ether succinate) (PAGES), a low viscosity, degradable polyester, was synthesized by ring opening copolymerization and used in combination with degradable thiol crosslinkers to afford a solvent free resin that can be utilized in DLP printing. Varying resin formulations of PAGES polymer are shown to decrease part shrinkage from 14&#8201;% to 0.3&#8201;%. Photochemically printed parts fabricated from PAGES possess tensile moduli between 0.43 and 6.18&#8197;MPa and degradation profiles are shown to vary between 12 and 40&#8197;days under accelerated conditions based on degree of polymerization and crosslink ratio.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Stabilized Single CoN4Cl2 Site Boosts Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction into Tunable Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique Co&#8722;N4Cl2 single&#8208;site was fabricated on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via molecule modulation and exhibited high efficiency in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion into syngas, showing a high production rate, TON, and TOF. The triazine&#8208;based COF framework promotes the charge kinetics and the single Co&#8722;N4Cl2 site strengthens the CO2 activation by reducing the activation energy towards the key intermediate *COOH.







Abstract
Solar carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provides an attractive alternative to producing sustainable chemicals and fuel. However, the construction of a highly active photocatalyst was challenging because of the rapid charge recombination and sluggish surface CO2 reduction. Herein, a unique Co&#8722;N4Cl2 single site was fabricated by loading Co species into the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF) for CO2 conversion into syngas under visible light irradiation. The resulting champion catalyst TPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Co enabled a record&#8208;high CO production rate of 426&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, associated with the unprecedented turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 2095 and 1607&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively. The catalyst also exhibited favorable recycling performance and widely adjustable syngas production (CO/H2 ratio: 1.8&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;1&#8201;:&#8201;16). A systematical investigation including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), and theoretical calculation indicated that the triazine&#8208;based COF framework promoted the charge transfer towards the single Co&#8722;N4Cl2 sites that greatly promoted the CO2 activation by lowering the energy barrier of *COOH generation, facilitating the CO2 transformation. This work highlights the great potential of the molecular regulation of COF&#8208;derived single&#8208;atom catalysts to boost CO2 photoreduction efficiency.

         <title>Experimental Observation of a Terminal Borylene&#8208;Dinitrogen Adduct via Cleavage of a 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Diboratriazoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of a doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene with organic azides yields stable CAAC&#8208;iminoborane adducts. Experimental and computational data confirm the involvement of a relatively long&#8208;lived terminal borylene&#8208;dinitrogen adduct (i.e. diazoborane), [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)] as a key intermediate in the reaction.







Abstract
While azides do not react with simple alkenes except under harsh conditions, a diboron alkene analogue, the doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene 1, reacts spontaneously with organic azides (7&#8211;10&#8197;equiv.) at room temperature to yield two equivalents of stable CAAC&#8208;imino(cyano)boranes (2&#8208;R). NMR&#8208;spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction mixtures shows the initial formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of 2&#8208;R and a relatively long&#8208;lived intermediate (Int), which in the presence of excess azide is converted into a second equivalent of 2&#8208;R. In the absence of excess azide, however, Int decomposes to 3, the product of an intramolecular C&#8722;H activation by a putative dicoordinate borylene intermediate &#8220;(CAAC)B(CN)&#8221;. Mechanistic insights from trapping experiments, NMR&#8208;spectroscopic and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry data, as well as DFT computations reveal that Int is the terminal borylene end&#8208;on&#8208;dinitrogen adduct [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The formation of the iminoboranes 2&#8208;R from diborene 1 and RN3 proceeds via an azide&#8208;diborene Huisgen&#8208;type [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, followed by a retro&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition, yielding 2&#8208;R and [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The latter then undergoes either N2 extrusion and intramolecular C&#8722;H activation to generate 3, or a Staudinger&#8208;type reaction with a second equivalent of azide to generate a second equivalent of the iminoborane 2&#8208;R.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Ball Milling Enables an Ultra&#8208;Fast Wittig Olefination Under Ambient and Solvent&#8208;free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a protocol for a solvent&#8208;free mechanically induced Wittig olefination under ambient conditions often without the need of ylide pre&#8208;formation with a 30&#8197;seconds reaction time under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions.







Abstract
30&#8197;Seconds to success!&#8212;The Wittig reaction, a fundamental and extensively utilized reaction in organic chemistry, enables the efficient conversion of carbonyl compounds to olefins using phosphonium salts. Traditionally, meticulous reaction setup, including the pre&#8208;formation of a reactive ylide species via deprotonation of a phosphonium salt, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;yielding reactions under classical solution&#8208;based conditions. In this report, we present an unprecedented protocol for an ultra&#8208;fast mechanically induced Wittig reaction under solvent&#8208;free and ambient conditions, often eliminating the need for tedious ylide pre&#8208;formation under strict air and moisture exclusion. A range of aldehydes and ketones were reacted with diverse phosphonium salts under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions, frequently giving access to the respective olefins in only 30&#8197;seconds.

         <title>Synthesis and Anisotropic Memristive Behavior of Borophene Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline borophene nanosheets were successfully synthesized on an aluminum foil substrate, exhibiting two characteristic borophene structures: &#946;12&#8208;borophene and &#945;&#8216;&#8208;4H&#8208;borophene. The anisotropic memory behavior of quasi&#8208;continuous borophene nanosheet films has been observed, which is characterized by volatile memory in the vertical direction and non&#8208;volatile memory in the horizontal direction.







Abstract
Neuromorphic computing, marked by its parallel computational abilities and low power usage, has become pivotal in advancing artificial intelligence. However, the advancement of neuromorphic computing has faced significant obstacles due to the performance limitations of traditional memory devices struggling with high power consumption and limited reliability. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively investigated as high&#8208;performance memristive materials, but they are often restricted by fixed memristive properties, which complicate circuit design and limit flexibility. Here, we report that multilayer borophene nanosheets represent a breakthrough material, displaying anisotropic variable memristive properties. The nanosheets, comprising semiconductor &#945;&#8217;&#8208;4H&#8208;borophene sheets and metal &#946;12&#8208;borophene sheets, have been synthesized on aluminum foil surface through chemical vapor deposition method. The multilayer borophene nanosheets exhibit volatile memory behavior in the vertical direction and non&#8208;volatile memory behavior in the planar direction. This innovative class of 2D nanosheets not only overcomes the limitations of conventional memory devices but also expands the potential applications of borophene&#8208;based memories in information storage and in&#8208;memory computing.

&lt;p&gt;Highly crystalline borophene nanosheets were successfully synthesized on an aluminum foil substrate, exhibiting two characteristic borophene structures: &#946;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-borophene and &#945;&#8216;-4H-borophene. The anisotropic memory behavior of quasi-continuous borophene nanosheet films has been observed, which is characterized by volatile memory in the vertical direction and non-volatile memory in the horizontal direction.

         <title>The Asymmetrical Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se Bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 Boosting Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalytic Performance for Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Fe&#8208;based selenium oxide catalyst Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC was fabricated for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). The Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC@NC could obviously enhance catalytic performance of ORR and OER because it can modify coordination environment surrounding Fe atoms and accordingly realize an optimization of the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates. Furthermore, the Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC&#8208;based ZABs exhibit superior peak power density and specific capacity in comparison to Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;based ZABs.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have the advantages of high energy density and rich zinc raw materials. It is a low&#8208;cost, green and sustainable energy storage device. At present, one of the key technologies that hinder the large&#8208;scale application of ZABs is the design and fabrication oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional catalysts with excellent performance, especially the non&#8208;platinum&#8208;based catalysts. Here N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Fe&#8208;based selenium oxide catalyst Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC with high performance has been fabricated by a one&#8208;step pyrolysis and then the electrochemical oxidization. The experimental results confirmed that the existence of Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 crystal phase of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC, and the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds could obviously enhance ORR and OER catalytic performance of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC. Density functional theoretical calculations (DFT) confirmed that the Fe2O(SeO3)2 in Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC had a higher d&#8208;band center of Fe atom and a lower p&#8208;orbital coupling degree with its own lattice O atom than Fe2O3, which leads to Fe site of Fe2O(SeO3)2 being more likely to adsorb external oxygen intermediates. The Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 results in the modification of coordination environment of Fe atoms and optimizes the adsorption energy of Fe site for oxygen intermediates. Compared with Fe2O3/Fe3C@NC, the Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC showed the obvious enhancements of ORR/OER catalytic activities with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V for ORR in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte and a low overpotential of 345&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The peak power density and specific capacity of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC&#8208;based ZABs are higher than those of Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;ZABs. The above results demonstrate that the asymmetrical Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 plays a key role in improving the bifunctional catalytic activities of ORR/OER for ZABs.

         <title>Operando Stable Palladium Hydride Nanoclusters Anchored on Tungsten Carbides Mediate Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reverse hydrogen spillover was mediated over operando stable Pd hydrides on tungsten carbides systems, which endows efficient and durable hydrogen evolution in proton exchange membrane electrolysis with ultralow Pd loading of 0.022&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis holds great promise for green hydrogen production, but suffering from high loading of platinum&#8208;group metals (PGM) for large&#8208;scale deployment. Anchoring PGM&#8208;based materials on supports can not only improve the atomic utilization of active sites but also enhance the intrinsic activity. However, in practical PEM electrolysis, it is still challenging to mediate hydrogen adsorption/desorption pathways with high coverage of hydrogen intermediates over catalyst surface. Here, operando generated stable palladium (Pd) hydride nanoclusters anchored on tungsten carbide (WCx) supports were constructed for hydrogen evolution in PEM electrolysis. Under PEM operando conditions, hydrogen intercalation induces formation of Pd hydrides (PdHx) featuring weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE), thus triggering reverse hydrogen spillover from WCx (strong HBE) supports to PdHx sites, which have been evidenced by operando characterizations, electrochemical results and theoretical studies. This PdHx&#8208;WCx material can be directly utilized as cathode electrocatalysts in PEM electrolysis with ultralow Pd loading of 0.022&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, delivering the current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the cell voltage of ~1.66&#8197;V and continuously running for 200&#8197;hours without obvious degradation. This innovative strategy via tuning the operando characteristics to mediate reverse hydrogen spillover provide new insights for designing high&#8208;performance supported PGM&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Metformin Conjugates Acting as Promising PD&#8208;L1 Inhibitors through the AMP&#8208;Activated Protein Kinase Mediated Lysosomal Degradation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate was developed to modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment through PD&#8722;L1 down&#8208;regulation and hypoxia reversion, leading to highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small&#8208;molecular Pt(II) complex. The study led to the proposal of an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time.







Abstract
With the development of metalloimmunology, the potential of platinum drugs in cancer immunotherapy has attracted extensive attention. Although immunochemotherapy combining PD&#8208;1/PD&#8722;L1 antibodies with platinum drugs has achieved great success in the clinic, combination therapy commonly brings new problems. Herein, we have developed a platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate as a promising alternative to antibody&#8208;based PD&#8722;L1 inhibitors, not only disrupting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8722;L1 axis on cell surface but also down&#8208;regulating the total PD&#8722;L1 levels in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells comprehensively, thus achieving highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small molecule. Mechanism studies demonstrate that Pt&#8208;metformin conjugate can selectively accumulate in lysosomes, promote lysosomal&#8208;dependent PD&#8722;L1 degradation via the AMPK&#8208;TFEB pathway, and modulate the upstream regulatory proteins related to PD&#8722;L1 expression (e.g. HIF&#8208;1&#945; and NF&#8208;&#954;B), eventually decreasing the total abundance of PD&#8722;L1 in NSCLC, overcoming tumor hypoxia, and activating anti&#8208;tumor immunity in vivo. This work suggests an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time and provides a unique design perspective for the development of novel platinum drugs for immunochemotherapy.

         <title>A Piezocatalysis Strategy to Enable Efficient Redox in Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezocatalysis is considered to be a favorable catalytic technology by utilizing external mechanical stimulation to promote the specific redox reactions. The application of piezocatalysis in batteries is promising but faces formidable challenges. Herein, the operation principles of piezocatalysis were successfully demonstrated by constructing a solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se (S) battery model with interfacial stress accumulation. Lead zirconate titanate with an ultra&#8208;high piezoelectric coefficient was applied as the piezoelectric catalyst. The uniformity of the dipole orientation in materials was essential for achieving piezocatalysis in batteries. The accumulated high&#8208;stress converts to piezopotential for catalyzing most reaction processes in batteries, while the rapid stress change prevents the internal charge reorganization, ensuring continuous efficient catalysis. The internal stress change alters the internal polarisation strength, driving excess screening charge to participate in the electrochemical reaction. Under piezocatalysis, solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se batteries exhibited a initial discharge capacity of 670.9 mAh g&#8722;1 (99.4% of the theoretical value) at 0.1C, and Li&#8722;S batteries showed a capacity of 1463 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2C, which was still maintained up to 1084 mAh g&#8722;1 at an elevated rate of 0.5C. This piezocatalysis strategy provides a strong theoretical basis and design specification for enhancing Li&#8722;Se (S) cell reaction kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal (3+2) Cycloadditions of Bicyclobutanes with Imines: Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc Lewis acid catalyzes asymmetric (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines to afford aza&#8208;BCHs bearing &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers in high yields and er values. Expeirmental studies and DFT calculations provide mechanistic insight.







Abstract
The cycloaddition reaction involving bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) offers a versatile and efficient synthetic platform for producing C(sp3)&#8208;rich rigid bridged ring scaffolds, which act as phenyl bioisosteres. However, there is a scarcity of catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of BCBs to fulfill the need for enantioenriched saturated bicycles in drug design and development. In this study, an efficient synthesis of valuable azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (aza&#8208;BCHs) by an enantioselective zinc&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines is reported. The reaction proceeds effectively with a novel type of BCB that incorporates a 2&#8208;acyl imidazole group and a diverse array of alkynyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted imines. The target aza&#8208;BCHs, which consist of &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers, are efficiently synthesized with up to 94&#8201;%&#8197;and 96.5:3.5 er under mild conditions. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the reaction follows a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism of BCBs with imines. This mechanism is distinct from previous studies on Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of BCBs.

         <title>6&#8208;Hydroxy Picolinohydrazides Promoted Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxylation Reaction in Water: Machine&#8208;Learning Accelerated Ligands Design and Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/6&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reaction of (hetero)aryl halides in water is described. For bromides, reaction worked well with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C. For chlorides, hydroxylation proceeded at 100&#8201;&#176;C with 2&#8211;3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. These represent the state of art for both lowest catalyst loading and temperature in the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reactions.







Abstract
Hydroxylated (hetero)arenes are privileged motifs in natural products, materials, small&#8208;molecule pharmaceuticals and serve as versatile intermediates in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient Cu(I)/6&#8208;hydroxy picolinohydrazide&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reaction of (hetero)aryl halides (Br, Cl) in water. By establishing machine learning (ML) models, the design of ligands and optimization of reaction conditions were effectively accelerated. The N&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208; carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide (L32, 6&#8208;HPA&#8208;DMCA) demonstrated high efficiency for (hetero)aryl bromides, promoting hydroxylation reactions with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;% (100&#8197;ppm) at 80&#8201;&#176;C to reach 10000 TON; for substrates containing sensitive functional groups, the catalyst loading needs to be increased to 3.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% under near&#8208;room temperature conditions. N&#8208;(2,7&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide (L42, 6&#8208;HPA&#8208;DTBCA) displayed superior reaction activity for chloride substrates, enabling hydroxylation reactions at 100&#8201;&#176;C with 2&#8211;3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. These represent the state of art for both lowest catalyst loading and temperature in the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reactions. Furthermore, this method features a sustainable and environmentally friendly solvent system, accommodates a wide range of substrates, and shows potential for developing robust and scalable synthesis processes for key pharmaceutical intermediates.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Triggered Spin&#8208;Magnetic Effect in Rare Earth Intraparticle Heterostructured Nanoalloys for Boosting Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antiferromagnetic couplings between rare earth and 3d transition&#8208;metal were achieved by creating RhCo&#8722;RhGd intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs), which could regulate the spin polarization of active sites to optimize adsorption and dissociation of H2O, thus boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs demonstrated excellent alkaline HER catalytic activity, with a small overpotential of 11.3&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and robust stability over 100&#8197;h operation.







Abstract
Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4&#8201;f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. Alloying RE with conventional 3d transition&#8208;metal (TM) is promising for the fabrication of advanced spin catalysts yet remains much difficulties in preparation, which leads to the mysteries of spin&#8208;magnetic effect between RE and 3d TM on catalysis. Here we define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d TM&#8208;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs) with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework, denoted as RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs. They exhibit interface&#8208;triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization. Theoretical calculations further reveal that active sites around the heterointerface with weakened spin polarization optimize the adsorption and dissociation of H2O, thus promoting alkaline hydrogen evolution catalysis. The RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs show a small overpotential of 11.3&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as remarkable long&#8208;term stability, far superior to previously reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts.

Through in situ polymerization based on nucleophilic substitution, the self&#8208;standing covalent organic polymer membrane (TAPT&#8208;CC) was successfully prepared. This membrane exhibits a persistent ultramicropores structure and exceptional chemical stability, facilitating efficient ion sieving and rapid proton transport.

Abstract
Fabrication of ion&#8208;conducting membranes with continuous sub&#8208;nanometer channels holds fundamental importance for flow batteries in achieving safe integration of renewable energy into grids. Self&#8208;standing covalent organic polymer (COP) membranes provide feasibility due to their rapid and selective ion transport. However, the development of a scale&#8208;up possible, mechanically robust and chemically stable membranes remains a significant challenge. Herein, using irreversible strong secondary amine linkage, we propose a self&#8208;standing COP membrane with sub&#8208;nanometer pores ranging from 4.5 to 6.4&#8197;&#197;, by a simple and efficient in situ polymerization approach. This membrane exhibits enhanced selectivity for proton and vanadium ions, especially excellent electrochemical stability, delivering an energy efficiency of over 80&#8201;% at the current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 1000&#8197;cycles for an all&#8208;vanadium redox flow battery (VFB). This study provides novel insights for COP&#8208;based ion&#8208;sieving membranes in sustainable energy fields.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phosphonate&#8208;Organic Network as Ion Enrichment Layer for Sustainable Zinc Metal Electrode with High Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion enriching features of the spontaneously constructed metal&#8208;phosphonate&#8208;organic network (MPON) on Zn metal facilitates rapid and uniform transport of Zn&#8208;ions as well as inhibit parasitic reactions of Zn electrode, which greatly improves the reversibility of Zn anode and Zn&#8208;metal batteries under practical conditions.







Abstract
Zinc (Zn) metal batteries could be the technology of choice for sustainable battery chemistries owing to its better safety and cost advantage. However, their cycle life and Coulombic efficiency (CE) are strongly limited by the dendritic growth and side reactions of Zn anodes. Herein, we proposed an in situ construction of a metal&#8208;phosphonate&#8208;organic network (MPON) with three&#8208;dimensional interconnected networks on Zn metal, which can act as an ion enrichment layer for Zn anodes in Zn&#8208;metal batteries. This MPON with abundant porous structure and phosphate sites possesses ion enriching properties and high Zn2+ transference number (0.83), which is beneficial for enhancing Zn2+ migration and self&#8208;concentrating kinetics. Meanwhile, MPON offers hydrophobicity to effectively inhibit the water&#8208;induced Zn anode corrosion. As a result, the Zn electrode exhibits superior Zn/Zn2+ reversibility of over 4&#8197;months at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high CE of 99.6&#8201;%. Moreover, the Zn/NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O and Zn/MnO2 full cells using ultrathin Zn anodes (10&#8197;&#956;m) exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention of 81&#8201;% and 78&#8201;% after 1400 and 1000&#8197;cycles, respectively. This work provides a unique promise to design high&#8208;performance anode for practical Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Enantioconvergent Reductive Couplings of Racemic Allenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoredox/Cr/Co triple catalytic radical enantioconvergent reductive coupling of racemic allenes with aldehydes is developed. This method is applicable to various allenyl sulfones and allenyl esters, providing a versatile and robust platform for the construction of synthetically valuable homoallylic alcohols bearing an internal carbon&#8208;carbon double bond with excellent efficiency, selectivity, and functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;based enantioconvergent reactions have become a powerful strategy to synthesize enantiopure compounds from racemic starting materials. However, existing methods primarily address precursors with central chirality, neglecting those with axial chirality. Herein, we describe the enantioconvergent reductive coupling of racemic allenes with aldehydes, facilitated by a photoredox, chromium, and cobalt triple catalysis system. This method selectively affords one product from sixteen possible regio&#8208; and stereoisomers. The protocol leverages CoIII&#8722;H mediated hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and Cr&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;polar crossover for efficient stereoablation of axial chirality and asymmetric addition, respectively. Supported by mechanistic insights from control experiments, deuterium labeling, and DFT calculations, our approach offers synthetic chemists a valuable tool for creating enantioenriched chiral homoallylic alcohols, promising to advance radical&#8208;based strategies for synthesizing complex chiral molecules.

         <title>Towards Stable Helical Structures with Enhanced Molecular Conductance by Strengthening Through&#8208;Space Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method to stabilize the folded helical conformations of ortho&#8208;hexaphenylene is proposed by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridine and pyrazine rings into molecular backbone to strengthen intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation. In consequence, the through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transport pathway becomes dominant in folded helical molecules and contributes significantly to molecular conductance, with a 70&#8201;% enhancement.







Abstract
Developing long&#8208;chain molecules with stable helical structures is of significant importance for understanding and modulating the properties and functions of helical biological macromolecules, but challenging. In this work, an effective and facile approach to stabilize folded helical structures by strengthening through&#8208;space conjugation is proposed, using new ortho&#8208;hexaphenylene (o&#8208;HP) derivatives as models. The structure&#8211;activity relationship between the through&#8208;space conjugation and charge&#8208;transport behavior of the prepared folded helical o&#8208;HP derivatives is experimentally and theoretically investigated. It is demonstrated that the through&#8208;space conjugation within o&#8208;HP derivatives can be strengthened by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridine and pyrazine rings, which can effectively stabilize the helical structures of o&#8208;HP derivatives. Moreover, scanning tunneling microscopy&#8208;break junction measurements reveal that the stable regular helical structures of o&#8208;HP derivatives open&#8208;up dominant through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transport pathways, and the single&#8208;molecule conductance is enhanced by more than 70&#8201;% by strengthening through&#8208;space conjugation with pyridine and pyrazine. However, the through&#8208;bond charge transport pathways contribute much less to the conductance of o&#8208;HP derivatives. These results not only provide a new method for exploring stable helical molecules, but also provide a stepping stone for deciphering and modulating the charge&#8208;transport behavior of helical systems at the single&#8208;molecule level.

         <title>Probing Twist&#8208;Induced Endocytotic Membrane Fission using Anisotropic Gold Homodimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dumbbell&#8208;shaped gold homodimers (AuHD) were developed as an anisotropic probe to real&#8208;time monitoring of live endocytic vesicles under DFM for the kinetic study of dynamin&#8208;induced lipid remodeling underlying membrane fission.







Abstract
Membrane fission involves a crucial step of lipid remodeling, in which the dynamin collar constricts and severs the tubulated lipid membrane at the neck of budding vesicles. Nevertheless, the difficulty in accurately determining the rotational dynamics of live endocytotic vesicles poses a limit on the elucidation of dynamin&#8208;induced membrane remodeling for endocytotic vesicle scission. Herein, we designed a DNA&#8208;modified gold homodimer (AuHD)&#8208;based anisotropic plasmonic probe with uniform surface chemistry, minimizing orientational fluctuation within vesicle encapsulation. Using AuHDs as cargos to image the dynamics of cargo&#8208;containing vesicles during endocytosis, we showed that, prior to detachment from plasma membrane, the cargo&#8208;containing vesicles underwent multiple intermittent twists of ~4&#176; angular orientation relative to plasma membrane with a ~0.2&#8197;s dwell time. These findings suggest that the membrane torques resulting from dynamin actions in vivo constitute the pathway to membrane fission, potentially shedding light on how dynamin&#8208;mediated lipid remodeling orchestrates membrane fission.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotides for Exploration of Cellular Protein ADP&#8208;Ribosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synthesis of cell&#8208;permeable NADs bearing fluorescent (TAMRA) or affinity (desthiobiotin) tag and their utility for ADP&#8208;ribosylation studies in living cells. Cell&#8208;permeability was achieved by modification with cholesterol or polyarginine. The probes were accepted by all tested PARP enzymes. The optimized desthiobiotin&#8208;labelled NAD+ was used for affinity enrichment and identification of proteins ADP&#8208;ribosylated upon oxidative stress.







Abstract
Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) greatly enhance the functional diversity of proteins, surpassing the number of gene&#8208;encoded variations. One intriguing PTM is ADP&#8208;ribosylation, which utilizes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a substrate and is essential in cell signaling pathways regulating cellular responses. Here, we report the first cell&#8208;permeable NAD+ analogs and demonstrate their utility for investigating cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Using a desthiobiotin&#8208;labelled analog for affinity enrichment of proteins that are ADP&#8208;ribosylated in living cells under oxidative stress, we identified protein targets associated with host&#8208;virus interactions, DNA damage and repair, protein biosynthesis, and ribosome biogenesis. Most of these targets have been noted in various literature sources, highlighting the potential of our probes for cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylome studies.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extension of a Multiple Resonance Core: Double Helical and Heptagon&#8208;Embedded Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three double helical BN&#8208;doped nanographenes (BN&#8208;NGs) and three BN&#8208;NGs containing heptagon rings were synthesized. These compounds exhibited orange to near&#8208;infrared thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions. The incorporation of B and N heteroatoms promoted the formation of heptagon rings, which improved the chiroptical dissymmetry factor.







Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) boron&#8211;nitrogen doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) have shown compelling thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), surpassing those of their hydrocarbon analogues. However, the structural variety of &#960;&#8208;extended BN&#8208;PAHs remains narrow. In this study, we synthesized three double helical BN&#8208;doped nanographenes (BN&#8208;NGs), 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c, and three heptagon&#8208;embedded BN&#8208;NGs, 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c, by &#960;&#8208;extension of the MR core. During the formation of 2&#8201;a, a nanographene with one heptagon (1&#8201;a) was obtained, whereas further dehydrocyclization of the [6]helicene units within 2&#8201;b and 2&#8201;c led to heptagon structures, yielding other two BN&#8208;NGs containing double heptagons (1&#8201;b and 1&#8201;c). These BN&#8208;NGs (2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c and 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c) showed pronounced redshifts of 100&#8211;190&#8197;nm compared to the parent MR core, while preserving the TADF characteristics and prolonging the delayed fluorescence lifetime to the millisecond level. Furthermore, the integration of a heptagon ring into 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c expanded the conjugation, reduced the oxidation potentials, and yielded a more flexible framework compared to those of 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c. The enantiomers of 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c, 1&#8201;a, and 1&#8201;c were resolved and their chiroptical properties were studied. Notably, 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;c exhibited increased chiroptical dissymmetry factors.

         <title>Sublimation Transformation Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a straightforward sublimation transformation strategy for the controllable synthesis of a dual&#8208;atom Fe catalyst (Fe2/NC), overcoming the randomness and complexity of previous synthesis strategies. Experimental evidence and microkinetic analysis demonstrated that the adjacent Fe sites and optimal Fe&#8722;Fe distance in Fe2/NC were vital for the adsorption of O2 on catalytic sites and facilitating the subsequent protonation process.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable catalytic reactivity. However, achieving atomically precise control in the fabrication of DACs remains a major challenge. Herein, we developed a straightforward and direct sublimation transformation synthesis strategy for dual&#8208;atom Fe catalysts (Fe2/NC) by utilizing in situ generated Fe2Cl6(g) dimers from FeCl3(s). The structure of Fe2/NC was investigated by aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. As&#8208;obtained Fe2/NC, with a Fe&#8722;Fe distance of 0.3&#8197;nm inherited from Fe2Cl6, displayed superior oxygen reduction performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#8197;V (vs. RHE), surpassing commercial Pt/C catalysts, Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe1/NC), and its counterpart with a common and shorter Fe&#8722;Fe distance of ~0.25&#8197;nm (Fe2/NC&#8208;S). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis revealed the extended Fe&#8722;Fe distance in Fe2/NC is crucial for the O2 adsorption on catalytic sites and facilitating the subsequent protonation process, thereby boosting catalytic performance. This work not only introduces a new approach for fabricating atomically precise DACs, but also offers a deeper understanding of the intermetallic distance effect on dual&#8208;site catalysis.

         <title>Mo Migration&#8208;Induced Crystalline to Amorphous Conversion and Formation of RuMo/NiMoO4 Heterogeneous Nanoarray for Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting at Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the migration and segregation of Mo atoms and its superior affinity with Ru, the amorphous RuMo alloy&#8208;coupled amorphous NiMoO4 electrocatalyst is constructed, which promotes the directional evolution of interfacial water molecules and optimizes the d&#8208;band center and adsorption energy of relevant reaction intermediates, thereby contributing to remarkable electrocatalytic bifunctionality, especially at large current densities.







Abstract
Manipulating the atomic structure of the catalyst and tailoring the dissociative water&#8208;hydrogen bonding network at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface is essential for propelling alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), but remains a great challenge. Herein, we constructed an advanced a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF heterogeneous electrocatalyst with amorphous RuMo alloy nanoclusters anchored to amorphous NiMoO4 skeletons on Ni foam by a heteroatom implantation strategy. Theoretical calculations and in situ Raman tests show that the amorphous and alloying structure of a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF not only induces the directional evolution of interfacial H2O, but also lowers the d&#8208;band center (from &#8722;0.43 to &#8722;2.22&#8197;eV) of a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH*, from &#8722;1.29 to &#8722;0.06&#8197;eV), and the energy barrier of HzOR (&#916;GN2(g)=1.50&#8197;eV to &#916;GN2*=0.47&#8197;eV). Profiting from these favorable factors, the a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances, especially at large current densities, with an overpotential of 13 and 129&#8197;mV to reach 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for HER. While for HzOR, it needs only &#8722;91 and 276&#8197;mV to deliver 10 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Further, the constructed a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF||a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF electrolyzer demands only 7 and 420&#8197;mV to afford 10 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

While for HzOR, it needs only &#8722;91 and 276&#8197;mV to deliver 10 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Further, the constructed a-RuMo/NiMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NF||a-RuMo/NiMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NF electrolyzer demands only 7 and 420&#8197;mV to afford 10 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dynamically Ion&#8208;Sieved Electrolyte towards Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly conductive and dynamically ion&#8208;sieved electrolyte was developed to simultaneously enhance the Zn metal reversibility and suppress the cathode dissolution of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The experiment characterizations and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the dynamic ion screen is achieved at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which can selectively facilitate the plating/stripping and insertion/extraction process of desolvated/solvated Zn2+ on the anode and cathode surfaces.







Abstract
The practical deployment of Zn&#8208;ion batteries faces challenges such as dendrite growth, side reactions and cathode dissolution in traditional electrolytes. Here, we develop a highly conductive and dynamically ion&#8208;sieved electrolyte to simultaneously enhance the Zn metal reversibility and suppress the cathode dissolution. The dynamic ion screen at the electrode/electrolyte interface is achieved by numerous pyrane rings with a radius of 3.69&#8197;&#197;, which can selectively facilitate the plating/stripping and insertion/extraction process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ and Zn2+ on the anode and cathode surfaces. As a proof of concept, Zn//Zn symmetric cells deliver exceptional cyclic stability for over 6,800&#8197;h and ultrahigh cumulative plated capacity of 1.95&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Zn//Na2Mn3O7 cells exhibit satisfactory cycling performance with capacity retention of 82.7&#8201;% after 4,000&#8197;cycles, and the assembled pouch cells achieve excellent stability and durability. This work provides valuable insights into the development of electrolytes aimed at enhancing the interface stability of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Unveiling Ionized Interfacial Water&#8208;Induced Localized H* Enrichment for Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen atoms, especially Cl in atomically precise copper halide clusters [Cu2X2(BINAP)2 (X=Cl, Br, I)], can significantly affect the distance of alkali metal&#8208;ionized water on the catalyst surface, which can promote the water dissociation to enhance the localized H* enrichment for the continues hydrogenation of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a process that requires the participation of eight electrons and nine protons. The regulation of active hydrogen (H*) supply and a deep understanding of related processes are necessary for improving the ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we synthesized a series of atomically precise copper&#8208;halide clusters Cu2X2(BINAP)2 (X=Cl, Br, I), among which the Cu2Cl2(BINAP)2 cluster shows the optimal ammonia FE of 94.0&#8201;% and an ammonia yield rate of 373&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that halogen atoms, especially Cl in Cu2Cl2(BIANP)2, can significantly affect the distance of alkali metal&#8208;ionized water on the catalyst surface, which can promote the water dissociation to enhance the localized H* enrichment for the continues hydrogenation of nitrate to ammonia. This work explains the role of H* in the hydrogenation process of NO3RR and the importance of localized H* enrichment strategy for improving the FEs.

         <title>Boosting K+&#8208;Ionic Conductivity of Layered Oxides via Regulating P2/P3 Heterogeneity and Reciprocity for Room&#8208;Temperature Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;faceted strategy is deployed to overcome the K+&#8208;ion transport resistance of a layered solid electrolyte, P2/P3&#8208;K0.62Mg0.54Sb0.46O2, at both atomic and macro scales. As a result, a record&#8208;high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is achieved. Moreover, the modified solid electrolyte enables durable potassium metal batteries, outperforming organic liquid electrolyte.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, high energy density and inherent safety. However, solid state K&#8208;ion conductors struggle with poor ionic conductivity due to the large ionic radius of K+&#8208;ions. Herein, we report precise regulation of phase heterogeneity and reciprocity of the P2/P3&#8208;symbiosis K0.62Mg0.54Sb0.46O2 solid electrolyte (SE) for boosting a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The bulk ionic conducting mechanism is explored by elucidating the effect of atomic stacking mode within the layered framework on K+&#8208;ion migration barriers. For ion diffusion at grain boundaries, the P2/P3 biphasic symbiosis property assists in tunning the SE microstructure, which crystallizes in rod&#8208;like particles with lengths of tens of micrometers facilitating long&#8208;distance ion transport and significantly decreasing grain boundary resistance. Potassium metal symmetric cells using the modified SE deliver excellent cycling life over 300&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high critical current density of 0.68&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries (QSSKBs) coupled with two kinds of layered oxide cathodes demonstrate remarkable stability over 300&#8197;cycles, outperforming the liquid electrolyte counterparts. The QSSKB system provides a promising strategy for high&#8208;efficiency, safe, and durable large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Coronene&#8208;Based 2D Networks by On&#8208;Surface Skeletal Rearrangement of Sumanene Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D coronene&#8208;based networks have been synthesized by intramolecular rearrangements and subsequent coupling of sumanene precursors deposited on a hot Au(111) substrate. This approach paves the way for synthesizing organometallic and covalent low&#8208;dimensional nanoarchitectures by exploiting the intramolecular transformation of molecular precursors and their subsequent intermolecular reactivity.







Abstract
The design of novel low&#8208;dimensional carbon materials is at the forefront of modern chemistry. Recently, on&#8208;surface covalent synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy to synthesize previously precluded compounds and polymers. Here, we report a scanning probe microscopy study, complemented by theoretical calculations, on the sequential skeletal rearrangement of sumanene&#8208;based precursors into a coronene&#8208;based organometallic network by stepwise intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular reactions on Au(111). Interestingly, upon higher annealing, the formed organometallic networks evolve into two&#8208;dimensional coronene&#8208;based covalently linked patches through intermolecular homocoupling reactions. A new reaction mechanism is proposed based on the role of C&#8722;Au&#8722;C motifs to promote two stepwise carbon&#8208;carbon couplings to form cyclobutadiene bridges. Our results pave avenues for the conversion of molecular precursors on surfaces, affording the design of unexplored two&#8208;dimensional organometallic and covalent materials.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for Infectious Diseases Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phototheranostics of infectious diseases by utilizing NIR&#8208;II AIEgens has been developed at a tremendous pace. This Minireview summarizes recent efforts in this area in terms of molecular design strategy and bioapplications, and discusses current challenges and promising prospects.







Abstract
Pathogenic infectious diseases have persistently posed significant threats to public health. Phototheranostics, which combines the functions of diagnostic imaging and therapy, presents an extremely promising solution to block the spread of pathogens as well as the outbreak of epidemics owing to its merits of a wide&#8208;spectrum of activity, high controllability, non&#8208;invasiveness, and difficult to acquire resistance. Among multifarious phototheranostic agents, second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are notable by virtue of their deep penetration depth, excellent biocompatibility, balanced radiative and nonradiative decay and aggregation&#8208;enhanced theranostic performance, making them an ideal option for combating pathogens. This minireview provides a systematical summary of the latest advancements in NIR&#8208;II AIEgens with emphasis on the molecular design and nanoplatform formulation to fulfill high&#8208;efficiency in treating bacterial and viral pathogens, classified by disease models. Then, the current challenges, potential opportunities, and future research directions are presented to facilitate the further progress of this emerging field.

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide Allows Bioorthogonal Coupling of Type&#8208;I AIEgens for Pyroptosis&#8208;Induced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholecystokinin&#8208;2 receptor (CCK2R) dual&#8208;targeting peptide, which can self&#8208;assemble on the cancer cell membrane. The formed nanofibers can provide abundant &#8220;click&#8221; sites to enrich aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers on the cell membrane for type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy (PDT) to efficiently induce pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD).







Abstract
Enrichment of photosensitizers (PSs) on cancer cell membranes via bioorthogonal reactions is considered to be a very promising therapeutic modality. However, azide&#8208;modified sugars&#8208;based metabolic labeling processes usually lack targeting and the labeling speed is relatively slow. Moreover, it has been rarely reported that membrane&#8208;anchoring pure type&#8208;I PSs can induce cancer cell pyroptosis. Here, we report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholecystokinin&#8208;2 receptor (CCK2R) dual&#8208;targeting peptide named DBCO&#8208;pYCCK6, which can selectively and rapidly self&#8208;assemble on cancer cell membrane, and then bioorthogonal enrich type&#8208;I aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) PSs (SAIE&#8208;N3) on the cell membrane. Upon light irradiation, the membrane&#8208;anchoring SAIE&#8208;N3 could effectively generate type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the bioorthogonal combination strategy of peptide and AIEgen PSs could significantly inhibit tumor growth, which is accompanied by CD8+ cytotoxic T cell infiltration. This work provides a novel self&#8208;assembly peptide&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reaction strategy to bridge the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and AIE field through strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and elucidates that pure type&#8208;I membrane&#8208;anchoring PSs can be used for cancer therapy via GSDME&#8208;mediated pyroptosis.

         <title>Helmholtz Plane Regulation Empowers PF6&#8722; Permselectivity Towards High Coulombic Efficiency Dual Ion Battery of 5.5&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexafluoroglutaric anhydride (HFGA) was developed as a functional electrolyte additive to improve high&#8208;voltage dual ion battery (DIB) performance. HFGA can positively regulate anion solvation behaviors and participate in forming a CF2&#8208;rich CEI layer with excellent PF6&#8722; permselectivity near the graphite electrode surface. Such strengths enable a 5.5&#8197;V DIB with 92&#8201;% capacity retention and &gt;99&#8201;% average Coulombic efficiency within 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage dual ion battery (DIB) is promising for stationary energy storage applications owing to its cost&#8208;effectiveness, which has been a hot topic of research in rechargeable battery fields. However, it still suffers from rapid battery failure caused by the severe solvent co&#8208;intercalation and electrolyte oxidation. To address these bottlenecks, herein a functional electrolyte additive hexafluoroglutaric anhydride (HFGA) is presented based on a Helmholtz plane regulation strategy. It is demonstrated that the HFGA can precisely enter into the Helmholtz plane and positively regulate anion solvation behaviors near the graphite electrode surface owing to its considerable H&#8722;F affinity with ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), thus alleviating EMC&#8208;related co&#8208;intercalation and oxidation decomposition during DIB charging. Meanwhile, HFGA can copolymerize with the presence of PF5 at the Helmholtz plane to participate in forming a CF2&#8208;rich CEI layer with excellent PF6&#8722; permselectivity, conducive to achieving PF6&#8722; de&#8208;solvation and simultaneously suppressing electrolyte oxidation decomposition. By virtue of such beneficial effects, the graphite cathode enables a 5.5&#8197;V DIB with a prominent capacity retention of 92&#8201;% and a high average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99&#8201;% within 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C, demonstrating significantly enhanced electrochemical reversibility. The Helmholtz plane regulation strategy marks a milestone in advancing DIB technologies.

         <title>Manufacturing Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalysts for Selective CO2 Hydrogenation via Refinement of Isolated&#8208;Alloy&#8208;Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new &#8216;islanding effect&#8217; strategy for high metal loading single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) synthesis by refining alloyed nanoparticles is introduced here for CO2 hydrogenation, achieving 100% CO selectivity and over 55 times reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) rate than the alloys with Ru cluster sites. In addition, the SAA catalysts by the &#8216;islanding effect&#8217; strategy exhibited a 3&#8208;4 times higher RWGS rate than the SAA synthesized with the dilution method.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts exhibit huge potential in heterogeneous catalysis. Manufacturing SAAs requires complex and expensive synthesis methods to precisely control the atomic scale dispersion to form diluted alloys with less active sites and easy sintering of host metal, which is still in the early stages of development. Here, we address these limitations with a straightforward strategy from a brand&#8208;new perspective involving the &#8216;islanding effect&#8217; for manufacturing SAAs without dilution: homogeneous RuNi alloys were continuously refined to highly dispersed alloy&#8208;islands (~1&#8197;nm) with completely single&#8208;atom sites where the relative metal loading was as high as 40&#8201;%. Characterized by advanced atomic&#8208;resolution techniques, single Ru atoms were bonded with Ni as SAAs with extraordinary long&#8208;term stability and no sintering of the host metal. The SAAs exhibited 100&#8201;% CO selectivity, over 55 times reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) rate than the alloys with Ru cluster sites, and over 3&#8211;4 times higher than SAAs by the dilution strategy. This study reports a one&#8208;step manufacturing strategy for SAA's using the wetness impregnation method with durable high atomic efficiency and holds promise for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

         <title>Oxygen Reduction Reaction Coupled Electro&#8208;Oxidation for Highly&#8208;Efficient and Sustainable Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to enable highly&#8208;efficient and sustainable water treatment by coupling the EO system with four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction is reported. This system achieves a 95&#8201;% total organic carbon (TOC) removal at an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 2.61&#8197;kWh/kgTOC.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;oxidation (EO) technology demonstrates significant potential in wastewater treatment. However, the high energy consumption has become a pivotal constraint hindering its large&#8208;scale implementation. Herein, we design an EO and 4&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction coupled system (EO&#8208;4eORR) to replace the traditional EO and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) coupled system (EO&#8208;HER). The theoretical cathodic potential of the electrolytic reactor is tuned from 0&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in HER to 1.23&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in 4eORR, which greatly decreases the required operation voltage of the reactor. Moreover, we demonstrate that convection can improve the mass transfer of oxygen and organic pollutants in the reaction system, leading to low cathodic polarization and high pollutant removal rate. Compared with traditional EO&#8208;HER system, the energy consumption of the EO&#8208;4eORR system under air aeration for 95&#8201;% total organic carbon (TOC) removal is greatly decreased to 2.61&#8197;kWh/kgTOC (only consider the electrolyzer energy consumption), which is superior to previously reported EO&#8208;based water treatment systems. The reported results in this study offer a new technical mode for development of highly efficient and sustainable EO&#8208;based treatment systems to remove organic pollutants in waste water.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Range Disordering RuO2 Catalyst for Highly Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realizing an efficient and stable non&#8208;Iridium (Ir)&#8208;based acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for low&#8208;cost practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), yet a tremendous challenge due to the robust oxidation conditions and active species leaching. Long&#8208;range disordered Boron doped RuO2 catalysts demonstrate highly active and durable acidic OER (1200&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and achieve highly efficient (1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.63&#8197;V) and stable (300&#8197;h at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) operating in practical PEMWEs device.







Abstract
Non&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial to reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we report a strategy to modulate the stability of RuO2 by doping boron (B) atoms, leading to the preparation of a RuO2 catalyst with long&#8208;range disorder (LD&#8208;B/RuO2). The structure of long&#8208;range disorder endowed LD&#8208;B/RuO2 with a low overpotential of 175&#8197;mV and an ultra&#8208;long stability, which can maintain OER for about 1.6&#8197;months at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 with almost invariable performance. More importantly, a PEM electrolyzer using LD&#8208;B/RuO2 as the anode demonstrated excellent performance, reaching 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.63&#8197;V with durability exceeding 300&#8197;h at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density. The introduction of B atoms induced the formation of a long&#8208;range disordered structure and symmetry&#8208;breaking B&#8722;Ru&#8722;O motifs, which enabled the catalyst structure to a certain toughness while simultaneously inducing the redistribution of electrons on the active center Ru, which jointly promoted and guaranteed the activity and long&#8208;term stability of LD&#8208;B/RuO2. This study provides a strategy to prepare long&#8208;range disordered RuO2 acidic OER catalysts with high stability using B&#8208;doping to perturb crystallinity, which opens potential possibilities for non&#8208;iridium&#8208;based PEMWE applications.

         <title>Proton Intercalation into an Open&#8208;Tunnel Bronze Phase with Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo3Nb2O14 undergoes the near&#8208;zero volume change upon H+ (de)intercalation in aqueous batteries owing to the open tunnels that buffer the local structure change of Mo/NbOn polyhedra upon charge/discharge. The optimal molecular crowding electrolyte and the structural integrity of Mo3Nb2O14 electrode synergistically establish a highly stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode system, providing a capacity retention of approximately 100&#8201;% over 500 cycles.







Abstract
Managing safety and supply&#8208;chain risks associated with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is an urgent task for sustainable development. Aqueous proton batteries are attractive alternatives to LIBs because using water and protons addresses these two risks. However, most host materials undergo large volume changes upon H+ intercalation, which induces intraparticle cracking to accelerates parasitic reactions. Herein, we report that Mo3Nb2O14 bronze exhibits reversible H+ intercalation (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% owing to near&#8208;zero volume change and solid&#8208;solution&#8208;type phase transition. Combination of experimental and theoretical analyses clarifies that rotation and shrinkage of open tunnels, which consist of flexible corner&#8208;sharing Mo/NbOn polyhedra, relieve local structural distortions upon H+ intercalation to suppress intraparticle cracking. The prototype full cell of an aqueous proton battery with a Mo3Nb2O14 anode operates stably over 1000 charge/discharge cycles. This study reveals the importance of implementing distortion&#8208;relieving voids in host materials to reduce volume change upon charge/discharge.

A large&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline 2D COFs with enhanced structural integrity and exceptional chemical and electrochemical stability was prepared. Through a simple composite process with CNTs, the resultant COF&#8208;CNT core&#8211;shell hybrids exhibit outstanding performance as lithium&#8208;ion storage materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
A large&#8208;sized single crystalline 2D COFs with excellent crystallinity and stability was prepared through the traditional thermal solvent method. The electrochemical performance can be significantly enhanced using a straightforward hybrid approach that involves in situ growth of the 2D COFs on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Both the advantages of COFs and CNTs are mutually enhanced. The single&#8208;crystalline feature of the obtained COFs improves the structural integrity and brings excellent chemical and electrochemical stabilities for lithium&#8208;ion battery applications. The resultant COF&#8208;CNT core&#8211;shell hybrids greatly improved the conductivity and demonstrated excellent lithium&#8208;ion storage performance with a high capacity of 228&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Topology of Gemini&#8208;shaped Hexagonal Heterojunction for Efficient Stereoconvergent Transformation via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent advances in the combination of kinetic resolution and racemization for efficient stereoconvergent transformation, the poor stability and limited reaction activities of the products restrict their wide application in industrial production. To overcome these problems, Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons with para&#8208;heterojunctions for one&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers were designed via hydrogen&#8208;bonding adhesion by racemization catalyst 1&#160;and kinetic resolution 2&#160;in this work. The polymers from the assembly of Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons exhibit rapid catalytic behaviour with efficient selectivity for the desired configuration in the synthesis of tertiary alcohols with contiguous stereocenters through dynamic kinetic resolution for the nanoscale heterojunctions of dissimilar catalysts. Among them, the developed 2D polymers gave outstanding enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities (&gt;99% ee, 20:1 dr) through the cooperation of adjacent dissimilar catalysts. The heterojunctions varying dimensions and distances of dissimilar catalysts provide new insight for increasing the enantioselectivity of chiral organocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable and Recyclable Copper Nanoclusters with Exposed Active Sites for Broad&#8208;Scope Protosilylation in Open Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent advances in cluster&#8208;based catalysis for organic synthesis, the substrate scope of reactions catalyzed by metal nanoclusters is typically not superior to previously established catalytic systems. Herein, we develop new atomically precise copper nanoclusters for protosilylation, with scope expanding to alkenes and simple enynes that were not suitable for prior synthetic methodologies with traditional copper complexes. The involvement of a second copper center in the metal kernel during the migratory insertion step is thought to be responsible for the expanded scope. In addition, the reaction is highly compatible with water and can be carried out in open air rather than under inert gas protection. Mechanistic studies suggest that the cluster&#8208;catalyzed protosilylation proceeds in the absence of silyl radicals. The current findings demonstrate the potential of using metal nanoclusters for practical and sustainable chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Assisted Microfluidics to Produce Chemically Equivalent Microgels with Tunable Network Morphologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although micron&#8208;sized microgels have become important building blocks in regenerative materials, offering decisive interactions with living matter, their chemical composition mostly significantly varies when their network morphology is tuned. Since cell behavior is simultaneously affected by the physical, chemical, and structural properties of the gel network, microgels with variable morphology but chemical equivalence are of interest. This work describes a new method to produce thermoresponsive microgels with defined mechanical properties, surface morphologies, and volume phase transition temperatures. A wide variety of microgels is synthesized by crosslinking monomers or star polymers at different temperatures using thermally assisted microfluidics. The diversification of microgels with different network structures and morphologies but of chemical equivalence offers a new platform of microgel building blocks with the ability to undergo phase transition at physiological temperatures. The method holds high potential to create soft and dynamic materials while maintaining the chemical composition for a wide variety of applications in biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature magnetocapacitance spanning 97 K hysteresis in molecular material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic capacitor, as a new type of device, has broad application prospects in fields such as magnetic field sensing, magnetic storage, magnetic field control, power electronics and so on. Traditional magnetic capacitors are mostly assembled by magnetic and capacitive materials. Magnetic capacitor made of a single material with intrinsic properties is very rare. This intrinsic property is magnetocapacitance (MC). The studies on MC effect have mainly focused on metal oxides so far. No study was reported in molecular materials. Herein, two complexes: (CETAB)2[CuCl4] (1) and (CETAB)2[CuBr4] (2) (CETAB = (2&#8208;chloroethyl)trimethylammonium) are reported. There exist strong H&#8208;Br and Br&#8208;Br interactions and other weak interactions in complex 2, so the phase transition energy barrier is high, resulting in the widest thermal hysteresis loop on a molecular level to date. Furthermore, complexes 1 and 2 show large MC parameters of 0.247 and 1.614, respectively, which is the first time to observe MC effect in molecular material.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Lattice Oxygen Regeneration of NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide Enhances Oxygen Evolution Catalysis Durability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) endows NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, yet the frequent evolution and sluggish regeneration of lattice oxygen intensify the dissolution of active species. Herein, we overcome this challenge by constructing the NiFe hydroxide/Ni4Mo alloy (NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni4Mo) heterojunction electrocatalyst, featuring the Ni4Mo alloy as the oxygen pump to provide oxygenous intermediates and electrons for NiFe&#8208;LDH. The released lattice oxygen can be timely offset by the oxygenous species during the LOM process, balancing the regeneration of lattice oxygen and assuring the enhancement of the durability. In consequence, the durability of NiFe&#8208;LDH is significantly enhanced after the modification of Ni4Mo with an impressively durability for over 60 h, much longer than that of NiFe&#8208;LDH counterpart with only 10 h. In&#8208;situ spectra and first&#8208;principle simulations reveal that the adsorption of OH&#8722; is significantly strengthened owing to the introduction of Ni4Mo, ensuring the rapid regeneration of lattice oxygen. Moreover, NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni4Mo&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) presents an impressive durability for over 150 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2. The oxygen pump strategy opens opportunities to balance the evolution and regeneration of lattice oxygen, enhancing the durability of efficient OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Light (1200&#8197;nm) Irradiation and a Ruthenium&#8208;Intercalated NiAl&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide</title>

A NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH photocatalyst showed impressive infrared&#8208;driven CO2 reduction activity at &#955;=1200&#8197;nm (CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;%) and good stability over 50 re&#8208;use cycles. In situ DRIFTs, fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and DFT calculations showed that compressed anionic Ru complexes in LDH interlayers induced a dual charge redistribution phenomenon, narrowing the band gap (0.89&#8197;eV) in the hybrid photocatalyst system to enable efficient infrared&#8208;driven CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction (NIR&#8208;CO2PR) holds tremendous promise for the production of valuable commodity chemicals and fuels. However, designing photocatalysts capable of reducing CO2 with low energy NIR photons remains challenging. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;driven photocatalyst comprising an anionic Ru complex intercalated between NiAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH) is shown to deliver efficient CO2 photoreduction (0.887&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) with CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;% under 1200&#8197;nm illumination and excellent stability over 50 testing cycles. This remarkable performance results from the intercalated Ru complex lowering the LDH band gap (0.98&#8197;eV) via a compression&#8208;related charge redistribution phenomenon. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy data verified light&#8208;induced electron transfer from the Ru complex towards the LDH sheets, increasing the availability of electrons to drive CO2PR. The presence of hydroxyl defects in the LDH sheets promotes the adsorption of CO2 molecules and lowers the energy barriers for NIR&#8208;CO2PR to CO. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of NIR&#8208;CO2PR at wavelengths up to 1200&#8197;nm in LDH&#8208;based photocatalyst systems.

         <title>Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores a unique co&#8208;functionalization approach using ruthenium single atoms (Ru1) and nanoparticles (RuNP) to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of crystalline red phosphorus. Employing &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221;&#8208;inspired tactics, the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 combats defect&#8208;induced charge deep trapping and fosters RuNP growth, forming effective charge transfer interfaces. This research illustrates the transformative impact of metal atom pre&#8208;anchoring in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Crystalline red phosphorus (CRP), known for its promising photocatalytic properties, faces challenges in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) due to undesired inherent charge deep trapping and recombination effects induced by defects. This study overcomes these limitations through an innovative strategy in integrating ruthenium single atoms (Ru1) within CRP to simultaneously repair the intrinsic undesired vacancy defects and serve as the uniformly distributed anchoring sites for a controllable growth into ruthenium nanoparticles (RuNP). Hence, a highly functionalized CRP with Ru1 and RuNP (Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP) with concerted effects in regulating electronic structures and promoting interfacial charge transfer has been achieved. Advanced characterizations unveil the pioneering dual role of pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 (analogous to the &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221; principle) in transforming CRP photocatalysis. The regulations of vacancy defects on the surface of CRP minimize the detrimental deep charge trapping, resulting in the prolonged lifetime of active charges. With the well&#8208;distributed in situ growth of RuNP on Ru1 sites, the constructed robust &#8220;bridge&#8221; that connects CRP and RuNP facilitates constructive interfacial charge transfer. Ultimately, the synergistic effect induced by the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 endows Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP with an exceptional PHE rate of 3175&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, positioning it as one of the most efficient elemental&#8208;based photocatalysts available. This breakthrough underscores the crucial role of pre&#8208;anchoring metal single atoms at defect sites of catalysts in enhancing sustainable hydrogen production.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Supported Low&#8208;Nuclearity Cluster Catalysts for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;based MOFs with unstable Cu coordination centers is electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported onto the remaining MOFs with 3D coordination bonds by the pore space limitation. The synergistic effect of Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8722;*CO coupling generation *CH2CHO species, leading to excellently electrocatalytic CO2&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH performance.







Abstract
It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF&#8208;based supported low&#8208;nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microporous Cu&#8208;based MOF, that achieves a single&#8208;product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi&#8208;site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C&#8722;C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2&#8211;to&#8211;ethanol.

&lt;p&gt;Cu-based MOFs with unstable Cu coordination centers is electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported onto the remaining MOFs with 3D coordination bonds by the pore space limitation. The synergistic effect of Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8722;*CO coupling generation *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHO species, leading to excellently electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction reactions (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products. Here, we report a MOF-based supported low-nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three-dimensional (3D) microporous Cu-based MOF, that achieves a single-product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi-site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C&#8722;C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;to&#8211;ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes via Sequential Povarov Reaction and Aromatizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular and efficient enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes has been developed through the sequential chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed Povarov reaction and subsequent aromatizations. With the excellent compatibility of the Povarov reaction and the development of distinct aromatization methods, a wide range of structurally diverse novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes were produced with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes represent a unique type of chiral molecules with significant applications, yet their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains largely underexplored. We report herein the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes through the sequential organocatalyzed enantioselective Povarov reaction and aromatizations. The chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed three&#8208;component Povarov reaction involving amino group&#8208;substituted calix[4]arenes, aldehydes and (di)enamides desymmetrized the prochiral calix[4]arene substrates, which was followed by various aromatization methods, resulting in a diverse array of novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 75&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee). The large&#8208;scale enantioselective synthesis and diverse derivatizations of the chiral calix[4]arene products highlight the value of this method. Furthermore, preliminary exploration into their photophysical and chiroptical properties demonstrate the potential applications of these novel calix[4]arene molecules.

The multisite and adaptive Al8 macrocycle demonstrates a groundbreaking capacity to sequentially encapsulate molecules, complexes, and polymers through &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; interactions. This progressive encapsulation culminates in the formation of an endless polyrotaxane structure, &#8220;the Al8 rock sugar gourd&#8221;. These distinct host&#8211;guest interactions bestow the Al8 macrocycles with customizable optical&#8208;limiting functionalities.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules, such as rotaxanes, have drawn significant attention within supramolecular chemistry. Although a variety of macrocycles have been thoroughly explored in rotaxane synthesis, metal&#8208;organic macrocycles remain relatively under&#8208;investigated. Aluminum molecular rings, with their inner cavities and numerous binding sites, present a promising option for constructing rotaxanes. Here, we introduce an innovative &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; motif utilizing Al8 molecular rings, enabling the stepwise assembly of molecules, complexes, and polymers through tailored coordination chemistry. This novel approach can not only be applied to macrocycle&#8208;based systems like catenanes but also enhance specific functionalities progressively.

         <title>Ambient Synthesis of Vanadium&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogues Nanocubes for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Eutectic Electrolytes</title>

The V&#8208;PBA cathode, prepared by in situ growth and conversion strategy, with eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose and 3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2 could maintain 55&#8201;% of the highest discharge specific capacity after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides a new strategy to prepare pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction to enhance the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current density for industrialization prospects.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely studied in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to the characteristics of large specific surface area, open aperture, and straightforward synthesis. In this work, vanadium&#8208;based PBA nanocubes were firstly prepared using a mild in situ conversion strategy at room temperature without the protection of noble gas. Benefiting from the multiple&#8208;redox active sites of V3+/V4+, V4+/V5+, and Fe2+/Fe3+, the cathode exhibited an excellent discharge specific capacity of 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in AZIBs, which is much higher than those of other metal&#8208;based PBAs nanocubes. To further improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of the V&#8208;PBA cathode, a high concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte (4.5&#8197;M ZnSO4+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2), and a water&#8208;based eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2) were designed to successfully inhibit the dissolution of vanadium and improve the deposition of Zn2+ onto the zinc anode. More importantly, the assembled AZIBs maintained 55&#8201;% of their highest discharge specific capacity even after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with superior rate capability. This study provides a new strategy for the preparation of pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction for enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current densities for industrialization prospects.

         <title>Hybrid Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Material with Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Efficient Organic Afterglow Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) and organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) in a molecule leads to a long OURTP lifetime up to 251&#8197;ms and a high total quantum efficiency over 80&#8201;%. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQEtotal) of ~12&#8201;%, OURTP efficiency (EQEOURTP) of 3.11&#8201;% and electroluminescent lifetime up to 201&#8197;ms, respectively.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials capable of combining various emission behaviors for diversified optoelectronic properties and applications have recently gained a vigorous development, but it remains a forbidden challenge in designing OURTP molecules with hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, possibly due to the elevated difficulties in simultaneously meeting the stringent requirements of both HLCT and OURTP emitters. Here, through introducing multiple heteroatoms into one&#8208;dimensional fused ring of coumarin with moderate charge transfer perturbation in donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor architecture, we demonstrate a HLCT&#8208;featured OURTP molecule showing both promoted fluorescence with a quantum yield of 77&#8201;% in solution and long&#8208;lived OURTP with a lifetime of 251&#8197;ms in conventional host material used in electroluminescent device. Thus, efficient OURTP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated, exhibiting bright electroluminescence with an exciton utilization efficiency of 85&#8201;% and yellow OURTP lasting over 2&#8197;s for afterglow. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP&#8208;OLEDs can be further optimized to reach an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~12&#8201;% and OURTP EQE up to 3.11&#8201;%, representing the highest performance among the reported OURTP&#8208;OLEDs. These impressive results highlight the significance to fuse HLCT and OURTP together in enriching OURTP materials and improving the afterglow OLED performances.

&lt;p&gt;The combination of hybrid local and charge-transfer (HLCT) and organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) in a molecule leads to a long OURTP lifetime up to 251&#8197;ms and a high total quantum efficiency over 80&#8201;%. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP light-emitting diodes exhibit an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;) of ~12&#8201;%, OURTP efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;OURTP&lt;/sub&gt;) of 3.11&#8201;% and electroluminescent lifetime up to 201&#8197;ms, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials capable of combining various emission behaviors for diversified optoelectronic properties and applications have recently gained a vigorous development, but it remains a forbidden challenge in designing OURTP molecules with hybrid local and charge-transfer (HLCT) feature, possibly due to the elevated difficulties in simultaneously meeting the stringent requirements of both HLCT and OURTP emitters. Here, through introducing multiple heteroatoms into one-dimensional fused ring of coumarin with moderate charge transfer perturbation in donor-&#960;-acceptor architecture, we demonstrate a HLCT-featured OURTP molecule showing both promoted fluorescence with a quantum yield of 77&#8201;% in solution and long-lived OURTP with a lifetime of 251&#8197;ms in conventional host material used in electroluminescent device. Thus, efficient OURTP organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated, exhibiting bright electroluminescence with an exciton utilization efficiency of 85&#8201;% and yellow OURTP lasting over 2&#8197;s for afterglow. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP-OLEDs can be further optimized to reach an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~12&#8201;% and OURTP EQE up to 3.11&#8201;%, representing the highest performance among the reported OURTP-OLEDs. These impressive results highlight the significance to fuse HLCT and OURTP together in enriching OURTP materials and improving the afterglow OLED performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rhodamine&#8208;Spiropyran Conjugate Empowering Tunable Mechanochromism in Polymers under Multiple Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugating rhodamine and spiropyran rings through a xanthene scaffold offers a new &#960;&#8208;fused mechanochromophore Rh&#8722;SP. High&#8208;contrast and broad&#8208;spectrum mechanochromism in Rh&#8722;SP&#8208;crosslinked elastomers corresponding to different (de)activated states are illustrated, highlighting the power of this mechanophore design in developing polymeric materials with mechanochromic programmability and recognition of multiple stimuli.







Abstract
Mechanochromic functionality realized via the force&#8208;responsive mechanophores in polymers has great potential for damage sensing and information storage. Mechanophores with the ability to recognize multiple stimuli for tunable chromic characteristics are highly sought after for versatile sensing ability and color programmability. Nevertheless, the majority of mechanophores are based on single&#8208;component chromophores with limited sensitivity, or require additional fabrication technology for multi&#8208;modal chromism. Here, we report a novel multifunctional mechanophore capable of vividly detectable and tunable mechanochromism in polymers. This synergistic optical coupling relies on strategically fusing rhodamine and spiropyran (Rh&#8722;SP), and tethering polymer chains on both subunits. The mechanochromic behaviors of the Rh&#8722;SP&#8208;linked polymers under sonication and compression are thoroughly evaluated in response to changes in force and the light&#8208;controlled relaxation process. Non&#8208;sequential ring&#8208;opening of the two subunits under force is identified, endowing high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism. Light&#8208;induced differential ring&#8208;closing reactions of the two subunits, together with the acidichromism of the SP moiety, are employed to engineer elastomers with programmable and wide&#8208;spectrum colors. Our work presents an effective strategy for highly appreciable and regulable mechanochromic functionality, and also provides new insights into the rupture mechanisms of &#960;&#8208;fused mechanophores, as well as how the stimuli history controls stress accumulation in polymers.

         <title>Recyclable Polythioesters and Poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s via Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Polymerization of Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens a new paradigm for polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydride based on a S&#8208;to&#8208;N shift reaction, producing unexpected recyclable polythioesters and unprecedent poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s.







Abstract
Polythioesters (PTEs) are emerging sustainable polymers for their degradability and recyclability. However, low polymerizability of monomers and extensive side reactions often hampered the polymerization process. Moreover, copolymers containing both thioester and other types of functional groups in the backbone are highly desirable but rarely accomplished owing to several synthetic challenges. Here, we report the ring&#8208;opening cascade polymerization (ROCAP) of N&#8208;(2&#8208;(acetylthio)ethyl)&#8208;glycine N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (TE&#8208;NCA) to afford recyclable PTEs and unprecedented poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s (P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s) in a controlled manner. By developing appropriated carboxylic acid&#8208;tertiary amine dual catalysts, intramolecular S&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift is coupled into the ROCAP process of TE&#8208;NCA to yield products with dispersity below 1.10, molecular weight (Mn) up to 84.5&#8197;kDa, and precisely controlled ratio of thioester to peptoids. Random copolymerization of sarcosine NCA (Sar&#8208;NCA) and TE&#8208;NCA gives thioester&#8208;embedded polysarcosine with facile backbone degradation while maintaining the water solubility. This work represents a paradigm shift for the ROP of NCAs, enriches the realm of cascade polymerizations, and provides a powerful synthetic approach to functional PTEs and P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s that are otherwise difficult or impossible to make.

A planar&#8208;structured dinuclear cobalt(II) complex exhibits an indirect synergistic catalysis effect between two Co(II) sites for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, with TON and TOF values of 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, which is 8.6&#8208;fold improvement than that of the corresponding mononuclear counterpart.







Abstract
Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) has been proved an effective approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, while it remains challenge to design dinuclear metal complexes that can show DMSC effect. The main reason is that the influence of the microenvironment around dinuclear metal centres on catalytic activity has not been well recognized and revealed. Herein, we report a dinuclear cobalt complex featuring a planar structure, which displays outstanding catalytic efficiency for photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values reach as high as 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, 8.6&#8197;times higher than those of the corresponding mononuclear cobalt complex. Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of the dinuclear cobalt complex is due to the indirect DMSC effect between two CoII ions, energetically feasible one step two&#8208;electron transfer process by Co2I,I intermediate to afford Co2II,II(CO22&#8722;) intermediate and fast mass transfer closely related with the planar structure.

         <title>Redox and Kinetic Properties of Composition&#8208;Dependent Active Sites in Copper&#8208;Exchanged Chabazite for Direct Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity tests and advanced in situ/operando spectroscopic techniques are employed to elucidate the Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites with varying Cu loading and Si/Al ratio and its influence on CH4 partial oxidation to CH3OH. An improved CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency of materials containing primarily monomeric Cu(II) active sites in contrast to zeolites with a significant fraction of dimeric Cu(II) centers has been found.







Abstract
The CH4 oxidation performance of Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites characterized by distinct Si/Al ratios and Cu loadings has been studied and the observed variations in reactivity have been correlated to the differences in the nature of the formed active centers. Plug flow reactor tests, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that a decrease in Cu loading shifts the reactivity/redox profile to higher temperatures and increases the CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance, Raman, ultraviolet&#8208;visible, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and photoluminescence spectroscopies reveal that this behavior is associated with the presence of monomeric Cu active sites, including bare Cu2+ and [CuOH]+ present at low Si/Al ratio and Cu loading. Formation of two distinct [Cu2(&#956;&#8208;O)]2+ moieties at higher Si/Al ratio or Cu loading forces these trends into the opposite direction. Operando electron paramagnetic resonance and ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy show that the apparent activation energy of monomeric Cu active species decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, whereas the one of dimeric centers is unaffected.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation performance of Cu-chabazite zeolites characterized by distinct Si/Al ratios and Cu loadings has been studied and the observed variations in reactivity have been correlated to the differences in the nature of the formed active centers. Plug flow reactor tests, in situ Fourier-transform infrared, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that a decrease in Cu loading shifts the reactivity/redox profile to higher temperatures and increases the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH selectivity and Cu-efficiency. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance, Raman, ultraviolet-visible, Fourier-transform infrared, and photoluminescence spectroscopies reveal that this behavior is associated with the presence of monomeric Cu active sites, including bare Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [CuOH]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; present at low Si/Al ratio and Cu loading. Formation of two distinct [Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; moieties at higher Si/Al ratio or Cu loading forces these trends into the opposite direction. Operando electron paramagnetic resonance and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy show that the apparent activation energy of monomeric Cu active species decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, whereas the one of dimeric centers is unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In situ Construction of Single&#8208;Atom Electronic Bridge on COF to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the photocatalytic process, Ru atoms are anchored in situ by COF&#8208;Cu3TG, forming a single&#8208;atom electronic bridge between layers. This, combined with the selection of small&#8208;sized metal cluster, facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic HER capability.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most valuable technologies in the future energy system. Here, we designed a metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with both small&#8208;sized metal clusters and nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, named COF&#8208;Cu3TG. Based on our design, small&#8208;sized metal clusters were selected to increase the density of active sites and shorten the distance of electron transport to active sites. While another building block containing nitrogen&#8208;rich organic ligands acted as a node that could in situ anchor metal atoms during photocatalysis and form interlayer single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) to accelerate electron transport. Together, they promoted photocatalytic performance. This represented the further utilization of Ru atoms and was an additional application of the photosensitizer. N2&#8208;Ru&#8208;N2 electron bridge (Ru&#8208;SAEB) was created in situ between the layers, resulting in a considerable enhancement in the hydrogen production rate of the photocatalyst to 10.47&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through theoretical calculation and EXAFS, the existence position and action mechanism of Ru&#8208;SAEB were reasonably inferred, further confirming the rationality of the Ru&#8208;SAEB configuration. A sufficiently proximity between the small&#8208;sized Cu3 cluster and the Ru&#8208;SAEB was found to expedite electron transfer. This work demonstrated the synergistic impact of small molecular clusters with Ru&#8208;SAEB for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Synthesis of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Cored Graphdiyne Nanosheets through Dehydrogenative Coupling on Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexabenzocoronene core&#8208;expanded graphdiyne nanosheets with a sixfold symmetry were synthesized on Au(111) via dehydrogenative coupling reactions of ethyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene. Their chemical and electronic configurations were thoroughly investigated using scanning probe microscopy, providing a band gap (2.8&#8197;eV) of a single&#8208;layer graphdiyne&#8208;like nanosheet.







Abstract
Thermally&#8208;induced dehydrogenative coupling of polyphenylenes on metal surfaces is an important technique to synthesize

&#8208;conjugated carbon nanostructures with atomic precision. However, this protocol has rarely been utilized to fabricate structurally defined carbon nanosheets composed of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Here, we present the synthesis of butadiyne&#8208;linked hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) on Au(111) surfaces as core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes. The reaction started from hexa(4&#8208;ethylphenyl)benzene, which undergoes dehydrogenation toward hexa(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)benzene, followed by planarization to hexabenzocoronene, coupling between the vinyl groups, and further dehydrogenation. In addition to butadiyne linkages, benzene groups were also found as another type of linker. The reaction sequences were monitored by scanning tunneling microscopy and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, which disclose the structures of intermediates and final products. In combination with density functional theory simulations, the key steps from ethyl substituents to butadiyne and benzene linkers were elucidated. This is a new on&#8208;surface synthesis of core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes with unprecedented electronic properties.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Dissociation&#8208;Reconstruction Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Continuity for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstruction of COFs into separation membranes: A 2D covalent organic framework (COF) is designed and dissociated into high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Reconstruction of COF nanosheets gives an ordered and defect&#8208;free membrane. The synthesized membrane exhibits superior CO2/N2 separation performance of high selectivity and large permeance owing to optimized microstructures.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), at the forefront of porous materials, hold tremendous potential in membrane separation; however, achieving high continuity in COF membranes remains crucial for efficient gas separation. Here, we present a unique approach termed assembly&#8208;dissociation&#8208;reconstruction for fabricating COF membranes tailored for CO2/N2 separation. A parent COF is designed from two&#8208;node aldehyde and three&#8208;node amine monomers and dissociated to high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Subsequently, COF nanosheets are orderly reconstructed into a crack&#8208;free membrane by surface reaction under water evaporation. The membrane exhibits high crystallinity, open pores and a strong affinity for CO2 adsorption over N2, resulting in CO2 permeance exceeding 1060 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity surpassing 30.6. The efficacy of this strategy offers valuable guidance for the precise fabrication of gas&#8208;separation membranes.

         <title>Chirality and Curvature on Protein Adsorption and Osteogenesis</title>

Lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid enantiomers (L/D&#8208;UG) are designed to self&#8208;assemble into vesicles and 2D nanocrystals with different chirality and curvature, which showed differentiated protein adsorption and subsequent osteogenesis. L&#8208;2D nanocrystal exhibits as one of the most effective materials to promote bone regeneration.







Abstract
Here we designed enantiomeric lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid derivatives (L/D&#8208;UG) and investigated their self&#8208;assembled chiral nanostructures&#8217; interaction with the protein adsorption as well as the osteogenesis. It was found that L or D&#8208;UG molecules can self&#8208;assemble into vesicle bilayers and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals via a kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. These chiral vesicles and 2D crystals showed differentiated adsorption of proteins, determined by their curvature and chirality. Specifically, fibronectin constituted by L&#8208;amino acids adsorbed preferentially on L&#8208;UG 2D crystal in a semi&#8208;random pattern and L&#8208;2D nanocrystal show as the most effective structures to promote bone regeneration. The controlled vesicle and 2D crystal assemblies with different chirality and curvature helps to clarify their determine roles in protein adsorption and osteogenesis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Electrochemiluminescence for Imaging the Corrosion of Protective Coating of Metal and Quantitative Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Galvanized iron was exploited as both power source and electrodes to achieve self&#8208;powered electrochemiluminescence (ECL) for the first time. The elimination of external power source enables protective coating corrosion imaging using a smartphone. This self&#8208;powered ECL also enables ECL analysis and holds great promise for corrosion imaging and analytical applications.







Abstract
In almost all electrochemical systems for electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analysis, electrodes are connected with an external power source, either directly or via wireless energy transfer circuit. That is inconvenient and makes some applications impossible. Herein, we use galvanized iron with two different metals as both power source and electrodes to achieve a self&#8208;powered ECL and exploit ECL for the imaging of the corrosion of protective coating of widely used metal (e.g. galvanized iron) for the first time. The self&#8208;powered ECL enables the visualization of the deterioration of galvanic coating on iron using a smartphone and the detection of ascorbic acid with a linear range of 0.5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.31&#8197;&#956;M. The devices based on self&#8208;powered approach do not require external power supply, thus effectively reducing their volume and cost. The self&#8208;powered ECL holds great promise for metal corrosion imaging and analytical applications.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Chemical Self&#8208;Rechargeable Zinc Ion Batteries with High Charging and Discharging Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;charging zinc ion battery system for the first time, the photo&#8208;assisted process during chemical self&#8208;charging promotes the transfer of electrons from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction, and enables it to exhibit excellent performance, providing a new strategy for zinc ion battery in energy storage.







Abstract
Chemical self&#8208;recharging zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), which are capable of auto&#8208;recharging in ambient air, are promising in self&#8208;powered battery systems. Nevertheless, the exclusive reliance on chemical energy from oxygen for ZIBs charging often would bring some obstacles in charging efficiency. Herein, we develop photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging aqueous ZIBs with a heterojunction of MoS2/SnO2 cathode, which are favorable to enhancing both the charging and discharging efficiency as well as the chemical self&#8208;charging capabilities under illumination. The photo&#8208;assisted process promotes the electron transfer from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction during chemical self&#8208;charging. Furthermore, the electrons within the MoS2/SnO2 cathode exhibit a low transfer impedance under illumination, which is beneficial to reducing the migration barrier of Zn2+ within the cathode and thereby facilitating the uniform inserting of Zn2+ into MoS2/SnO2 cathode during discharging. This photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging mechanism enables ZIBs to attain a maximum self&#8208;charging potential of 0.95&#8197;V within 3&#8197;hours, a considerable self&#8208;charging capacity of 202.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling performance in a self&#8208;charging mode. This work not only provides a route for optimizing chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage, but also broadens the potential application of aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Emissive B&#8211;N Lewis Pair&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes via Selective LUMO Extension in Conjugated Dimer and Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of B&#8211;N Lewis pair functionalized anthracene into a vinylene&#8208;linked dimer and polymer leads to selective extension of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), thus significantly lowering the band gap, shifting the emission into the near&#8208;infrared region, and modulating the self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward oxygen and release of singlet oxygen from the corresponding endoperoxides.







Abstract
Acenes are attractive as building blocks for low gap organic materials with applications, for example, in organic light emitting diodes, solar cells, bioimaging and diagnostics. Previously, we have shown that modification of dipyridylanthracene via B&#8211;N Lewis pair fusion (BDPA) strongly redshifts the emission, while facilitating self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward O2 to reversibly generate the corresponding endoperoxides. Herein, we report on the further expansion of the &#960;&#8208;system of BDPA to a vinyl&#8208;substituted monomer, vinylene&#8208;bridged dimer, and a polymer with an average of 20 chromophores. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation results in largely reduced band gaps of 1.8&#8197;eV for the dimer and 1.7&#8197;eV for the polymer, the latter giving rise to NIR emission with a maximum at 731&#8197;nm and an appreciable quantum yield of 7&#8201;%. Electrochemical and computational studies reveal efficient delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) along the pyridyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;pyridyl axis, which results in effective electronic communication between BDPA units, selectively lowers the LUMO, and ultimately narrows the band gap. Time&#8208;resolved emission and transient absorption (TA) measurements offer insights into the pertinent photophysical processes. Extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation also slows down the self&#8208;sensitized formation of endoperoxides, while significantly accelerating the thermal release of singlet oxygen to regenerate the parent acenes.

         <title>Exploring Geometric Chirality in Nanocrystals for Boosting Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of geometric chiral effect was explored to enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution using a chiral composite of geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) and C3N4 nanosheets. The chiral Au NPs enable efficient charge carrier separation and high&#8208;activity facets, boosting performance over achiral counterparts and resulting in a quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performance was also revealed.







Abstract
Advancing catalyst design is pivotal for the enhancement of photocatalytic processes in renewable energy conversion. The incorporation of structural chirality into conventional inorganic solar hydrogen nanocatalysts promises a significant transformation in catalysis, a feature absent in this field. Here we unveil the unexplored potential of geometric chirality by creating a chiral composite that integrates geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) with two&#8208;dimensional C3N4 nanosheets, significantly boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution beyond the achiral counterparts. The superior performance is driven by the geometric chirality of Au NPs, which facilitates efficient charge carrier separation through the favorable C3N4&#8208;chiral Au NP interface and chiral induced spin polarization, and exploits high&#8208;activity facets within the concave surfaces of chiral Au NPs. The resulting synergistic effect leads to a remarkable increase in photocatalytic H2 evolution, with an apparent quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Furthermore, we explore the selective polarized photo&#8208;induced carrier separation behavior, revealing a distinct chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic HER performance. Our work advances the design and utilization of chiral inorganic nanostructures for superior performance in energy conversion processes.

Triangulenes as neutral radicals are becoming promising candidates for future applications such as spintronics and quantum technologies. To extend the potential of the advanced materials, it is of importance to control their electronic and magnetic properties by multiple graphitic nitrogen doping. Here, we synthesize triaza[5]triangulene on Au(111) by cyclodehydrogenation, and its derivatives by cleaving C&#8722;N bonds. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy provided detailed structural information and evidence for open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. The antiferromagnetic arrangement of the spins in positively doped triaza[5]triangulene was further confirmed by density function theory calculations. The key aspect of triangulenes with multiple graphitic nitrogen is the extra pz electrons composing the &#960; orbitals, favoring charge transfer to the substrate and changing their low&#8208;energy excitations. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phases of matter in heteroatom doped organic systems.

         <title>Encapsulation of Sn Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters in Multichannel Carbon Matrix for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF, a flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries, is synthesized with uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in a multichannel carbon matrix. This design ensures a size&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance with enhanced K+ diffusion kinetics and cycling stability. Theoretical calculations clarify electron transfer and energy barriers of intermediates. In situ XRD and XANES analysis reveals the K+ storage mechanisms.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability ( around 331&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of around 167&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Enhanced Alkene Oxidative Cleavage in Water via Photoexcited FeIV Species within Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the catalytic activity of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O towards alkene scission in water, facilitated by the hydrophobic COF backbone. The COF acts as a photosensitizer and structural support, enhancing reaction efficiency by proximity effect. The method achieves up to 75&#8201;% yield, producing selectively aldehydes or ketones, and is recyclable for four cycles.







Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8722;O&#8722;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8722; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et4N)2[FeIII(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8722;B and C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization of PolyBorylated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents site&#8208;, and stereoselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed strategies for synthesizing stereodefined polysubstituted alkenes using poly&#8208;boron&#8208;containing alkenes. Four protocols were developed to generate reactive alkenyl&#8208;Rh and aryl&#8208;Rh intermediates, enabling diverse stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formations. The study introduces Z&#8722;Rh species, facilitating stereoselective coupling reactions and remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization.







Abstract
Alkenes are fundamental functional groups which feature in various materials and bioactive molecules; however, efficient divergent strategies for their stereodefined synthesis are difficult. In this regard, numerous synthetic methodologies have been developed to construct carbon&#8211;carbon bonds with regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, enabling the predictable and efficient synthesis of stereodefined alkenes. In fact, an appealing alternative approach for accessing challenging stereodefined alkene molecular frameworks could involve the sequential selective activation and cross&#8208;coupling of strong bonds instead of conventional C&#8722;C bond formation. In this study, we introduce a series of programmed site&#8208; and stereoselective strategies that capitalizes on the versatile reactivity of readily accessible polymetalloid alkenes (i.e. polyborylated alkenes), through a tandem cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which is catalyzed by an organometallic Rh&#8208;complex to produce complex molecular scaffolds. By merging selective C&#8722;B and remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization, we achieve the in situ generation of polyfunctional C(sp2)&#8208;nucleophilic intermediates. These species can be further modified by selective coupling reactions with various C&#8208;based electrophiles, enabling the formation of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond for the generation of even more complex molecular architectures using the readily available starting polyborylated&#8208;alkenes. Mechanistic and computational studies provide insight into the origins of the stereoselectivities and C&#8722;H activation via a 1,4&#8208;Rh migration process.

         <dc:description>
A series of switchable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereodivergent cycloadditions of allenes have been developed. These mechanistically distinct cycloadditions enabled to rapidly access structurally and stereochemically diverse 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazine species with high efficiency and selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we report a strategy enabling triple switchable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereodivergence in newly developed palladium&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of allenes. An asymmetric pseudo&#8208;stereodivergent cycloaddition of allenes bearing a primary leaving group at the &#945;&#8208;position, where a dynamic kinetic asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of racemic unactivated allenes was the enantio&#8208;determining step, is realized, providing four stereoisomers [(Z,R), (Z,S), (E,S), and (E,R)] containing a di&#8208;substituted alkene scaffold and a stereogenic center. By tuning reaction conditions, a mechanistically distinctive cycloaddition is uncovered selectively with the same set of substrates. By switching the position of the leaving group of allenes, a cycloaddition involving an intermolecular O&#8208;attack is disclosed. Diverse mechanisms of the cycloaddition reactions of allenes enable rapid access to structurally and stereochemically diverse 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high efficiency and selectivity.

Core&#8208;shell MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with highly adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure were constructed by innovatively exploiting C&#8722;C linkage, demonstrating much better degradation performance than their parent components, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Moreover, the in situ grown MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V films exhibited broad&#8208;spectrum, reusable and significantly enhanced removal capabilities for diverse pollutants in river water by solar drive.







Abstract
Diversifying the connecting junctions will be feasible for the controllable collaboration of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to rationally design multifunction&#8208;integrated heterostructures with enhanced performance, yet it is in the nascent stage. Herein, by intelligently exploiting the polymerization of vinyl group, C&#8722;C bond is innovatively introduced to construct the core&#8211;shell MOF@COF heterostructures with adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure. The unique structure endows prepared C&#8722;C&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with more superior visible&#8208;light harvesting and photogenerated carrier separation capability, leading to significantly higher photocatalytic activity and faster degradation rate than pristine MIL&#8208;68&#8208;C=Cs, COF&#8722;V, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Further, the customized MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V is in situ grown as reusable films with dramatically boosted performance under ambient conditions, which realize the highly efficient degradation of tetracycline within 15&#8197;min (96.5&#8201;%), rhodamine 6G within 25&#8197;min (97.6&#8201;%), and phenol within 40&#8197;min (95.3&#8201;%) by solar drive. This work exhibits the distinctive advantages of C&#8722;C junction in the MOF@COF construction, and highlights the application prospect of rational&#8208;designed heterostructure in the treatment of persistent organic pollutants.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Pd&#8208;Catalyzed sp3 C&#8722;H Macrocyclization: Synthesis and Evaluation of Macrocyclic Sulfonamide for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination, and arylation macrocyclization is reported, which provided a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. A combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide, which demonstrated a potential efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of SIRT3.







Abstract
The development of simplified synthetic strategy to create structurally and functionally diverse pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic molecules is highly appealing but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by natural scaffolds, herein, we describe a practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination and arylation macrocyclization, which could offer a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. Interestingly, the potential of ligand acceleration in C&#8722;H activation is also demonstrated by an unprecedented enantioselective sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation macrocyclization. Moreover, a combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide 2&#8201;a, which showed a promising efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of silent information regulator sirtuin 3 (SIRT3).

         <title>Electron&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;Electrosynthesis of Formates from CO2 and Methanol Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer coupling acidic CO2RR with alkaline MOR to effectively co&#8208;produce formate. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR system exhibits high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;h of continuous operation and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro&#8208;synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide&#8208;decorated Cu2Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of only 2.1&#8197;V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system. This study illuminates an innovative electron&#8208;efficiency and energy&#8208;saving techniques for CO2 electrolysis, as well as the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Main&#8208;Group Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Dynamic Proton Bridges Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A main&#8208;group metal&#8208;nonmetal proton bridge catalyst (O&#8722;In&#8722;S), featuring the In&#8722;S polarization pair as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites and electronegative oxygen as an electron pool, enables the asymmetric In&#8722;S dual&#8208;sites to back&#8208;donate electrons to the &#960;x* and &#960;y* antibonding orbitals of nitrogen (N2), achieving exceptional N2 fixation activity. This discovery paves the way for efficient electrocatalysts for activating inert molecules.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is a crucial process for the sustainable production of ammonia (NH3) for energy and agriculture applications. However, the reaction's efficiency is highly dependent on the activation of the inert N&#8801;N bond, which is hindered by the electron back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* orbitals of the N&#8801;N bond, resulting in low eNRR capacity. Herein, we report a main&#8208;group metal&#8208;nonmetal (O&#8722;In&#8722;S) eNRR catalyst featuring a dynamic proton bridge, with In&#8722;S serving as the polarization pair and O functioning as the dynamic electron pool. In situ spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the In&#8722;S polarization pair acts as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites, polarizing the N&#8801;N bond by concurrently back&#8208;donating electrons to both the &#960;x* and &#960;y* orbitals of N2, thereby overcoming the significant band gap limitations, while inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the O dynamic electron pool acts as a &#8220;repository&#8221; for electron storage and donation to the In&#8722;S polarization pair. As a result, the O&#8722;In&#8722;S dynamic proton bridge exhibits exceptional NH3 yield rates and Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) across a wide potential window of 0.3&#8197;V, with an optimal NH3 yield rate of 80.07&#177;4.25&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and an FE of 38.01&#177;2.02&#8201;%, outperforming most previously reported catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;A main-group metal-nonmetal proton bridge catalyst (O&#8722;In&#8722;S), featuring the In&#8722;S polarization pair as asymmetric dual-sites and electronegative oxygen as an electron pool, enables the asymmetric In&#8722;S dual-sites to back-donate electrons to the &#960;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;* and &#960;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;* antibonding orbitals of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), achieving exceptional N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation activity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is a crucial process for the sustainable production of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) for energy and agriculture applications. However, the reaction's efficiency is highly dependent on the activation of the inert N&#8801;N bond, which is hindered by the electron back-donation to the &#960;* orbitals of the N&#8801;N bond, resulting in low eNRR capacity. Herein, we report a main-group metal-nonmetal (O&#8722;In&#8722;S) eNRR catalyst featuring a dynamic proton bridge, with In&#8722;S serving as the polarization pair and O functioning as the dynamic electron pool.

Meanwhile, the O dynamic electron pool acts as a &#8220;repository&#8221; for electron storage and donation to the In&#8722;S polarization pair.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Concentration Distribution in Sb&#8722;Cu Alloy Nanoarrays for Robust Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D coral&#8208;like alloy nanoarray featuring decreasing Sb and increasing Cu concentrations from bottom to top has been established. The former endows high capacity, while the latter acts as a protective layer maintaining high stability at the electrolyte/electrode interface. It also facilitates smooth distribution and release of stress, thereby exhibiting superior cycling stability and high&#8208;rate capability for sodium storage.







Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type materials are attractive for anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and overall performance. However, the accumulation of stress/strain during repeated cycling results in electrode pulverization, leading to rapid capacity decay and eventual disintegration, thus hindering their practical applications. Herein, we report a 3D coral&#8208;like Sb&#8722;Cu alloy nanoarray with gradient distribution of both elements. The array features a Sb&#8208;rich bottom and a Cu&#8208;rich top with increasing Sb and decreasing Cu concentrations from top to bottom. The former is the active component that provides the high capacity, whereas the latter serves as an inert additive that acts against volume variation. The gradual transition in composition within the electrode introduces a ladder&#8208;type volume expansion effect, facilitating a smooth distribution and effective release of stress, thereby ensuring the wanted mechanical stability and structural integrity. The as&#8208;developed nanoarray affords a high reversible capacity (460&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), stable cycling (89&#8201;% retention over 120&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C), and superior rate capability (354&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C). The concentration dual&#8208;gradient strategy paves a new pathway of designing alloy&#8208;type materials for
SIBs.

         <title>Thermal Effect Management via Entropy Variation Strategy to Improve the Catalyst Stability in Acetylene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provided an entropy variation strategy to realize thermal effect management and developed a long&#8208;term stable CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst for acetylene hydrogenation. Its essence is that the heat sensitive but non active Co nano&#8208;islands experienced an entropy increasing process of slowly redispersion via capturing and utilizing the reaction heat generated on the active CuZn alloys, thus solving the deactivation problem of Cu&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
The dynamic structure evolution of heterogeneous catalysts during reaction has gained great attention recently. However, controllably manipulating dynamic process and then feeding back catalyst design to extend the lifetime remains challenging. Herein, we proposed an entropy variation strategy to develop a dynamic CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst, in which the non&#8208;active Co nano&#8208;islands play a crucial role in controlling thermal effect via timely capturing and utilizing reaction heat generated on the adjacent active CuZn alloys, thus solving the deactivation problem of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Specifically, heat sensitive Co nano&#8208;islands experienced an entropy increasing process of slowly redispersion during the reaction. Under such heat dissipation effect, the CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst exhibited 95.7&#8201;% ethylene selectivity and amazing long&#8208;term stability (&gt;530&#8197;h) in the typical exothermic acetylene hydrogenation. Aiming at cultivating it as a catalyst with promising industrial potential, we proposed a simple regeneration approach via an entropy decreasing process.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Sulfur&#8208;Doped Double [7]Helicene Photosensitizer: Synthesis, Structure and Chiral Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a deep&#8208;red emissive sulfur&#8208;doped double [7]helicene with a high photoluminescence yield and large Stokes shift, as well as aromatic behaviors of various oxidation states. Its chiroptical properties are also studied. High spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants between the singlet and triplet states enable the double helicene to act as an efficient singlet oxygen photosensitizer.







Abstract
Doping of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with sulfur atoms is becoming more and more important as a means of creating unique functional materials. Recently, thiophene&#8208;containing multiple helicenes have garnered enormous attention due to their intriguing electronic and (chir)optical properties compared with carbohelicenes. However, the efficient synthesis of thiopyran&#8208;containing multiple helicenes and the underlying sulfur doping mechanisms are rather unexplored. Herein, the synthesis and structural analysis of a thiopyran&#8208;containing double [7]helicene 3 are reported. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals 3 and its dication with C2&#8208;symmetric propeller&#8208;shape structures and compact interactions in the solid state. 3 exhibits deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission. Tunable aromaticity of the central benzene ring and thiopyran rings is found by chemical oxidation, which is further confirmed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS), anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) analysis. Furthermore, the chiral and photosensitizing characters of 3 are investigated. The excellent deep&#8208;red to NIR fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and photosensitizing activities suggest that 3 can be used as an outstanding photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and bioimaging, especially paving the way for future CPL&#8208;PDT and CPL&#8208;bio&#8208;probe applications.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Catalyst Mimicking the Two&#8208;Component Architecture of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst, composed of S&#8722;C&#8208;supported ruthenium single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs), was designed for electrochemical nitrate reduction. Leveraging the synergistic effects of SAs and NPs, this two&#8208;component M&#8722;S&#8722;C catalyst exhibits an exceptional ammonia yield rate of 37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen sources involves competitive adsorption of different intermediates and multiple electron and proton transfers, presenting grand challenges in catalyst design. In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. Such process results in a more energetically accessible pathway for NO3&#8722; reduction on Ru NPs co&#8208;existing with SAs. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8722;S&#8722;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>Helix&#8208;Sense&#8208;Selective Memory Polymerization of Biphenylylacetylenes Bearing Carboxy and Amino Groups in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization of achiral monomers with carboxy and amino groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively, was developed for the rapid synthesis of one&#8208;handed helicity&#8208;memorized polymers. The carboxy&#8208;bound polymer forms a cholesteric liquid crystal in water, in which basic achiral dyes further co&#8208;assemble to form helical aggregates showing induced circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
We report the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization (HSMP) of achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing carboxy and amino pendant groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively. The HSMP proceeds in a highly helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective manner driven by noncovalent chiral ionic interactions between the monomers and guests under kinetic control, producing the one&#8208;handed helical polymers with a static memory of helicity in one&#8208;pot during the polymerization in a very short time, accompanied by amplification of asymmetry. The carboxy&#8208;bound helicity&#8208;memorized polymer self&#8208;assembles into a cholesteric liquid crystal in concentrated water, in which a variety of basic achiral fluorophores further co&#8208;assembles to form supramolecular helical aggregates that exhibit an induced circularly polarized luminescence in a color tunable manner.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of High&#8208;Rate Copper Electrochemical Machining in Nitrate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dissolution mechanism of copper during high&#8208;rate electrochemical machining in nitrate electrolyte is investigated and proposed to change to overcome mass transport limitation. Prerequisites are derived from polarization measurements under various (hydrodynamic) conditions. A new complexation mechanism involving nitrate ions is proposed at overlimiting currents.







Abstract
The high&#8208;rate electrochemical dissolution of copper in nitrate electrolytes is investigated primarily via polarization curves, while varying parameters such as the electrolyte flow velocity, the electrolyte resistance, the anode geometry, and the temperature. This study focuses on the re&#8208;rise in current at high voltages after the limiting current plateau. As a result of the studies, a change in the complexation mechanism from hydration to &#8220;solvo&#8208;nitration&#8221; is proposed, which requires an additional potential drop within the electrochemical double layer.

         <title>Tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficiently Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine based covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time. They displayed superior H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in H2O and O2 under AM&#8197;1.5G through the combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have recently emerged as fascinating scaffolds for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion because of their customizable structures and functionalities. Herein, two tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials (namely COF&#8208;JLU51 and COF&#8208;JLU52) featuring large surface area, high crystallinity, excellent stability and photoelectric properties were designed and constructed for the first time. Remarkably, COF&#8208;JLU51 gave an outstanding H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in pure water and O2 under one standard sun light, that higher than its isomorphic COF&#8208;JLU52 and most of the reported metal&#8208;free materials, owing to its superior generation, separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Experimental and theoretical researches prove that the photocatalytic process undergoes a combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction (WOR). Specifically, an ultrahigh yield of 7624.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with apparent quantum yield of 18.2&#8201;% for COF&#8208;JLU52 was achieved in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio of benzyl alcohol and water system. This finding contributes novel, nitrogen&#8208;rich and high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials, and also designate their bright future in photocatalytic solar transformations.

         <title>Progressive Endergonic Synthesis of Diels&#8211;Alder Adducts Driven by Chemical Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going uphill. While most chemical reactions proceed towards equilibrium, we describe herein how to drive Diels&#8211;Alder reactions away from equilibrium (&#916;G &gt;0) using the hydration energy of carbodiimides. Our strategy yielded products up to 400&#8201;% of what thermodynamics would allow at equilibrium. Progressive accumulation upon repeated fueling cycles unlocks adaptive behaviors in chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
The overwhelming majority of artificial chemical reaction networks respond to stimuli by relaxing towards an equilibrium state. The opposite response&#8212;moving away from equilibrium&#8212;can afford the endergonic synthesis of molecules, of which only rare examples have been reported. Here, we report six examples of Diels&#8211;Alder adducts formed in an endergonic process and use this strategy to realize their stepwise accumulation. Indeed, systems respond to repeated occurrences of the same stimulus by increasing the amount of adduct formed, with the final network distribution depending on the number of stimuli received. Our findings indicate how endergonic processes can contribute to the transition from responsive to adaptive systems.

The opposite response&#8212;moving away from equilibrium&#8212;can afford the endergonic synthesis of molecules, of which only rare examples have been reported. Here, we report six examples of Diels&#8211;Alder adducts formed in an endergonic process and use this strategy to realize their stepwise accumulation. Indeed, systems respond to repeated occurrences of the same stimulus by increasing the amount of adduct formed, with the final network distribution depending on the number of stimuli received. Our findings indicate how endergonic processes can contribute to the transition from responsive to adaptive systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks for Robust Light Harvesting and Efficient Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes afforded covalently waved 2D lattices and crystalline &#960; layers. The helicene frameworks are highly red emissive, enable intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;state energy transfer, and facilitate intermolecular triplet state energy transfer to convert molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species, thereby offering a method for the design of helicene materials for light&#8208;harvesting and photoenergy applications.







Abstract
Helicenes represent a class of fascinating &#960; compounds with fused yet folded backbones. Despite their broad structural diversity, harnessing helicenes to develop well&#8208;defined materials is still a formidable challenge. Here we report the synthesis of crystalline porous helicene materials by exploring helicenes to synthesize covalent 2D lattices and layered &#960; frameworks. Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene&#8208;porphyrin alignment along the x and y directions at a 1.5&#8208;nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti&#8208;AA stack along the z direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields. The [6]helicene frameworks trigger effieicnt intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet state energy transfer from [6]helicene to porphyrin and facilitate intermolecular triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state energy transfer from frameworks to molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, harvesting a wide range of photons from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions for light emitting and photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. This study introduces a new family of extended frameworks, laying the groundwork for exploring well&#8208;defined helicene materials with unprecedented structures and functions.

         <title>A Coupling&#8208;Induced Assembly Strategy for Constructing Artificial Shell on Mitochondria in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently cross&#8208;linked artificial shells with multiple binding sites were constructed in situ on mitochondria by a coupling&#8208;induced assembly (CIA) strategy. Under ultrasonic (US) irradiation, a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was generated, which acted on the neighboring mitochondrial membranes and thus induced mitochondrial apoptosis.







Abstract
The strategy of in vivo self&#8208;assembly has been developed for improved enrichment and long&#8208;term retention of anticancer drug in tumor tissues. However, most self&#8208;assemblies with non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions are susceptible to complex physiological environments, leading to weak stability and loss of biological function. Here, we develop a coupling&#8208;induced assembly (CIA) strategy to generate covalently crosslinked nanofibers, which is applied for in situ constructing artificial shell on mitochondria. The oxidation&#8208;responsive peptide&#8208;porphyrin conjugate P1 is synthesized, which self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles. Under the oxidative microenvironment of mitochondria, the coupling of thiols in P1 causes the formation of dimers, which is further ordered and stacked into crosslinked nanofibers. As a result, the artificial shell is constructed on the mitochondria efficiently through multivalent cooperative interactions due to the increased binding sites. Under ultrasound (US) irradiation, the porphyrin molecules in the shell produce a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that act on the adjacent mitochondrial membrane, exhibiting ~2&#8208;fold higher antitumor activity than nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the mitochondria&#8208;targeted CIA strategy provides a novel perspective on improved sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and shows potential applications in antitumor therapies.

Abstract
We report a highly crystalline self&#8208;assembled multilayer (SAMUL) that is fundamentally different from the conventional monolayer or disordered bilayer used for hole&#8208;extraction in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SAMUL can be easily formed on ITO substrate to establish better surface coverage to enhance the performance and stability of PSCs. A detailed structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of molecules used for SAMUL is established through a systematic study of their crystallinity, molecular packing, and hole&#8208;transporting properties. These SAMULs are rationally optimized by varying their molecular structures and deposition methods through thermal evaporation or spin&#8208;coating for fabricating PSCs. The CbzNaphPPA&#8208;based SAMUL was chosen for fabricating inverted PSCs due to it exhibiting the highest crystallinity and hole mobility which is derived from the ordered H&#8208;aggregation. This resulted in a remarkably high fill factor of 86.45&#8201;%, which enables a very impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.07&#8201;% to be achieved along with excellent device stability (94&#8201;% of its initial PCE retained after continuous operation for 1200&#8197;h under 1&#8208;sun irradiation at maximum power point at 65&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, a record&#8208;high PCE of 23.50&#8201;% could be achieved by adopting a thermally evaporated SAMUL.

         <title>Achieving Record C2H2 Packing Density for Highly Efficient C2H2/C2H4 Separation with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Prepared by a Scalable Synthesis in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that achieves a record acetylene packing density, which is pivotal for the highly efficient purification of ethylene. The synthesis of this material is readily scalable to the kilogram level using pure water as solvent, thereby establishing it as a leading candidate for practical industrial applications.







Abstract
Adsorptive C2H2/C2H4 separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged as a promising technology for the removal of C2H2 (acetylene) impurity (1&#8201;%) from C2H4 (ethylene). The practical application of these materials involves the optimization of separation performance as well as development of scalable and green production protocols. Herein, we report the efficient C2H2/C2H4 separation in a MOF, Cu(OH)INA (INA: isonicotinate) which achieves a record C2H2 packing density of 351&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 0.01&#8197;bar through high affinity towards C2H2. DFT (density functional theory) calculations reveal the synergistic binding mechanism through pore confinement and the oxygen sites in pore wall. The weakly basic nature of binding sites leads to a relatively low heat of adsorption (Qst) of approximately 36&#8197;kJ/mol, which is beneficial for material regeneration and thermal management. Furthermore, a scalable and environmentally friendly synthesis protocol with a high space&#8208;time yield of 544&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3 day&#8722;1 has been developed without using any modulating agents. This material also demonstrates enduring separation performance for multiple cycles, maintaining its efficacy after exposure to water or air for three months.

The weakly basic nature of binding sites leads to a relatively low heat of adsorption (Q&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt;) of approximately 36&#8197;kJ/mol, which is beneficial for material regeneration and thermal management. Furthermore, a scalable and environmentally friendly synthesis protocol with a high space-time yield of 544&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; has been developed without using any modulating agents. This material also demonstrates enduring separation performance for multiple cycles, maintaining its efficacy after exposure to water or air for three months.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rigid&#8208;Flexible Coupled Dendritic Molecule Doping: General Approach to Activate Commercial Polymers into Harsh Condition&#8208;Tolerant Multi&#8208;Reusable Strong Supramolecular Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy is proposed to activate commercial polymers into a new family of harsh condition&#8208;tolerant, multi&#8208;reusable and strong supramolecular adhesives by simple physical doping of rigid&#8208;flexible coupled dendritic molecule (named M4C8OH). Such M4C8OH doping overcomes commonly&#8208;seen trade&#8208;off between cohesion and interface adhesion. The rigid&#8208;flexible dendritic structure, branch number, and OH&#8208;terminated alkyl chain length for molecule dopants are key structural factors for superior adhesion properties.







Abstract
Developing functional adhesives combining strong adhesion, good recyclability and diverse harsh&#8208;condition adaptability is a grand challenge. Here, we introduce a general dendritic molecule doping strategy to activate commercial polymers into a new family of supramolecular adhesives integrating high adhesion strength, ultralow temperature, water resistant and multi&#8208;reusable properties. Our method involves rational design of a new rigid&#8208;flexible coupled dendritic molecule&#8212;M4C8OH as a versatile dopant, while simple M4C8OH doping into commercial polymers can modulate internal and external non&#8208;covalent interaction to enable H&#8208;bonding enhanced interchain cross&#8208;linking for tough cohesion along with enhanced interphase interaction. This endows 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% M4C8OH&#8208;doped polycaprolactone (PCL) adhesives (PCL&#8208;M4C8OH) with improved adhesion strength on various substrates with the maximum increase up to 2.87&#8197;times that of PCL. In particular, the adhesion strengths of PCL&#8208;M4C8OH on polymethyl methacrylate at 25&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C reach 4.67 and 3.58&#8197;MPa&#8212;1.9 and 2.3&#8197;times those of PCL and superior to diverse commercial adhesives and most reported adhesives. PCL&#8208;M4C8OH also displays markedly&#8208;improved multi&#8208;usability and tolerance against ultralow temperature and diverse wet environments. Mechanism studies reveal the crucial role of M4C8OH molecular structures toward superior adhesion. Our method can be expanded to other polymer matrices, yielding diverse new supramolecular adhesives.

         <title>Leap&#8208;Type Response of Redox/Photo&#8208;Active Lanthanide&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Early and Accurate Screening of Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating mixed&#8208;valent redox metal center, charge/energy donor and photo&#8208;active center in one interface, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;amplified sensitivity is developed for precisely distinguishing the negative and positive acid phosphatase (ACP, prostate cancer marker), which exhibits bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence (&#8220;leap&#8221; response from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221;) at ACP threshold.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;accuracy technologies to distinguish the quite tiny concentration change of tumor markers between negative and positive is of vital significance for early screening and diagnosis of cancers, but is still a great challenge for the conventional biosensors because of their &#8220;gradual&#8221; detection mode. Herein, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (designated as Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;/photo&#8208;activities is developed for precisely identifying acid phosphatase (ACP), an early pathological marker of prostate cancer (PCa) in serum. The engineered Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X probe achieves a bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence at the critical concentration of ACP (9&#8197;U&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), while keeping silent below this threshold, undergoing a qualitative signal change from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221; between negative and positive indicators and thus significantly improving the identification precision. Significantly, such &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; response performance can be further edited and amplified by rational defect engineering in the crystal structure to improve the accessibility of active centers, consequently maximizing the detection sensitivity toward ACP in the complex biological media. This study proposes the first paradigm for the development of &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; biosensors with ultra&#8208;sensitive differentiation capability between negative and positive, and provides a potentially valuable tool for early and accurate screening of PCa.

         <title>Insulator&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Degradation of Pyrochlore Ruthenates in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution and Stabilization through Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulator&#8208;transition companied with lattice contraction induces the degradation of pyrochlore ruthenates (Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. With Ir substitution, the adjustment of electron configuration in newly formed [RuO6]&#8208;[IrO6] suppresses the interior and surface reconstruction of pyrochlores, thus endowing Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; with superior stability during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;based pyrochlores (e.g., Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) are promised to replace IrO2 in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. It is significant to reveal the cliff attenuation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these pyrochlores. In this work, we monitor the structure changes and electrochemical behavior of Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; over the OER process, and it is found that the reason of decisive OER inactivation is derived from an insulator transition occurred within Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; due to its inner &#8220;perfecting&#8221; lattice induced by continuous atom rearrangement. Therefore, a stabilization strategy of the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; is proposed to alleviate this undesirable behavior. The double&#8208;exchange interaction between Ru and Ir in [RuO6] and [IrO6] octahedra leads the charge redistribution with simultaneous spin configuration adjustment. The electronic state in newly formed octahedrons centered with Ru 4d3 (with the state of eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8593;a1g&#8593; eg0) and Ir 5d6 (eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8595;&#8593;&#8595;a1g&#8593;&#8595; eg0) relieves the uneven electron distributions in [RuO6] orbital. The attenuated Jahn&#8211;Teller effect alleviates atom rearrangement, represented as the mitigation of insulator transition, surface reconstruction, and metal dissolution. As results, the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; presents the greatly improved OER stability and PEM durability. This study unveils the OER degradation mechanism and stabilization strategy for material design of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts for electrochemical applications.

         <title>Conformational Locking Induced Enantioselective Diarylcarbene Insertion into B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bonds Using a Cationic Rh(I)/Diene Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cationic rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system has been developed, and the first example of rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;diarylcarbenes has been realized. The computational study indicates that the combination of a stereochemically favored &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction and a rotation&#8208;restricted conformation is crucial to the reaction enantio&#8208;discrimination.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective transformations of aryl/aryl carbene are inherently challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing between two arene rings in the reaction process thus remain largely less explored. The few successful examples reported so far, without exception, have all been catalyzed by Rh(II)&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe our successful development of a novel cationic Rh(I)/chiral diene catalytic system capable of efficient enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H insertions with diaryl diazomethanes, allowing the access to a broad range of gem&#8208;diarylmethine boranes and gem&#8208;diarylmethine ethers in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Notably, previously unattainable asymmetric diarylcarbene insertion into the O&#8722;H bond was achieved for the first time. A remarkable feature of this newly designed Rh(I)/diene catalyst bearing two ortho&#8208;amidophenyl substitutents is that it can distinguish between two arene rings of the diaryl carbene through a stereochemically selective control of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. DFT calculations indicate that the rotation&#8208;restricted conformation of Rh(I)/diene complex played an important role in the highly enantioselective carbene transformations. This work provides an interesting and unprecedented stereocontrol mode in diaryl metal carbene transformations.

         <title>Leveraging Ion Pairing and Transport in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Reversible Lithium Metal Anodes at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Along with the desolvation barrier, bulk transport properties also determine Li deposition behavior at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. The combination of moderately weak solvent and low viscosity diluent allows for low desolvation energy and high Li+ transference number while maintaining adequate ion conduction and diffusion. Therefore, exceptional Li metal Coulombic efficiency at extremely low temperatures is achieved.







Abstract
Coulombic efficiency of over 99&#8201;% is rarely achieved for Li metal anode below &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, hindering the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries under extreme conditions. Herein, limiting factors for Li metal reversibility are investigated utilizing ether&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes of different solvent&#8208;diluent combinations. We find that along with the desolvation barrier, bulk ion transport properties including ionic conductivity, transference number, and diffusivity are also crucial factors for low&#8208;temperature Li deposition behavior. Superior Li metal reversibility was observed within the combination of the solvent with moderately weak solvating power and the diluent with minimal viscosity, highlighting the role of ion transport and the necessity for a trade&#8208;off with desolvation. The optimized electrolyte composed of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, methyl n&#8208;propyl ether, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether delivers exceptional Coulombic efficiency of 99.34&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and 98.96&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C under a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, Li||LiCoO2 (2.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cells demonstrate impressive reversible capacity and cycling stability at these temperatures. This work sheds light on the less&#8208;recognized relevance of bulk ion transport to low&#8208;temperature performance and provides guidelines for the electrolyte design of Li metal batteries operating in cold environments.

         <title>A Cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H Annulation Involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;Palladacycle Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a unprecedented cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles. In this protocol, C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles formed by alkene&#8208; or indole&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can be captured by &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids to access tricyclic and pentacyclic fused pyridinediones. In addition, alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can also be used to construct a tricyclic skeleton containing a four&#8208;membered ring.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond functionalization involving C,C&#8208;palladacycle intermediates provides a unique platform for developing novel reactions. However, the vast majority of studies have been limited to the transformations of C(aryl),C&#8208;palladacycles. In sharp contrast, catalytic reactions involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles have rarely been reported. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles. In this protocol, alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides undergo intramolecular Heck/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation to generate C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles, which can be captured by &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids to afford tricyclic fused pyridinediones. In addition, this strategy can also be applied to indole&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides to construct pentacyclic fused pyridinediones via suquential Heck dearomatization/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization. Notably, the removal of &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids in the reaction of alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can build an interesting tricyclic skeleton containing a four&#8208;membered ring. Preliminary mechanistic experiments indicate that five&#8208;membered C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles serve as the key intermediates. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway.

Confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with copper single atoms (CuSAs) inside defective UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 nanocrystals is achieved by the straightforward method of low&#8208;temperature thermolysis. The prepared composite CuSAs@PCN@UiO, combining the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis, exhibits an excellent photocatalytic performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added fuels displays an attractive scenario to enhance energy supply and reduce global warming. We report herein the confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with Cu single atoms (CuSAs) inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which combines the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis (SAC) to achieve high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. A series of spectral studies displays the formation of CuSAs@PCN inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, the ternary composite shows an excellent photocatalytic turnover frequency of 4.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the doping of CuSAs, as well as the formation of type&#8208;II heterojunction, are causal factors to achieve CH3OH generation. The study provides new insights designing high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for CO2 conversion to fuels at atomic scale.

Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the doping of CuSAs, as well as the formation of type-II heterojunction, are causal factors to achieve CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH generation. The study provides new insights designing high-performance photocatalyst for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to fuels at atomic scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Protein Assembly with Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>

In living systems, protein assemblies serve essential functions. Controlling their construction in biotechnology is challenging. We show that anionic boron clusters act as reversible molecular glue for proteins, forming 2D assemblies and preventing temperature denaturation of myoglobin. Nano&#8208;ion concentration controls assembly size with minimal impact on structures, introducing boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions as tools for protein assembly and stabilization.







Abstract
In living systems, protein assemblies have essential functions, serving as structural supports, transport highways for molecular cargo, and containers of genetic material. The construction of protein assemblies, which involves control over space and time, remains a significant challenge in biotechnology. Here, we show that anionic boron clusters, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;commo&#8208;bis[closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;3&#8208;cobaltadodecaborane] (COSAN&#8722;), and halogenated closo&#8208;dodecarboranes (B12X122&#8722;, X=H, Cl, or I), described as super&#8208;chaotropic nano&#8208;ions, induce the formation of 2D assemblies of model proteins, myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and trypsin inhibitor. We found that the nano&#8208;ion concentration reversibly controls the size of the protein assemblies. Furthermore, the secondary structures of the proteins are only slightly affected by assembly formation. For myoglobin, the formation of these assemblies even prevents temperature denaturation, highlighting a preservation effect of nano&#8208;ions. Our study reveals that inorganic boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions act as a reversible molecular glue for proteins, providing a potential starting point for the further development of controlled protein assemblies.

         <title>Highly Potent and Intestine Specific P&#8208;Glycoprotein Inhibitor to Enable Oral Delivery of Taxol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taxol is widely used in chemotherapy but couldn't be orally administrated. In this protocol, a series of benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and compound 16&#8201;c was identified as potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor, which could enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency and offers high therapeutic effects in breast cancer xenograft model along with almost none oral absorption itself. Therefore, this work provides a valuable strategy of Taxol's oral delivery and chemotherapy.







Abstract
Taxol is widely used in cancer chemotherapy; however, the oral absorption of Taxol remains a formidable challenge. Since the intestinal p&#8208;glycoprotein (P&#8208;gp) mediated drug efflux is one of the primary causes, the development of P&#8208;gp inhibitor is emerging as a promising strategy to realize Taxol's oral delivery. Because P&#8208;gp exists in many tissues, the non&#8208;selective P&#8208;gp inhibitors would lead to toxicity. Correspondingly, a potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor would be an ideal solution to boost the oral absorption of Taxol and avoid exogenous toxicity. Herein, we would like to report a highly potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor to enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency. Through a multicomponent reaction and post&#8208;modification, various benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and the biological evaluation identified 16&#8201;c with potent P&#8208;gp inhibitory activity. Notably, 16&#8201;c was intestine specific and showed almost none absorption (F=0.82&#8201;%), but possessing higher efficacy than Encequidar to improve the oral absorption of Taxol. In MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft model, the oral administration of Taxol and 16&#8201;c showed high therapeutic efficiency and low toxicity, thus providing a valuable chemotherapy strategy.

Pre&#8208;anchoring ruthenium (Ru) single atoms in crystalline red phosphorus boosts its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Yun Hau Ng, Lin Jing et al. highlight in their Research Article (e202409179) the dual role of this innovative strategy in repairing undesired phosphorus defects and enabling Ru nanoparticle anchoring. This results in extended charge lifetimes and enhanced interfacial charge transfer, leading to a "simple" yet highly efficient photocatalytic system for hydrogen production.

Subtractive two&#8208;photon biofabrication facilitates spatiotemporal tissue engineering and drug testing in the laboratory. However, it necessitates the rational design of cell&#8208;compatible, photolabile macromolecular networks that cleave rapidly upon laser exposure. In their Communication (e202404599), Xiao&#8208;Hua Qin and co&#8208;workers develop coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels that enable two&#8208;photon direct laser writing of complex 3D microfluidic networks at 300&#160;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept laser&#8208;guided tissue morphogenesis is demonstrated at micron&#8208;scale resolution.

Copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with unstable Cu coordination centers are electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported on the remaining MOF structure. The synergistic effect of the Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8211;*CO coupling to generate *CH2CHO species, leading to an excellent electrocatalytic CO2&#8722;to&#8722;EtOH performance, as reported by Jin Huang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409270).

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Adenine Derived Secondary Nucleic Acid Frameworks: From Structural Characteristics to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>

Supramolecular oligo&#8208;adenine structures, including A&#8208;motif, T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex, adenine&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, and adenine&#8208;coralyne&#8208;adenine complex, find growing interest in the area of DNA&#8208;nanotechnology, and significant recent advances and applications of these frameworks are demonstrated.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208;adenine (polyA) is primarily known for its critical role in mRNA stability, translational status, and gene regulation. Beyond its biological functions, extensive research has unveiled the diverse applications of polyA. In response to environmental stimuli, single polyA strands undergo distinctive structural transitions into diverse secondary configurations, which are reversible upon the introduction of appropriate counter&#8208;triggers. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances of noncanonical structures derived from polyA, including A&#8208;motif duplex, A&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, A&#8208;coralyne&#8208;A duplex, and T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex. The structural characteristics and mechanisms underlying these conformations under specific external stimuli are addressed, followed by examples of their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA hydrogels, supramolecular fibre assembly, molecular electronics and switches, biosensing and bioengineering, payloads encapsulation and release, and others. A detailed comparison of these polyA&#8208;derived noncanonical structures is provided, highlighting their distinctive features. Furthermore, by integrating their stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and conformational characteristics, advanced material development, such as pH&#8208;cascaded DNA hydrogels and supramolecular fibres exhibiting dynamic structural transitions adapting environmental cues, are introduced. An outlook for future developments is also discussed. These polyA derived, stimuli&#8208;responsive, noncanonical structures enrich the arsenal of DNA &#8220;toolbox&#8221;, offering dynamic DNA frameworks for diverse future applications.

         <title>Stable Silica&#8208;Based Zeolites with Three&#8208;Dimensional Systems of Extra&#8208;Large Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the discovery and properties of the first stable, silica&#8208;based zeolites with 3D systems of extra&#8208;large pores. A hydrothermal synthesis using a large phosphonium cation affords the direct synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 and chain silicate ZEO&#8208;2. A 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation of ZEO&#8208;2 yields zeolite ZEO&#8208;3, while its silylation followed by topotactic condensation affords the zeolite of lowest density, ZEO&#8208;5.







Abstract
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12&#8197;SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.

         <title>Coumarin&#8208;Based Photodegradable Hydrogels Enable Two&#8208;Photon Subtractive Biofabrication at 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1</title>

Coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels enable fast two&#8208;photon subtractive 3D microprinting and laser&#8208;guided cell outgrowth on demand, opening new avenues for bio&#8208;applications, such as spatiotemporal tissue engineering.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally controlled two&#8208;photon photodegradation of hydrogels has gained increasing attention for high&#8208;precision subtractive tissue engineering. However, conventional photolabile hydrogels often have poor efficiency upon two&#8208;photon excitation in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region and thus require high laser dosage that may compromise cell activity. As a result, high&#8208;speed two&#8208;photon hydrogel erosion in the presence of cells remains challenging. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of efficient coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels to overcome these limitations. A set of photolabile coumarin&#8208;functionalized polyethylene glycol linkers are synthesized through a Passerini multicomponent reaction. After mixing these linkers with thiolated hyaluronic acid, semi&#8208;synthetic photodegradable hydrogels are formed in situ via Michael addition crosslinking. The efficiency of photodegradation in these hydrogels is significantly higher than that in nitrobenzyl counterparts upon two&#8208;photon irradiation at 780&#8197;nm. A complex microfluidic network mimicking the bone microarchitecture is successfully fabricated in preformed coumarin hydrogels at high speeds of up to 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1 and low laser dosage down to 10&#8197;mW. Further, we demonstrate fast two&#8208;photon printing of hollow microchannels inside a hydrogel to spatiotemporally direct cell migration in 3D. Collectively, these hydrogels may open new avenues for fast laser&#8208;guided tissue fabrication at high spatial resolution.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalating Supramolecular Hydrogels for Tunable Thermal and Viscoelastic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce DNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) that leverage the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA as a cross&#8208;linking mechanism. These DISHs exhibit tunable endothermic or exothermic driven material properties via strategic choice of intercalator. Interestingly, acridine&#8208;PEG cross&#8208;linkers showing increasing elasticity with increasing temperature, suggesting these materials are joined by purely entropic forces.







Abstract
Polymeric supramolecular hydrogels (PSHs) leverage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains to govern their structural characteristics. As these materials are formed via endothermic or exothermic equilibria, their thermal response is challenging to control without drastically changing the nature of the chemistry used to join them. In this study, we introduce a novel class of PSHs utilizing the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the primary dynamic non&#8208;covalent interaction. The resulting dsDNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) can be tuned to exhibit both endothermically or exothermically driven binding through strategic selection of intercalators. Bifunctional polyethylene glycol (MW~2000&#8197;Da) capped with intercalators of varying hydrophobicity, charge, and size (acridine, psoralen, thiazole orange, and phenanthridine) produced DISHs with comparable moduli (500&#8211;1000&#8197;Pa), but unique thermal viscoelastic responses. Notably, acridine&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkers displayed invariant and even increasing relaxation times with temperature, suggesting an endothermic binding mechanism. This methodology expands the set of structure&#8208;properties available to biomass&#8208;derived DNA biomaterials and promises a new material system where a broad set of thermal and viscoelastic responses can be obtained due to the sheer number and variety of intercalating molecules.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial enzymes that operate with pnictogen bonds or &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in general are introduced: Transfer hydrogenation of quinolines accelerates with biotinylated pnictogen&#8208;bonding cofactors and their interfacing with streptavidin and mutants, shows saturation behavior with transition&#8208;state recognition three orders of magnitude beyond substrate recognition, and the emergence of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The objective of this study was to create artificial enzymes that capitalize on pnictogen bonding, a &#963;&#8208;hole interaction that is essentially absent in biocatalysis. For this purpose, stibine catalysts were equipped with a biotin derivative and combined with streptavidin mutants to identify an efficient transfer hydrogenation catalyst for the reduction of a fluorogenic quinoline substrate. Increased catalytic activity from wild&#8208;type streptavidin to the best mutants coincides with the depth of the &#963; hole on the Sb(V) center, and the emergence of saturation kinetic behavior. Michaelis&#8211;Menten analysis reveals transition&#8208;state recognition in the low micromolar range, more than three orders of magnitude stronger than the millimolar substrate recognition. Carboxylates preferred by the best mutants contribute to transition&#8208;state recognition by hydrogen&#8208;bonded ion pairing and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with the emerging pyridinium product. The emergence of challenging stereoselectivity in aqueous systems further emphasizes compatibility of pnictogen bonding with higher order systems catalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of an Unlikely Occurring Quadrangular Tube by Modulating Intramolecular Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor with a central dibenzothiophene moiety, functionalized at the 3,7&#8208;positions with m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. Combining this with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine at high concentrations produced a quadrangular tube, driven by intramolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions within the framework. This research highlights how modulating these forces can yield products previously deemed difficult or impossible to synthesize.







Abstract
One of the central focuses in self&#8208;assembly is precisely controlling the self&#8208;assembly pathway so that the target molecules can be produced exclusively. Trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine contains two amino units that form a 60&#176; angle when projected on a plane. This angle naturally favors the formation of triangular products in most cases when trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine is used as a bisamino building block in the synthesis of macrocycles and tubes. Here, we synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor bearing a central dibenzothiophene moiety, whose 3,7&#8208;positions are functionalized with two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. We observed that combining this tetraformyl building block with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine yielded a quadrangular tube when the concentrations of the precursors were relatively high. Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the formation of this unlikely occurring quadrangular product was driven by the intramolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the dibenzothiophene building blocks within the tube framework. This driving force, however, was disturbed in the triangular tube, a smaller counterpart whose formation was considered previously much more thermodynamically favored. These results improved our fundamental understanding on how to create those products whose syntheses are considered difficult or impossible, by modulating the intramolecular driving forces.

         <title>P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15): A Phosphorus Tantalum Nitride Featuring Mixed&#8208;Valent Tantalum and P/Ta Disorder Visualized by Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first phosphorus tantalum nitride P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15) was obtained at high&#8208;pressure conditions. It features a three&#8208;dimensional network that exhibits PN6 octahedra and occupational disorder of P and Ta atoms visualized by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Mixed&#8208;valent Ta atoms result in metallic behavior with rather high resistivity.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis, crystal, and electronic structure, as well as the magnetic, and electric properties of the phosphorus&#8208;containing tantalum nitride P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15). A high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction (8&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8201;&#176;C) of Ta3N5 and P3N5 with NH4F as a mineralizing agent yields the compound in the form of black, rod&#8208;shaped crystals.

         <title>Copper(I) Catalysed Diboron(4) Reduction of Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new process for the deoxygenation of nitrous oxide is presented which uses copper(I) boryl complexes as highly productive catalysts and leverages the oxophilicity of boron as a thermodynamic driving force. Selective N&#8722;O bond activation of nitrous oxide is mediated by O&#8208;atom insertion into the metal&#8211;boron bond and turnover numbers over 800 can be achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
A process for the catalytic reduction of nitrous oxide using NHC&#8208;ligated copper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide precatalysts and B2pin2 as the reductant is reported. These reactions proceed under mild conditions via copper(I)&#8208;boryl intermediates which react with N2O by facile O&#8208;atom insertion into the Cu&#8722;B bond and liberate N2. Turnover numbers &gt;800 can be achieved at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 1&#8197;bar N2O.

         <title>Electrolyte Composition&#8208;Dependent Product Selectivity in CO2 Reduction with a Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major product of electrochemical CO2 reduction on a porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework catalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was found to switch from CO to formic acid upon electrolyte composition changing. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies indicates pathway steering by addition of extra proton source to the electrolyte.







Abstract
A copper porphyrin&#8208;derived metal&#8211;organic framework electrocatalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was synthesized and its catalytic activity for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) was investigated. FICN&#8208;8 selectively catalyzed electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in anhydrous acetonitrile electrolyte. However, formic acid became the dominant CO2RR product with the addition of a proton source to the system. Mechanistic studies revealed the change of major reduction pathway upon proton source addition, while catalyst&#8208;bound hydride (*H) species was proposed as the key intermediate for formic acid production. This work highlights the importance of electrolyte composition on CO2RR product selectivity.

         <title>Wiring Covalent Organic Frameworks with Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing pyrrole units to pore walls followed by polymerization integrates spatially segregated six single file molecular wires in each pore of covalent organic frameworks. This wiring strategy offers a distinct electronic channel to enable electronic conduction along the z direction in the pores and to achieve an exceptional charge carrier stability and motion. This result highlights a new aspect and dimension for designing &#960; electronic organic materials based on molecular wiring.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks are a class of crystalline porous polymers formed by linking organic units into periodically aligned skeletons and pores. Here we report a strategy for wiring these frameworks with conducting polymers via wall engineering and polymerization. We anchored each edge site with one pyrrole unit, which is densely packed along the z direction yet protruded from pore walls. This assembly enables the polymerization of pyrrole units to form polypyrrole and creates a new polypyrrole chain conformation. The resultant framework constitutes six single file polypyrrole chains in each pore and develop spatially segregated yet built&#8208;in single molecular wires with exceptional stable polarons. Hall effect measurements revealed that the materials are p&#8208;type semiconductors, increase conductivity by eight orders of magnitude compared to the pristine frameworks, and achieve a carrier mobility as large as 13.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Our results open an avenue to &#960; electronic frameworks by interlayer molecular wiring with conducting polymers.

         <title>Boosting Stimulated Emission via a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Co&#8208;Crystallization Approach in Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stimulated emission of molecular crystals was boosted via a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Structural and theoretical analyses revealed that the higher radiative transition rate and shorter excited&#8208;lifetime in the cocrystal lead to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, thereby facilitating the occurrence of stimulated emission.







Abstract
Stimulated emission (SE) of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule in solid state remains a significant challenge, mainly involving the mode of molecular stacking that invariably alters the photo&#8208;physical processes. Herein, we successfully realized stimulated emission in molecular crystals using a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Two hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals, obtained from 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;p&#8208;cyanostyrylbenzene (CNDSB) and two types of co&#8208;formers, can boost stimulated emission and show decent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), whereas the parent CNDSB crystal is not SE&#8208;active. Crystal structural analysis demonstrated that the co&#8208;crystallization eliminated excimer formation. The resulting higher kr and shorter excited lifetime led to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, which benefited to the occurrence of ASE. Simultaneously, the uniaxial arrangements along the long axis of co&#8208;crystal together contributed to highly polarized emission. This system presents very rare evidence of boosting stimulated emission by binary co&#8208;crystallization, which enriches our insights into organic solid&#8208;state lasers.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Vesicle Microreactors for Oscillating ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered vesicle microreactors with multiple functional proteins are constructed for bioenergy oscillation. Modulating biocatalytic reaction involved with each fuel (glucose, urea) generates and consumes protons respectively, which facilitates ATP synthesis and hydrolysis of ATPase in a tunable fashion.







Abstract
We construct a compartmentalized nanoarchitecture to regulate bioenergy level. Glucose dehydrogenase, urease and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are encapsulated inside through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. ATPase and glucose transporter embedded in hybrid liposomes are attached at the surface. Glucose is transported and converted to gluconic acid catalyzed by glucose dehydrogenase, resulting in an outward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP synthesis. In parallel, urease catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to generate ammonia, which leads to an inward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP hydrolysis. These processes lead to a change of the direction of proton gradient, thus achieving artificial ATP oscillation. Importantly, the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillation can be programmed. The work explores nanoarchitectonics integrating multiple components to realize artificial and precise oscillation of bioenergy level.

The deoxygenative geminal silylboration of amides using silylboronates in the presence of alkoxide base catalyst, producing &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines, is reported herein. Both silicon and boron groups from &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines were found useful in the context of further chemoselective transformations, such as protonation and alkylation.

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Styrenes Installing a Terminal NH2 Group Alongside Unprotected Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes is described that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles at the internal position, including primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and an ammonia surrogate. Two complementary set of conditions allow embedding both electronically activated and deactivated styrenes bearing diverse functional groups.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Diamination of alkenes represents an attractive way to generate differentiated vicinal diamines, which are prevalent motifs in biologically active compounds and catalysts. However, existing methods are usually limited in scope and produce diamines where one or both nitrogens are protected, adding synthetic steps for deprotection and further N&#8208;functionalization to reach a desired target. Furthermore, the range of amino groups that can be introduced at the internal position is fairly limited. Here we describe a 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles (primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and ammonia surrogate) at the internal position. Two complementary sets of conditions encompass electronically activated and deactivated styrenes with diverse substitution patterns and functional groups. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to the 1,2&#8208;aminothiolation of styrenes.

         <title>Solvent Attenuation of London Dispersion in Polycyclic Aromatic Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic attenuation of polycyclic aromatic stacking due to solvent competition is measured experimentally. Interaction energies scale with surface contact area but are attenuated by an order of magnitude in solution. The extent of attenuation scales with the bulk polarisability of the solvent.







Abstract
Solvent competition for London dispersion attenuates its energetic significance in molecular recognition processes. By varying both the stacked contact area and the solvent, here we experimentally deconvolute solvent attenuation using molecular balances. Experimental stacking energies (phenyl to pyrene) correlated strongly with calculations only when dispersion was considered. Such calculations favoured stacking by up to &#8722;27&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in the gas phase, but it was weakly disfavoured in our solution&#8208;phase experiments (+0.5 to +4.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Nonetheless, the propensity for stacking increased with contact area and in solvents with lower bulk polarisabilities that compete less for dispersion. Experimental stacking energies per unit change in solvent accessible area ranged from &#8722;0.02&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CS2, to &#8722;0.05&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CD2Cl2, but were dwarfed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase energy of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2. The results underscore the challenge facing the exploitation of dispersion in solution. Solvent competition strongly but imperfectly cancels dispersion at molecular recognition interfaces, making the energetic benefits difficult to realise.

         <title>Iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;7 Selective NH2 Amination of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indole via directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS), enabled by identifying N&#8211;P(O)t&#8722;Bu2 (TBPO) as the directing group. Important features of this reaction include the broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, good functional groups tolerance, use of earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst and low catalyst loading, and the ease to scale up.







Abstract
7&#8208;Aminoindoles are important synthetic intermediates to a broad range of bioactive molecules. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H amination is among the most straightforward route for their synthesis, whereas methods that could directly incorporate an NH2 group in a highly selective manner remains elusive. Moreover, there is still high demand for the development of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis for such attractive reactivity. We present here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indoles through a directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) with iron&#8208;aminyl radical. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerates variety of functional groups, and is readily scalable with catalyst loading down to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover number (TON) up to 4500.

Transition metal-catalyzed directed C&#8722;H amination is among the most straightforward route for their synthesis, whereas methods that could directly incorporate an NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group in a highly selective manner remains elusive. Moreover, there is still high demand for the development of earth-abundant metal catalysis for such attractive reactivity. We present here the first C-7 selective NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amination of indoles through a directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) with iron-aminyl radical. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerates variety of functional groups, and is readily scalable with catalyst loading down to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover number (TON) up to 4500.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Spatial Surface Energy in Porous Skeletons: a Pathway to Bridging Electronic Circuits from 2D to 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing maskless surface energy manipulation on a porous skeleton to guide PEDOT conductive ink deposition, electric circuits with high precision, density, stability, and adaptability are effortlessly engineered within or atop the porous skeleton. This facilitates transitions between 2D and 3D circuit configurations in electronic devices, whether rigid or flexible.







Abstract
Conventional approaches to creating high&#8208;resolution electric circuits face challenges such as the requirement for skilled personnel and expensive equipment. In response, we propose an innovative strategy that leverages a photochemically modified porous polymer skeleton for in&#8208;situ circuit fabrication. By developing maskless surface energy manipulation that guides PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based conductive ink deposition, electric circuits with high precision, density, stability and adaptability are effortlessly engineered within or atop the porous skeleton, enabling transitions between 2D and 3D circuit configurations. This process simplifies prototyping while significantly reducing costs and maintaining efficiency, promising advancements across various technological sectors.

         <title>Redox Self&#8208;Equilibration in Molecular Vanadium Oxide Mixtures Enables Multi&#8208;Electron Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) are ideal components for reversible multi&#8208;electron storage in energy technologies. To&#8208;date, most redox&#8208;applications employ only single, individual POM species, which limits the number of electrons that can be stored within a given potential window. Here, a synthetic approach is reported, where spontaneous redox self&#8208;equilibration leads to the formation of two structurally related polyoxovanadates which subsequently aggregate into co&#8208;crystals. This results in systems with significantly increased redox reactivity. The mixed POM system was formed by non&#8208;aqueous self&#8208;assembly of a vanadate precursor in the presence of Mg2+, resulting in two mixed&#8208;valent (VIV/V) species, [(MgOH)V13O33Cl]4&#8208; (= {MgV13}) and the di&#8208;vanadium&#8208;functionalized species [V14O34Cl]4&#8208; (= {V14}), which co&#8208;crystallize in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry. Experimental data indicate that in the native state, {MgV13} is reduced by three electrons, and {V14} is reduced by five electrons. Electrochemical studies in solution show, that the system can reversibly undergo up to fourteen redox transitions (tentatively assigned to twelve 1&#8208;electron processes and two 2&#8208;electron processes) in the potential range between &#8208;2.15 V to +1.35 V (vs Fc+/Fc). The study demonstrates how highly redox&#8208;active, well&#8208;defined molecular mixtures of mixed&#8208;valent molecular metal oxides can be accessed by redox&#8208;equilibration during synthesis, opening new avenues for molecular energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Reversible Thermal/Electro&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymeric Adhesives via Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds and Ionic Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adhesive conducting elastomers are rising materials towards cutting&#8208;edge applications in wearable and implantable soft electronics. Yet, engineering the conductive adhesives with robust and tunable interfacial bonding strength is still in its infancy stage. We herein identify a structurally novel supramolecular polymer scaffold, characterized by synergistic coexistence of hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions and electrostatic ionic junctions, endowing the robust and tunable elastic conducting adhesives with remarkable thermal/electro&#8208;responsive performance. H&#8208;bonding association and electrostatic interaction play orthogonal yet synergistic roles in the strong supramolecular adhesive formation, serving as the leveraging forces for opposing both cohesion and adhesion energy. To do so, six&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped random copolymers P(DAP&#8208;co&#8208;Thy&#8208;co&#8208;MBT)6 are strategically designed, bearing H&#8208;bonding PDAP (poly(diaminopyridine acrylamide)) and PThy (poly(thymine)) segments, which can form hetero&#8208;complementary DAP/Thy H&#8208;bonding association, along with conductive poly(ionic liquid)s segment: PMBT, (poly(1&#8208;[2&#8208;methacryloylethyl]&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane)&#8208;sulfonamide)). DAP/Thy H&#8208;bonding association, along with electrostatic ionic interaction, can yield dual supramolecular forces crosslinked polymeric networks with robust cohesion energy. Moreover, coexistence of poly(ionic liquid)s can impact and interfere the configuration of H&#8208;bonding association, liberate more free DAP and Thy motifs to form H&#8208;bonds towards substrate, affording strong surface adhesion in a synergistic manner. This work demonstrates a significant forward step towards potential adhesives devoted to hybrid electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Xanthene Radicals and Their Heavy Chalcogen Analogues Showing Tunable Doublet Emission from Green to Near&#8208;infrared</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic luminescent radicals, unlike traditional closed&#8208;shell fluorescent emitters, exhibit distinct luminescence mechanisms, offering promising potential for optoelectronic devices. To date, stable luminescent radicals have predominantly been confined to polychlorinated triphenylmethyl radicals, underscoring the need for new platforms to expand their emission spectra. In this study, we report the synthesis of stable 9&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted xanthene radicals and their heavy chalcogen analogues (1a&#8208;c and 2a&#8208;c), which exhibited excellent chemical stability and emission ranging from green to near&#8208;infrared (527~714 nm). Notably, the selenium&#8208;substituted radical (1c) demonstrates a significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield of 41% when doped into its precursor solid. Additionally, the introduction of methoxyphenyl groups has largely enhanced the stability of the radical, showcasing an excellent photostability with the longest half&#8208;life of around 1792 h. The high internal quantum efficiency of up to 81% was further validated in organic light&#8208;emitting diode. This study introduces a novel class of stable carbon&#8208;centered radicals with high tunability and functionality for photoelectric applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Single&#8208;Atom Modification of Hybrid Lead Chlorides for Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Effect and Enhanced Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid lead halides show significant potential in photocatalysis due to their excellent photophysical properties, but the atomically precise modification of their organic component to achieve synergistic interactions with the lead halide units remains a great challenge. Herein, for the first time, we have employed the crystal engineering strategy to construct a class of single&#8208;atom&#8208;substituted hybrid lead halides with electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) effect. The lead halide frameworks consist of 1D linear [PbCl]+ chains as inorganic building units and benzoxadiazole/benzothiadiazole/ benzoselenadiazole&#8208;funtionalized dicarboxylates as linkers. The covalent bonding between the organic ligands with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and the electron&#8208;rich lead halide units not only facilitate the charge separation, but also enhance structural robustness that is critical for photocatalysis. The D&#8208;A structured lead halides serve as highly efficient heterogeneous photooxidation catalysts, including aerobic oxidation of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds, oxidative coupling of primary amines, oxidation of phenylboronic acids and selective oxidation of sulfides that are demonstrated in 30 examples. Importantly, these photooxidation reactions are able to be driven by natural sunlight and ambient air to afford quantitative yields. Moreover, our lead halide photocatalysts are successful to fix into a photocatalytic flow system, which enables the flow&#8208;type synthesis of high value&#8208;added photooxidation products on a gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Binding Induced Hydrogen Bond Network Connectivity on Ru&#8208;based Catalysts for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the role of adsorbed intermediates at the polarized catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface on the structure of electrical double layer (EDL) is essential for developing highly efficient electrocatalysts. Here, we prepared a series of unconventional face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) phase Ru&#8208;based catalysts (i.e. fcc&#8208;Ru, fcc&#8208;RuCr, and fcc&#8208;RuCrW) by rational tuning the binding energetics of hydroxyl intermediate to engineer the electrochemical interface and boost the performance of alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The introduction of oxyphilic metals Cr and W can regulate the orbital occupation of Ru, promote the adsorption of hydroxyl species, resulting in an anomalous behavior that HOR performance under alkaline media exceeds acidic media. Experimental results and theoretical calculations unravel that the modulated adsorption of hydroxyl species on the electrode surface are responsible for the reconstruction of interfacial water structure and dynamic evolution of free water molecules from nearest to the electrode surface to above the gap region in the EDL, thereby leading to significantly increased water connectivity and hydrogen bond network. Our work reveals a new understanding of the surface intermediates in controlling the dynamic process of interfacial water and hydrogen bonding network in HOR electrocatalysis, and will guide rational design of advanced electrocatalysts through electrochemical interfacial engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Asymmetrical Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Co Sites Enable Efficient Chloride&#8208;mediated Ethylene Electrooxidation in Neutral Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene oxidation reaction (EOR) of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) via electrocatalysis is practically attractive because of its sustainability and mild reaction conditions. However, the chlorine oxidation reaction (COR), which is essential for the above process, is commonly catalyzed by dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) with high contents of precious Ru and/or Ir. The development of highly efficient COR electrocatalysts composed of nonprecious metals or decreased amounts of precious metals is highly desirable. Herein, we report a modified Co3O4 with a single&#8208;atom Ir substitution (Ir1/Co3O4) as a highly efficient COR electrocatalyst for chloride&#8208;mediated EOR to ECH in neutral seawater. Ir1/Co3O4 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 94.8% for ECH generation and remarkable stability. Combining experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the unique atomically asymmetrical Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Co configuration with a strong electron coupling effect in Ir1/Co3O4 can accelerate electron transfer to increase the reaction kinetics and maintain the structural stability of Co3O4 during COR. Moreover, a coupling reaction system integrating the anodic chloride&#8208;mediated and cathodic H2O2&#8208;mediated EOR show a total FE of ~170% for paired electrosynthesis of ECH and ethylene glycol (EG) using ethylene as the raw material. The technoeconomic analysis highlights the promising application prospects of this system.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin&#8208;based nanohoops, nanorings, and cages with fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures are highly sought after, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report the template&#8208;free synthesis of a highly strained, bithiophene&#8208;bridged porphyrin cyclophane (1) from a porphyrin quinone via a stereoselective nucleophilic addition followed by intermolecular Yamamoto coupling strategy. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses of 1 and its dication 12+ reveal significantly distorted cyclophane&#8208;like geometries, with calculated strain energies of 51.2 and 80.7 kcal/mol, respectively. While the neutral compound 1 exhibits localized aromaticity, the dication 12+ is globally aromatic, with the porphyrin unit displaying weak antiaromaticity. Additionally, the dication 12+ undergoes nucleophilic addition with chloride, relieving strain. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for highly strained, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems with intriguing electronic properties and chemical reactivity.</dc:description>

Abstract
Magnetic semiconductors, with integrated properties of ferromagnets and semiconductors, are significant for developing next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. Herein two atomically precise clusters of dysprosium(III) tellurides, formulated respectively as [Na2(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)3(py)2][(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)5(Te)6](py)4 (Dy5Te6, Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; py=pyridine) and [K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*Dy)6(Te3)(Te2)2(Te)3] (Dy6Te10), are reported. Crystallographic studies revealed the presence of multifarious tellurido ligands within the polyhedral cluster cores. Spectroscopic and magnetic studies showed that both clusters are single&#8208;molecule magnets exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures and semiconductors with low optical band gaps comparable to benchmark semiconductors. These clusters represent probably the first lanthanide&#8208;based molecular magnetic semiconductors.

&lt;/b&gt;, Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; py=pyridine) and [K(2,2,2-cryptand)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[(&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-Cp*Dy)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Te)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;Dy&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), are reported. Crystallographic studies revealed the presence of multifarious tellurido ligands within the polyhedral cluster cores. Spectroscopic and magnetic studies showed that both clusters are single-molecule magnets exhibiting slow magnetic relaxation behaviors at low temperatures and semiconductors with low optical band gaps comparable to benchmark semiconductors. These clusters represent probably the first lanthanide-based molecular magnetic semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Synthetic organic electrochemistry is recognized as one of the most sustainable forms of redox chemistry that can enable a wide variety of useful transformations. In this study, readily prepared pyrolytic carbon electrodes are explored in several powerful rAP transformations as well as C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bond forming reactions. Pyrolytic carbon provides an alternative to classic amorphous carbon&#8208;based materials that are either expensive or ill&#8208;suited to large&#8208;scale flow reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Identification of Inhibitors of the Lipid Transfer Protein CERT Using Nanoluciferase Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (NanoBRET)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A BRET system is described, in which Nanoluciferase was fused to the lipid transfer protein CERT for efficient energy transfer to a Nile red&#8208;labeled ceramide, which is either directly bound to CERT or transported to the adjacent Golgi membrane. Bulk formation of sphingomyelin, a major plasma membrane component in mammals, is dependent on CERT&#8208;mediated transfer of its predecessor ceramide. CERT is considered a promising drug target but no direct cell&#8208;based methods exist to efficiently identify inhibitors. The utility off the method was demonstrated by a library of 140 derivatives of the CERT inhibitor HPA&#8208;12. These were obtained in a combinatorial synthesis using solid&#8208;phase transacylation. Screening of the library led to six compounds that were picked and confirmed to be superior to HPA&#8208;12 in a subsequent dose&#8208;response study and also in an orthogonal lipidomics analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable C&#8211;N Bond Formation through Radical&#8208;Mediated Chemistry in Plasma&#8208;Microdroplet Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge produced in the wake of charged microdroplets is found to facilitate catalyst&#8208;free radical mediated hydrazine cross&#8208;coupling reactions without the use of external light source, heat, precious metal complex, or trapping agents. A plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion platform is utilized for introduction of hydrazine reagent that undergoes homolytic cleavage forming radical intermediate species. The non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge that causes the cleavage originates from a chemically etched silica capillary. The coupling of the radical intermediates gives various products. Plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion occurs online in a programmable reaction platform allowing direct process optimization and product validation via mass spectrometry. The platform is applied herein with a variety of hydrazine substrates, enabling i) self&#8208;coupling to form secondary amines with identical N&#8208;substitutions, ii) cross&#8208;coupling to afford secondary amine with different N&#8208;substituents, iii) cross&#8208;coupling followed by in&#8208;situ dehydrogenation to give the corresponding aryl&#8208;aldimines with two unique N&#8208;substitutions, and iv) cascade heterocyclic carbazole derivatives formation. These unique reactions were made possible in the charged microdroplet environment through our ability to program conditions such as reagent concentration (i.e., flowrate), microdroplet reactivity (i.e., presence or absence of plasma), and reaction timescale (i.e., operational mode source). The selected program is implemented in a co&#8208;axial spray format.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Rational and effective design of a universal near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;absorbed platform employed to prepare diverse activatable NIR fluorogenic probes for in vivo imaging and the imaging&#8208;guided tumor resection remains less exploited but highly meaningful. Herein, mandelic acid with a core structure of 4&#8208;hydroxylbenzyl alcohol to link recognition unit, a fluorophore and a quencher was employed to prepare activatable probes. We exemplified ester as carboxylesterase (CE)&#8208;recognized unit, ferrocene as quencher and phenothiazinium as NIR fluorophore to afford fluorogenic probes termed NBS&#8208;Fe&#8208;CE and NBS&#8208;C&#8208;Fe&#8208;CE. These probes enabled the conversion toward CE with significant fluorescence increases and successfully discriminate CE activity in cells.

         <title>A Poly(2,7&#8208;anthrylene) with peri&#8208;Fused Porphyrin Edges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthracene has served as an important building block of conjugated polymers with the connecting positions playing a crucial role for the electronic structures. Herein, anthracene units have been coupled through their 2,7&#8208;carbons to develop an unprecedented, conjugated polymer, namely, poly(2,7&#8208;anthrylene) featuring additional peri&#8208;fused porphyrin edges. The synthesis starts from a 2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9&#8208;nickel(II) porphyrinyl&#8208;anthracene as the pivotal precursor. Polymerization is achieved by an AA&#8208;type Yamamoto coupling, followed by a polymer&#8208;analogous oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to obtain a peri&#8208;fusion between porphyrin and anthracene moieties. Although further cyclodehydrogenation between the repeating units cannot be achieved in solution, the thermal treatment of the precursor polymer derived from 2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9&#8208;porphyrinyl&#8208;anthracene on a metal surface realizes the full cyclodehydrogenation. The difference between solution and on&#8208;surface reactivity can be rationalized by the larger dihedral angle between repeat units in solution, which is reduced under the pronounced interaction with the metal surface. The peri&#8208;fusion in the title polymer gives rise to a narrow electronic band gap optical absorptions extending far into the near&#8208;infrared region. Oligomeric models are synthesized as well to support the analyses of the electronic and photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>The Photodynamic Agent Designed by Involvement of Hydrogen Atom Transfer&#160;for Enhancing Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy has attracted increasingly growing interest due to its reduced dependence on oxygen, the design of effective Type&#8208;I photosensitizers remains a challenge. In this work, we report a design strategy for Type&#8208;I photosensitizers by the involvement of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). As a proof of concept, a HAT&#8208;involved Type&#8208;I PS, which simultaneously generates superoxide and carbon&#8208;centered radicals under light&#8208;irradiation, was synthesized. This photosensitizer is comprised of a fluorene&#8208;substituted BODIPY unit as an electron acceptor covalently linked with a triphenylamine moiety as an electron donor. Under light&#8208;irradiation, photo&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer occurs to generate the BODIPY anion radical and triphenylamine cation radical. The former transfers electrons to oxygen to generate O2&#8722;&#8226;, while the latter loses a proton to produce a benzyl carbon&#8208;centered radical which is well characterized.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although Type-I photodynamic therapy has attracted increasingly growing interest due to its reduced dependence on oxygen, the design of effective Type-I photosensitizers remains a challenge. In this work, we report a design strategy for Type-I photosensitizers by the involvement of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). As a proof of concept, a HAT-involved Type-I PS, which simultaneously generates superoxide and carbon-centered radicals under light-irradiation, was synthesized. This photosensitizer is comprised of a fluorene-substituted BODIPY unit as an electron acceptor covalently linked with a triphenylamine moiety as an electron donor. Under light-irradiation, photo-induced intramolecular electron transfer occurs to generate the BODIPY anion radical and triphenylamine cation radical. The former transfers electrons to oxygen to generate O2&#8722;&#8226;, while the latter loses a proton to produce a benzyl carbon-centered radical which is well characterized. The resulting carbon-centered radicals efficiently oxidize NADH by HAT reaction. This photosensitizer demonstrates remarkable photocytotoxicity even under hypoxic conditions, along with outstanding in vivo antitumor efficacy in mouse models bearing HeLa tumors. This work offers a novel strategy for the design of Type-I photosensitizers by involvement of HAT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nature&#8208;inspired N, O Co&#8208;Coordinated Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a pivotal pathway for the distributed production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In nature, enzymes containing manganese (Mn) centers can convert reactive oxygen species into H2O2. However, Mn&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts for 2e&#8722; ORR are scarcely reported. Herein, we developed a nature&#8208;inspired single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst comprising N, O co&#8208;coordinated Mn sites, utilizing carbon dots as the modulation platform (Mn CD/C). As&#8208;synthesized Mn CD/C exhibited exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.786 V and a maximum H2O2 selectivity of 95.8%. Impressively, Mn CD/C continuously produced 0.1 M H2O2 solution at 200 mA/cm2 for 50 h in the flow cell, with negligible loss in activity and H2O2 faradaic efficiency, demonstrating practical application potential. The enhanced activity was attributed to the incorporation of Mn atomic sites into the carbon dots. Theoretical calculations revealed that the N, O co&#8208;coordinated structure, combined with abundant oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the carbon dots, optimized the binding strength of intermediate *OOH at the Mn sites to the apex of the catalytic activity volcano. This work illustrates that carbon dots can serve as a versatile platform for modulating the microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts and for the rational design of nature&#8208;inspired catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Cu&#8208;Pd Paddle&#8208;Wheel Metal&#8722;Organic Framework for Selective CO  2   Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the binding energy between the intermediate and the active site is a key factor for tuning catalytic product selectivity and activity in the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Copper active sites are known to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but suffer from poor product selectivity due to the moderate binding energies of several of the reaction intermediates. Here, we report an ion exchange strategy to construct Cu&#8208;Pd paddle wheel dimers within Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu3&#8208;xPdx(BTC)2] (BTC = benzentricarboxylate), without altering the overall MOF structural properties. Compared to the pristine Cu MOF ([Cu3(BTC)2], HKUST&#8208;1), the Cu&#8208;Pd MOF shifts CO2 electroreduction products from diverse chemical species to selective CO generation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis of the catalyst oxidation state and local geometry, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the incorporation of Pd within the Cu&#8208;Pd paddle wheel node structure of the MOF promotes adsorption of the key intermediate COOH* at the Cu site. This permits CO&#8208;selective catalytic mechanisms and thus advances our understanding of the interplay between structure and activity toward electrochemical CO2 reduction using molecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Inorganic&#8208;Organic Dual&#8208;Photosensitizing Dinuclear&#8208;Metal Self&#8208;Assembly System for Efficient Artificial Photosynthesis without Sacrificial Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the unique synergistic effect, dinuclear&#8208;metal&#8208;molecule&#8208;catalysts (DMCs) show excellent performance in catalytic fields. However, for overall photocatalytic CO2 reaction (CO2RR), it is still a challenge to construct well&#8208;matched photosensitizer (PS) components for DMCs&#8208;based photocatalysts. Inorganic&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot PS possesses capacities of multiple exciton generation and catalyzing water oxidation but is incompatible with DMCs. In contrast, organic PS can be covalently linked with DMCs but inescapable of using sacrificial electron donors. For overall photocatalytic CO2RR, organic&#8208;inorganic dual&#8208;photosensitizing system might be a promising candidate. Herein, we employed covalent&#8208;linking and electrostatic&#8208;driven approaches to construct the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;sensitized Co2L DMCs (Py&#8208;Co2L) and perovskite (PVK) quantum dots, i.e., PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L]. Using H2O as an electron donor, PVK@[Py&#8208;Co2L] realized 105.24 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 CO yield in photocatalytic CO2RR, much higher than PVK (15.44 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) and PVK@Co2L (32.30 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1), ascribing to the efficient photogenerated charge separation and transfer. The experimental results and theoretical investigations demonstrated that the pyrene linked on Co2L boosted the electron delivery from PVK to DMCs. Besides, this strategy could also be extended to the photocatalytic H2 evolution coupled with alcohol oxidation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, our work lightens the integration of DMCs, organic and inorganic PS components, promoting the development of photocatalysis without sacrificial electron donors.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Propane Dehydrogenation to Propylene via Electron Hole&#8208;Hydrogen Coupling on Cobalt Metal Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane is useful for the high selectivity to propylene but is suffering from the heavy coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Herein, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application of a hole&#8208;hydrogen (H) couple on a metallic cobalt surface to decrease the deactivation rate. The coupled H atoms on the Co surface, partially resulting from propane dehydrogenation, enabled the desorption of propylene to avoid deep hydrogenolysis and coke deposition and realize selective and durable propylene production, while conventional Co metal&#8208;based catalysts do not generate propylene. The optimized hole&#8208;H coupled Co catalyst provided a low deactivation rate (0.0036 h&#8722;1) and a high turnover frequency (55.6 h&#8722;1) for propylene production with a high propane flux (48 vol.% C3H8 in gas feeds) at 550 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Chaperone&#8208;Derived Copper(I)&#8208;Binding Peptide Nanofibers Disrupt Copper Homeostasis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper (Cu) is a transition metal that plays crucial roles in cellular metabolism. Cu+ homeostasis is upregulated in many cancers and contributes to tumorigenesis. However, therapeutic strategies to target Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells are rarely explored because small molecule Cu+ chelators have poor binding affinity in comparison to the intracellular Cu+ chaperones, enzymes, or ligands. To address this challenge, we introduce a Cu+ chaperone&#8208;inspired supramolecular approach to disrupt Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells that induces programmed cell death. The Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers inside cancer cells with high binding affinity and selectivity for Cu+ due to the presence of the unique MT/CGGC motif, which is conserved in intracellular Cu+ chaperones. Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR exhibits cytotoxicity towards triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), impairs the activity of Cu+ dependent co&#8208;chaperone super oxide dismutase1 (SOD1), and induces oxidative stress. In contrast, Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR has minimal impact on normal HEK 293T cells. Control peptides show that the self&#8208;assembly and Cu+ binding must work in synergy to successfully disrupt Cu+ homeostasis. We show that assembly&#8208;enhanced affinity for metal ions opens new therapeutic strategies to address disease&#8208;relevant metal ion homeostasis.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Nanoparticle Oxidation by NO2&#160;and O2: Chemical Kinetics and&#160;Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanoparticle interactions with gases are central to many environmental and technical processes, but the underlying reaction kinetics and mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investigate the oxidation and gasification of carbon nanoparticles by NO2&#160;and O2&#160;under combustion exhaust conditions. We build on a comprehensive experimental data set and use a kinetic multilayer model (KM&#8208;GAP&#8208;CARBON) to trace the uptake and release of gas molecules alongside the temporal evolution of particle size and surface composition. The experimental results are captured by a model mechanism that involves different types of carbon atoms (edge/plane&#8208;like) and the formation of a reactive oxygen intermediate (activated CO complex) as the rate&#8208;limiting step. A transition between distinct chemical regimes driven by NO2&#160;at lower temperatures and O2&#160;at higher temperatures is reflected by an increase in the observable activation energy from ~60 kJ/mol to ~130 kJ/mol. We derive energy profiles for three alternative reaction pathways that involve uni&#8208; or bimolecular decomposition of reactive oxygen intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Fundamentals and Challenges of Ligand Modification in Heterogeneous Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient catalytic materials in the energy field could promote the structural transformation from traditional fossil fuels to sustainable energy. In heterogeneous catalytic reactions, ligand modification is an effective way to regulate both electronic and steric structures of catalytic sites, thus paving a prospective avenue to design the interfacial structures of heterogeneous catalysts for energy conversion. Although great achievements have been obtained for the study and applications of heterogeneous ligand&#8208;modified catalysts, the systematical refinements of ligand modification strategies are still lacking. Here, we reviewed the ligand modification strategy from both the mechanistic and applicable scenarios by focusing on heterogeneous electrocatalysis. We elucidated the ligand&#8208;modified catalysts in detail from the perspectives of basic concepts, preparation, regulation of physicochemical properties of catalytic sites, and applications in different electrocatalysis. Notably, we bridged the electrocatalytic performance with the electronic/steric effects induced by ligand modification to gain intrinsic structure&#8208;performance relations. We also discussed the challenges and future perspectives of ligand modification strategies in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity of organobismuth(I) complexes with organic azides. Treatment of N,C,N&#8208;pincer bismuthinidenes with organic azides (acyl, sulfonyl, and bulky aryl) results in isolable monomeric iminobismuthanes which can be structurally characterized&#8212;including the formal Bi=N double bond&#8212;by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Building upon the stoichiometric reactivity of the monomeric iminobismuthanes, catalytic reduction of a broad range of organic azides is developed. DFT calculations of the catalytic reaction pathway support the redox nature of the overall process.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Hard and Soft Acid&#8208;base Theory to Construct Heterometallic Materials with Metal&#8208;oxo Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials offer the potential to incorporate multiple functionalities, leveraging the aggregation effects of clusters and translating this heterogeneity and complexity into unexpected properties that are more than just the sum of their components. However, the rational construction of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials remains challenging due to the complexity of metal cation coordination and structural unpredictability. This minireview provides insights into a general synthetic strategy based on Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory, summarizing its advantages in the designed synthesis of discrete heterometallic clusters (intracluster assembly) and infinite heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials (intercluster assembly). Furthermore, it emphasizes the potential to exploit the intrinsic properties of mixed components to achieve breakthroughs across a broad range of applications. The insights from this review are expected to drive the progress of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials in a controllable and predictable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Helical Organization in Supramolecular Polymers of Pseudo&#8208;Macrocyclic Tetrakisporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrakisporphyrin monomers with amino acid side chains at each end form intramolecular antiparallel hydrogen&#8208;bonds to adopt chirally twisted pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic structures that result in right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;conformations. The pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic tetrakisporphyrin monomers self&#8208;assembled to form supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers via head&#8208;to&#8208;head complementary dimerization of the bisporphyrin cleft units in an isodesmic manner. The formation of one&#8208;handed supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The methyl and iso&#8208;propyl groups at the stereogenic center greatly enhanced the induced circular dichroism (CD) in the Soret bands of the supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers. The induced CDs were reduced upon the introduction of large iso&#8208;butyl and tert&#8208;butyl groups. Atomic force microscopy revealed well&#8208;grown and long supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymer chains with chain lengths in the range of 361 to 13.6 nm. The right&#8208;handed helical chains were established by the self&#8208;assembly of the right&#8208;handed (P)&#8208;conformation of the pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic monomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Peripheral Nitrogen Dopants in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Enhance Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the dopants situated near the metal site have demonstrated a significant impact on the catalytic properties. However, the effect of dopants situated further away from the metal centers and their working mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein, we conduct density functional theory&#8208;driven studies on regulating the peripheral nitrogen dopants in graphene&#8208;based SACs, with a particular focus on Ir1 SAC, for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It is found that increasing the distance between the N dopant and the Ir1 site results in a different energy change for the reaction process compared to the dense doping model with only first and second&#8208;shell N species. The proposed stochastic doping models demonstrate statistically that increasing the N dopant in farther shells not only enhances the activity of Ir1 but also maintains a high selectivity for propene, which is verified by experimental tests. The modulation of the d&#8208;band center of Ir1 by stochastic N dopants effectively modifies the binding strength of reaction intermediates, thereby enabling the optimization of the potential energy surface of PDH. These results deepen the understanding of dopant states around metal sites and provide an important implication for the doping engineering in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Customizing Bonding Affinity with Multi&#8208;Intermediates via Interfacial Electron Capture to Boost Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and earth&#8208;abundant alkaline HER electrocatalysts is pivotal for sustainable energy, but co&#8208;regulating its intricate multi&#8208;step process, encompassing water dissociation, OH&#8208; desorption, and hydrogen generation, is still a great challenge. Herein, we tackle these obstacles by fabricating a vertically integrated electrode featuring a nanosheet array with prominent dual&#8208;nitride metallic heterostructures characterized by impeccable lattice matching and excellent conductivity, functioning as a multi&#8208;purpose catalyst to fine&#8208;tune the bonding affinity &#160;with alkaline HER intermediates. Detailed structural characterization and theoretical calculation elucidate that charge redistribution at the heterointerface creates electron&#8208;accumulating W&#8208;W sites, which reduces the O p&#8208;W d and H s&#8208;W d interactions vs. single nitride, thereby enhancing OH&#8208; transfer and H2 release. As anticipated, the resulting WN&#8208;NiN/CFP catalyst demonstrates a gratifying low overpotential of 36.8 mV at 10 mA/cm&#178; for alkaline HER, while concurrently maintaining&#160;operational stability for 1300 h at 100 mA/cm&#178; for overall water splitting. This work presents an effective approach to meticulously optimize multiple site&#8208;intermediate interactions in alkaline HER, laying the foundation for efficient energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Revision of Halisphingosine A via Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sphingoid bases are important bioactive lipids found in a variety of organisms, serving as the backbone of sphingolipids, which regulate essential physiological processes. Here we describe the total synthesis and structure revision of halisphingosine A, a sphingoid base initially isolated from marine sponges. To address inconsistencies in the NMR interpretation of this natural product, we developed a synthetic route involving a late&#8208;stage enantioselective Henry reaction that allows access to multiple stereoisomers of the proposed halisphingosine core structure. Our library of 32 fully characterized synthetic stereoisomers enabled us to rectify the structure of halisphingosine A as (2R,3R,8R,Z)&#8208;2&#8208;aminooctadec&#8208;9&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3,8&#8208;triol, and to pursue further structure&#8208;activity relation (SAR) studies regarding their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential. In summary, our study offers a yet unreported compound library along with validated analytical datasets of marine sphingoid base derivatives, which significantly affects future ecometabolomic marine research and will facilitate the identification of inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism or antagonists of sphingolipid base&#8208;sensing receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Frustrated Coordination in Eutectic Electrolyte Driven by Ligand Asymmetry toward High&#8208;Performance Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eutectic electrolytes hold promise for aqueous zinc metal batteries in sustainable energy storage chemistries, yet improvement from perspective of molecule configurational engineering are ambiguous. Herein, we propose design strategy of increasing asymmetric molecular geometry in organic ligands to regulate frustrated coordination and disordered structure for eutectic electrolytes toward enhanced zinc metal batteries. The introduced asymmetry in eutectic component gives rise to relatively weak coordination strength and configurational disorder interaction among cation&#8208;anion&#8208;ligand, leading to suppressed local aggregation, steady eutectic phase and improved Zn2+&#160;diffusion kinetics. Such highly frustrated coordination state also enables disruption of hydrogen bonding network and reinforcement of anion participation, which results in confined side reactions, decreased water activity and the formation of inorganic&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase. In comparison to highly symmetric ligands, asymmetric ligand&#8208;involved eutectic electrolytes with configurational disorder&#160;deliver high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4 %, stabilized Zn plating/stripping of 5000 h and impressive rate capability even under harsh conditions such as small N/P, low temperature. The rationale in this work advances the deep understanding of asymmetric molecular engineering in eutectic electrolytes and showcases suitability of frustrated coordination to achieve high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the influence of oxygen on drug release dynamics in semipermeable polymersomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semipermeable polymersomes, a class of polymeric vesicles that allow molecular passage across their membranes, offer significant potential for controlled drug delivery. These vesicles can be designed for inherent or selective permeability through the choice of suitable copolymers or the incorporation of protein nanopores, respectively. In this study, we explore a novel approach using oxygen&#8208;producing enzymatic reactions within biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;poly(caprolactone&#8208;gradient&#8208;trimethylene carbonate) (PEG&#8208;p(CL&#8208;g&#8208;TMC)) polymersomes to modulate drug release. These polymersomes were found to enhance the release of hydrophobic drugs while retaining hydrophilic drugs. The enzymatic generation of oxygen within the polymersomes increased membrane hydrophobicity, influencing drug release kinetics. The findings highlight the importance of understanding drug release kinetics in designing effective drug delivery systems, as the release rate and mechanism critically impact therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Epitaxial Growth of Polycrystalline MOF Membranes on Cu Foils for Uniform Li Deposition in Long&#8208;life Anode&#8208;free Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal battery (AFLMB) is being developed as the next generation of advanced energy storage devices. However, the low plating and stripping reversibility of Li on Cu foil prevents its widespread application. A promising avenue for further improvement is to enhance the lithophilicity of Cu foils and optimise their surfaces through a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) functional layer. However, excessive binder usage in the current approaches obscures the active plane of the MOF, severely limiting its performance. In response to this challenge, MOF polycrystalline membrane technology has been integrated into the field of AFLMB in this work. The dense and seamless HKUST&#8208;1 polycrystalline membrane was deposited on Cu foil (HKUST&#8208;1M@Cu) via an epitaxial growth strategy. In contrast to traditional MOF functional layers, this binder&#8208;free polycrystalline membrane fully exposes lithophilic sites, effectively reducing the nucleation overpotential and optimising the deposition quality of Li. Consequently, the Li plating layer becomes denser, eliminating the effects of dendrites. When coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes, the battery based on the HKUST&#8208;1 membrane exhibits excellent rate performance and cycling stability, achieving a high reversible capacity of approximately 160 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintaining a capacity retention of 80.9% after 1100 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Cocrystallization&#8208;Induced Red Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cocrystals formed through multicomponent self&#8208;assembly have attracted significant interest owing to their clear structure and tunable optical properties. However, most cocrystal systems suffer from inefficient long&#8208;wavelength emission and low phosphorescence efficiency due to strong non&#8208;radiative processes governed by the energy gap law. Herein, an efficient long&#8208;lived red afterglow is achieved using a pyrene (Py) cocrystal system incorporating a second component (NPYC4) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) properties. The cocrystal (NPYC4&#8208;Py) not only inherits the excellent luminescence of its monomeric counterparts, but also exhibits unique dual&#8208;mode characteristics, including persistent TADF and UOP emission with a high quantum yield of 58% and a lifetime of 362 ms. The precise cocrystal stacking distinctly reveals that intermolecular interactions lock the cocrystal formation and weaken the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between NPYC4 and Py, thereby stabilizing the excited triplet excitons. Furthermore, the favorable energy level of NPYC4 acts as a bridge, reducing the energy gap between the S1 and T1 states for Py, therefore activating its red phosphorescence from Py. This research provides direct insights into achieving efficient red UOP through co&#8208;crystallization.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Gene Expression System Using a Caging&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Photoactivatable Dye</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical regulation of transcription using chemical compounds is an effective strategy to manipulate gene expression spatiotemporally. Conventional caging approaches with photoremovable protecting groups may require intense UV&#8208;light exposure and release potentially toxic byproducts. To address these problems, here we developed a light&#8208;mediated transcriptional regulation system by combining a caging&#8208;group&#8208;free photoactivatable dye PaX560 and a multidrug&#8208;binding transcriptional regulator QacR. The cationic dye generated from PaX560 through traceless photoconversion bound QacR and reduced its repressor function, resulting in transcriptional activation. Importantly, this system allowed transcriptional activation with a large dynamic range under mild visible light exposure and simultaneous detection of the state of the photoactivated effector. This module was integrated into the T7 RNA polymerase expression system to demonstrate light&#8208;activated transcription in vitro and in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Tuning Band Gaps of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Based MOFs Toward Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise adjusting the band gaps in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is crucial for improving their visible&#8208;light absorption capacity during photocatalysis, presenting both a formidable challenge and a charming opportunity. This present study employed a symmetry&#8208;reduction strategy to pre&#8208;design six novel 4&#8208;connected ligands with systematic substituents (&#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, &#8208;tBu, &#8208;OCH3, &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2) and synthesized the corresponding pillared&#8208;layer Zr&#8208;MOFs (NKM&#8208;668) retaining the hexaphenylbenzene fragment. Subsequently, the NKM&#8208;668 MOFs were transformed into large&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated hexabenzocoronene&#8208;based MOFs (pNKM&#8208;668) via the Scholl reaction. These twelve MOFs exhibited broad and tunable band gaps over 1.41 eV (ranging from 3.25 eV to 1.84 eV), and the photocatalytic CO2 conversion rate raised by 33.2&#8208;fold. This study not only enriches the type of hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based MOFs, but also paves the way for nanographene&#8208;containing MOFs in the further application of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Band Engineering of Mn&#8208;P Alloy Enables HER&#8208;suppressed Aqueous Manganese Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous manganese ion batteries hold potential for stationary storage applications owing to their merits in cost, energy density, and environmental sustainability. However, the formidable challenge is the instability of metallic manganese (Mn) anodes in aqueous electrolytes due to severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is more serious than the commonly studied Zn metal anodes. Moreover, the mechanism of HER side reactions has remained unclear. Herein, we design a series of Mn&#8208;P alloying anodes by precisely regulating their energy band structures to mitigate the HER issue. It is found that the serious HER primarily originates from the spontaneous Mn&#8208;H2O reaction driven by the excessively high HOMO energy level of Mn, rather than electrocatalytic water splitting. Owing to a reduced HOMO energy level and enhanced electron escape work function, the MnP anode achieves an evidently enhanced cycle durability (over 1000 hours at a high current density of 5 mA cm&#8208;2). The MnP||AgVO full cell with an N/P ratio of 4 exhibits better rate capability and extended cycle life (7000 cycles) with minimal capacity degradation than the cell using metallic Mn anode (less than 100 cycles). This study provides a practical approach for developing highly durable aqueous Mn ion batteries</dc:description>

         <title>A Fentanyl Hapten&#8208;Displaying Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine that Non&#8208;Covalently Encapsulates a TLR7/8 Agonist and T&#8208;helper Epitope Induces Protective Anti&#8208;Fentanyl Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Opioid use disorder &#8208; particularly involving fentanyl &#8208; has precipitated a public health crisis characterized by a significant increase in addiction and overdose&#8208;related deaths. Fentanyl&#8208;specific immunotherapy, which aims at inducing&#160;fentanyl&#8208;specific&#160;antibodies capable of binding fentanyl molecules in the bloodstream, preventing their entry in the central nervous system, is therefore gaining momentum.&#160;Conventional opioid designs&#160;rely on the covalent conjugation of fentanyl analogues to immunogenic carrier proteins that hold the inherent capacity of mounting immunodominant responses. Here, we present an alternative fentanyl vaccine design that utilizes a non&#8208;covalent assembly of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver fentanyl haptens in conjunction with a CD4+&#160;T&#8208;helper peptide epitope and an imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 agonist. Our results demonstrate that a single intramuscular administration of the LNP&#8208;based nanovaccine elicits fentanyl&#8208;specific antibodies, significantly mitigating the effects of opioid overdose in preclinical mouse models. Furthermore, we analyzed the immunobiological behavior of the vaccine in vivo in mouse models, providing evidence that covalent attachment of a fentanyl hapten to a carrier proteins or peptide epitope is not necessary for inducing an effective immune response. However, co&#8208;delivery &#8208; specifically, the physical assembly of all immune cues into an LNP &#8208; remains essential for inducing hapten&#8208;specific immunity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Double&#8208;walled Noncovalent Carbon Nanotube by Columnar Packing of Nanotube Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through host&#8211;guest complexation of nanotube fragments and tube&#8208;forming crystal engineering. As the smallest fragment of double&#8208;walled CNTs, a host&#8211;guest complex of perfluorocycloparaphenylene (PFCPP) and carbon nanobelt (CNB) was synthesized by mixing them in solvents. The immediate complexation of the PF[12]CPP&#8835;(6,6)CNB complex with a remarkably high association constant (Ka) of 2&#215;105 L/mol was observed. Time&#8208;dependent 1H NMR and thermogravimetry measurements revealed that the stability of (6,6)CNB was significantly improved by encapsulation. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the robust belt&#8208;in&#8208;ring structure of this complex. As indicated by the short distance between PF[12]CPP and (6,6)CNB (2.8 &#197;), intermolecular orbital interactions exist between the belt and the ring, which were further supported by theoretical calculation and phosphorescence quenching experiments. While the PF[12]CPP&#8835;(6,6)CNB complex adopts various crystal packing structures, chloroform was discovered to be a magic &#8220;glue&#8221; solvent inducing one&#8208;dimensional alignment of the PF[12]CPP&#8835;(6,6)CNB complex to build an unprecedented double&#8208;walled noncovalent CNT structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropic Hollow Structure with Chemotaxis Enabling Intratumoral Autonomic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective intratumoral drug penetration is pivotal for successful cancer treatment. However, due to the disrupted capillary networks and poor perfusion in solid tumors, there exist challenges to realize autonomous directional drug penetration and controlled drug release within the tumor. Considering the specificity of glucose within tumor tissue, we draw inspiration from nature and engineer asymmetrical hollow structures exhibiting chemotaxis towards high glucose levels. By incorporating multiple shells into these structures, we enhance the local chemical concentration gradients, thereby improving cellular uptake and precise targeting. The advantages of anisotropic hollow multishell structure (a&#8208;HoMS) can be reflected from the diffusion coefficient and directivity, which increase by 73.4% and 265% respectively compared to conventional isotropic hollow spheres, achieving the most linear movement while ensuring the speed of movement. Furthermore, the multi&#8208;level porosity and temporal&#8208;spatial order of a&#8208;HoMS enable sequential drug delivery that inhibits angiogenesis with inducing cell apoptosis. After the eradication of localized tumor cells, the a&#8208;HoMS can automatically migrate to the alive tumor cells under the glucose gradient, inducing another cycle of drug delivery and chemotaxis, resulting in excellent antitumor efficacy. These anisotropic HoMS demonstrate intelligence, adaptability, and precision in tumor therapy, providing valuable insights for programmable treatment within tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structural and Functional Mimic of P680+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One or multiple chlorophyll molecules are employed in the reaction center of photosystem II's main electron donor (defined as P680). We have a poor understanding of how the reaction center facilitates water oxidation and the roles that mono&#8208; and/or multimeric chlorophyll groups play when P680 oxidizes a neighboring tyrosine in order to drive water oxidation at the oxygen evolving complex. We have prepared a dimeric MgII&#8208;porphyrin complex [Mg2(BTPP)] (1, H4&#8208;BTPP = 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;(10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene) as a structural and functional mimic of the dimeric core of P680. 1 was oxidized by one&#8208;electron to the corresponding &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex 2. The radical cation was characterized by UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR, FT&#8208;IR, and EPR spectroscopic techniques. 2 was shown to be reactive towards phenols to give the corresponding phenoxyl radicals, mimicking the reactivity of the P680 cation radical which oxidizes tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. Critically, the dimeric &#960;&#8208;cation radical showed markedly higher rates of proton coupled electron transfer oxidation (PCET) of phenols when compared to its monomeric counterpart [Mg(TPP)] (TPP = 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin). Our findings demonstrate that MgII&#8208;porphyrin complexes are reliable mimics of photosynthetic PCET processes and suggest that photosynthetic reaction centers with multiple &#960;&#8208;conjugated complexes likely lower the barrier to PCET oxidation by &#960;&#8208;cation radical species.</dc:description>

We have prepared a dimeric MgII-porphyrin complex [Mg2(BTPP)] (1, H4-BTPP = 1,2-bis-(10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin-5-yl)-benzene) as a structural and functional mimic of the dimeric core of P680. 1 was oxidized by one-electron to the corresponding &#960;-cation radical complex 2. The radical cation was characterized by UV-Vis-NIR, FT-IR, and EPR spectroscopic techniques. 2 was shown to be reactive towards phenols to give the corresponding phenoxyl radicals, mimicking the reactivity of the P680 cation radical which oxidizes tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. Critically, the dimeric &#960;-cation radical showed markedly higher rates of proton coupled electron transfer oxidation (PCET) of phenols when compared to its monomeric counterpart [Mg(TPP)] (TPP = 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin). Our findings demonstrate that MgII-porphyrin complexes are reliable mimics of photosynthetic PCET processes and suggest that photosynthetic reaction centers with multiple &#960;-conjugated complexes likely lower the barrier to PCET oxidation by &#960;-cation radical species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides by Sulfonium Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8209;dicarbonyls remains a contemporary challenge in synthesis due to their tendency to undergo racemization via keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Herein, we report a method to access enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides by a chiral sulfinimine&#8208;mediated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement. The transformation displays good chirality transfer, as well as excellent chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. Diastereoselective reduction of the ketone moiety, also achievable in one&#8208;pot fashion, affords enantioenriched &#946;&#8209;hydroxyamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Genome Mining Facilitates the Discovery of a Promiscuous, Hyperthermostable Amidase from Thermovenabulum gondwanense with Notable Nylon&#8208;Degrading Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are ubiquitous in our ecosystems, and microplastic accumulation in the environment is an emerging global health concern. Since available recycling technologies are not economically competitive with primary plastic production, global use is expected to reach 1231 megatons by 2060, with 493 megatons leeching into the environment each year. To identify new nylon&#8208;recycling biotechnologies, targeted genome mining was used to identify thermostable enzymes capable of degrading polyamides. Here, we describe the characterization of a novel protein sourced from Thermovenabulum gondwanense: TvgC. TvgC is extremely stable, exhibiting a melting temperature of 93 &#176;C and no detectable losses in hydrolytic activity after one week at 60 &#176;C. While nylonases primarily process nylon&#8208;6, TvgC catalysed the degradation of both nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;6,6 films, which are considerably more difficult to degrade. Finally, conversion experiments demonstrate that TvgC achieves a 1.2 wt% conversion of nylon&#8208;6 film, comparable to that of the most highly engineered nylonases. This novel hyperthermostable protein represents an excellent starting point for future engineering of increasingly efficient nylonases.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infinite&#8208;Chain Polymers with Ge=Ge Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite considerable interest in heteroatom&#8208;containing conjugated polymers, there are only few examples with heavier p&#8208;block elements in the conjugation path. The recently reported heavier acyclic diene metathesis (HADMET) allowed for the synthesis of a polymer containing Ge=Ge double bonds &#8211; albeit insoluble and with limited degree of polymerization. By incorporation of long alkyl chains, we now obtained soluble representatives, which exhibit degrees of polymerization near infinity according to diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Analyses of the UV/Vis absorption and the NMR spectroscopic data confirm the presence of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation across the silylene&#8208;phenylene linkers between the Ge=Ge double bonds. Favorable intermolecular dispersion interactions lead to ladder&#8208;like cylindrical supramolecular assemblies as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and DLS. AFM and TEM images of deposited thin films reveal lamellar ordering of extended polymer bundles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Methods for precisely constructing a &#946;&#8208;sheet assembly with number&#8208;defined strands in solution remains quite limited due to its intense aggregation property. Here, we report the precise construction of a four&#8208;stranded anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet by utilizing a non&#8208;covalent approach.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Raman Probing of the Intrinsic Electric Field for High&#8208;Efficiency Screening of Electricity&#8208;Producing Bacteria at the Single&#8208;Cell Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of high&#8208;performance microbial fuel cells requires the evaluation of the activity of electrochemically active bacteria. However, this is challenging because of the time&#8208;consuming nature of biofilm formation and the invasive nature of labeling. To address this issue, we developed a fast, label&#8208;free, single&#8208;cell Raman spectroscopic method. This method involves investigating the &#8220;pure&#8221; linear Stark effect of endogenous CO in the silent region of biological samples, which allows for probing the intrinsic electric field in the outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes of live bacterial cells. We found that reduced outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes can generate an additional intrinsic electric field equivalent to an applied potential of +0.29 V. We also found that the higher the electrical activity of the cell, the larger the generated electric field. This was also reflected in the output current of the constructed microbial fuel cells. Raman spectroscopy was employed to facilitate the assessment of electrochemical activity at the single&#8208;cell level in highly&#8208;diluted bacterial samples. After analysis, inactive bacteria were ablated by laser heating, and 20 active cells were cultured for further testing. The rapid and high&#8208;throughput probing of the intrinsic electric field offers a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency screening of electrochemically active bacterial cells for bioenergetic and photosynthetic research.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Spin&#8208;State of Cobalt in Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Iodine Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the catalytic activity is heavily reliant on the electronic structure of the catalyst, understanding the impact of electron spin regulation on electrocatalytic performance is still rarely investigated. This work presents a novel approach involving the single&#8208;atom coordination of cobalt (Co) within metalloporphyrin&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs) to facilitate the catalytic conversion for sodium&#8208;iodine batteries. The spin state of Co is modulated by altering the oxidation state of the porphyrin&#8208;centered Co, achieving optimal catalysis for iodine reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that CoII and CoIII are incorporated into the 3D&#8208;COFs, exhibiting spin ground states of S = 1/2 and S = 0, respectively. The low spin state of CoIII is favorable to hybridize with the sp 3d orbitals of I3&#8208;, thus facilitating the conversion of I3&#8208; to I&#8208;. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the presence of CoIII enhances iodide adsorption and accelerates the formation of NaI in 3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII, thereby promoting its rapid kinetic behaviors. Notably, the I2@3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII cathode achieves a high reversible capacity of 227.7 mAh g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and demonstrates exceptional cyclic stability, exceeding 2000 cycles at 10 C with a minor capacity fading rate of less than one 0.01% per cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Palladium Migration for Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal migration strategy can offer BH functionalization of o&#8208;carboranes at different positions from where initial bond activation occurs to achieve bifunctionalized o&#8208;carboranes in one reaction. We report in this article an enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes via asymmetric Pd migration with a high efficiency and up to 98% ee. This asymmetric catalysis has a broad substrates scope, leading to the preparation of a class of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives. The enantiocontrol model is suggested on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) results, where the chiral Trost ligand plays a crucial role in this enantioselective Pd migration from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 C to the cage B(4) position of o&#8208;carborane.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium Dioxide Catalyzed Polymerization of N&#8208;doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) and Its Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution&#8208;processable, n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) marks a milestone in the development of&#160;conducting polymers. Currently, n&#8208;PBDF is prepared by either duroquinone&#8208;mediated or copper&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations, where scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness may present challenges. Here, we report a general, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective method for n&#8208;PBDF and its derivatives, namely selenium dioxide (SeO2) catalyzed polymerization. We discovered that a catalytic amount of selenium dioxide leads to high monomer conversions (&gt;99% by NMR). The obtained n&#8208;PBDF exhibits a consistently narrow hydrodynamic diameter distribution and its thin films show high conductivities. Furthermore, we revealed that this polymerization involves a mechanism distinct from the previously reported radical pathway. It involves successive Riley oxidation and aldol polycondensation processes. It was also found that the reduced selenium precipitates from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) when the catalytic cycle is terminated, allowing for a straightforward purification process through centrifugation and filtration. This method thus eliminates the need for the costly and slow dialysis process. Finally, we demonstrated that SeO2 catalyzed polymerization is applicable to n&#8208;PBDF derivatives, proving the generality of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>The Paradoxical Influence of Hydrothermally Treated Zeolites on the Hydrocarbon Pool Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the mechanistic intricacies of hydrothermally treated zeolite is crucial for valorizing any oxygen&#8208;containing renewable feedstocks (e.g., methanol, carbon dioxide, biomass). Additionally, the regeneration of deactivated zeolite catalysts under oxidative conditions, akin to hydrothermal treatment, is essential in industrial processes. While research in this area has predominantly focused on characterizing steaming&#8208;induced physicochemical changes in zeolite, their ultimate impact on the organic reaction mechanism governed by the hydrocarbon pool dual&#8208;cycle mechanism remains unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates the effect of steamed zeolite on the organic reaction mechanism during the industrially significant methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. We achieved this objective by strategically integrating catalytic and control experiments over the pristine and steamed zeolites and their advanced characterization, including under operando conditions, XRD structural refinement, and using &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. This multimodal characterization approach was instrumental in elucidating elusive mechanistic information in the dual&#8208;cycle mechanism, shedding light on phenomena such as the unchanged ethylene selectivity despite decreasing aromatics selectivity, while ethylene could solely be derived from arene&#8208;based reaction intermediates. This study could improve the process efficiency in zeolite catalysis by connecting steaming&#8208;induced changes in the organic reaction mechanisms with inorganic material aspects.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating Spin Channels in SrCoO3 through Triagonal&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Structural Transformation for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution/Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) play crucial roles in energy conversion processes such as water splitting and air batteries, where spin dynamics inherently influence their efficiency. However, the specific contribution of spin has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we intentionally introduce a spin channel through the transformation of trigonal antiferromagnetic SrCoO2.5 into cubic ferromagnetic SrCoO3, aiming to deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in catalytic reactions. Based on the results from spherical&#8208;aberration&#8208;corrected microscope, synchrotron absorption spectra, magnetic characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that surface electron transfer is predominantly governed by local geometric structures, while the presence of the spin channel significantly enhances the bulk transport of spin&#8208;polarized electrons, particularly under high current densities where surface electron transfer is no longer the limiting factor. The overpotential for OER is reduced by at least 70 mV at 150 mA cm&#8208;2 due to the enhanced conductivity from spin&#8208;polarized electrons facilitated by spin channels, with an expectation of even more significant reductions at higher current densities. This work provides a clearer picture of the role of spin in oxygen&#8208;involved electrocatalysis, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient catalytic systems in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Active Sites of Metal/Metal Oxide Catalysts by Oxide Ligand Overlayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering sites of supported metal catalysts is essential to enhancing activity and selectivity. Such enhancement is typically achieved by particle size modification, surface alloying, or attaching molecular ligands. Yet, control strategies for complex, multifunctional molecules and catalysts, where selectivity is crucial, are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that submonolayer WOx with tunable coverage preferentially decorates well&#8208;coordinated Pt terrace sites as a stable ligand. By combining experimental kinetics with probe molecules, in situ spectroscopies, and first&#8208;principles modeling, we show that the WOx coverage on Pt modifies the metal&#8208;to&#8208;acid site balance while retaining the acid strength intact and results in optimal reactivity for metal&#8208;acid catalyzed reactions at a specific metal, size, and support&#8208;dependent WOx coverage. The oxide can also alter the reactant adsorption mode, reversing selectivity and pathways from terrace&#8208; to step&#8208;dominated, as evidenced in furfural decarbonylation and hydrogenation. The insights open avenues for improving metal/metal oxide catalysts beyond the specific system.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing Non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 Assisted Asymmetrical C&#8208;C Coupling for Highly Energy&#8208;Efficient Electroreduction of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring an appropriate support material for Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst is conducive for stably producing multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from electroreduction of carbon monoxide. However, the insufficient metal&#8208;support adaptability and low conductivity of the support would hinder the C&#8208;C coupling capacity and energy efficiency. Herein, non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 was incorporated into Cu electrocatalysts (Cu&#8208;Ti4O7), and served as a highly conductive and stable support for highly energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical conversion of CO. The abundant oxygen vacancies originated from ordered lattice defects in Ti4O7 facilitate the water dissociation and the CO adsorption to accelerate the hydrogenation to *COH. The highly adaptable metal&#8208;support interface of Cu&#8208;Ti4O7 enables a direct asymmetrical C&#8208;C coupling between *CO on Cu and *COH on Ti4O7, which significantly lowers the reaction energy barrier for C2+ products formation. Additionally, the excellent electroconductivity of Ti4O7 benefits the reaction charge transfer through robust Cu/Ti4O7 interface for minimizing the energy loss. Thus, the optimized 20Cu&#8208;Ti4O7 catalyst exhibits an impressive selectivity of 96.4% and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 45.1% for multi&#8208;carbon products, along with a remarkable partial current density of 432.6 mA cm&#8208;2. Our study underscores a novel C&#8208;C coupling strategy between Cu and the support material, advancing the development of Cu&#8208;supported catalysts for highly efficient electroreduction of carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;assisted Controllable Synthesis of PdNi Nanoalloys for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF), a vital fuel precursor and solvent, is crucial for biomass refining. Herein, we report highly selective and stable PdNi nanoalloy catalysts for this deep hydrogenation process. A CO2&#8208;assisted green method was developed for the controllable synthesis of various bimetallic and monometallic catalysts. The PdNi/SBA&#8208;15 catalysts with various Pd/Ni ratios exhibited a volcano&#8208;like trend between BHMTHF yield and Pd/Ni ratio. Among all catalysts tested, Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 achieved the best performance, converting 99.0% of HMF to BHMTHF with 96.0% selectivity, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Additionally, the Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst maintained excellent stability even after five recycling runs. Catalyst characterizations (e.g., HAADF&#8208;STEM) and DFT calculations confirmed the successful formation of the alloy structure with electron transfer between Ni and Pd, which accounts for the remarkable performance and stability of the catalyst. This work paves the way for developing highly selective and stable alloy catalysts for biomass valorization.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control over Social and Narcissistic Self&#8208;Sorting from Multicomponent Mixtures in Seed&#8208;Initiated Supramolecular Polymerization by Fine&#8208;Tuning of Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers offer an intriguing possibility to transfer molecular properties from the nano&#8208; to the mesoscale. Towards this achievement, seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization has emerged as a powerful tool, as it prevents unlimited growth and enables size control of the assembly outcome. However, the potential application of the seeding method in the context of complex supramolecular systems is hitherto unclear. Herein we demonstrate that minute differences in molecular design in direct proximity to intermolecular recognition sites govern the molecular packing and in turn dictate the efficacy of seeded polymerization processes. We introduce a stepwise increase in steric demand in the central amino acid residue of a diamide system, which gradually increases the rotational displacement within the aggregated state. This fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular packing directly affects the propensity of the different aggregates to act as seeds for the other supramolecular synthons. In turn this allows us to selectively target specific trapped monomer states in binary mixtures for social or narcissistic seeded polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Excitation of Poly&#8208;(para&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Enables Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Oxidations of Amines in Flow.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous visible light photocatalysis is a compelling approach to address sustainability in synthetic photochemistry. However, the use of solid&#8208;state photocatalysts remains very unpopular in organic synthesis because of their limited accessibility and the black&#8208;box effect associated to the lack of rational between their molecular structure and their photochemical properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis, characterization, photocatalytic properties and synthetic applications of a simple and readily available solid&#8208;state conjugated organic polymer, poly&#8208;(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) 1, which exhibits a strong oxidative power upon irradiation with visible light (E(1*/1&#8226;&#8211;) = +1.67 V vs SCE). Comparisons with structural analogues highlighted the superior photocatalytic activity of this linear semiconductor, on account of its fully conjugated architecture. The associated excited&#8208;state reactivity enabled the transformation of various amines into imines in batch and continuous flow reactors together with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. Mechanistic investigations revealed concomitant photoredox and energy transfer pathways, that led to the formation of the desired products. Ultimately, the inline generation of imines was exploited in telescoped three&#8208;component Ugi reactions (3CR) in batch and flow toward biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;acylaminoamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of Chemical Space through Automated Reasoning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast size of composition space poses a significant challenge for materials chemistry: exhaustive enumeration of potentially interesting compositions is typically infeasible, hindering assessment of important criteria ranging from novelty and stability to cost and performance. We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user&#8208;specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen&#8217;s outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high&#8208;level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors. Further, we demonstrate the integration of Comgen into an end&#8208;to&#8208;end automated workflow to propose and evaluate candidate compositions quantitatively, prior to experimental investigation.</dc:description>
