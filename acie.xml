         <title>Reversible Three&#8208;Color Fluorescence Switching of an Organic Molecule in the Solid State via &#8220;Pump&#8208;Trigger&#8221; Optical Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photoswitches that undergo fluorescence switching upon ultraviolet irradiation, photoluminescence and photoisomerization often occur simultaneously, leading to unstable fluorescence properties. Here, we successfully demonstrated reversible solid&#8208;state triple fluorescence switching through "Pump&#8208;Trigger" multiphoton manipulation. A novel fluorescence photoswitch, BOSA&#8208;SP, achieved green, yellow, and red fluorescence under excitation by pump light and isomerization induced by trigger light. The energy ranges of photoexcitation and photoisomerization did not overlap, enabling appropriate selection of the multiphoton light for &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; photoswitching, respectively. Additionally, the large free volume of the spiropyran (SP) moiety in the solid state promoted reversible photoisomerization. Switching between &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; light is useful for three&#8208;color tunable switching cell imaging, which can be exploited in programmable fluorescence switching. Furthermore, we exploited reversible dual&#8208;fluorescence switching in a single molecular system to successfully achieve two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Shizukaol J, Trichloranoid C and Trishizukaol A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric total synthesis of three lindenane sesquiterpenoid oligomers, i.e. shizukaol J, trichloranoid C and trishizukaol A, has been accomplished concisely in 15, 16 and 18 longest linear steps respectively. The expeditious construction of molecular architectures was facilitated by Nelson&#8217;s catalytic asymmetric ketene&#8208;aldehyde cycloaddition, a sequence of allylic alkylation/reduction/acidic cyclization to forge a lactone, and a double aldol condensation cascade to construct the 5/6 bicyclic system. Diastereoselective nucleophilic substitution promoted by a phase transfer catalyst constructed the C  11  quaternary stereogenic center, thus prompting synthetic efficacy toward shizukaol J. The synthesis of trichloranoid C and trishizukaol A was achieved after a cascade involving furanyl diene formation and a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, as well as a one&#8208;pot sequence involving furan oxidation and global deprotection. Furthermore, our biological evaluation revealed that two compounds exhibited unexpected toxicity against tumor cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;Induced Exposure of the Intrinsic Magnetic Surface of BaTiO3 to Give Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Preparation of low dimensional ferromagnetic nano&#8208;materials and investigation of their magnetic origin is critical to the exploration of novel materials with various applications such as data storage. Herein, non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) BaTiO  3  was successfully stripped to a low&#8208;dimensional structure by treating the materials with supercritical CO  2  (SC CO  2  ). Under different CO  2  pressures, SC CO  2  selectively cleaves the covalent bonds of the bulk BaTiO  3  , leading to the exposure of various surfaces. After SC CO  2  treatments, the BaTiO  3  exhibit room temperature ferromagnetism, which is significantly stronger than conventional treatments. According to the experimental and theoretical investigations, the enhanced ferromagnetic property is attributed to the exposure of the intrinsic surfaces of BaTiO  3  .</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding: A New Platform for Achieving Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Persistent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monotonous luminescence has always been a major factor limiting the application of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials. Enhancing and regulating the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest is an effective strategy to achieve excellent phosphorescence performance. In this study, intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8230;Br) was introduced into the host&#8208;guest RTP system. The interaction promoted intersystem crossing and stabilized the triplet excitons, thus helping to achieve strong phosphorescence emission. In addition, the weak intermolecular interaction of halogen bonding is sensitive to external stimuli such as heat, mechanical force, and X&#8208;rays. Therefore, the triplet excitons were easily quenched and colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli responsive behaviors were realized, which greatly enriched the luminescence functionality of the RTP materials. This method provides a new platform for the future design of responsive RTP materials based on weak intermolecular interactions between the host and guest molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Aldehydes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization Followed by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially  chiral aldehydes have received increasing attention in enantioselective catalysis. However, only very few catalytic methods have been developed to construct structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes. We herein describe an NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of biaryl dialdehydes as a general and practical strategy for the construction of axially chiral aldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that coupling proceeds through a novel combination of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes and kinetic resolution. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization and provides a modular platform for the synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting System with Controllable Efficiency Enabled by an Annulene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Fluid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of controllable artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems based on liquid crystal (LC) materials,  i.e., anisotropic fluids, remains a challenge. Herein, an annulene&#8208;based discotic LC compound  6  with a saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene core has been synthesized to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform. The LC material shows typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission, which can act as a suitable light&#8208;harvesting donor. By loading Nile red (NiR) as an acceptor, an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system is achieved. Relying on the thermal&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling ability of  6  with variable molecular order, the efficiency of such  6  &#8208;NiR system can be controlled by temperature. This light&#8208;harvesting system works sensitively at a high donor/acceptor ratio as 1000:1, and exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100:1 donor/acceptor ratio. This thermochromic artificial light&#8208;harvesting LC system could find potential applications in smart devices employing soft materials.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Degradable Vinylic Polymer&#8208;Based Latexes via Aqueous Radical Emulsion Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous emulsion copolymerizations of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) were performed with&#160;  n  &#8208;butyl acrylate (BA), styrene (S) and a combination of both. In all cases, stable latexes were obtained in less than two hours under conventional conditions; that is in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) used as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. A limited solubility of DOT in BA was observed compared to S, yielding to a more homogeneous integration of DOT units in the PS latex. In both cases, the copolymer could be easily degraded under basic conditions. Emulsion terpolymerization between DOT, BA and S allowed to produce stable latexes not only composed of degradable chains but also featuring a broad range of glass transition temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling charge separation mechanisms in photocatalyst particles by spatially resolved surface photovoltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic solar energy conversion offers a potential route to renewable energy, and its efficiency relies on the effective charge separation in nanostructured photocatalysts. Therefore, understanding the charge separation mechanism is key to improving the photocatalytic performance and has now been enabled by advances in the spatially resolved surface photovoltage (SRSPV) method. Here we review the progress made by SRSPV in mapping the charge distributions at the nanoscale and determining the driving forces of charge separation in heterogeneous photocatalyst particles. We discuss how charge separation via a built&#8208;in electric field, diffusion, and trapping can be exploited and optimized through photocatalyst design and underline the importance of asymmetric engineering of photocatalyst for effective charge separation. Finally, we offer an outlook on further opportunities that arise from leveraging these insights to guide the rational design of photocatalysts and advance the imaging technique to expand the knowledge of charge separation</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Promoted Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Aliphatic Ketoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust and highly active homogeneous chiral nickel&#8208;phosphine complex for the asymmetric hydrogenation of aliphatic &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;ketoacids has been discovered. The hydrogenation could be smoothly proceeded in the presence of 0.0133 mol% catalyst loading (S/C = 7500). The coordination chemistry and catalytic behavior of Ni(OTf)  2  with (  S  ,  S  )&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE were explored by  1  H NMR and HRMS. The mechanistic studies revealed that proton promoted the activation of the substrate C=O bond and controlled stereoselectivity through hydrogen bonds. A series of chiral &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;alkyl substituted lactones were obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% yield and 99% ee). In addition, this catalytic system was also demonstrated that levulinic acid produced from biomass feedstock was converted into chiral &#947;&#8208;valerolactone without loss of ee value.</dc:description>

         <title>Inorganic&#8208;Organic Hybrid Membrane based on Pillararene&#8208;intercalated MXene Nanosheets for Efficient Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discharge of antibiotic&#8208;containing wastewater causes environmental pollution and  threatens biological  and human health. An efficient treatment method for this wastewater is urgently required.  We  prepared inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid pillararene&#8208;MXene nanosheets with a large lateral size  (5&#8211;8  &#956;  m). The hybrid nanosheets were stacked on supports via vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration to prepare membranes with regular parallel slits and an interlayer spacing of 1.36 nm, which were used to purify antibiotic&#8208;containing water. Permeance through the membrane increased 100&#8208;fold compared with most polymeric and other two&#8208;dimensional nanofiltration membranes with similar rejection. This high permeance and rejection was attributed to the large lateral size of the nanosheets, regular interlayer spacing, and electrostatic interaction between the membrane and antibiotics. These membranes will broaden the applications of lamellar materials for the separation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added drugs in academia and industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Carbonyls and &#960;&#8208;Cation Effect for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepare a polyimide covalent organic framework composite anode by effective in&#8208;situ condensation of anhydride and amine on the surface of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. The construction of the conductive network accelerates the transport of electron. Dual electroactive sites in the framework, carbonyls and aromatic naphthalene rings, could storage more potassium ions by the enolization and &#960;&#8208;K+ effect.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COF) possess a robust and porous crystalline structure, making them an appealing candidate for energy storage. Herein, we report an exfoliated polyimide COF composite (P&#8208;COF@SWCNT) prepared by an in situ condensation of anhydride and amine on the single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes as advanced anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Numerous active sites exposed on the exfoliated frameworks and the various open pathways promote the highly efficient ion diffusion in the P&#8208;COF@SWCNT while preventing irreversible dissolution in the electrolyte. During the charging/discharging process, K+ is engaged in the carbonyls of imide group and naphthalene rings through the enolization and &#960;&#8208;K+ effect, which is demonstrated by the DFT calculation and XPS, ex&#8208;situ FTIR, Raman. As a result, the prepared P&#8208;COF@SWCNT anode enables an incredibly high reversible specific capacity of 438&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and extended stability. The structural advantage of P&#8208;COF@SWCNT enables more insights into the design and versatility of COF as an electrode.

         <title>Picking on Carbonate: Kinetic Selectivity in the Encapsulation of Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexapodal capsule has been shown to trap inorganic anions over a large span of time. Whereas small spherical and cylindrical ions enter the cage at a rapid rate (seconds), it takes longer (minutes) for medium&#8208;sized and tripodal species, and larger and tetrahedral anions need hours to days to fully populate the host. Such a kinetic selection could be used for sequestering anions from solution and/or controlling their chemistry.







Abstract
Supramolecular hosts bind to inorganic anions at a fast rate and select them in proportion with thermodynamic stability of the corresponding [anion&#8834;host] complexes, forming in a reversible manner. In this study, we describe the action of hexapodal capsule 1 and its remarkable ability to select anions based on a large span of rates by which they enter this host. The thermodynamic affinity of 1 toward eighteen anions extends over eight orders of magnitude (0&lt;Ka&lt;108&#8197;M&#8722;1; 1H NMR spectroscopy). The capsule would retain CO32&#8722; (Ka=107&#8197;M&#8722;1) for hours in the presence of eleven competing anions, including stronger binding SO42&#8722;, HAsO42&#8722; and HPO42&#8722; (Ka=107&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1). The observed selection resulted from 1 possessing narrow apertures (ca. 3&#215;6&#8197;&#197;) comparable in size to anions (d=3.5&#8211;7.1&#8197;&#197;) slowing down the encapsulation to last from seconds to days. The unorthodox mode of action of 1 sets the stage for creating hosts that pick anions by their ability to access the host.

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;Templated Palladium Nanoparticles for Water Purification by Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density palladium nanocatalyst is successfully immobilized on bulk electrodes via a 3D&#8208;structured amyloid fibrils template. The novel hybrid electrodes exhibit superior electroreduction performance for detoxification of wastewater and drinking water.







Abstract
Electrocatalysis offers great promise for water purification but is limited by low active area and high uncontrollability of electrocatalysts. To overcome these constraints, we propose hybrid bulk electrodes by synthesizing and binding a Pd nanocatalyst (nano&#8208;Pd) to the electrodes via amyloid fibrils (AFs). The AFs template is effective for controlling the nucleation, growth, and assembly of nano&#8208;Pd on the electrode. In addition, the three&#8208;dimensional hierarchically porous nanostructure of AFs is beneficial for loading high&#8208;density nano&#8208;Pd with a large active area. The novel hybrid cathodes exhibit superior electroreduction performance for the detoxification of hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), 4&#8208;chlorophenol, and trichloroacetic acid in wastewater and drinking water. This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of an AFs&#8208;templated nano&#8208;Pd&#8208;based hybrid electrode, which constitutes a paradigm shift in electrocatalytic water purification, and broadens the horizon of its potential engineered applications.

         <title>Synergy Effect of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ionic Compound: Dual Interfacial Energy Level Regulation and Passivation to Promote Voc and Stability of Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic multifunctional additive (QAPyBF4) was developed and introduced into perovskite solar cells (PSCs). QAPyBF4 passivated defect states in the perovskite layer, adjusted energy level alignment at the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces, and prevented the decomposition of perovskite crystals. Therefore, a planar PSC with QAPyBF4 delivered an efficiency of 23.1&#8201;% with a remarkable Voc of 1.2&#8197;V and operational stability.







Abstract
Defects and energy offsets at the bulk and heterojunction interfaces of perovskite are detrimental to the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed an amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic compound (QAPyBF4), implementing simultaneous defects passivation and interface energy level alignments. The p&#8208;type conjugated cations passivated the surface trap states and optimized energy alignment at the perovskite/hole transport layer. The highly electronegative [BF4]&#8722; enriched at the SnO2 interface featured desired band alignment due to the dipole moment of this interlayer. The planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSC had an efficiency of 23.1&#8201;% with Voc of 1.2&#8197;V. Notably, the synergy effect elevated the intrinsic endothermic decomposition temperature of the perovskite. The modified devices showed excellent long&#8208;term thermal (85&#8201;&#176;C) and operational stability at the maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h at 45&#8201;&#176;C under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination with no appreciable efficiency loss.

         <title>Clusters Induced Electron Redistribution to Tune Oxygen Reduction Activity of Transition Metal Single&#8208;Atom for Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy of metal clusters regulating metal single&#8208;atom sites is developed to boost the activities of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts (Fe, Co, Ni). Benefiting from the electron redistribution between active sites and substrate, the optimized catalyst exhibits remarkable activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE and achieves high discharge voltages in various metal&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity can be effectively tuned by modulating the electron configuration and optimizing the chemical bonds. Herein, a general strategy to optimize the activity of metal single&#8208;atoms is achieved by the decoration of metal clusters via a coating&#8211;pyrolysis&#8211;etching route. In this unique structure, the metal clusters are able to induce electron redistribution and modulate M&#8722;N species bond lengths. As a result, M&#8208;ACSA@NC exhibits superior ORR activity compared with the nanoparticle&#8208;decorated counterparts. The performance enhancement is attributed to the optimized intermediates desorption benefiting from the unique electronic configuration. Theoretical analysis reinforces the significant roles of metal clusters by correlating the ORR activity with cluster&#8208;induced charge transfer. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, various metal&#8211;air batteries assembled with Fe&#8208;ACSA@NC deliver remarkable power densities and capacities. This strategy is an effective and universal technique for electron modulation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C, which shows great potential in application of energy storage devices.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Based COF 2D Materials: Variable Modification of Sensing Performances by Post&#8208;Metallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metalloporphyrin covalent organic framework based nanosheets has been synthesized and successfully applied in specific sensing of NO2 at room temperature.







Abstract
2D nanomaterials with flexibly modifiable surfaces are highly sought after for various applications, especially in room&#8208;temperature chemiresistive gas sensing. Here, we have prepared a series of COF 2D nanomaterials (porphyrin&#8208;based COF nanosheets (NS)) that enabled highly sensitive and specific&#8208;sensing of NO2 at room temperature. Different from the traditional 2D sensing materials, H2&#8208;TPCOF was designed with a largely reduced interlayer interaction and predesigned porphyrin rings as modifiable sites on its surfaces for post&#8208;metallization. After post&#8208;metallization, the metallized M&#8208;TPCOF (M=Co and Cu) showed remarkably improved sensing performances. Among them, Co&#8208;TPCOF exhibited highly specific sensing toward NO2 with one of the highest sensitivities of all reported 2D materials and COF materials, with an ultra&#8208;low limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 6.8&#8197;ppb and fast response/recovery. This work might shed light on designing and preparing a new type of surface&#8208;highly&#8208;modifiable 2D material for various chemistry applications.

&lt;p&gt;A series of metalloporphyrin covalent organic framework based nanosheets has been synthesized and successfully applied in specific sensing of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D nanomaterials with flexibly modifiable surfaces are highly sought after for various applications, especially in room-temperature chemiresistive gas sensing. Here, we have prepared a series of COF 2D nanomaterials (porphyrin-based COF nanosheets (NS)) that enabled highly sensitive and specific-sensing of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature. Different from the traditional 2D sensing materials, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TPCOF was designed with a largely reduced interlayer interaction and predesigned porphyrin rings as modifiable sites on its surfaces for post-metallization. After post-metallization, the metallized M-TPCOF (M=Co and Cu) showed remarkably improved sensing performances. Among them, Co-TPCOF exhibited highly specific sensing toward NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with one of the highest sensitivities of all reported 2D materials and COF materials, with an ultra-low limit-of-detection of 6.8&#8197;ppb and fast response/recovery. This work might shed light on designing and preparing a new type of surface-highly-modifiable 2D material for various chemistry applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Directed Formation of Anisotropic Kettlebell and Tadpole Nanostructures in the Absence of a Swelling&#8208;Induced Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic kettlebell and tadpole polymer nanostructures formed through a single protrusion from spheres. This method obviates the commonly used solvent swelling&#8208;induced method to form anisotropic particles by driving tail assembly through enhanced chain mobility by tuning the glass transition temperature of the polymer core. Further, the kettlebells could be isolated and transformed to tadpoles on&#8208;demand with temperature.







Abstract
Anisotropic Janus (&#8220;snowman&#8221;) nanoparticles with a single protrusion are currently made via the solvent swelling&#8208;induced method. Here, we demonstrate without the aid of toxic solvents a generally applicable method for the formation of anisotropic polymer nanoparticles directly in water by controlling polymer mobility through tuning its glass transition temperature (Tg). Spherical structures, formed immediately after the emulsion polymerization, transformed into uniform tadpoles (with head diameter &#8776;60&#8197;nm and tail length &#8776;130&#8197;nm) through the protrusion of a single cylindrical tail when cooled to a temperature above the Tg of the polymer. Cooling the spheres to below the Tg produced kinetically trapped kettlebell structures that could be freeze&#8208;dried and rehydrated without any structural change. These unique kettlebells could transform into uniform tadpoles by heating above the Tg, representing a triggered and on&#8208;demand structural reorganization.

         <title>Hydrocarbon Macrocycle Conformer Ensembles and 13C&#8208;NMR spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NMR as a routine analytic method provides important three&#8208;dimensional structure information of compounds in solution. Here we apply the recently released  crenso  computational workflow for the automated generation of conformer ensembles to the quantum mechanical calculation of  13  C&#8208;NMR spectra of a series of flexible cylcoalkanes up to C  20  H  40  . We evaluate the computed chemical shifts in comparison with corresponding experimental data in chloroform. It is shown that accurate and properly averaged theoretical NMR data can be obtained in about a day of computation time on a standard workstation computer. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables to deduce preferred conformations of large, non&#8208;rigid macrocylces under ambient&#160; conditions from our automated procedure.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic Encoding of Cyanopyridylalanine for In&#8208;Cell Protein Macrocyclization by the Nitrile&#8208;Aminothiol Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanopyridylalanines are non&#8208;canonical amino acids that react with aminothiol compounds under physiological conditions in a biocompatible manner without requiring added catalyst. Here we present newly developed aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases for genetic encoding of  meta  &#8208; and  para  &#8208;cyanopyridylalanine to enable the site&#8208;specific attachment of a wide range of different functionalities. The outstanding utility of the cyanopyridine moiety is demonstrated by examples of (i) post&#8208;translational functionalization of proteins, (ii) in&#8208;cell macrocyclization of peptides and proteins, and (iii) protein stapling. The biocompatible nature of the protein ligation chemistry enabled by the cyanopyridylalanine amino acid opens a new path to specific  in vivo  protein modifications in complex biological environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework (COF) derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: Unraveling Fundamental Kinetic and Structural Parameters of the Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO  2  reduction is a potential approach to convert CO  2  into valuable chemicals using electricity as feedstock. Abundant and affordable catalyst materials are needed to upscale this process in a sustainable manner. Nickel&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) is an efficient catalyst for CO  2  electro&#8208;reduction to CO, and the single&#8208;site Ni&#8208;N  x  motif is believed as the active site. However, critical metrics for its catalytic activity, such as active site density and intrinsic turnover frequency, so far lack systematic discussion. In this work, we prepared a set of covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts, for which the Ni&#8208;N  x  content could be adjusted by the pyrolysis temperature. The combination of high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure evidenced the presence of Ni single&#8208;sites, and quantitative X&#8208;ray photoemission addressed the relation between active site density and turnover frequency.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a strategy for making anionic pacs type porous materials by combining pore space partition with charge reallocation. The method uses the first negatively charged pore partition ligand (2,5,8&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,7,9&#8208;hexaazaphenalene, H&#8208;tph) that simultaneously enables pore partition and charge reallocation. Over two dozen anionic  pacs  materials have been made to demonstrate their excellent chemical stability and a high degree of tunability. Notably, Ni  3  &#8208;bdt&#8208;tph (bdt = 1,4&#8208;benzeneditetrazolate) exhibits month&#8208;long water stability, while CoV&#8208;bdt&#8208;tph sets a new benchmark for C  2  H  2  storage capacity under ambient conditions for ionic MOFs. In addition to tunable in&#8208;framework modules, we show feasibility to tune the type and concentration of extra&#8208;framework counter cations and their influence on both stability and capability to separate industrial C  3  H  8  /C  3  H  6  and C  6  H  6  /C  6  H  12  mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Millisecond&#8208;Range Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging Enabled through Ultralong Aqueous Phosphorescence Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Probes featuring room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising tools for time&#8208;resolved imaging. It is worth noting that the time scale of time&#8208;resolved bioimaging generally ranges microsecond level, because of the short&#8208;lived emission. In this report, the first example of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved bioimaging is illustrated, which is enabled through a kind of ultralong aqueous phosphorescence probes (i.e., cyclo&#8208;(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;AspD&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Cys)&#8208;conjugated zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres), with RTP emission lasting for ~5 s and lifetime as long as 743.7 ms. We demonstrate that the live cells and deep tumor tissue in mice can be specifically targeted through immune&#8208;phosphorescence imaging, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) value of ~69 for in vitro imaging, and ~627 for in vivo imaging, respectively. We further show that, compared to that of fluorescence imaging, the SBR enhancement of millisecond&#8208;range time&#8208;resolved in vivo bioimaging is up to 105&#8208;times.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Computationally Guided Synthesis of SSZ&#8208;43: A One&#8208;Dimensional 12&#8208;Ring Zeolite with Unique Sinusoidal Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of zeolite SSZ&#8208;43 was determined by 3D electron diffraction, synchrotron X&#8209;ray powder diffraction, and high&#8209;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The SSZ&#8208;43 framework forms one&#8208;dimensional, sinusoidal 12&#8208;ring channels from 5461 butterfly units commonly found in other zeolites, but with unique 6.5 &#215; 6.5 &#197; apertures and 12&#8208;ring 6.5 &#215; 8.9 &#197; windows perpendicular to the channels. SSZ&#8208;43 crystals are intergrowths of two polytypes: ~90% orthorhombic polytype A with ABAB stacking of the 12&#8208;rings, and ~10% monoclinic polytype B with ABCABC stacking. Molecular modeling performed on the idealized Si&#8208;SSZ&#8208;43 structure along with empirical relationships for zeolite selectivity in boron&#8208; and aluminum&#8208;containing synthesis gels were used in a combined approach to design new di&#8208;quaternary ammonium organic structure&#8209;directing agents (OSDAs). Experimental trials demonstrated that the new OSDAs produced SSZ&#8208;43 over a broader range of compositions than previous mono&#8208;quaternary OSDAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Finite Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional DNA Hierarchical Nanoarchitectures through Orthogonal and Directional Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reliable orthogonal bonding with precise and flexible orientation control would be ideal for building finite complex nanostructures via self&#8208;assembly. Employing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DNA origami, hexagonal prism DNA origami (HDO), as building block, we demonstrate it is practical to construct finite hierarchical nanoarchitectures with complicated conformations through orthogonal and directional bonding. The as&#8208;designed HDO building block has twelve prescribed directional valences in 3D space and each of them supports two opposite orientations, yielding the capability to generate abundant directional bonding. Meanwhile, we minimize the thorny non&#8208;specific interactions among HDOs and enable the orthogonal bonding between any two valences based on self&#8208;similar designing. Consequently, various hierarchical nanostructures are prepared at will simply by the combination of HDOs with appropriate valences. We believe this route towards hierarchically assembly is inspiring and hope it would facilitate the fabrication of functional superstructures.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Precision Synthesis of AB, ABA and ABC Block Copolymers via Switchable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined block copolymers with molecular complexity by simple techniques has always been a meaningful but rarely achieved task. Here, a commercial switchable catalysis is reported comprising a delicate &#8220;double switch&#8221; process. This unique switch can be applied up to pentacomponent mixtures to prepare sequence&#8208;controlled AB, ABA, and ABC copolymers.







Abstract
The switchable catalysis using a commercial salenMn catalyst was firstly developed and applied in the one&#8208;pot selective copolymerization from anhydrides, epoxides, CO2 and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (&#1013;&#8208;CL) mixtures for the precise synthesis of AB, ABA and novel ABC block copolymers. The observed unique double switch process comprising three different polymerization cycles was rationalized by theoretical calculations. Surprisingly, the first block turned out to be an efficient macromolecular initiator for the consecutive introduction of carbonate linkages into copolymers, albeit with dominant cyclization with the catalyst alone. Further, through the selective reaction on different epoxides, the switchable copolymerization of up to five monomers was achieved yielding well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block copolymers with structural diversity and functionality.

         <title>Transforming Escherichia coli Proteomembranes into Artificial Chloroplasts Using Molecular Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cofactors: Like the chloroplasts of green plants, a hybrid system consisting of heterodinuclear photocatalysts and inverted E. coli vesicles generates reduced nicotinamides and adenosine triphosphate simultaneously.







Abstract
During the light&#8208;dependent reaction of photosynthesis, green plants couple photoinduced cascades of redox reactions with transmembrane proton translocations to generate reducing equivalents and chemical energy in the form of NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate), respectively. We mimic these basic processes by combining molecular ruthenium polypyridine&#8208;based photocatalysts and inverted vesicles derived from Escherichia coli. Upon irradiation with visible light, the interplay of photocatalytic nicotinamide reduction and enzymatic membrane&#8208;located respiration leads to the simultaneous formation of two biologically active cofactors, NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and ATP, respectively. This inorganic&#8208;biologic hybrid system thus emulates the cofactor delivering function of an active chloroplast.

         <title>Transforming Electrocatalytic Biomass Upgrading and Hydrogen Production from Electricity Input to Electricity Output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coupling anodic low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation with the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction, a multipurpose electrocatalytic system was assembled for biomass upgrading, hydrogen production, and electricity generation. This system could generate about 2&#8197;kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced, instead of requiring electricity input.







Abstract
Integrating biomass upgrading and hydrogen production in an electrocatalytic system is attractive both environmentally and in terms of sustainability. Conventional electrolyser systems coupling anodic biosubstrate electrooxidation with hydrogen evolution reaction usually require electricity input. Herein, we describe the development of an electrocatalytic system for simultaneous biomass upgrading, hydrogen production, and electricity generation. In contrast to conventional furfural electrooxidation, the employed low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation enabled the hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group to be released as gaseous hydrogen at the anode at a low potential of approximately 0&#8197;VRHE (vs. RHE). The integrated electrocatalytic system could generate electricity of about 2&#8197;kWh per cubic meter of hydrogen produced. This study may provide a transformative technology to convert electrocatalytic biomass upgrading and hydrogen production from a process requiring electricity input into a process to generate electricity.

         <title>Internal Electric Field and Interfacial Bonding Engineered Step&#8208;Scheme Junction for a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Involved Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8722;N bonding in S&#8208;scheme Fe2O3/C3N4 significantly boosts the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;excited carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers. These enable the light&#8208;involved Li&#8211;O2 battery with a Fe2O3/C3N4 cathode to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13&#8197;V under illumination and a charge voltage of 3.19&#8197;V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability.







Abstract
Li&#8211;O2 batteries have aroused considerable interest in recent years, however they are hindered by high kinetic barriers and large overvoltages at cathodes. Herein, a step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) junction with hematite on carbon nitride (Fe2O3/C3N4) is designed as a bifunctional catalyst to facilitate oxygen redox for a visible&#8208;light&#8208;involved Li&#8211;O2 battery. The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8722;N bonding in the heterojunction boost the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers, at which the photoelectrons on C3N4 and holes on Fe2O3 remarkably accelerate the discharge and charge kinetics. These enable the Li&#8211;O2 battery with Fe2O3/C3N4 to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13&#8197;V under illumination, higher than the equilibrium potential 2.96&#8197;V in the dark, and a charge voltage of 3.19&#8197;V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability. This work will shed light on rational cathode design for metal&#8211;O2 batteries.

         <title>Discrete Stacked Dimers of Aromatic Oligoamide Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking of aromatic foldamer helices in water gives rise to thermodynamically and kinetically stable discrete dimers. The association can be used to convey helix handedness from one helix to the next and be designed to form heterodimers exclusively.







Abstract
Tight binding was observed between the C&#8208;terminal cross section of aromatic oligoamide helices in aqueous solution, leading to the formation of discrete head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimers in slow exchange on the NMR timescale with the corresponding monomers. The nature and structure of the dimers was evidenced by 2D NOESY and DOSY spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The binding interface involves a large hydrophobic aromatic surface and hydrogen bonding. Dimerization requires that helices have the same handedness and the presence of a C&#8208;terminal carboxy function. The protonation state of the carboxy group plays a crucial role, resulting in pH dependence of the association. Dimerization is also influenced by neighboring side chains and can be programmed to selectively produce heteromeric aggregates.

         <title>Significance of Receptor Mobility in Multivalent Binding on Lipid Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent membrane processes result in numerous receptors being coupled on a diffusive surface. As such, these binding mechanisms depend heavily on the intrinsic mobility on the cell membrane. The Minireview discusses the importance of mobility in multivalent binding, demonstrating that it is crucial for the deeper understanding of receptor interactions, and to guide the design of new generations of multivalent ligands.







Abstract
Numerous key biological processes rely on the concept of multivalency, where ligands achieve stable binding only upon engaging multiple receptors. These processes, like viral entry or immune synapse formation, occur on the diffusive cellular membrane. One crucial, yet underexplored aspect of multivalent binding is the mobility of coupled receptors. Here, we discuss the consequences of mobility in multivalent processes from four perspectives: (I)&#8197;The facilitation of receptor recruitment by the multivalent ligand due to their diffusivity prior to binding. (II)&#8197;The effects of receptor preassembly, which allows their local accumulation. (III)&#8197;The consequences of changes in mobility upon the formation of receptor/ligand complex. (IV)&#8197;The changes in the diffusivity of lipid environment surrounding engaged receptors. We demonstrate how understanding mobility is essential for fully unravelling the principles of multivalent membrane processes, leading to further development in studies on receptor interactions, and guide the design of new generations of multivalent ligands.

         <title>A Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;Anchored Rhenium(I) Photosensitizer Evokes Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyroptosis is a unique form of programmed cell death that is essentially proinflammatory and critical for immunity. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115800), Qian Cao, Zong&#8208;Wan Mao and co&#8208;workers developed a carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored photosensitizer CA&#8208;Re capable of inducing and self&#8208;reporting membrane rupture upon irradiation, as well as evoking pyroptosis to activate anti&#8208;tumor immunity. CA&#8208;Re is the first metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducer, and this work provides a tantalizing angle for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Heteroaromatics with Prolonged Homogeneous Hexatomic Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic heteroaromatics have exhibited fascinating multi&#8208;resonance (MR) characteristics for efficient narrowband emission, but strategies to bathochromic shift their emissions while maintaining the narrow bandwidths remain exclusive. Here, homogeneous hexatomic&#8208;rings are introduced into nitrogen&#8208;embedded MR skeletons to prolong the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length for low&#8208;energy electronic transitions while retaining the non&#8208;bonding character of the rest parts. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitters exhibit nearly unity photoluminescence quantum yields with peak at 598 nm and 620 nm and small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 28 nm and 31 nm, respectively. Optimal organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit a high external quantum efficiency of 18.2%, negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off, and ultra&#8208;long lifetime with negligible degradation at an initial luminance of 10000 cd m&#8208;2 after 94 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Dual Single&#8208;Atom Sites on 2D Ultrathin N&#8208;doped Carbon Nanosheets Attaining Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
A Fe/Mn dual single&#8208;atom catalyst with an excellent bifunctional activity is prepared as the cathode for a flexible low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB). Profiting from the combined Fe/Mn dual&#8208;site effect as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure, the ZAB could operate efficiently at the ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Herein, a novel dual single&#8208;atom catalyst comprising adjacent Fe&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4 sites on 2D ultrathin N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with porous structure (FeMn&#8208;DSAC) was constructed as the cathode for a flexible low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB). FeMn&#8208;DSAC exhibits remarkable bifunctional activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Control experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the catalytic activity arises from the cooperative effect of the Fe/Mn dual&#8208;sites aiding *OOH dissociation as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure promoting active sits exposure and mass transfer during the reaction process. The excellent bifunctional activity of FeMn&#8208;DSAC enables the ZAB to operate efficiently at ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, delivering 30&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 peak power density and retaining up to 86&#8201;% specific capacity from the room temperature counterpart.

         <title>Interfacial Atom&#8208;Substitution Engineered Transition&#8208;Metal Hydroxide Nanofibers with High&#8208;Valence Fe for Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving NiFeV nanofiber was synthesized by an interfacial atom&#8208;substitution strategy to boost the activity of the NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that the NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high&#8208;valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts for efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key for scalable water electrolysis, for instance, NiFe&#8208;based materials. Decorating NiFe catalysts with other transition metals offers a new path to boost their catalytic activities but often suffers from the low controllability of the electronic structures of the NiFe catalytic centers. Here, we report an interfacial atom&#8208;substitution strategy to synthesize an electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving NiFeV nanofiber to boost the activity of NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that the NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high&#8208;valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The NiFeV nanofiber supported on a carbon cloth shows a low overpotential of 181&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, along with long&#8208;term stability (&gt;20&#8197;h) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based OER catalysts.

         <title>Unifying Scheme for the Biosynthesis of Acyl&#8208;Branched Sugars: Extended Substrate Scope of Thiamine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of bacteria have branched sugars in their outer cell membrane with long, highly modified side chains. LPSs are often crucial factors in the pathogenesis of the bacteria. A unifying explanation of the biosynthesis of these highly interesting structures is introduced, based on the investigation of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes responsible for the linkage of the side chain and the sugar core.







Abstract
Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) dependent enzymes are useful catalysts for asymmetric C&#8722;C bond formation through benzoin&#8208;type condensation reactions that result in &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. A wide range of aldehydes and ketones can be used as acceptor substrates; however, the donor substrate range is mostly limited to achiral &#945;&#8208;keto acids and simple aldehydes. By using a unifying retro&#8208;biosynthetic approach towards acyl&#8208;branched sugars, we identified a subclass of (myco)bacterial ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes with a greatly extended donor substrate range, namely functionalized chiral &#945;&#8208;keto acids with a chain length from C4 to C8. Highly enantioenriched acyloin products were obtained in good to high yields and several reactions were performed on a preparative scale. The newly introduced functionalized &#945;&#8208;keto acids, accessible by known aldolase&#8208;catalyzed transformations, substantially broaden the donor substrate range of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes, thus enabling a more general use of these already valuable catalysts.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Tuned Molecular Packing Allows Concurrently Boosted Photoacoustic Imaging and NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is generally considered that photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) cannot be enhanced concurrently, as they are dependent on competitive photophysical processes at the single molecular level. Herein, we reveal that BDTR9&#8208;OC8 and BDTR9&#8208;C8, which have identical &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones but are substituted by side chains of different rigidity, show distinct phototheranostic properties in the aggregated state. The NIR&#8208;II FLI and PAI brightness of BDTR9&#8208;C8 nanoparticles are enhanced by 4.6&#8208; and 1.4&#8208; times compared with BDTR9&#8208;OC8 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations and GIWAXS analysis revealed that BDTR9&#8208;C8 with rigid side chains shows a relative amorphous condensed state, which will benefit the efficient transportation of photo&#8208;generated excitons and phonons, subsequently enhancing the FLI and PAI signals. Besides, both nanoparticles exhibit excellent photothermal conversion efficiency due to their strong light&#8208;harvesting capability and are considered effective photothermal therapy materials. This work provides an illuminating strategy for material design in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tertiary &#946;&#8208;Boryl Amides by Conjunctive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkenyl Boronates and Carbamoyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of versatile tertiary &#946;&#8208;boryl amides is accomplished by conjunctive cross coupling of a&#8208;substituted alkenyl boron &#8220;ate&#8221; complexes and carbamoyl chloride electrophiles. This reaction can be accomplished in an enantioselective fashion using a palladium catalyst in combination with MandyPhos. The addition of water results in enhanced chemoselectivity for the conjunctive coupling product relative to the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling product. Transformations of the reaction products were examined as well as application to the synthesis of (+)&#8208;adalinine.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Elastic Organic Crystals that Respond to Aerial Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reshaping of elongated organic crystals that can be used as semiconductors, waveguides or soft robotic grippers by application of force or light is now a commonplace, however mechanical response of organic crystals to changes in humidity has not been accomplished yet. Here, we report a universal approach to instigating a humidity response into elastically bendable organic crystals that elicits controllable deformation with linear response to aerial humidity while retaining their physical integrity entirely intact. Hygroresponsive bilayer elements are designed by mechanically coupling a humidity&#8208;responsive polymer with elastic molecular crystals that have been mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating. As an illustration of the application of these cladded crystalline actuators, they are used tested as active optical transducers of visible light where the position of light output can be precisely controlled by variations in aerial humidity. Within a broader context, the approach described here provides access to a vast range of mechanically robust, lightweight hybrid hygroresponsive crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is regarded as one of the promising strategies for freshwater production desirable to provide sustainable water for landlocked and arid regions. Hygroscopic materials have attracted widespread attention because of their water harvesting performance. However, the introduction of much inorganic salts often leads to aggregation and leakage issues in practical use. Here, polyzwitterionic hydrogels are developed as an effective AWH material platform. Via anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, the hygroscopic salt coordinated with polymer chains could capture moisture and enhance the swelling property, leading to strong moisture sorption capacity. The hydrogel shows superior AWH performance (0.62 g/g, 120 minutes for equilibrium at 30% relative humidity) and produces 5.87 L kg&#8208;1 freshwater per day. It is anticipated that the polyzwitterionic hydrogels with unique salt&#8208;responsive property could provide new insights to design and prepare next&#8208;generation AWH materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) as a Peptide&#8208;Based Molecular Scaffold with a Minimal Structure and High Density of Functionalizable Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalizable synthetic molecules with nanometer sizes and defined shapes in water are useful as molecular scaffolds to mimic the functions of biomacromolecules and develop chemical tools for manipulating biomacromolecules. Herein, we propose oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Oligo&#8208;NMA forms a defined shape in water without hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks or ring constraints, which enables the molecule to act as a scaffold with minimal atomic composition. Furthermore, functional groups can be readily introduced on the nitrogens and &#945;&#8208;carbons of oligo&#8208;NMA. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands. The ease of synthesis, minimal structure, and high functionalization flexibility makes oligo&#8208;NMA a useful scaffold for chemical and biological applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The structural diversity of sp  3  &#8208;triorganometallic reagents enhances their potentiality in the modular construction of molecular complexity in chemical synthesis. Despite significant achievements on the preparation of sp  3  1,1,1&#8208; and 1,1,2&#8208;triorganometallic B,B,B&#8208;reagents, catalytic approaches that enable the installation of multiple boryl groups at skipped carbons of unactivated alkenes still remain elusive. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed selective triborylation reaction of unactivated alkenes to access synthetically versatile 1,1,3&#8208;triborylalkanes. This triborylation protocol provides a general platform for regioselective trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes, and its utility is highlighted by the synthesis of various value&#8208;added chemicals from readily accessible unactivated alkenes. Mechanistic studies, including deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and evaluation of potential reactive intermediates, provide insight into the experimentally observed chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exotic oxidation states of the first row transition metals have recently attracted much interest. In order to investigate the oxidation states of a series of iron&#8208;oxalate complexes, an aqueous solution of iron(III) nitrate and oxalic acid was studied by infrared free liquid matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization and ionspray mass spectrometry. Here, we show that iron is not only detected in its common oxidation states +II and +III, but also in its unusual oxidation state +I, detectable in both positive and in negative ion modes, respectively. Vibrational spectra of the anionic iron oxalate complexes [Fe  (III)  (C  2  O  4  )  2  ]&#8254;, [Fe  (II)  (C  2  O  4  )CO  2  ]&#8254; and [Fe  (I)  (C  2  O  4  )]&#8254; are measured by means of infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and their gas phase structures are assigned by comparison to anharmonic vibrational spectra based on second order perturbation theory.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A loop deletion mutant of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) that facilitates the cellular uptake of decoy molecules into Escherichia coli has been developed. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111612), Osami Shoji et&#8197;al. report that co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type CYP102A1 enables an E. coli&#8208;based whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst to efficiently oxidise benzene, alkyl&#8208; and cycloalkylbenzenes with the help of decoy molecules, bringing this system a significant step closer to its practical application.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Zero and Low&#8208;Valent Metal Nodes Connected by Tetratopic Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, tetratopic phosphine linkers were used to realize MOFs with Pd0 and Pt0 metal nodes, which represent the first MOFs constructed using only metal&#8211;phosphine coordination bonds. In addition, a RhI coordination solid was synthesized, highlighting the versatility of these phosphine linkers. A total of six new materials are reported using unique triphenylphosphine&#8208;modulated syntheses and their luminescent properties are described.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed with M0 nodes are attractive targets due to the reactivity of these low&#8208;valent metals, but examples of these MOFs remain exceedingly rare. The rational design of three&#8208;dimensional MOFs with Pd0 and Pt0 nodes using tetratopic phosphine ligands is reported. Five new MOFs have been synthesized by systematic variation of the phosphine ligands and metal precursors employed, and these represent the first examples of MOFs constructed using phosphine&#8211;metal bonds as the sole structural component. The MOFs display solid&#8208;state luminescence, with emission maxima that are significantly red&#8208;shifted compared to Pd(PPh3)4. In addition, a RhI low&#8208;valent coordination solid based on the same linker design is reported, which displays solid&#8208;state luminescence that is not observed for the molecular analogue.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Nitric Acid from Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) has drawn widespread attention due to its potential for the green synthesis of nitric acid. Since a prerequisite for the favorable development of this emerging field is the rational testing of NOR performance, a recommended protocol is presented in this Minireview. In addition, possible reaction mechanisms and future perspectives, as well as challenges related to NOR, are discussed.







Abstract
Nitric acid is widely applied in agriculture and industry. The present manufacturing process via a combination of the Haber&#8211;Bosch process and the Ostwald oxidation process is accompanied by massive energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The direct electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to nitric acid is a promising alternative, especially when it is driven by renewable energy sources. The standardization of performance evaluation is the prerequisite for the design and synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts for NOR. In this context, this Minireview first discusses the history of the development of HNO3 manufacturing and the possible reaction mechanisms for electrocatalytic NOR. Then, a strict protocol for electrochemical NOR experiments is recommended. Finally, general research targets associated with techno&#8208;economic analysis, challenges, and prospects for NOR are summarized for future studies.

         <title>A Molecular Pump Facilitates Mechanical Adsorption Away from Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attaching or embedding biological or artificial molecular pumps to or into a surface or interface to achieve compartmentalization enables their unidirectional molecular motion to be organized in a confined environment. This approach led to the discovery of the phenomenon of mechanisorption and paves the way towards building highly complex organized molecular architectures.







Abstract
Artificial molecular pumps that perform unidirectional motion on the molecular scale have been used to design systems operating away from equilibrium. Crafting such pumps onto a surface allows their unidirectional movement to be organized in a confined environment as well as the active pumping of adsorbents from the bulk solution to the surface. This study led to the discovery of the phenomenon of mechanisorption and paves the way for the construction of highly complex organized molecular architectures.

         <title>Coordinated Anionic Inorganic Module: An Efficient Approach Towards Highly Efficient Blue&#8208;Emitting Copper Halide Ionic Hybrid Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper halide based organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid structures exhibit great potential as light&#8208;emitting materials. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115225), Wei Liu, Gangfeng Ouyang et&#8197;al. report a facile strategy for the synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating a coordinated anionic inorganic module with a neutral organic ligand molecule. By using this approach, a family of blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures has been prepared with high internal quantum yields up to 98&#8201;%.

         <title>Ultrafast Metal Electrodeposition Revealed by in&#8208;situ Optical Imaging and Theoretical Modeling towards Fast&#8208;charging Zn Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic Zn is a preferred anode material for rechargeable aqueous batteries towards smart grid and renewable energy storage. Understanding how metal nucleates and grows at aqueous Zn anode is a critical and challenging step to achieve full reversibility of Zn battery chemistry, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, by combining  in&#8208;situ  optical imaging and theoretical modeling, we uncover the critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of metallic Zn electrode, that is, the competition among crystallographic thermodynamics, kinetics, and Zn  2+  &#8208;ion diffusion. Moreover, steady&#8208;state Zn metal plating/stripping with Coulombic efficiency above 99% is achieved at 10&#8208;100 mA cm  &#8208;2  in a reasonably high concentration (3 M) ZnSO  4  electrolyte. Significantly, long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stable Zn metal electrode is realized with a depth of discharge of 66.7% under 50 mA cm  &#8208;2  in both Zn||Zn symmetrical cells and MnO  2  ||Zn full cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Targeted Delivery of an Immune Stimulant that Selectively Reactivates Exhausted CAR T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have demonstrated significant promise in suppressing hematopoietic cancers, their applications in treating solid tumors have been limited by onset of CAR T cell exhaustion that accompanies continuous CAR T cell exposure to tumor antigen. To address this limitation, we have exploited the abilities of recently designed universal CARs to bind fluorescein and internalize a fluorescein&#8208;TLR7 agonist conjugate by CAR&#8208;mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate here that anti&#8208;fluorescein CAR&#8208;mediated uptake of a fluorescein&#8208;TLR7&#8208;3 conjugate can reactivate exhausted CAR T cells, leading to dramatic reduction in T cell exhaustion markers (PD&#8208;1  +  Tim&#8208;3  +  ) and shrinkage of otherwise resistant tumors without inducing systemic activation of the immune system. We conclude that CAR T cell exhaustion can be reversed by administration of a CAR&#8208;targeted TLR7 agonist, thereby enabling the CAR T cells to successfully treat solid tumors without incurring the systemic toxicity that commonly accompanies administration of nontargeted TLR7 agonists.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular and Spin Structures of a Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Triradical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A through&#8208;space conjugated multi&#8208;phenalenyl triradical  1a  has been prepared and characterized. Partial occupancy of doubly degenerate molecular orbitals in  1a  leads to Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, creating a molecular skeleton in which  C2v  doublet states are lower in energy than undistorted  D3h  doublet and quartet states. Triradical  1a  exists in an acute form in the solution state, whereas it adopts a preferred obtuse form in the solid state. The results of the investigation show that these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted by thermal energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetics&#8208;Regulated Interfacial Selective Superassembly of Asymmetric Smart Nanovehicles with Tailored Topological Hollow Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hollow nanoparticles featuring tunable structures with spatial and chemical specificity are of fundamental interest. However, it remains a significant challenge to design and synthesize asymmetric nanoparticles with controllable topological hollow architecture. Here, a versatile kinetics&#8208;regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial selective superassembly strategy is demonstrated to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites (AHPCs) with tunable diameters, architectures and components. The size and number of patches on Janus nanoparticles can be precisely manipulated by the precursor and catalyst content. Notably, AHPCs exhibit excellent photothermal conversion performance under the irradiation of near infrared (NIR) laser. Thus, AHPCs are utilized as NIR light triggered nanovehicles and cargos can be controllably released. In brief, this versatile superassembly approach offers a streamlined and powerful toolset to design diverse asymmetric hollow porous composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Dual&#8208;Base&#8208;Enabled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Aryl Amidations: Application in the Synthesis of 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides with NH substrates employing nickel catalysts and organic amine bases represents an emergent strategy for the sustainable synthesis of (hetero)anilines. However, unlike protocols that rely on photoredox/electrochemical/reductant methods within Ni(I/III) cycles, the reaction steps that comprise a putative Ni(0/II) C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling cycle for a thermally promoted catalyst system using organic amine base have not been elucidated. Here we disclose an efficient new nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling of amides and 2&#8217;&#8208;(pseudo)halide&#8208;substituted acetophenones, for the first time where the (pseudo)halide is chloride or sulfonate, which makes use of the commercial bisphosphine ligand PAd2&#8208;DalPhos (  L4  ) in combination with an organic amine base/halide scavenger, leading to 4&#8208;quinolones. Room temperature stoichiometric experiments involving isolated Ni(0, I, and II) species support a Ni(0/II) pathway, where the combined action of DBU/NaTFA allows for room&#8208;temperature amide cross&#8208;couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Biodegradable Nanoagents Based on Lanthanide Nucleotide Self&#8208;Assemblies toward Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoagents, which simultaneously satisfy normal tissue clearance and tumor&#8208;specific responsive treatment, are highly attractive for precise cancer theranostics. Herein, we develop a unique template&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy for the exquisitely controlled synthesis of self&#8208;assembled lanthanide (Ln3+) nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with amorphous structure and tunable size from sub&#8208;5 nm to 105 nm. By virtue of the low&#8208;temperature (10 K) and high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy, the local site symmetry of Ln3+ in LNNPs is unraveled for the first time. The proposed LNNPs are further demonstrated to possess the ability for highly efficient loading and tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive release of doxorubicin. Particularly, sub&#8208;5 nm LNNPs not only exhibit excellent biocompatibility and predominant renal&#8208;clearance performance, but also enable efficient tumor retention. These findings reveal the great potential of LNNPs as a new generation of therapeutic platform to overcome the dilemma between efficient therapy and long&#8208;term toxicity of nanoagents for future clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Imaging of Chemical Activity on Gold Plates with Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Classical electrochemical characterization tools cannot avoid averaging between the active reaction sites and their support, thus obscuring their intrinsic roles. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemical techniques are thus highly demanded. Here, we demonstrate super&#8208;resolution imaging of Ru(bpy)  3  2+  based reactions on Au plates using single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy. By converting electrochemical signals into optical signals, we manage to achieve the ultimate sensitivity of single&#8208;entity chemistry that is directly resolving the single photons from individual electrochemical reactions. High spatial resolution, up to 37 nm, further enables mapping Au chemical activity and the reaction kinetics. The spatiotemporally resolved dynamic structure&#8208;activity relationship on Au plates shows that the restructuring of catalysts plays an important role in determining the reactivity. Our approach may empower gaining new insights towards evaluating and designing electrocatalytic systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Classical electrochemical characterization tools cannot avoid averaging between the active reaction sites and their support, thus obscuring their intrinsic roles. Single-molecule electrochemical techniques are thus highly demanded. Here, we demonstrate super-resolution imaging of Ru(bpy)  3  2+  based reactions on Au plates using single-molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy.

         <title>A &#8220;Blockchain&#8221; Synergy in Conductive Polymer&#8208;Filled Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;Free Li Plating/Stripping with High Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; matrix Li storage is proposed by utilizing the N&#8208;rich polypyrrole (PPy) as the &#8220;chain&#8221; to fill and interlink the &#8220;blocks&#8221; of MOF cavities. The lithiophilic PPy helps to guide fast infiltration/extrusion of Li+ ions and serve as the nucleation sites for isotropic Li deposition, while the MOF pores enable the compartmentalization of the otherwise bulk Li deposition and provide spatial confinement for accommodating 3D matrix Li storage.







Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries is severely hampered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and volume expansion on the metal anodes. Inspired by the &#8220;blockchain&#8221; concept in data mining, here we utilize a conductive polymer&#8208;filled metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as the lithium host, in which polypyrrole (PPy) serves as the &#8220;chain&#8221; to interlink Li &#8220;blocks&#8221; stored in the MOF pores. While the N&#8208;rich PPy guides fast Li+ infiltration/extrusion and serves as the nucleation sites for isotropic Li growth, the MOF pores compartmentalize bulk Li deposition for 3D matrix Li storage, leading to low&#8208;barrier and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping with superb Coulombic efficiency. The as&#8208;fabricated lithium&#8208;metal anodes operate over 700&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells, and 800 cycles at 1&#8197;C in full cells with a per&#8208;cycle capacity loss of only 0.017&#8201;%. This work might open a new chapter for Li&#8208;metal anode construction by introducing the concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; management of Li plating/stripping.

         <title>Generic Rules for Distinguishing Autophoretic Colloidal Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;diffusiophoretic motors slow down sharply with population density while self&#8208;electrophoretic motors maintain an almost constant speed regardless of their population density. Self&#8208;diffusiophoretic motors form continuously growing clusters, while self&#8208;electrophoretic motors form dynamic clusters with limited sizes.







Abstract
Distinguishing the operating mechanisms of nano&#8208; and micromotors powered by chemical gradients, i.e. &#8220;autophoresis&#8221;, holds the key for fundamental and applied reasons. In this article, we propose and experimentally confirm that the speeds of a self&#8208;diffusiophoretic colloidal motor scale inversely to its population density but not for self&#8208;electrophoretic motors, because the former is an ion source and thus increases the solution ionic strength over time while the latter does not. They also form clusters in visually distinguishable and quantifiable ways. This pair of rules is simple, powerful, and insensitive to the specific material composition, shape or size of a colloidal motor, and does not require any measurement beyond typical microscopy. These rules are not only useful in clarifying the operating mechanisms of typical autophoretic micromotors, but also in predicting the dynamics of unconventional ones that are yet to be experimentally realized, even those involving enzymes.

         <title>A Chemical Biology Toolbox Targeting the Intracellular Binding Site of CCR9: Fluorescent Ligands, New Drug Leads and PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the intracellular CCR9 antagonist vercirnon, we developed the first small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based fluorescent ligand targeting the intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) of a GPCR. This tool enabled binding studies via NanoBRET, fluorescence microscopy, and the discovery of a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To induce CCR9 degradation, we developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs.







Abstract
A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Starting from vercirnon, an intracellular C&#8722;C chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) antagonist and previous phase III clinical candidate for the treatment of Crohn's disease, we developed a chemical biology toolbox targeting the IABS of CCR9. We first synthesized a fluorescent ligand enabling equilibrium and kinetic binding studies via NanoBRET as well as fluorescence microscopy. Applying this molecular tool in a membrane&#8208;based setup and in living cells, we discovered a 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine analogue as a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To chemically induce CCR9 degradation, we then developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we succeeded in showing that our CCR9&#8208;PROTAC is able to reduce CCR9 levels, thereby offering an unprecedented approach to modulate GPCR activity.

         <title>Planar Chirality: A Mine for Catalysis and Structure Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the benefits of molecules exhibiting planar chirality have recently been recognized in different areas of chemistry, the shortage of available catalytic methods for generating planar chirality has precluded their use. This Minireview aims to highlight the infancy of the area and serve as a source of inspiration for the design of unconventional methods for the generation of three&#8208;dimensional complexity from accessible simple/linear molecules.







Abstract
Planar chirality is one of the most fascinating expressions of chirality, which is exploited by nature to lock three&#8208;dimensional chiral conformations and, more recently, by chemists to create new chiral reagents, catalysts, and functional organic materials. Nevertheless, the shortage of procedures able to induce and secure asymmetry during the generation of these unique chiral entities has dissuaded chemists from exploiting their structural properties. This Minireview intends to illustrate the limited but remarkable catalytic methods that have been reported for the production of planar chirality in strained molecules and serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new unconventional procedures, which are expected to appear in the near future.

         <title>Developing an Effective Glycan&#8208;Based Vaccine for Streptococcus Pyogenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infectious diseases are a human welfare threat. This Review outlines the structure&#8211;immunogenicity correlation of subunit vaccines developed against S.&#8197;pyogenes, highlighting the different glycotope constructs and carrier systems used as well as shedding light on some recent interventions which were developed to overcome the limitations of carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine development.







Abstract
Streptococcus pyogenes is a primary infective agent that causes approximately 700&#8197;million human infections each year, resulting in more than 500&#8201;000 deaths. Carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccines are proven to be one of the most promising subunit vaccine candidates, as the bacterial glycan pattern(s) are different from mammalian cells and show increased pathogen serotype conservancy than the protein components. In this Review we highlight reverse vaccinology for use in the development of subunit vaccines against S.&#8197;pyogenes, and report reproducible methods of carbohydrate antigen production, in addition to the structure&#8211;immunogenicity correlation between group&#8197;A carbohydrate epitopes and alternative vaccine antigen carrier systems. We also report recent advances used to overcome hurdles in carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine development.

In this Review we highlight reverse vaccinology for use in the development of subunit vaccines against S.&#8197;pyogenes, and report reproducible methods of carbohydrate antigen production, in addition to the structure&#8211;immunogenicity correlation between group&#8197;A carbohydrate epitopes and alternative vaccine antigen carrier systems. We also report recent advances used to overcome hurdles in carbohydrate-based vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Modification of Nano&#8208;Cu2O for Controlling CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to Ethylene and Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) with controllable production of important carbon resources was achieved by a surface modification strategy of nano&#8208;Cu2O catalysts. Through facet controlling the highest C2H4 selectivity among Cu2O&#8208;based catalysts was achieved, while the products were completely converted to syngas with an appropriate H2:CO ratio via a MOF coating on the surface of the nano&#8208;Cu2O.







Abstract
In the surroundings of carbon neutrality, nano&#8208;Cu2O is considered a promising catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR), whose improvements in product selectivity still require considerable efforts. Here, we present an efficient strategy for controlling the ECO2RR product by modifying the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O, i.e., by controlling the exposed facets via a reductant&#8208;controlled method to achieve the highest C2H4 selectivity (Faradic efficiency=74.1&#8201;%) for Cu2O&#8208;based catalysts in neutral electrolytes, and introducing a well&#8208;suited metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coating on the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O to obtain syngas completely with an appropriate H2:CO ratio. Detailed mechanism and key intermediate have been illustrated by DFT calculations. Our systematic strategy is expected to control the ECO2RR product, improve the selectivity, and provide a reliable method for CO2 management and the green production of important carbon resources.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Encoded Integration of Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is reported that integrates silica&#8208;metal (Au/Ag) heterostructures by programming the density and length of protruding dsDNA strands on a DNA origami template. The binding energy differences between silica/metal clusters and DNA molecules achieves a heterogeneous integration process.







Abstract
Integrating dissimilar materials at the nanoscale is crucial for modern electronics and optoelectronics. The structural DNA nanotechnology provides a universal platform for precision assembly of materials; nevertheless, heterogeneous integration of dissimilar materials with DNA nanostructures has yet to be explored. We report a DNA origami&#8208;encoded strategy for integrating silica&#8208;metal heterostructures. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal distinctive mechanisms for the binding and aggregation of silica and metal clusters on protruding double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) strands that are prescribed on the DNA origami template. In particular, the binding energy differences of silica/metal clusters and DNA molecules underlies the accessibilities of dissimilar material areas on DNA origami. By programming the densities and lengths of protruding dsDNA strands on DNA origami, silica and metal materials can be independently deposited at their predefined areas with a high vertical precision of 2&#8197;nm. We demonstrate the integration of silica&#8208;gold and silica&#8208;silver heterostructures with high site addressability. This DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy is thus applicable for integrating various types of dissimilar materials, which opens up new routes to bottom&#8208;up electronics.

         <title>Vanadium&#8208;Incorporated CoP2 with Lattice Expansion for Highly Efficient Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust V&#8722;CoP2 porous nanowire was fabricated by incorporating vanadium into a CoP2 lattice. The V incorporation results in an upshift of the d&#8208;band center, boosting HER activity. Meanwhile, V promotes the generation of a thicker Co3O4 layer with an oxygen vacancy that enhances the acidic OER stability. It presents a low voltage (1.47&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and remarkable stability toward acidic water splitting.







Abstract
A proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) in acidic medium is a hopeful scenario for hydrogen production using renewable energy, but the grand challenge lies in substituting noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Herein, a robust electrocatalyst of V&#8722;CoP2 porous nanowires arranged on a carbon cloth is successfully fabricated by incorporating vanadium into the CoP2 lattice. Structural characterizations and theoretical analysis indicate that lattice expansion of CoP2 caused by V incorporation results in the upshift of the d&#8208;band center, which is conducive to hydrogen adsorption for boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, V promotes surface reconstruction to generate a thicker Co3O4 layer with an oxygen vacancy that enhances acid&#8208;corrosion resistance and optimizes the adsorption of water and oxygen&#8208;containing species, thus improving activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Accordingly, it presents a superior acidic overall water splitting activity (1.47&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to Pt&#8722;C/CC||RuO2/CC (1.59&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and remarkable stability. This work proposes a new route to design efficient non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for PEMWE.

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Permeable and Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) Enrichable Cross&#8208;Linking Reagent to Advance In&#8197;Vivo Cross&#8208;Linking Mass Spectrometry</title>

A phosphonate&#8208;containing cross&#8208;linker, tBu&#8208;PhoX, has been developed that efficiently permeates various biological membranes and can be robustly enriched using routine immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). The optimized tBu&#8208;PhoX&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) system enables the time&#8208;efficient and detailed characterization of protein interaction landscapes in intact human cells.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) is an attractive method for the proteome&#8208;wide characterization of protein structures and interactions. Currently, the depth of in&#8197;vivo XL&#8208;MS studies is lagging behind the established applications to cell lysates, because cross&#8208;linking reagents that can penetrate intact cells and strategies to enrich cross&#8208;linked peptides lack efficiency. To tackle these limitations, we have developed a phosphonate&#8208;containing cross&#8208;linker, tBu&#8208;PhoX, that efficiently permeates various biological membranes and can be robustly enriched using routine immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. We have established a tBu&#8208;PhoX&#8208;based in&#8197;vivo XL&#8208;MS approach that enables cross&#8208;links in intact human cells to be identified in high numbers with substantially reduced analysis time. Collectively, the developed cross&#8208;linker and XL&#8208;MS approach pave the way for the comprehensive XL&#8208;MS characterization of living systems.

         <title>Moderated Basicity of Endohedral Amine Groups in an Octa&#8208;Cationic Self&#8208;Assembled Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endohedrally functionalized self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 cage complex with 12 internal amines in the cavity acts as an acid host, and shows differential basicity, moderated by the cage superstructure.







Abstract
A self&#8208;assembled FeII4L6 cage was synthesized with 12 internal amines in the cavity. The cage forms as the dodeca&#8208;ammonium salt, despite the cage carrying an overall 8+ charge at the metal centers, extracting protons from displaced water in the reaction. Despite this, the basicity of the internal amines is lower than their counterparts in free solution. The 12 amines have a sliding scale of basicity, with a &#8776;6&#8197;pKa unit difference between the first and last protons to be removed. This moderation of side&#8208;chain basicity in an active site is a hallmark of enzymatic catalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;Oligosaccharides through Versatile C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation of Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation of glycosides is disclosed. This saccharide assembly by C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation featured excellent site&#8208; and stereoselectivity and enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse C&#8208;disaccharides and C&#8208;trisaccharides.







Abstract
C&#8208;oligosaccharides are pharmacologically relevant because they are more hydrolysis&#8208;resistant than O&#8208;oligosaccharides. Despite indisputable advances, C&#8208;oligosaccharides continue to be underdeveloped, likely due to a lack of efficient and selective strategies for the assembly of the interglycosidic C&#8722;C linkages. In contrast, we, herein, report a versatile and robust strategy for the synthesis of structurally complex C&#8208;oligosaccharides via catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activations. Thus, a wealth of complex interglycosidic (2&#8594;1)&#8208; and (1&#8594;1)&#8208;C&#8208;oligosaccharides becomes readily available by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H glycoside glycosylation. The isolation of key palladacycle intermediates and experiments with isotopically&#8208;labeled compounds identified a trans&#8208;stereoselectivity for the C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation. The glycoside C(sp3)&#8722;H activation manifold was likewise exploited for the diversification of furanoses, pyranoses and disaccharides.

         <title>A Br&#248;nsted Acidic Gallium Hydride: Facile Interconversion of NNNN&#8208;Macrocycle Supported [GaI]+ and [GaIIIH]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of an NNNN&#8208;macrocycle chelated gallium(I) cation provides a rare dicationic gallium(III) hydride. This process is easily reversed by treatment of the Br&#248;nsted acidic (pKa=24.5) hydride with a neutral base. Similar facile redox cycling was not observed for analogous aluminium, indium, or thallium systems.







Abstract
Protonolysis of [Cp*M] (M=Ga, In, Tl) with [(Me4TACD)H][BAr4Me] (Me4TACD=N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane; [BAr4Me]&#8722;=[B{C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CH3)2}4]&#8722;) provided monovalent salts [(Me4TACD)M][BAr4Me], whereas [Cp*Al]4 yielded trivalent [(Me4TACD)AlH][BAr4Me]2. Protonation of [(Me4TACD)Ga][BAr4Me] with [Et3NH][BAr4Me] gave an unusually acidic (pKa(CH3CN)=24.5) gallium(III) hydride dication [(Me4TACD)GaH][BAr4Me]2. Deprotonation with IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;ylidene) returned [(Me4TACD)Ga][BAr4Me]. These reversible processes occur with formal two&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction of gallium. DFT calculations suggest that gallium(I) protonation is facilitated by strong coordination of the tetradentate ligand, which raises the HOMO energy. High nuclear charge of [(Me4TACD)GaH]2+ facilitates hydride&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer during deprotonation. Attempts to prepare a gallium(III) dihydride cation resulted in spontaneous dehydrogenation to [(Me4TACD)Ga]+.

         <title>Deoxygenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aromatic Amides with Polyfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An attractive deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of amides with polyfluoroarenes was successfully achieved. Aromatic amides act as readily available carbene precursors through a Sm/SmI2&#8208;mediated deoxygenation process, and the insertion of the carbene into the C&#8722;H bond of polyfluoroarene affords architecturally complex and functionally diverse &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines in a single step.

Considering the ubiquitous nature and ready synthesis of amides, and the great significance of organofluorine&#8208;containing species, the cross&#8208;coupling of amides and polyfluoroarenes, leading to new carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming methodologies, would find useful applications in synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and rapid generation of molecular diversity. Herein, we present a novel synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines via Sm/SmI2&#8208;mediated deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of aromatic amides with polyfluoroarenes through direct C&#8722;H functionalization. The structural and functional diversity of these readily available precursors provides a versatile and flexible strategy for the streamlined synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, a novel plausible mechanism of the &#945;&#8208;aminocarbene&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H insertion has been revealed, which may stimulate future work for the development of novel methods in amine synthesis.

         <title>Rational Design of ZnMn2O4 Quantum Dots in a Carbon Framework for Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnMn2O4 quantum dots homogeneously embedded in a carbon framework (ZMO QD@C) are prepared by in&#8208;situ electrochemically inducing a Mn&#8208;MIL&#8208;100&#8208;derived precursor. Owing to the formation of Mn&#8722;O&#8722;C bonds at the interface between the ZMO QDs and the carbon matrix, the composite reveals superior cycling stability in a pure ZnSO4 electrolyte by inhibiting the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and the disproportional reaction of the discharge product.







Abstract
Manganese oxides are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high energy density and low cost. However, in their discharging processes, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and Mn3+ disproportionation often lead to irreversible structural transformation and Mn2+ dissolution, deteriorating the cycling stability of ZIBs. Herein, ZnMn2O4 quantum dots (ZMO QDs) were introduced into a porous carbon framework by in&#8208;situ electrochemically inducing Mn&#8208;MIL&#8208;100&#8208;derived Mn3O4 quantum dots and the carbon composite. In such ZMO QDs and carbon composite, the quantum dot structure endows ZnMn2O4 with a shorter ion diffusion route and more active sites for Zn2+. The conductive carbon framework is beneficial to the fast transport of electrons. Furthermore, at the interface between the ZMO QDs and the carbon matrix, the Mn&#8722;O&#8722;C bonds are formed. They can effectively suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and manganese dissolution of discharge products. Therefore, Zn/ZMO QD@C batteries display remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF)&#8208;Based Multifunctional Cargo Vehicle for Reactive&#8208;Gas Delivery and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifaceted metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can act as a food truck to adsorb, store, and deliver toxic gases to organic reactions. We showcase the versatility of MOFs by employing them as a safe&#8208;delivery tool, while simultaneously catalyzing organic reactions, producing yields and conversions that are comparable to the reactions utilizing the toxic gases directly.







Abstract
The efficient delivery of reactive and toxic gaseous reagents to organic reactions was studied using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The simultaneous cargo vehicle and catalytic capabilities of several MOFs were probed for the first time using the examples of aromatization, aminocarbonylation, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions. These reactions highlight that MOFs can serve a dual role as a gas cargo vehicle and a catalyst, leading to product formation with yields similar to reactions employing pure gases. Furthermore, the MOFs can be recycled without sacrificing product yield, while simultaneously maintaining crystallinity. The reported findings were supported crystallographically and spectroscopically (e.g., diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy), foreshadowing a pathway for the development of multifunctional MOF&#8208;based reagent&#8208;catalyst cargo vessels for reactive gas reagents as an attractive alternative to the use of toxic pure gases or gas generators.

         <title>Modular Halogenation, &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation, and Acylation by a Remarkably Versatile Polyketide Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oocydin&#8208;type complex polyketides feature a wide array of structural moieties, resembling the versatility of a Swiss army knife. These include a vinyl chloride, vicinal bis&#8208;oxygens, an O&#8208;acetylation, and other features. Here it is shown that a functionally greatly expanded polyketide synthase with numerous non&#8208;canonical features assembles these compounds entirely in a modular fashion.







Abstract
Bacterial multimodular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large enzymatic assembly lines that synthesize many bioactive natural products of therapeutic relevance. While PKS catalysis is mostly based on fatty acid biosynthetic principles, polyketides can be further diversified by post&#8208;PKS enzymes. Here, we characterized a remarkably versatile trans&#8208;acyltransferase (trans&#8208;AT) PKS from Serratia that builds structurally complex macrolides via more than ten functionally distinct PKS modules. In the oocydin PKS, we identified a new oxygenation module that &#945;&#8208;hydroxylates polyketide intermediates, a halogenating module catalyzing backbone &#947;&#8208;chlorination, and modular O&#8208;acetylation by a thioesterase&#8208;like domain. These results from a single biosynthetic assembly line highlight the expansive biochemical repertoire of trans&#8208;AT PKSs and provide diverse modular tools for engineered biosynthesis from a close relative of E.&#8197;coli.

         <title>Organoplatinum(II) Cruciform: A Versatile Building Block to Fabricate 2D Microcrystals with Full&#8208;Color and White Phosphorescence and Anisotropic Photon Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controllable preparations of two&#8208;dimensional phosphorescent crystals remain a challenging task. In stark contrast to the conventional one&#8208;dimensional assemblies of square&#8208;planar platinum complexes, organoplatinum(II) complexes with a cruciform shape form two&#8208;dimensional microcrystals with full&#8208;color and white phosphorescence by unique molecular stackings, opening a new avenue for the preparations of phosphorescent micro/nanostructures for advanced photonic applications.







Abstract
Conventional square&#8208;planar platinum complexes typically form one&#8208;dimensional assemblies as a result of unidirectional metallophilic and/or &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; intermolecular interactions. Organoplatinum(II) complexes with a cruciform shape are presented herein to construct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) microcrystals with full&#8208;color and white phosphorescence. These 2D crystals show unique monocomponent &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking, from either the cyclometalating or noncyclometalating ligand, and the bicomponent alternate &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking from both ligands along different facet directions. Anisotropic tri&#8208;directional waveguiding is further implemented on a single hexagonal microcrystal. These results demonstrate the great capability of the organoplatinum(II) cruciform as a general platform to fabricate 2D phosphorescent micro&#8208;/nanocrystals for advanced photonic applications.

         <title>Shell&#8208;like Xenon Nano&#8208;Traps within Angular Anion&#8208;Pillared Layered Porous Materials for Boosting Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shell&#8208;like nano traps for xenon were prepared by exploiting the shape and size of tetrahedral MO42&#8722; pillar ligands. This approach gives a high degree of confinement and multiple interactions in close proximity which enhance the affinity towards Xe.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of xenon (Xe) and krypton (Kr) is a promising technique but remains a daunting challenge since they are atomic gases without dipole or quadruple moments. Herein we report a strategy for fabricating angular anion&#8208;pillared materials featuring shell&#8208;like Xe nano&#8208;traps, which provide a cooperative effect conferred by the pore confinement and multiple specific interactions. The perfect permanent pore channel (4&#8211;5&#8197;&#197;) of Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2MO4 (M=Cr, Mo, W) can host Xe atoms efficiently even at ultra&#8208;low concentration (400&#8197;ppm Xe), showing the second&#8208;highest selectivity of 30.2 in Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2WO4 and excellent Xe adsorption capacity in Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2CrO4 (15.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Crystallography studies and DFT&#8208;D calculations revealed the energy favorable binding sites and angular anions enable the synergism between optimal pore size and polar porosity for boosting Xe affinity. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrated three MOFs as efficient adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation.

         <title>Chemiluminescent 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane Iridium Complexes for Near&#8208;Infrared Oxygen Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium(III)&#8208;based chemiluminescent oxygen sensors are described. Energy transfer from the chemiexcited benzoate to the oxygen&#8208;sensitive IrIII sub&#8208;unit results in emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. The corresponding O2&#8208;dependent responses have been exploited for achieving in vitro O2 imaging as well as live animal imaging.







Abstract
Chemiluminescent iridium&#8208;based sensors which demonstrate oxygen&#8194;dependent responses have been developed. The molecular probes, named IrCL&#8208;1, IrCL&#8208;2 and IrCL&#8208;3 consist of oxygen&#8208;sensitive iridium complexes attached to a spiroadamantane 1,2&#8194;dioxetane and operate via energy transfer from the chemiexcited benzoate to the corresponding iridium(III) complex. Complexing the iridium(III) center with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands results in emission in the biologically relevant, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. All probes demonstrate varying oxygen tolerance, with IrCL&#8208;1 being the most oxygen sensitive. These probes have been further utilized for in vitro ratiometric imaging of oxygen, as well as for intraperitoneal, intramuscular and intratumoral imaging in live mice. To our knowledge, these are the first iridium&#8208;based chemiluminescent probes that have been employed for in vitro ratiometric oxygen sensing, and for in vivo tumor imaging.

         <title>p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization Induced by a Monodispersed Ga Site on a Pt3Mn Nanocatalyst Boosts Ethanol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monodispersed Ga site tailored Pt3Mn nanocatalyst based on high&#8208;indexed facets was constructed and shows excellent EOR performance with high activity and selectivity towards the C2 reaction pathway, which was attributed to the unconventional p&#8211;d orbital hybridization and atomic&#8208;level interface synergy.







Abstract
Constructing monodispersed metal sites in heterocatalysis is an efficient strategy to boost their catalytic performance. Herein, a new strategy using monodispersed metal sites to tailor Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts is addressed by engineering unconventional p&#8211;d orbital hybridization. Thus, monodispersed Ga on Pt3Mn nanocrystals (Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn) with high&#8208;indexed facets was constructed for the first time to drive ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR). Strikingly, the Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn nanocatalyst shows an enhanced EOR performance with achieving 8.41&#8197;times of specific activity than that of Pt/C. The electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results and theoretical calculations disclose that the Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn nanocatalyst featuring an unconventional p&#8211;d orbital hybridization not only promote the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;breaking and rapid oxidation of &#8208;OH of ethanol, but also inhibit the generation of poisonous CO intermediate species. This work discloses a promising strategy to construct a novel nanocatalysts tailored by monodispersed metal site as efficient fuel cell catalysts.

         <title>Mapping the Morphological Landscape of Oligomeric Di&#8208;block Peptide&#8211;Polymer Amphiphiles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomeric di&#8208;block peptide&#8211;polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) provide a modular platform for sophisticated higher&#8208;order assembly, but tools to predict assembly behavior from molecular structure are limited. By systematically characterizing PPAs composed of oligo(ethyl acrylate) and random coil peptides, we outline general design principles of PPAs showing how oligomer length, dispersity, and peptide hydrophilicity impact the morphological distribution.







Abstract
Peptide&#8211;polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) are tunable hybrid materials that achieve complex assembly landscapes by combining the sequence&#8208;dependent properties of peptides with the structural diversity of polymers. Despite their promise as biomimetic materials, determining how polymer and peptide properties simultaneously affect PPA self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. We herein present a systematic study of PPA structure&#8211;assembly relationships. PPAs containing oligo(ethyl acrylate) and random&#8208;coil peptides were used to determine the role of oligomer molecular weight, dispersity, peptide length, and charge density on self&#8208;assembly. We observed that PPAs predominantly formed spheres rather than anisotropic particles. Oligomer molecular weight and peptide hydrophilicity dictated morphology, while dispersity and peptide charge affected particle size. These key benchmarks will facilitate the rational design of PPAs that expand the scope of biomimetic functionality within assembled soft materials.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Deuteration of Benzylic C&#8211;H Bonds via Reversible &#951;6&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel rhodium&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange of primary, secondary, and tertiary benzylic C&#8722;H bonds by means of an &#951;6&#8208;coordination strategy is reported. The method, which features high regioselectivity and stereoretention, shows broad functional group tolerance and has been used in late&#8208;stage labeling of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
We report a convenient method for benzylic H/D exchange of a wide variety of substrates bearing primary, secondary, or tertiary C&#8722;H bonds via a reversible &#951;6&#8208;coordination strategy. A doubly cationic [CpCF3RhIII]2+ catalyst that serves as an arenophile facilitates deprotonation of inert benzylic hydrogen atoms (pKa&gt;40 in DMSO) without affecting other hydrogen atoms, such as those on aromatic rings or in &#945;&#8208;positions of carboxylate groups. Notably, the H/D exchange reactions feature high stereoretention. We demonstrated the potential utility of this method by using it for deuterium labeling of ten pharmaceuticals and their analogues.

&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;40 in DMSO) without affecting other hydrogen atoms, such as those on aromatic rings or in &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-positions of carboxylate groups. Notably, the H/D exchange reactions feature high stereoretention. We demonstrated the potential utility of this method by using it for deuterium labeling of ten pharmaceuticals and their analogues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Confined Intervention of Cellular Senescence by a Lysosomal Metabolism Targeting Molecular Prodrug for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Senotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially confined prodrug activation strategy is reported as a new paradigm of senotherapy. The prodrug is designed to target the defective lysosome metabolism, a unique yet ubiquitous event during cellular senescence, instead of dynamically changing and highly heterogeneous senescence&#8208;related signaling pathways employed in conventional methods, thereby fulfilling robust specificity and broad&#8208;spectrum activity towards senescent cells.







Abstract
Specific intervention of senescent cells (SnCs) is emerging as a powerful means to counteract aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Canonical methods are generally designed to target SnC&#8208;associated signaling pathways, which are however dynamically changing and highly heterogeneous in SnCs, significantly limiting the effectiveness. Here, we present a tailor&#8208;made molecular prodrug targeting lysosome dysfunction, a unique feature shared by virtually all types of SnCs. The prodrug comprises three modules all targeting the altered lysosomal programs in SnCs, namely, a recognizing unit towards the elevated lysosome content, a linker cleavable by the activated lysosomal enzyme, and a lysosomotropic agent targeting the increased lysosomal membrane sensitivity. This spatially confined design enables killing broad&#8208;spectrum SnCs, with high specificity over non&#8208;SnCs. Along with in&#8197;vivo benefits, this work offers a way to significantly expand the applicability of senotherapy in a wide range of diseases.

         <title>Fluorescence Colour Control in Perylene&#8208;Labeled Polymer Chains Trapped by Nanotextured Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical tweezer technique using nanotextured Si (black&#8208;Si) can efficiently trap polymer chains. By increasing the laser intensity, the local concentration of perylene&#8208;labelled water&#8208;soluble polymer chains increased inside the trapping potential. Accordingly, the excimer fluorescence of perylene increased while the monomer fluorescence decreased. Based on the behaviour, we can control the fluorescence colour; blue, green, yellow&#8208;green, yellow, and orange.







Abstract
The ability to modulate, tune, and control fluorescence colour has attracted much attention in photonics&#8208;related research fields. Thus far, it has been impossible to achieve fluorescence colour control (FCC) for material with a fixed structure, size, surrounding medium, and concentration. Here, we propose a novel approach to FCC using optical tweezers. We demonstrate an optical trapping technique using nanotextured Si (black&#8208;Si) that can efficiently trap polymer chains. By increasing the laser intensity, the local concentration of perylene&#8208;labelled water&#8208;soluble polymer chains increased inside the trapping potential. Accordingly, the excimer fluorescence of perylene increased while the monomer fluorescence decreased, evidenced by a fluorescence colour change from blue to orange. Using nanostructure&#8208;assisted optical tweezing, we demonstrate control of the relative intensity ratio of fluorescence of the two fluorophores, thus showing remote and reversible FCC of the polymer assembly.

         <title>Light/Force&#8208;Sensitive 0D Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites: From Highly Efficient Blue Afterglow to White Phosphorescence with Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 0D lead&#8208;free perovskites (PA6InCl9 and PA4InCl7) exhibit ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) sensitive to light and force, respectively. The activated PA6InCl9 shows highly efficient blue RTP with a &#934;P of 43&#8201;% and a lifetime of 1.2&#8197;s. After the introduction of Sb3+, pure white phosphorescence with near&#8208;unity quantum yield and a color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) of near 90 can be achieved through the combination of blue RTP of PA6InCl9 and orange RTP of Sb3+.







Abstract
Herein, new types of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) perovskites (PA6InCl9 and PA4InCl7) with blue room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) were obtained from InCl3 and aniline hydrochloride. These are highly sensitive to external light and force stimuli. The RTP quantum yield of PA6InCl9 can be enhanced from 25.2&#8201;% to 42.8&#8201;% upon illumination. Under mechanical force, PA4InCl7 exhibits a phase transform to PA6InCl9, thus boosting ultralong RTP with a lifetime up to 1.2&#8197;s. Furthermore, white and orange pure RTP with a quantum yield close to 100&#8201;% can be realized when Sb3+ was introduced into PA6InCl9. The white pure phosphorescence with a color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) close to 90 consists of blue RTP of PA6InCl9 and orange RTP of Sb3+. Thus, this work not only overcomes long&#8208;standing problems of low quantum yield and short lifetime of blue RTP, but also obtains high&#8208;efficiency white RTP. It provides a feasible method to realize near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency and has great application potential in the fields of optical devices and smart materials.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Three&#8208;Dimensional MXene/Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites for High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for synthesizing uniform 3D MXene/MOF composites was proposed. The metal ions cross&#8208;linked with the surface termination groups of Ti3C2TX nanosheets, which destroyed the electrostatic repulsion between the nanosheets, and thereafter became the nucleation site for the in situ growth of MOF particles on Ti3C2TX nanosheets. The composites combined the advantages of MOF and MXene to enhance stability and improve conductivity.







Abstract
In this study, we propose a versatile method for synthesizing uniform three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes)/metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) composites (Ti3C2TX/Cu&#8208;BTC, Ti3C2TX/Fe,Co&#8208;PBA, Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;8, and Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67) that combine the advantages of MOFs and MXenes to enhance stability and improve conductivity. Subsequently, 3D hollow Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67/CoV2O6 composites with excellent electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;transport properties derived from Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67 were synthesized. The specific capacitance of the Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67/CoV2O6 electrode was 285.5&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much higher than that of the ZIF&#8208;67 and Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67 electrode. This study opens a new avenue for the design and synthesis of MXene/MOF composites and complex hollow structures with tailorable structures and compositions for various applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of Recombinant Spider Silk Janus Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus fibers were created by applying two different recombinant spider silk constructs that were electrospun in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement. Subsequent gold coupling via thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry allowed for highly selective deposition of a conductive gold layer only on the cysteine&#8208;modified silk protein side. The study demonstrates the high potential of tailored silk design to generate multi&#8208;functional nanomaterials for various applications.







Abstract
Biotechnological production is a powerful tool to design materials with customized properties. The aim of this work was to apply designed spider silk proteins to produce Janus fibers with two different functional sides. First, functionalization was established through a cysteine&#8208;modified silk protein, ntagCyseADF4(&#954;16). After fiber spinning, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were coupled via thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry. Significantly reduced electrical resistivity indicated sufficient loading density of AuNPs on such fiber surfaces. Then, Janus fibers were electrospun in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement, with &#8220;non&#8208;functional&#8221; eADF4(C16) on the one and &#8220;functional&#8221; ntagCyseADF4(&#954;16) on the other side. Post&#8208;treatment was established to render silk fibers insoluble in water. Subsequent AuNP binding was highly selective on the ntagCyseADF4(&#954;16) side demonstrating the potential of such silk&#8208;based systems to realize complex bifunctional structures with spatial resolutions in the nano scale.

         <title>Functional Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Acetylene Batteries for Electricity Generation and Electrochemical Acetylene Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aqueous Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery is reported, which not only switches energy&#8208;consuming acetylene removal to electricity generation, but also reduces acetylene to ethylene through a unique discharge mechanism: C2H2+Zn+H2O&#8594;C2H4+ZnO. The Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery under a pure acetylene stream manifests an open&#8208;circuit potential of 1.14&#8197;V and a peak power density of 2.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For crude ethylene, the Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery produces polymer&#8208;grade ethylene.







Abstract
The available processes for removing acetylene impurities from crude ethylene are tremendously energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we demonstrate a novel aqueous Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery, which not only switches energy&#8208;consuming acetylene removal to electricity generation, but also reduces acetylene to ethylene through a unique discharge mechanism: C2H2+Zn+H2O&#8594;C2H4+ZnO. Under a pure acetylene stream, this Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery exhibits an open circuit potential of 1.14&#8197;V and a peak power density of 2.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which exceed those of reported Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries. Even for simulated crude ethylene, the Zn&#8211;C2H2 battery manifests an acetylene conversion of 99.97&#8201;% and continuously produces polymer&#8208;grade ethylene with only &#8776;3&#8197;ppm acetylene during a long&#8208;term discharge operation. Such a functional battery is universally appliable for reducing other alkynes and generating electricity. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for green ethylene purification and the design of functional batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adjusting Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Capture of Trace Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adjusting metal&#8211;organic framework has been proposed for capturing trace Xe and Kr from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior endows ATC&#8208;Cu the highest Xe and Kr capacity at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, as well as a benchmark for capturing low concentration Xe and Kr. The mechanism of the self&#8208;adjusting behavior has been studied through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments and computational calculations.







Abstract
The capture of the xenon and krypton from nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas is essential to the treatment of radioactive waste. Although various porous materials have been employed to capture Xe and Kr, the development of high&#8208;performance adsorbents capable of trapping Xe/Kr at very low partial pressure as in the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a self&#8208;adjusting metal&#8208;organic framework based on multiple weak binding interactions to capture trace Xe and Kr from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior of ATC&#8208;Cu and its mechanism have been visualized by the in&#8208;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and theoretical calculations. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior endows ATC&#8208;Cu unprecedented uptake capacities of 2.65 and 0.52&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Xe and Kr respectively at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, as well as the record Xe capture capability from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. Our work not only provides a benchmark Xe adsorbent but proposes a new route to construct smart materials for efficient separations.

         <title>Highly Accurate Synthesis of Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles by Dendron&#8208;assembled Supramolecular Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Dendron&#8208;assembled supramolecules&#8221; constructed by self&#8208;assembly based on coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry serve as flexibly designable supramolecular huge templates and demonstrate the first&#8208;ever precise synthesis of quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials. This concept for the creation of larger inorganic nanomaterials using even larger organic molecules will provide a crucial key to exploring the last frontier in nanoscience.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm) have been predicted to exhibit unique properties originating from the gray structures considered both bulk solids and molecules, while their synthesis is extremely difficult. The present study describes a new template synthesis method for quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanosized materials using a combination of coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry. Utilizing self&#8208;assembly of guest basic phenylazomethine dendron units onto host acidic core units with six tritylium cations, the dendron&#8208;assembled supramolecules were constructed easily and quantitatively without costly techniques. This huge supramolecular capsule accumulating multiple acidic rhodium salts in its basic ligands enabled a precise synthesis of rhodium particles via formation of multinuclear complexes. The obtained particles (Rh84, &#8776;1.5&#8197;nm) have particle sizes within 1&#8211;3&#8197;nm range and were larger than conventional sub&#8208;nanoparticles (Rh14, &#8776;0.85&#8197;nm), therefore the precise template synthesis of quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles was successfully demonstrated.

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Orotate and Pyruvate Suggestive of Common Protometabolic Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prebiotic synthesis of the nucleobase orotate, and the citric acid cycle intermediate pyruvate, proceeds in a single pot from two small glycine derivatives, hydantoin and glyoxylate, under mild aqueous conditions. These findings support a co&#8208;evolution of pathways to core protometabolites and nucleic acid building blocks in a common environment. Additionally, open&#8208;chain thiohydantoin derivatives enable a synthesis of thioorotate nucleosides.







Abstract
A reaction between two prebiotically plausible building blocks, hydantoin and glyoxylate, generates both the nucleobase orotate, a precursor of biological pyrimidines, and pyruvate, a core metabolite in the citric acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis.

     alt="A Plausible Prebiotic One-Pot Synthesis of Orotate and Pyruvate Suggestive of Common Protometabolic Pathways"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prebiotic synthesis of the nucleobase orotate, and the citric acid cycle intermediate pyruvate, proceeds in a single pot from two small glycine derivatives, hydantoin and glyoxylate, under mild aqueous conditions. These findings support a co-evolution of pathways to core protometabolites and nucleic acid building blocks in a common environment. Additionally, open-chain thiohydantoin derivatives enable a synthesis of thioorotate nucleosides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reaction between two prebiotically plausible building blocks, hydantoin and glyoxylate, generates both the nucleobase orotate, a precursor of biological pyrimidines, and pyruvate, a core metabolite in the citric acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis. The reaction proceeds in water to provide significant yields of the two widely divergent chemical motifs. Additionally, the reaction of thiohydantoin and glyoxylate produces thioorotate in high yield under neutral aqueous conditions. The use of an open-chain thiohydantoin derivative also enables the potential pre-positioning of a nucleosidic bond prior to the synthesis of an orotate nucleoside. The observation that diverse building blocks of modern metabolism can be produced in a single reaction pot, from common reactants under mild conditions, supports the plausibility of orthogonal chemistries operating at the origins of chemical evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deeper Insight into the Role of Organic Ammonium Cations in Reducing Surface Defects of the Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism to understand the role of organic ammonium salt (OAS) in improving performances of perovskite solar cells is proposed. Besides passivating defects by itself, OAS also augments the passivation effect of excess PbI2 on the surface of the perovskite film by dispersing it into a discontinuous layer. Furthermore, using PbI2 nanosheets fully dispersed in advance boosts the efficiency to 23.14&#8201;%.







Abstract
Organic ammonium salts (OASs) have been widely used to passivate perovskite defects. The passivation mechanism is usually attributed to coordination of OASs with unpaired lead or halide ions, yet ignoring their interaction with excess PbI2 on the perovskite film. Herein, we demonstrate that OASs not only passivate defects by themselves, but also redistribute excess aggregated PbI2 into a discontinuous layer, augmenting its passivation effect. Moreover, alkyl OAS is more powerful to disperse PbI2 than a F&#8208;containing one, leading to better passivation and device efficiency because F atoms restrict the intercalation of OAS into PbI2 layers. Inspired by this mechanism, exfoliated PbI2 nanosheets are adopted to provide better dispersity of PbI2, further boosting the efficiency to 23.14&#8201;%. Our finding offers a distinctive understanding of the role of OASs in reducing perovskite defects, and a route to choosing an OAS passivator by considering substitution effects rather than by trial and error.

         <dc:description>
A radical transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free 1&#8208;fluorosulfonyl&#8208;2&#8208;alkynylation of unactivated alkenes with alkynyl sulfonyl fluorides as radical traps and FSO2&#8208;radical precursors is presented. The reaction features high atom economy, broad functional group tolerance, allows the synthesis of quaternary C&#8208;centers and installs a sulfonyl fluoride moiety, which can be conveniently diversified via SuFEx click chemistry.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have found widespread use in chemical biology and drug discovery. The development of synthetic methods for the introduction of the sulfonyl fluoride moiety is therefore of importance. Herein, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes via FSO2&#8208;radical addition with subsequent vicinal alkynylation to access &#946;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;fluorosulfonylalkanes is presented. Alkynyl sulfonyl fluorides are introduced as highly valuable bifunctional radical trapping reagents that also serve as FSO2&#8208;radical precursors. The &#946;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;fluorosulfonylalkanes obtained in these transformations can be readily diversified by using SuFEx click chemistry to obtain sulfonates and sulfonamides.

         <title>Dehydrated UiO&#8208;66(SH)2: The Zr&#8208;O Cluster and Its Photocatalytic Role Mimicking the Biological Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports a dehydrated Zr&#8208;based MOF UiO&#8208;66(SH)  2  as a visible light driven photocatalyst to mimic the biological N  2  fixation process. The  15  N  2  and other control&#8208;experiments demonstrated that the new photocatalyst is highly efficient in converting N  2  to ammonia. In&#8208;situ TGA, XPS, EXAFS etc. and first&#8208;principles simulations were used to demonstrate the role of the thermal treatment and the changes of the local structures around Zr due to the dehydration. It was shown that the dehydration opened a gate for the entry of N  2  molecules into the [Zr  6  O  6  ] cluster where the strong N&#8801;N bond was broken stepwise by &#956;&#8208;N&#8208;Zr type interactions driven by the photoelectrons aided by the protonation. This mechanism was discussed in comparison with the Lowe&#8208;Thorneley mechanism proposed for the MoFe nitrogenase, and with emphasis on the [Zr  6  O  6  ] cluster effect and the leading role of photoelectrons over the protonation. The results shed new light on understanding the catalytic mechanism of biological N  2  fixation and open a new way to fix N  2  under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Advanced electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells are strongly desired owing to the higher energy efficiency. Herein, Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets (Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs) have been successfully fabricated via one&#8208;step approach. These Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs feature unique electronic and geometrical structure, in which unconventional  p&#8208;d  hybridization interaction and tensile strain effect co&#8208;exist. Compared with commercial Pd/C and Pd NSs catalysts, Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs display 5.5 (6.6) and 2.5 (2.6) folds enhancement of specific (mass) activity for EG oxidation reaction (EGOR). Especially, the optimum C1 pathway selectivity of Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs reaches 44.3%, illustrating the superior C&#8211;C Bond cleavage ability. Electrochemical in situ FTIR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate extraordinary p&#8208;d hybridization interaction and tensile strain effect could effectively reduce the activation energy of C&#8211;C bond breaking and accelerate CO* oxidation, boosting the complete oxidation of EG and improving the catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8211;N Axially Chiral Indoles and Pyrroles by De Novo Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first highly atroposelective construction of N&#8208;N axially chiral indole scaffolds were established via a new strategy of de novo ring formation. This strategy makes use of the organocatalytic asymmetric Paal&#8208;Knorr reaction of well&#8208;designed N&#8208;aminoindoles with 1,4&#8208;diketones, thus affording high yields for N&#8208;pyrrolylindoles with excellent atroposelectivities (up to 98% yield, 96% ee). In addition, this strategy is applicable for the atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;N axially chiral bispyrroles (up to 98% yield, 97% ee). More importantly, such N&#8208;N axially chiral heterocycles can be converted into chiral organocatalysts with applications in asymmetric catalysis, and some molecules display potent anticancer activities. This work not only provides a new strategy for the atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;N axially chiral molecules but also offers a new member of the N&#8208;N atropisomer family with promising applications in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissection of Light&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation at a Highly Active Iron Porphyrin: Insights in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron porphyrins are among the best molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction reaction. Powering these catalysts with the help of photosensitizers comes along with a couple of unsolved challenges that need to be addressed with much vigor. We have designed an iron porphyrin catalyst decorated with urea functions (  UrFe  ) acting as a multipoint hydrogen bonding scaffold towards the CO  2  substrate. We found a spectacular photocatalytic activity reaching unreported TONs and TOFs as high as 7270 and 3720 h  &#8208;1  respectively. While the Fe  0  redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, we show here that the Fe  I  species is already involved in the CO  2  activation which represents the rate determining step in the photocatalytic cycle. The urea functions help to dock the CO  2  upon photocatalysis. DFT calculations bring support to our experimental findings that constitute a new paradigm in the catalytic reduction of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Indolenine and Indoline Ring Systems by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomatized indole derivatives bearing a C3&#8208; or C2stereocenter exist ubiquitously in natural products and biologically active molecules. Despite remarkable advances in their chemical synthesis, stereoselective and  regio  &#8208;divergent methods are still in a high demand. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric spiroannulation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles with internal alkynes has been developed for the efficient construction of indoline structures with a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. Stereospecific aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement of these indoline derivatives under acidic conditions afforded indolenine products bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter, where the selectivity for the rearranging group could be controlled by the reaction sequence. The asymmetric spiroannulation together with the subsequent aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement enabled a divergent access to dearomatized indole derivatives with either a C3&#8208; or a C2quaternary stereocenter.</dc:description>

         <title>Intercalation&#8208;Activated Layered MoO3 Nanobelts as Biodegradable Nanozymes for Tumor&#8208;Specific Photo&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The existence of natural van der Waals gaps in layered materials allows them to be easily intercalated with varying guest species, offering an appealing strategy to optimize their physicochemical properties and application performance. Herein, we report the activation of layered MoO3 nanobelts via aqueous intercalation as an efficient biodegradable nanozyme for tumor&#8208;specific photo&#8208;enhanced catalytic therapy. The long MoO3 nanobelts are grinded and then intercalated with Na+ and H2O to obtain the short Na+/H2O co&#8208;intercalated MoO3 nanobelts (NH&#8208;MoO3). In contrast to the inert MoO3 nanobelts, the NH&#8208;MoO3 nanobelts exhibit excellent enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity for generation of reactive oxygen species, which can be further enhanced by the photothermal effect under a 1064 nm laser irradiation. Thus, after bovine serum albumin modification, the NH&#8208;MoO3 nanobelts can efficiently kill cancer cells in vitro and eliminate tumors in vivo facilitating with 1064 nm laser irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphonate/Phosphine Oxide Dyad Additive for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additive plays critical role for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we report a novel phosphonate/phosphine oxide dyad molecular additive (PE&#8208;TPPO), with unique dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, to boost the device efficiency of metal&#8208;halide perovskites. In addition to the defect passivation effect of the phosphine oxide group to enhance the photoluminescence intensity and homogeneity of perovskite film, the phosphonate group with strong electron affinity can capture the injected electrons to increase local carrier concentration and accelerate carrier radiative recombination in electroluminescence process. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, quasi&#8208;two dimensional green PeLEDs modified by this dyad additive exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency, current efficiency, and power efficiency of 25.1%, 100.5 cd/A, and 98.7 lm/W, which are among the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies.</dc:description>

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Platinum Supernanoparticles for Urinary Microfluidic Monitoring of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and there is an increasing need for versatile tools to enable sensitive, simple and early cancer monitoring. Here, we report platinum supernanoparticles as an exogenous nanosensor which can dissociate into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters (PtNCs) under tumor&#8208;specific hypoxia conditions. The resulting PtNCs can be filtered through the kidney as urinary reporters to be quantified by a companion volumetric bar&#8208;chart chip (V&#8208;Chip) for point&#8208;of&#8208;care analysis. The V&#8208;Chip signals of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and its lung metastasis mouse model showed a significant increase compared to healthy mice. Our nanosensor can also noninvasively monitor the course of treatment, which is significant for screening tumor recurrence and individualized evaluation of pharmacological and follow&#8208;up efficacy. Importantly, this strategy could be adapted for various diseases to form a common diagnostic platform by changing responsive linkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic FeMo(Se, Te) as Joint Electron Pool Promoting    Nitrogen   Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has been long believed that FeMoS structure, where Fe is bonded with S, plays a pivotal role as a biomimetic catalyst for  electrochemical nitrogen (N  2  ) fixation  . Nevertheless, the structure of Fe bonded to heavier analogues (Se or Te) has never been explored for N  2  electrofixation.  Here, we theoretically  predict the electronic structure of FeMo(Se, Te)  composed of tri&#8208;coordinated Fe species with open shells for binding with Se, which forms a collective electron pool for promoting N  2  activation. Guided by this interesting prediction, we then demonstrate a two&#8208;step procedure to synthesize such structures, which displays remarkable N  2  electrofixation activities with ammonia yield of 72.54 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  &#8208;1  and Faradic efficiency of 51.67% that are more than three times of the FeMoS counterpart. Further mechanism study has been conducted through density function theory (DFT) simulations. This work would provide new clues for designing versatile electrocatalytic materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Unlike many reactions of their six&#8208;membered ring counterparts, the reactions of chiral seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring enolates are highly diastereoselective. Diastereoselectivity was observed for a range of substrates, including lactam, lactone, and cyclic ketone derivatives. The stereoselectivity arises from torsional and steric interactions that develop when electrophiles approach the diastereotopic &#960;&#8208;faces of the enolates, which are differentiated by subtle differences in the orientation of nearby atoms of the ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of an Autocatalytic Hybridization Assembly Circuit for Amplified In Vivo MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lowly expressed analyte in complex cytoplasmic milieu necessitates the development of non&#8208;enzymatic autocatalytic DNA circuits with high amplification and anti&#8208;interference performance. Herein, we engineered a versatile and robust stimuli&#8208;responsive autocatalytic hybridization assembly (AHA) circuit for high performance  in vivo  bioanalysis. Under a moderately confined condition, the initiator motivated the autonomous and cooperative cross&#8208;activation of cascade hybridization reaction and catalytic DNA assembly for generating an exponentially amplified readout without the parasite steric hindrance and random diffusion side effects. The AHA circuit was systematically investigated by a series of experimental studies and theoretical simulations. The successively guaranteed target&#8208;recognition and synergistically accelerated signal&#8208;amplification enables the sensitive and selective detection of analyte, and realized the robust miRNA imaging in living cells and mice. This autocatalytic DNA circuit could substantially expand the toolbox for accurate diagnosis and programmable therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have designed a heterochiral dipeptide monomer (N  3  &#8208;D&#8208;Ala&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;NHCH  2  C&#8801;CH), modified with  &#160;  azide and alkyne at its termini for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. We obtained two different polymorphs; PI (P2  1  ) from DCM&#8208;toluene mixture, and PII (P&#8208;1) from hexane&#8208;ethyl acetate mixture. PI adopts parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing and PII adopts anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing. In both the cases, molecules from adjacent &#946;&#8208;stacks are arranged in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner. On heating, both the polymorphs undergo TAAC reaction to form linear polymers having parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like ordering (PI) and antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure (PII). PI reacted spontaneously at room temperature and the crystals showed cracking after the reaction, but PII was intact even after complete reaction. The dipeptide congeals various solvents and the aerogels are identical to PI. These aerogels also underwent spontaneous TAAC reaction at r.t. yielding pseudoprotein having alternate D&#8208; and L&#8208; amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Ionic Liquid in Copper Electrocatalyst for Improving CO2 Conversion to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of CO2  to valuable fuels is appealing for CO2  fixation and energy storage. The Cu&#8208;based catalysts feature unique superiorities, but achieving high ethylene selectivity is still restricted. In this study, we propose the anchoring of ionic liquid (IL) on Cu electrocatalyst for improving the electrochemical CO2  reduction to ethylene. In water&#8208;based electrolyte and a commonly used H&#8208;type cell, a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 77.3% was achieved at &#8208;1.49 V (  vs  . RHE). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that IL can modify the electronic structure of Cu catalyst through its interaction with Cu, which are more conducive to *CO dimerization for ethylene formation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although sufficient tolerance against attack by superoxide radicals (O  2  &#8208;  ) has been mainly recognized as an important property for Li&#8211;O  2&#160;  battery (LOB) electrolytes, recent evidence has revealed that other critical factors also govern the cyclability, prompting a reconsideration of the basic design guidelines of LOB electrolytes. Here, we found that LOBs equipped with a  N,N&#8208;  dimethylacetamide (DMA)&#8208;based electrolyte exhibited better cyclability compared with other standard LOB electrolytes. This superior cyclability is attributable to the capabilities of quenching  1  O  2  and forming highly decomposable Li  2  O  2  . The  1  O  2  quenching capability is equivalent to that of a tetraglyme&#8208;based electrolyte containing a several millimolar concentration of a typical chemical quencher. Based on these advantageous properties, the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte led to superior cyclability despite its lower O  2  &#8208;  tolerance. Thus, the present work provides a novel design guideline for the development of LOB electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of diarylphosphines and  O  &#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamines is developed. In the cases of symmetrical diarylphosphines, a series of aminophosphinites is prepared in high yields. In the cases of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines, an array of  P  &#8208;chiral aminophosphinites is synthesized by using copper(I)&#8208;(  R  ,  R  P  )&#8208;Ph&#8208;FOXAP complex as a chiral catalyst in high yields with high enantioselectivity. Based on several control experiments and  31  P NMR studies, a two&#8208;electron redox mechanism involving the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines is proposed for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction. Finally, one representative  P  &#8208;chiral phosphoric amide generated through the oxidation with H  2  O  2  is transformed to chiral diarylphosphinate in high yields with maintained enantioselectivity, which allows further transformations towards various  P  &#8208;chiral tertiary phosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Symmetry MOF&#8208;Based Patchy Colloids and Their Precise Linking via Site&#8208;Selective Liquid Bridging to Form Supra&#8208;Colloidal and Supra&#8208;Framework Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;symmetry, MOF&#8208;based patchy colloids are reported, which carry both shape and chemical information that enables precise directional colloidal assembly, producing hierarchical, multicomponent, and supra&#8208;framework architectures with unprecedented control over the position, rotation, and orientation of the constituent building blocks.







Abstract
Colloids with surface patches (or patchy particles) can bind and assemble with directionality. However, the bonding between the usually high&#8208;symmetry, dome&#8208;shaped patches is not precise, as it cannot lock the exact position and orientation of the relevant particles. This issue prevents the assembly of well&#8208;defined colloidal superstructures by design. Herein, we introduce low&#8208;symmetry, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based patchy colloids, which feature a polyhedral matrix and flat hexagonal patches, along with anisotropic surfaces and compositions. Guided by the encoded shape/chemical information and mediated by a site&#8208;selective liquid&#8208;bridging interaction, the distinct patchy particles self&#8208;assemble into supra&#8208;colloidal (or supra&#8208;framework) structures with unprecedented precision. In this case, the valence, position, and orientation of the particles within assemblies are fully coordinated and precisely aligned. The dynamic nature of the liquid bridges also allows us to investigate the unique assembly kinetics. Our strategy not only defines new modes of colloidal bonding, but also provides a powerful means toward creating hierarchical and multi&#8208;component MOF materials.

&lt;p&gt;Colloids with surface patches (or patchy particles) can bind and assemble with directionality. However, the bonding between the usually high-symmetry, dome-shaped patches is not precise, as it cannot lock the exact position and orientation of the relevant particles. This issue prevents the assembly of well-defined colloidal superstructures by design. Herein, we introduce low-symmetry, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-based patchy colloids, which feature a polyhedral matrix and flat hexagonal patches, along with anisotropic surfaces and compositions. Guided by the encoded shape/chemical information and mediated by a site-selective liquid-bridging interaction, the distinct patchy particles self-assemble into supra-colloidal (or supra-framework) structures with unprecedented precision. In this case, the valence, position, and orientation of the particles within assemblies are fully coordinated and precisely aligned. The dynamic nature of the liquid bridges also allows us to investigate the unique assembly kinetics. Our strategy not only defines new modes of colloidal bonding, but also provides a powerful means toward creating hierarchical and multi-component MOF materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Phenanthrocarbazole&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymer with Noncovalent Conformational Locking for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>

A polymeric hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) based on the phenanthrocarbazole derivative PC6 features a two&#8208;dimensionally conjugated phenanthrocarbazole and S&#8208;O noncovalent conformational locking. Perovskite solar cells employing PC6 as a dopant&#8208;free HTM afforded an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.2&#8201;% and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Adequate hole mobility is the prerequisite for dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs). Constraining the configurational variation of polymer chains to afford a rigid and planar backbone can reduce unfavorable reorganization energy and improve hole mobility. Herein, a noncovalent conformational locking via S&#8211;O secondary interaction is exploited in a phenanthrocarbazole (PC) based polymeric HTM, PC6, to fix the molecular geometry and significantly reduce reorganization energy. Systematic studies on structurally explicit repeats to targeted polymers reveals that the broad and planar backbone of PC remarkably enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of adjacent polymers, facilitating intermolecular charge transfer greatly. The inserted &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; oxygen atoms passivate the trap sites efficiently at the perovskite/HTM interface and further suppress interfacial recombination. Consequently, a PSC employing PC6 as a dopant&#8208;free HTM offers an excellent power conversion efficiency of 22.2&#8201;% and significantly improved longevity, rendering it as one of the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.

         <title>Watching Microwave&#8208;Induced Microscopic Hot Spots via the Thermosensitive Fluorescence of Europium/Terbium Mixed&#8208;Metal Organic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave&#8208;induced micro&#8208;hot spots were detected in liquid solutions through fluorescence thermometers attached on microwave&#8208;absorbing carbon particles. The fluorescent experiments confirmed the established microwave&#8208;irradiated energy&#8208;transfer model, whose results can guide precise control and optimization of conditions in microwave chemistry.







Abstract
The hypothesis of microscopic hot spots is widely used to explain the unique microwave (MW) effect in materials science and chemical engineering, but it has not yet been directly measured. Herein we use Eu/Tb mixed&#8208;metal organic complexes as nano thermometers to probe the intrinsic temperature of MW&#8208;absorbing particles in MW fields based on the thermosensitive fluorescent spectra. According to the measurements of the temperature gradient at the solid/liquid interphase, we derive an MW&#8208;irradiated energy transfer model to predict the extent of microscopic hot spots. The fluorescence results agree with the model predictions that the MW&#8208;induced temperature gradient can be enlarged by increasing MW intensity, as well as the dielectric loss and size of particles. Conversely, the increase in the thermal conductivity and the dielectric loss of the liquid lowers the temperature gradient. This study enables control of MW&#8208;assisted synthesis and MW&#8208;responsive techniques.

         <title>Stereoselective O&#8208;Glycosylations by Pyrylium Salt Organocatalysis**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A glycosylation method for non&#8208;specialists: Commercially available pyrylium salts catalyze stereoselective glycosylation reactions with trichloroacetimidate electrophiles. A wide range of phenolic nucleophiles are compatible with the procedure. The standard conditions involve mixing three components at ambient conditions and proceed with minimal formation of undesired by&#8208;products.







Abstract
Despite many years of invention, the field of carbohydrate chemistry remains rather inaccessible to non&#8208;specialists, which limits the scientific impact and reach of the discoveries made in the field. Aiming to increase the availability of stereoselective glycosylation chemistry for non&#8208;specialists, we have discovered that several commercially available pyrylium salts catalyze stereoselective O&#8208;glycosylations of a wide range of phenols and alkyl alcohols. This catalytic reaction utilizes trichloroacetimidates, an easily accessible and synthetically proven electrophile, takes place under air and only initiates when all three reagents are mixed, which should provide better reproducibility by non&#8208;specialists. The reaction exhibits varying degrees of stereospecificity, resulting in &#946;&#8208;selective glycosylations from &#945;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates, whilst an &#945;&#8208;selective glycosylation proceeds from &#946;&#8208;trichloroacetimidates. A mechanistic study revealed that the reaction likely proceeds via an SN2&#8208;like substitution on the protonated electrophile.

         <title>Radiation Chemistry Provides Nanoscopic Insights into the Role of Intermediate Phases in CeO2 Mesocrystal Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of radiation chemistry, different stages of CeO2 mesocrystal formation are revealed. The nucleation and growth of the primary particles, followed by their self&#8208;assembly into mesocrystals, occur inside a hydrated CeIV hydroxide phase. The hydroxide forms as the initial phase and serves as an intermediate in the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation. Mesocrystals can be used as buildings blocks for designing complex hierarchical structures.







Abstract
The role of intermediate phases in CeO2 mesocrystal formation from aqueous CeIII solutions subjected to &#947;&#8208;radiation was studied. Radiolytically formed hydroxyl radicals convert soluble CeIII into less soluble CeIV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of samples from different stages of the process allowed the identification of several stages in CeO2 mesocrystal evolution following the oxidation to CeIV: (1)&#8197;formation of hydrated CeIV hydroxides, serving as intermediates in the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transformation; (2)&#8197;CeO2 primary particle growth inside the intermediate phase; (3)&#8197;alignment of the primary particles into &#8220;pre&#8208;mesocrystals&#8221; and subsequently to mesocrystals, guided by confinement of the amorphous intermediate phase and accompanied by the formation of &#8220;mineral bridges&#8221;. Further alignment of the obtained mesocrystals into supracrystals occurs upon slow drying, making it possible to form complex hierarchical architectures.

         <title>Dianion and Dication of Tetracyclopentatetraphenylene as Decoupled Annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;Annulene Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dianion and dication of a tetracyclopentatetraphenylene derivative were generated and investigated as the annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;annulene models. Experiments based on X&#8208;ray crystallography and 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MCD spectroscopies indicate that the outer and inner conjugation circuits are significantly decoupled, strongly supporting the theoretically predicted structures.







Abstract
The dianion and dication of tetramesityl&#8208;substituted tetracyclopentatetraphenylene, a circulene consisting of alternating five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings, have been generated by reduction with alkali metals and oxidation with antimony(V) halides, respectively. They are theoretically predicted to adopt double annulenoid structures called annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;annulene models in which the outer and inner conjugation circuits are significantly decoupled. The theoretical structures were experimentally proven by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses and the electronic configurations were supported by MCD spectra. Based on the 13C NMR chemical shifts, negative and positive charges are shown to be located mainly at the outer periphery, indicating that the dianion and dication have delocalized 22&#8208;&#960; and 18&#8208;&#960; electron outer perimeters, respectively, and 8&#8208;&#960; electron structure at the inner ring. Notably, the dianion has an open&#8208;shell character, whereas the dication has a closed&#8208;shell ground state.

&lt;p&gt;Dianion and dication of a tetracyclopentatetraphenylene derivative were generated and investigated as the annulene-within-an-annulene models. Experiments based on X-ray crystallography and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, and MCD spectroscopies indicate that the outer and inner conjugation circuits are significantly decoupled, strongly supporting the theoretically predicted structures.

         <title>Scalable Molten Salt Synthesis of Platinum Alloys Planted in Metal&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Graphene for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8722;Co nanoalloys planted in the metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;graphene system achieved by a scalable molten salt pyrolysis method demonstrate improved activity and stability for oxygen reduction through a synergistic effect among multiple active sites and a strong metal&#8211;support interaction.







Abstract
Fuel cells are considered as a promising alternative to the existing traditional energy systems towards a sustainable future. Nevertheless, the synthesis of efficient and robust platinum (Pt) based catalysts remains a challenge for practical applications. In this work, we present a simple and scalable molten&#8208;salt synthesis method for producing a low&#8208;platinum (Pt) nanoalloy implanted in metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;graphene. The as&#8208;prepared low&#8208;Pt alloyed graphene exhibits a high oxygen reduction activity of 1.29&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and excellent durability over 30&#8201;000 potential cycles. The catalyst nanoarchitecture of graphene encased Pt nanoalloy provides a robust capability against nanoparticle migration and corrosion due to a strong metal&#8211;support interaction. Similarly, advanced characterization and theoretical calculations show that the multiple active sites in platinum alloyed graphene synergistically account for the improved oxygen reduction. This work not only provides an efficient and robust low&#8208;Pt catalyst but also a facile design idea and scalable preparation technique for integrated catalysts to achieve more profound applications in fuel cells and beyond.

         <title>A DNA Nanocomplex Containing Cascade DNAzymes and Promoter&#8208;Like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite for Combined Gene/Chemo&#8208;dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanocomplex containing cascade DNAzymes and promoter&#8208;like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite was synthesized. The promoter&#8208;like ZMF decomposed in response to intratumoral glutathione to release a sufficient quantity of metal ions, thus promoting cascade DNA/RNA cleavage and free radical generation, and achieving combined gene/chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy.







Abstract
Sequential control of exogenous chemical events inside cells is a promising way to regulate cell functions and fate. Herein we report a DNA nanocomplex containing cascade DNAzymes and promoter&#8208;like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite (ZMF), achieving combined gene/chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy. The promoter&#8208;like ZMF decomposed in response to intratumoral glutathione to release a sufficient quantity of metal ions, thus promoting cascade DNA/RNA cleavage and free radical generation. Two kinds of DNAzymes were designed for sequential cascade enzymatic reaction, in which metal ions functioned as cofactors. The primary DNAzyme self&#8208;cleaved the DNA chain with Zn2+ as cofactor, and produced the secondary DNAzyme; the secondary DNAzyme afterwards cleaved the EGR&#8208;1 mRNA, and thus downregulated the expression of target EGR&#8208;1 protein, achieving DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy. Meanwhile, the released Zn2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+ induced Fenton/Fenton&#8208;like reactions, during which free radicals were catalytically generated and efficient chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy was achieved. In a breast cancer mouse model, the administration of DNA nanocomplex led to a significant therapeutic efficacy of tumor growth suppression.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Melt&#8208;Processable Supramolecular Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of polythiourethane soft actuators based on liquid crystal and thiourethane segments has been developed by a one&#8208;pot approach. The formation of well&#8208;defined thiourethane segments affords supramolecular cross&#8208;links through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions yielding materials that can be reprocessed and reprogrammed into arbitrary 3D shapes. A detailed understanding and characterization of the developed material are presented.







Abstract
The application of reprocessable and reprogrammable soft actuators is limited by the synthetic strategies, 3D&#8208;shaping capabilities, and small deformations. In this work, melt&#8208;processable supramolecular soft actuators based on segmented copolymers containing thiourethane and liquid crystal segments have been prepared via sequential thiol addition reactions in a one&#8208;pot approach using commercially available building blocks. The actuators demonstrated immediate, reversible response and weightlifting capabilities with large deformations up to 32&#8201;%. Through exploiting the supramolecular cross&#8208;links, the material could be recycled and reprogrammed into 3D actuators and welded into an actuator assembly with different deformation modes. Our work offers a one&#8208;pot synthesis and straightforward melt&#8208;processable approach to prepare supramolecular soft actuators with large deformations that can be reprocessed and reprogrammed into arbitrary 3D shapes.

         <title>Single&#8208;Bonded Cubic AsN from High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Chemical Reactivity of Arsenic and Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cubic arsenic nitride was synthesized from arsenic and nitrogen under high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions using a laser heated diamond anvil cell. The crystalline structure of AsN (P213), in which every As atom is single&#8208;bonded to three N atoms and vice versa, was determined by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction. The discovery of AsN is relevant to the fundamental chemistry of pnictogens and to synthesis of new advanced materials.







Abstract
Chemical reactivity between As and N2, leading to the synthesis of crystalline arsenic nitride, is here reported under high pressure and high temperature conditions generated by laser heating in a diamond anvil cell. Single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at different pressures between 30 and 40&#8197;GPa provides evidence for the synthesis of a covalent compound of AsN stoichiometry, crystallizing in a cubic P213 space group, in which each of the two elements is single&#8208;bonded to three atoms of the other and hosts an electron lone pair, in a tetrahedral anisotropic coordination. The identification of characteristic structural motifs highlights the key role played by the directional repulsive interactions between non&#8208;bonding electron lone pairs in the formation of the AsN structure. Additional data indicate the existence of AsN at room temperature from 9.8 up to 50&#8197;GPa. Implications concern fundamental aspects of pnictogens chemistry and the synthesis of innovative advanced materials.

         <title>Synthetic Silica Nano&#8208;Organelles for Regulation of Cascade Reactions in Multi&#8208;Compartmentalized Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic silica nano&#8208;organelles designed to regulate kinetics and pathway selection in enzymatic cascade reactions are reported. Like cell organelles, synthetic nano&#8208;organelles can be combined to create integrated systems. Multicompartmentalized synthetic cells were built using synthetic nano&#8208;organelles and giant polymeric vesicles.







Abstract
In eukaryotic cells, enzymes are compartmentalized into specific organelles so that different reactions and processes can be performed efficiently and with a high degree of control. In this work, we show that these features can be artificially emulated in robust synthetic organelles constructed using an enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization strategy. We describe an in&#8197;situ encapsulation approach that allows enzymes to be loaded into silica nanoreactors in well&#8208;defined compositions. The nanoreactors can be combined into integrated systems to produce a desired reaction outcome. We used the selective enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization and nanoreactor integration to regulate competitive cascade reactions and to modulate the kinetics of sequential reactions involving multiple nanoreactors. Furthermore, we show that the nanoreactors can be efficiently loaded into giant polymer vesicles, resulting in multi&#8208;compartmentalized microreactors.

         <title>Titanocene(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Precision Deuteration of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanocene catalysis delivers D to the more substituted C&#8208;atom of epoxides with high efficiency, deuterium incorporation, and stereoselectivity. A novel method of catalyst activation that prevents isotope scrambling warrants the excellent performance of the reaction.







Abstract
We describe a titanocene(III)&#8208;catalyzed deuterosilylation of epoxides that provides &#946;&#8208;deuterated anti&#8208;Markovnikov alcohols with excellent D&#8208;incorporation, in high yield, and often excellent diastereoselectivity after desilylation. The key to the success of the reaction is a novel activation method of Cp2TiCl2 and (tBuC5H4)2TiCl2 with BnMgBr and PhSiD3 to provide [(RC5H4)2Ti(III)D] without isotope scrambling. It was developed after discovering an off&#8208;cycle scrambling with the previously described method. Our precision deuteration can be applied to the synthesis of drug precursors and highlights the power of combining radical chemistry with organometallic catalysis.

         <title>A Supramolecular Polymer Constituted of Antiaromatic NiII Norcorroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular polymer that consists of an antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;system as the monomer has been created. An amide&#8208;functionalized NiII norcorrole derivative forms a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The formation of a long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking array ensures the persistency of the conducting pathway against thermal perturbation and achieves high charge&#8208;carrier mobility along the tightly&#8208;bound linear aggregates.







Abstract
For the creation of next&#8208;generation organic electronic materials, the integration of &#960;&#8208;systems has recently become a central theme. Such functional materials can be assembled by supramolecular polymerization when aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems are used as monomers, and the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymer strongly depend on the electronic structure of the monomers. Here, we demonstrate the construction of a supramolecular polymer consisting of an antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;system as the monomer. An amide&#8208;functionalized NiII norcorrole derivative formed a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, ensuring the persistency of the conducting pathway against thermal perturbation, which results in higher charge mobility along the tightly bound linear aggregates than that of the aromatic analogue composed of ZnII porphyrins.

         <title>Oriented Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Ion Flux and Smart Gating Nanofluidic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework membranes that offer vertically aligned nanofluidic channel arrays, leading to an ultrahigh ion flux and pH&#8208;gating nanofluidic transport.







Abstract
Nanofluidic ion transport holds high promise in bio&#8208;sensing and energy conversion applications. However, smart nanofluidic devices with high ion flux and modulable ion transport capabilities remain to be realised. Herein, we demonstrate smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (2D COF) membranes with vertically aligned nanochannel arrays that achieved a 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher ion flux compared with that of conventional single&#8208;channel nanofluidic devices. The surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion conductance is dominant for electrolyte concentration up to 0.01&#8197;M. Moreover, owing to the customisable pH&#8208;responsivity of imine and phenol hydroxyl groups, the COF&#8208;DT membranes attained an actively modulable ion transport with a high pH&#8208;gating on/off ratio of &#8776;100. The customisable structure and rich chemistry of COF materials will offer a promising platform for manufacturing nanofluidic devices with modifiable ion/molecular transport features.

Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) between organic tris&#8208;carboxylates and tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands afforded an Archimedean solid (truncated tetrahedron) and a double&#8208;walled tetrahedron featuring a ravel topology. The results demonstrate the promising ability of tris&#8208;carboxylates as new anion coordination centers in constructing novel topologies on account of the modifiable size and function of these organic anions.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) is showing increasing power in the construction of anionic supramolecular architectures. Herein, by expanding the anion centers from oxoanion (phosphate or sulfate) to organic tris&#8208;carboxylates, an Archimedean solid (truncated tetrahedron) and a highly entangled, double&#8208;walled tetrahedron featuring a ravel topology have been assembled with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands. The results demonstrate the promising ability of tris&#8208;carboxylates as new anion coordination centers in constructing novel topologies with increasing complexity and diversity compared to phosphate or sulfate ions on account of the modifiable size and easy functionalization character of these organic anions.

         <title>Design and Development of a Bioorthogonal, Visualizable and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a triple&#8208;functional H2S delivery system, which is triggered by the bioorthogonal click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction between a newly designed diphenylamino&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dithiolium&#8208;4&#8208;olate (DTO) and a strained alkyne. This COS&#8208;based H2S release platform can realize in&#8208;mitochondria H2S release in a controllable manner, and provide a concomitant fluorescence for spatiotemporal feedback of the exogenous H2S in cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important endogenous gasotransmitter, but the targeted delivery and real&#8208;time feedback of exogenous H2S are still challenging. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a new 1,3&#8208;dithiolium&#8208;4&#8208;olate (DTO) compound, which can react with a strained alkyne via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to generate carbonyl sulfide (COS) as the precursor of H2S, and a thiophene derivative with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Moreover, the diphenylamino substituent in DTO greatly increases the mitochondrial targeting of this H2S delivery system. Such a bioorthogonal click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has integrated three functions in one system for the first time: (1)&#8197;in situ controllable H2S release, (2)&#8197;concomitant fluorescence response, and (3)&#8197;mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery. In addition, we investigated the mitochondrial membrane potential loss alleviation by using this system in H9c2 cells under oxidative stress.

         <title>Altering Chain Flexibility of Aliphatic Polyesters for Yellow&#8208;Green Clusteroluminescence in 38&#8201;% Quantum Yield</title>

This work reports the novel example of linear non&#8208;conjugated polyester exhibiting yellow&#8208;green clusteroluminescence and a high quantum yield of 38&#8201;%. The formation of ester&#8208;unit cluster is responsible for the emission and is decided by balancing flexible and rigid structures of chains.







Abstract
Preparation of non&#8208;conjugated polymers with long&#8208;wavelength emission and high quantum yield (QY) is still a huge challenge. Herein, we report the first example of linear non&#8208;conjugated polyester exhibiting yellow&#8211;green clusteroluminescence (CL) and a high QY of 38&#8201;%. We discovered that the polyester P3 with balanced flexibility and rigidity showed the longest CL wavelength and highest QY. Systematically photophysical characterization unravel the key role of ester cluster in the CL and the cluster formation via the aggregate of ester units was visualized. Moreover, P3 was demonstrated to be a highly selective, quick&#8208;responsive (ca. 1.2&#8197;min) and sensitive detector (detection limit is 0.78&#8197;&#956;M) for irons owing to the fast disassociation of clusters by irons. This work not only gains further mechanistic insight into CL but also provides a new strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;wavelength CL, meanwhile, enlightens the glorious application prospect of luminescent polyester.

         <title>Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for the Chemiresistive Detection of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isorecticular and heterobimetallic two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks achieves chemiresistive sensing of ppm concentrations of carbon monoxide at low power. Spectroscopic techniques and computational methods, along with comparative experiments, suggest the contribution of Cu nodes to CO binding and the essential role of metallophthalocyanine units in tuning and amplifying the sensing response.







Abstract
This paper describes the demonstration of a series of heterobimetallic, isoreticular 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with metallophthalocyanine (MPc, M=Co and Ni) units interconnected by Cu nodes towards low&#8208;power chemiresistive sensing of ppm levels of carbon monoxide (CO). Devices achieve a sub&#8208;part&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) limit of detection (LOD) of 0.53&#8197;ppm toward CO at a low driving voltage of 0.1&#8197;V. MPc&#8208;based Cu&#8208;linked MOFs can continuously detect CO at 50&#8197;ppm, the permissible exposure limit required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), for multiple exposures, and realize CO detection in air and in humid environment. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and comparison experiments suggest the contribution of Cu nodes to CO binding and the essential role of MPc units in tuning and amplifying the sensing response.

         <title>A Ni0 &#963;&#8208;Borane Complex Bearing a Rigid Bidentate Borane/Phosphine Ligand: Boryl Complex Formation by Oxidative Dehydrochloroborylation and Catalytic Activity for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a rigid bidentate borane/phosphine ligand was explored within the background of statistical olefin copolymerization with group 10 metals. During this work, a mild oxidative dehydrochloroborylation reaction was found to convert different Ni0 &#963;&#8208;borane complexes into NiII boryl chloride complexes. This new ligand also allows the nickel catalyzed polymerization of ethylene, a first for a B&#8208;donor in group 10 olefin polymerization.







Abstract
While of interest, synthetically feasible access to boryl ligands and complexes remains limited, meaning such complexes remain underexploited in catalysis. For bidentate boryl ligands, oxidative addition of boranes to low&#8208;valent IrI or Pt0 are the only examples yet reported. As part of our interest in developing improved group 10 ethylene polymerization catalysts, we present here an optimized synthesis of a novel, rigid borane/phosphine ligand and its Ni0 &#963;&#8208;borane complex. From the latter, an unprecedented oxidative dehydrochloroborylation, to give a NiII boryl complex, was achieved. Furthermore, this new B/P ligand allowed the nickel&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of ethylene, which suggests that Ni0 &#963;&#8208;hydroborane complexes act as masked NiII boryl hydride reagents.

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of Polymerized Dioxolane as Solid Electrolyte and its Thermal Decomposition Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnF2 is an efficient catalyst for the polymerization of DOL and also an effective additive for improving the interfacial wettability with Li&#8208;metal, of benefit in reaching the dendrite free and dense Li&#8208;deposition in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells. However, P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE tends to be thermally decomposed at 110&#8201;&#176;C with the formation of formaldehyde gas and other epoxides, restricting the operating temperature window of P&#8208;DOL based electrolytes.







Abstract
Polymerized&#8208;dioxolane(P&#8208;DOL) is of potential as a solid&#8208;polymer&#8208;electrolyte(SPE) due to its high Li+&#8208;conductivity, good compatibility with Li&#8208;metal and desired preparation method of in situ polymerization in cells. In this study, SnF2 was demonstrated not only to be an efficient catalyst for the polymerization of DOL at room temperature, but also an effective additive for improving interfacial wettability and suppressing dendrite through the reaction with Li&#8208;metal and the formation of LiF/LixSn based composite solid electrolyte interlayer(SEI). Using the SnF2 polymerized P&#8208;DOL containing 1&#8197;M LiTFSI as SPE(P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE), obviously denser Li&#8208;deposition was obtained, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state(ASS) Li/LiFePO4 cell delivered stable cycling over 350 cycles at 45&#8201;&#176;C. At the same time, the irreversible decomposition of P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE into formaldehyde and small molecule epoxides are observed at 110&#8201;&#176;C, which is even initiated at lower temperature of 40&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum. This thermal decomposition of P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE in pouch cell causes huge volume swell, and therefore putting a strict limitation on the operating temperature window for the P&#8208;DOL based electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;SnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an efficient catalyst for the polymerization of DOL and also an effective additive for improving the interfacial wettability with Li-metal, of benefit in reaching the dendrite free and dense Li-deposition in all-solid-state cells. However, P-DOL-SPE tends to be thermally decomposed at 110&#8201;&#176;C with the formation of formaldehyde gas and other epoxides, restricting the operating temperature window of P-DOL based electrolytes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerized-dioxolane(P-DOL) is of potential as a solid-polymer-electrolyte(SPE) due to its high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conductivity, good compatibility with Li-metal and desired preparation method of in situ polymerization in cells. In this study, SnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was demonstrated not only to be an efficient catalyst for the polymerization of DOL at room temperature, but also an effective additive for improving interfacial wettability and suppressing dendrite through the reaction with Li-metal and the formation of LiF/Li&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Sn based composite solid electrolyte interlayer(SEI). Using the SnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; polymerized P-DOL containing 1&#8197;M LiTFSI as SPE(P-DOL-SPE), obviously denser Li-deposition was obtained, and the all-solid-state(ASS) Li/LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cell delivered stable cycling over 350 cycles at 45&#8201;&#176;C. At the same time, the irreversible decomposition of P-DOL-SPE into formaldehyde and small molecule epoxides are observed at 110&#8201;&#176;C, which is even initiated at lower temperature of 40&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum. This thermal decomposition of P-DOL-SPE in pouch cell causes huge volume swell, and therefore putting a strict limitation on the operating temperature window for the P-DOL based electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circular Permutated PQQ&#8208;Glucose Dehydrogenase as an Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circular permutation of PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase creates an artificial allosteric enzyme controlled by ligand binding to N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal domains. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays.







Abstract
Protein biosensors play an increasingly important role as reporters for research and clinical applications. Here we present an approach for the construction of fully integrated but modular electrochemical biosensors based on the principal component of glucose monitors PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ&#8208;GDH). We designed allosterically regulated circular permutated variants of PQQ&#8208;GDH that show large (&gt;10&#8208;fold) changes in enzymatic activity following intramolecular scaffolding of the newly generated N&#8208; and C termini by ligand binding domain/ligand complexes. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays. For instance, the concentration of Cyclosporine&#8197;A could be measured in 1&#8197;&#956;L of undiluted blood with the same accuracy as the leading diagnostic technique that uses 50 times more sample. We further used this biosensor to construct highly porous gold bioelectrodes capable of robustly detecting concentrations of Cyclosporine&#8197;A as low as 20&#8197;pM and retained functionality in samples containing at least 60&#8201;% human serum.

         <title>PDMS with Tunable Side Group Mobility and Its Highly Permeable Membrane for Removal of Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of phenyl side groups as rigid molecular spacers into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) imparted the methyl side groups with higher mobility and additional degrees of freedom for fast transport of aromatic compounds. Combined with the engineering design of the transport highway, the membrane achieved outstanding performance for aromatic removal.







Abstract
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), as the benchmark of organophilic membrane materials, still faces challenges for removal of aromatic compounds due to the undesirable transport channels. In this work, we propose to reconstruct the PDMS conformation with tunable side group mobility by introducing phenyl as rigid molecular spacer to relieve steric hindrance of large&#8208;sized aromatic molecules; meanwhile, polymer segments are loosely stacked to provide additional degrees of freedom as increasing the permeant size. Moreover, the reconstructed PDMS is engineered into the composite membrane with prevention of condensation of aromatic compounds in the substrate pores. The resulting thin&#8208;film composite membrane achieved one order of magnitude higher flux (11.8&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) with an equivalent separation factor (12.3) compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes for aromatic removal. The permeant&#8208;customized membrane molecular and microstructure designing strategy opens a new avenue to develop membranes for specific separation targets.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept for the transformation of the excellent tetrazine&#8208;ligation dependent fluorogenicity of blue&#8208;excitable cores to biologically preferable emission ranges is presented herein. Such relay mechanism resulted in improved yellow/red fluorogenicities together with increased photostabilities and large apparent Stokes&#8208;shifts. The presented fluorogenic dyads were utilized in multicolor single excitation imaging schemes and STED imaging as well.







Abstract
An energy transfer&#8208;based signal amplification relay concept enabling transmission of bioorthogonally activatable fluorogenicity of blue&#8208;excitable coumarins to yellow/red emitting cyanine frames is presented. Such relay mechanism resulted in improved cyanine fluorogenicities together with increased photostabilities and large apparent Stokes&#8208;shifts allowing lower background fluorescence even in no&#8208;wash bioorthogonal fluorogenic labeling schemes of intracellular structures in live cells. These energy transfer dyads sharing the same donor moiety together with their parent donor molecule allowed three&#8208;color imaging of intracellular targets using one single excitation source with separate emission windows. Sub&#8208;diffraction imaging of intracellular structures using the bioorthogonally activatable FRET dyads by STED microscopy is also presented.

         <title>Stabilizing Interface pH by N&#8208;Modified Graphdiyne for Dendrite&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Interface pH change seriously influences dendrite formation, while its importance has not been revealed. We constructed a N&#8208;modification graphdiyne interface to stabilize pH by accelerating hydrated zinc ions desolvation, enabling the direct electron transfer from anode to Zn2+ (rather than the coordinated H2O). Operando pH detection reveals the pH stabilization. Zn&#8208;V6O13 battery works well at 20.65&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.07&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work highlights interface pH and provides a new approach to address Zn dendrite issue.







Abstract
Zn dendrite issue was intensively studied via tuning zinc ion flux. pH change seriously influences dendrite formation, while its importance has not been revealed. Here, we construct a N&#8208;modification graphdiyne interface (NGI) to stabilize pH by mediating hydrated zinc ion desolvation. Operando pH detection reveals pH stabilization by NGI. This works with pores in NGI to achieve dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and an increased symmetric cell lifespan by 116 times. Experimental and theoretical results owe pH stabilization to desolvation with a reduced activation energy achieved by electron transfer from solvation sheath to N atom. The efficient desolvation ensures that electron directly transfers from substrate to Zn2+ (rather than the coordinated H2O), avoiding O&#8722;H bond splitting. Hence, Zn&#8208;V6O13 battery achieves a long lifespan at 20.65&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.07&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work reveals the significance of interface pH and provides a new approach to address Zn dendrite issue.

         <title>Metallization&#8208;Prompted Robust Porphyrin&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallographic and computational studies on a series of porphyrinic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) reveal that metallization of porphyrin centers greatly alters the orbital overlap of the adjacent porphyrin, the geometry of the molecule/layer, and the strength of noncovalent interactions. Therefore, metalloporphyrin HOFs exhibit much higher stability, surface area, and catalytic activity than metal&#8208;free porphyrinic HOFs.







Abstract
Under topological guidance, the self&#8208;assembly process based on a tetratopic porphyrin synthon results in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with the predicted square layers topology (sql) but unsatisfied stability. Strikingly, simply introducing a transition metal in the porphyrin center does not change the network topology but drastically causes noticeable change on noncovalent interaction, orbital overlap, and molecular geometry, therefore ultimately giving rise to a series of metalloporphyrinic HOFs with high surface area, and excellent stability (intact after being soaked in boiling water, concentrated HCl, and heated to 270&#8201;&#176;C). On integrating both photosensitizers and catalytic sites into robust backbones, this series of HOFs can effectively catalyze the photoreduction of CO2 to CO, and their catalytic performances greatly depend on the chelated metal species in the porphyrin centers. This work enriches the library of stable functional HOFs and expands their applications in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Atomic Bridging Structure of Nickel&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic bridging structure of nickel&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon active sites confined in channel&#8208;rich porous carbon fibers enables the highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.







Abstract
To meet strategic applications, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into value&#8208;added chemical molecules would be improved by the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed active sites. Herein an electrospun&#8208;pyrolysis cooperative strategy is presented to not only modulate the porous structure of the carbon support for favorable charge and mass transfer, but also adjust the bridging structure of atomically dispersed metal species. Typically, the experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the unique chemical structure of binuclear nickel bridging with nitrogen and carbon atoms (namely Ni2&#8722;N4&#8722;C2) tunes the electronic nature of the d&#8208;states for the optimal adsorption of carbon dioxide and intermediates, thus inducing the substantial enhancement of CO2 reduction via the thermodynamically more favorable pathway. The identification of such a structure demonstrates the large space to modulate the atomic bridging status for optimizing electrocatalysis.

         <title>Tunable Second&#8208;Level Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Solid Supramolecules between Acrylamide&#8211;Phenylpyridium Copolymers and Cucurbit[7]uril</title>

         <dc:description>
Solid supramolecules based on acrylamide&#8211;phenylpyridium copolymers with various substituent groups and cucurbit[7]uril not only exhibit tunable ultralong phosphorescence with lifetimes varying from 0.9&#8197;s to 2.2&#8197;s, but also co&#8208;assemble with organic dyes Eosin&#8197;Y or SR101 to display high&#8208;performance phosphorescence energy transfer with multicolor delayed fluorescence properties.







Abstract
A series of solid supramolecules based on acrylamide&#8211;phenylpyridium copolymers with various substituent groups (P&#8722;R: R=&#8722;CN, &#8722;CO2Et, &#8722;Me, &#8722;CF3) and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) are constructed to exhibit tunable second&#8208;level (from 0.9&#8197;s to 2.2&#8197;s) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the amorphous state. Compared with other solid supramolecules P&#8722;R/CB[7] (R=&#8722;CN, &#8722;CO2Et, &#8722;Me), P&#8722;CF3/CB[7] displays the longest lifetime (2.2&#8197;s), which is probably attributed to the fluorophilic interaction of cucurbiturils leading to a uncommon host&#8211;guest interaction between 4&#8208;phenylpyridium with &#8722;CF3 and CB[7]. Furthermore, the RTP solid supramolecular assembly (donors) can further react with organic dyes Eosin Y or SR101 (acceptors) to form ternary supramolecular systems featuring ultralong phosphorescence energy transfer (PpET) and visible delayed fluorescence (yellow for EY at 568&#8197;nm and red for SR101 at 620&#8197;nm). Significantly, the ultralong multicolor PpET supramolecular assembly can be further applied in fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption and painting.

         <title>A {Ni12}&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Coordinative Binding of Sulphur Dioxide and Nitrogen Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallographic observation of reversible coordinative binding of SO2 and NO2 on open NiII sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework (NKU&#8208;100) incorporating unprecedented {Ni12}&#8208;wheels has been achieved by in&#8197;situ synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Air pollution by SO2 and NO2 has caused significant risks on the environment and human health. Understanding the mechanism of active sites within capture materials is of fundamental importance to the development of new clean&#8208;up technologies. Here we report the crystallographic observation of reversible coordinative binding of SO2 and NO2 on open NiII sites in a metal&#8208;organic framework (NKU&#8208;100) incorporating unprecedented {Ni12}&#8208;wheels; each wheel exhibits six open NiII sites on desolvation. Immobilised gas molecules are further stabilised by cooperative host&#8208;guest interactions comprised of hydrogen bonds, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and dipole interactions. At 298&#8197;K and 1.0&#8197;bar, NKU&#8208;100 shows adsorption uptakes of 6.21 and 5.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for SO2 and NO2, respectively. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have confirmed the selective retention of SO2 and NO2 at low concentrations under dry conditions. This work will inspire the future design of efficient sorbents for the capture of SO2 and NO2.

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the unique natural reaction of azaphilones with amines, an efficient, highly chemoselective and activation&#8208;free primary amine bioconjugation protocol has been developed and demonstrated in a variety of applications.







Abstract
Residue&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods for biomolecules are highly sought to expand the scope of their biological and medical applications. Inspired by the mechanism of the generation of natural vinylogous &#947;&#8208;pyridones (vPDNs), we have developed a novel unique azaphilone&#8208;based, activation&#8208;free primary&#8208;amine&#8208;selective bioconjugation method for biomolecules. Our strategy allows facile functionalization of primary amine groups in peptides and proteins, including the clinically used therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, by generating a highly stable vPDN linkage. Excellent chemoselectivity toward primary amines also enables the azaphilone derivatives to specifically modify the lipid components of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria while bypassing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and mammalian cells. The new method shows significant advantages including chemoselectivity, efficiency, flexibility and biocompatibility, and therefore provides a valuable addition to the current toolbox for biomolecule conjugation.

         <title>Imaging Membrane Order and Dynamic Interactions in Living Cells with a DNA Zipper Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesterol&#8208;modified programmable DNA probes are developed to image transient interactions and membrane order in live cell membranes. The membrane order during the activation of T&#8208;cell receptor signaling has also been measured.







Abstract
The cell membrane is a dynamic and heterogeneous structure composed of distinct sub&#8208;compartments. Within these compartments, preferential interactions occur among various lipids and proteins. Currently, it is still challenging to image these short&#8208;lived membrane complexes, especially in living cells. In this work, we present a DNA&#8208;based probe, termed &#8220;DNA Zipper&#8221;, which allows the membrane order and pattern of transient interactions to be imaged in living cells using standard fluorescence microscopes. By fine&#8208;tuning the length and binding affinity of DNA duplex, these probes can precisely extend the duration of membrane lipid interactions via dynamic DNA hybridization. The correlation between membrane order and the activation of T&#8208;cell receptor signaling has also been studied. These programmable DNA probes function after a brief cell incubation, which can be easily adapted to study lipid interactions and membrane order during different membrane signaling events.

         <title>Highly Durable and Fully Dispersed Cobalt Diatomic Site Catalysts for CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co dual&#8208;atom catalysts were used for CO2 reduction with superior CH4 selectivity. The charge at the inserted Co2 active sites in tri&#8208;3s&#8208;triazine was enriched as compared to that at Co single sites, thus promoting a lower activation energy barrier by stabilizing the rate&#8208;limiting COOH* and CHO* intermediates.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (DACs) have emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis because the synergistic effect between adjacent metal atoms can promote their catalytic activity while maintaining the advantages of single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts, such as almost 100&#8201;% atomic efficiency and excellent hydrocarbon selectivity. In this study, cobalt&#8208;based atom site catalysts with a Co2&#8211;N coordination structure were synthesized and used for photodriven CO2 reduction. The resulting CoDAC containing 3.5&#8201;% Co atoms demonstrated a superior atom ratio for CO2 reduction catalytic performance, with 65.0&#8201;% CH4 selectivity, which far exceeds that of cobalt&#8208;based single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (CoSACs). The intrinsic reason for the superior activity of CoDACs is the excellent adsorption strength of CO2 and CO* intermediates at dimeric Co active sites.

An unambiguous structural elucidation using microcrystal electron diffraction provides insight into unique properties of a layered conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Cu3(C6O6)2. The presence of strong interlayer electronic coupling exerts a profound effect on the electrical and magnetic properties of the MOF.







Abstract
This paper describes structural elucidation of a layered conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) material Cu3(C6O6)2 by microcrystal electron diffraction with sub&#8208;angstrom precision. This insight enables the first identification of an unusual &#960;&#8208;stacking interaction in a layered MOF material characterized by an extremely short (2.73&#8197;&#197;) close packing of the ligand arising from pancake bonding and ordered water clusters within pores. Band structure analysis suggests semiconductive properties of the MOF, which are likely related to the localized nature of pancake bonds and the formation of a singlet dimer of the ligand. The spin of CuII within the Kagom&#233; arrangement dominates the paramagnetism of the MOF, leading to strong geometrical magnetic frustration.

         <title>M&#246;bius ZnII&#8208;Hexaphyrins Bearing a Chiral Coordinating Arm: A Chiroptical Switch Featuring P/M Twist Inversion Controlled by Achiral Effectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
How far can the dynamic chirality of M&#246;bius hexaphyrins be controlled lies firstly on the capacity of an attached source of chirality to explore the M&#246;bius ring environment, which depends on several convoluted dynamic processes; secondly on the responsiveness of the system, making this exploration tunable and multi&#8208;reversible; and thirdly on the unwavering optimism of the experimenter.







Abstract
By their conformational flexibility, M&#246;bius aromatic hexaphyrins provide a dynamic chirality attractive to develop stimuli responsive systems such as chiroptical switches. A regular [28]hexaphyrin has been equipped with a chiral coordinating arm to achieve transfer of chirality from a fix stereogenic element to the dynamic M&#246;bius one. The arm allows straightforward formation of labile monometallic ZnII complexes with an exogenous ligand, either a carboxylato or an amino with opposite inwards/outwards orientations relative to the M&#246;bius ring. As a corollary, the chiral coordinating arm is constrained over the ring or laterally, inducing opposite P and M M&#246;bius configurations with unprecedented high stereoselectivity (diast. excess greater than 95&#8201;%). By tuning the transfer of chirality, these achiral effectors generate electronic circular dichroism spectra with bisignate Cotton effect of opposite signs. Switching between distinct chiroptical states was ultimately achieved in mild conditions owing to ligand exchange, with high robustness (10 cycles).

         <title>Fluorescence Imaging of Mitochondrial DNA Base Excision Repair Reveals Dynamics of Oxidative Stress Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;up fluorescent probe (UBER) that reacts rapidly with apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites visualizes base excision repair (BER) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in cells. Monitoring of the mtDNA BER process in cells over time illuminated the time lag between the initiation of oxidative stress and the initial step of DNA repair, along with the effect of DNA defensive enzymes, MTH1 and OGG1.







Abstract
Mitochondrial function in cells declines with aging and with neurodegeneration, due in large part to accumulated mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that arise from deficient DNA repair. However, measuring this repair activity is challenging. We employ a molecular approach for visualizing mitochondrial base excision repair (BER) activity in&#8197;situ by use of a fluorescent probe (UBER) that reacts rapidly with AP sites resulting from BER activity. Administering the probe to cultured cells revealed signals that were localized to mitochondria, enabling selective observation of mtDNA BER intermediates. The probe showed elevated DNA repair activity under oxidative stress, and responded to suppression of glycosylase activity. Furthermore, the probe illuminated the time lag between the initiation of oxidative stress and the initial step of BER. Absence of MTH1 in cells resulted in elevated demand for BER activity upon extended oxidative stress, while the absence of OGG1 activity limited glycosylation capacity.

&lt;p&gt;A light-up fluorescent probe (UBER) that reacts rapidly with apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites visualizes base excision repair (BER) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in cells. Monitoring of the mtDNA BER process in cells over time illuminated the time lag between the initiation of oxidative stress and the initial step of DNA repair, along with the effect of DNA defensive enzymes, MTH1 and OGG1.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial function in cells declines with aging and with neurodegeneration, due in large part to accumulated mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that arise from deficient DNA repair. However, measuring this repair activity is challenging. We employ a molecular approach for visualizing mitochondrial base excision repair (BER) activity in&#8197;situ by use of a fluorescent probe (UBER) that reacts rapidly with AP sites resulting from BER activity. Administering the probe to cultured cells revealed signals that were localized to mitochondria, enabling selective observation of mtDNA BER intermediates. The probe showed elevated DNA repair activity under oxidative stress, and responded to suppression of glycosylase activity. Furthermore, the probe illuminated the time lag between the initiation of oxidative stress and the initial step of BER. Absence of MTH1 in cells resulted in elevated demand for BER activity upon extended oxidative stress, while the absence of OGG1 activity limited glycosylation capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assembly of Hexagonal Column Interpenetrated Spheres from Plant Polyphenol/Cationic Surfactants and Their Application as Antimicrobial Molecular Banks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lasting and broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial agents with the special structure of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are constructed through non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid and quaternary ammonium surfactants. HCISs possess high substrate&#8208;adhesion on various substrates and high anti&#8208;water washing property, and can continuously provide antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, avoiding one&#8208;time burst release of antimicrobial units.







Abstract
Microbial infections have become a great threat to human health and one of the main risks arises from direct contact with the surfaces contaminated by pathogenic microbes. Herein, a kind of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are fabricated by non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid with quaternary ammonium surfactants. Different from one&#8208;time burst release of conventional antimicrobial agents, the HCIS acts like a &#8220;antimicrobial molecular bank&#8221; and releases the antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, leading to long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial performance. Taking advantage of strong hydrophobicity and adhesion, HCISs are applicable to various substrates and endowed with anti&#8208;water washing property, thus showing high in vitro antimicrobial efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) even after being used for 10 cycles. Meanwhile, HCISs exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, and have good biocompatibility with mammalian cells. Such a low&#8208;cost and portable long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent meets the growing anti&#8208;infection demand in public spaces.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Embedded Approach to Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Isoelectronic Structures for Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was synthesized by condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde derivative, which was readily converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacing oxonium with nitrogen atoms under the treatment of ammonia.







Abstract
Embedding heteroatoms into the main backbones of polymeric materials has become an efficient tool for tailoring their structures and improving their properties. However, owing to comparatively harsh heteroatom&#8208;doping conditions, this has rarely been explored in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein, upon aldol condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium salt with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde, a two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was achieved, which was further converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacement of oxonium ions with nitrogen atoms under ammonia treatment. The two heteroatom&#8208;embedded COFs are conceptually isoelectronic with each other, featuring similar geometric structures but different electronic structures, rendering them capable of catalyzing the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component synthesis of tri&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives with good recyclability.

         <title>Inside Cover: Dianion and Dication of Tetracyclopentatetraphenylene as Decoupled Annulene&#8208;within&#8208;an&#8208;Annulene Models (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 6/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
Dianion and dication of a tetracyclopentatetraphenylene derivative were generated and characterized by spectroscopic methods and X&#8208;ray crystallography to reveal that the outer and inner conjugation circuits are significantly decoupled as theoretically predicted. The magnetically induced ring currents of the outer and inner circuits flow clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively, in the same direction as the trains run on the outer and inner loops of Osaka Loop Line, as reported by Ichiro Hisaki, Marina&#8197;A. Petrukhina, Tohru Nishinaga, Masayoshi Nakano, Yoshito Tobe, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202115316).

Aromatics&#8208;permeable membranes made from polydimethylsiloxane with tunable side group mobilities are reported by Gongping Liu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202111810). Phenyl groups were introduced as rigid molecular spacers to endow the methyl groups with high mobility and reconstruct the polymer conformation, creating a highway for the fast transport of aromatic molecules, and thus realizing efficient removal of aromatic compounds from aqueous solution.

         <title>The Mechanism of Piezocatalysis: Energy Band Theory or Screening Charge Effect?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes advances in the mechanistic study of newly developed piezocatalysis systems. The differences, relevance, evidence, and contradiction of the tentative mechanisms of energy band theory and screening charge effect are elaborated. The current challenges and perspectives for future mechanistic studies are provided.







Abstract
Piezocatalysis, a newly emerging catalysis technology that relies on the piezopotential and piezoelectric properties of the catalysts, is attracting unprecedented research enthusiasm for applications in energy conversion, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation. Despite the rapid development in the past three years, the mechanism of piezocatalysis is still under debate. A fundamental understanding of the working principles of this technology should enable the future design and optimization of piezocatalysts. Herein, we provide an overview of the two popular theories used to explain the observed piezocatalysis: energy band theory and screening charge effect. A comprehensive discussion and clarification of the differences, relevance, evidence, and contradiction of the two mechanisms are provided. Finally, challenges and perspectives for future mechanistic studies are highlighted. Hopefully, this Review can help readers gain a better understanding of piezocatalysis and enable its application in their own research.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Annulations Involving the Activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The number of methods that exploit transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activations for the assembly of cyclic systems is steadily growing. This Minireview covers the most relevant cyclization and cycloaddition approaches, discussed from a mechanistic perspective.







Abstract
The selective functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using transition&#8208;metal catalysis is among the more attractive transformations of modern synthetic chemistry. In addition to its inherent atom economy, such reactions open unconventional retrosynthetic pathways that can streamline synthetic processes. However, the activation of intrinsically inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and the selection among very similar C&#8722;H bonds, represent highly challenging goals. In recent years there has been notable progress tackling these issues, especially with regard to the development of intermolecular reactions entailing the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Conversely, the assembly of cyclic products from simple acyclic precursors using metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activations has been less explored. Only recently has the number of reports on such annulations started to grow. Herein we give an overview of some of the more relevant advances in this exciting topic.

&lt;p&gt;The selective functionalization of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds using transition-metal catalysis is among the more attractive transformations of modern synthetic chemistry. In addition to its inherent atom economy, such reactions open unconventional retrosynthetic pathways that can streamline synthetic processes. However, the activation of intrinsically inert C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds, and the selection among very similar C&#8722;H bonds, represent highly challenging goals. In recent years there has been notable progress tackling these issues, especially with regard to the development of intermolecular reactions entailing the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Conversely, the assembly of cyclic products from simple acyclic precursors using metal-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond activations has been less explored. Only recently has the number of reports on such annulations started to grow. Herein we give an overview of some of the more relevant advances in this exciting topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals: A Critical Overview of Experimental Elastic Tensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extensive overview of experimental elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals employs a rotation&#8208;invariant description of the Young's modulus to critically compare multiple observations and computational results. To encourage the wider use of experimental elastic constant tensors in studies of mechanical properties, outliers are clearly identified, resulting in a curated database of experimental results for molecular crystals.







Abstract
This review presents a critical and comprehensive overview of current experimental measurements of complete elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals. For a large fraction of these molecular crystals, detailed comparisons are made with elastic tensors obtained using the corrected small basis set Hartree&#8211;Fock method S&#8208;HF&#8208;3c, and these are shown to be competitive with many of those obtained from more sophisticated density functional theory plus dispersion (DFT&#8208;D) approaches. These detailed comparisons between S&#8208;HF&#8208;3c, experimental and DFT&#8208;D computed tensors make use of a novel rotation&#8208;invariant spherical harmonic description of the Young's modulus, and identify outliers among sets of independent experimental results. The result is a curated database of experimental elastic tensors for molecular crystals, which we hope will stimulate more extensive use of elastic tensor information&#8212;experimental and computational&#8212;in studies aimed at correlating mechanical properties of molecular crystals with their underlying crystal structure.

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on an Organic Antimony(III) Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent organic antimony(III) hybrid (MePPh3)2SbCl5 featured with STE emission is prepared with good reproducibility and high stability. High&#8208;efficiency OLEDs are demonstrated with this hybrid as an emitter with the luminance of 3500&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, current efficiency of 6.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and EQE of 3.1&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
As low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free hybrids with higher stability and lower toxicity than those of three&#8208;dimensional lead perovskites, organic antimony(III) halides show great application potential in opt&#8208;electronic field owing to diverse topologies along with exceptional optical properties. We report herein an antimony(III) hybrid (MePPh3)2SbCl5 with a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structure, which exhibits brilliant orange emission peaked at 593&#8197;nm with near&#8208;unity photoluminescent quantum yield (99.4&#8201;%). The characterization of photophysical properties demonstrates that the broadband emission with a microsecond lifetime (3.24&#8197;&#956;s) arises from self&#8208;trapped emission (STE). Electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on neat and doped films of (MePPh3)2SbCl5 were fabricated. The doped devices show significant improvement in comparison to non&#8208;doped OLEDs. Owing to the much improved surface morphology and balanced carrier transport in light&#8208;emitting layers of doped devices, the peak luminance, current efficiency (CE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are boosted from 82&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 3500&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, 1.1&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 to 6.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and 0.7&#8201;% to 3.1&#8201;% relative to non&#8208;doped devices, respectively.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Conjugation of a Selenopolypeptide to Alpha&#8208;1&#8208;antitrypsin Enhances Oxidation Resistance and Pharmacological Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biocompatible selenopolypeptide was site&#8208;specifically conjugated to alpha&#8208;1&#8208;antitrypsin (A1AT). The conjugated A1AT fully retained its inhibitory activity on neutrophil elastase (NE), enhanced oxidation resistance, extended the serum half&#8208;life, and afforded long&#8208;lasting protective activity in a mouse model of acute lung injury.







Abstract
Human alpha&#8208;1&#8208;antitrypsin (A1AT), a native serine&#8208;protease inhibitor that protects tissue damage from excessive protease activities, is used as an augmentation therapy to treat A1AT&#8208;deficienct patients. However, A1AT is sensitive to oxidation&#8208;mediated deactivation and has a short circulating half&#8208;life. Currently, there is no method that can effectively protect therapeutic proteins from oxidative damage in vivo. Here we developed a novel biocompatible selenopolypeptide and site&#8208;specifically conjugated it with A1AT. The conjugated A1AT fully retained its inhibitory activity on neutrophil elastase, enhanced oxidation resistance, extended the serum half&#8208;life, and afforded long&#8208;lasting protective efficacy in a mouse model of acute lung injury. These results demonstrated that conjugating A1AT with the designed selenopolymer is a viable strategy to improve its pharmacological properties, which could potentially further be applied to a variety of oxidation sensitive biotherapeutics.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Homologation of 4&#8208;Substituted Cyclohexanones with CF3CHN2: Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Cycloheptanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl cycloheptanones containing the C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bond on the chiral centers were accessed through a highly stereoselective ScIII/chiral bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed homologation reaction of cyclic ketones with CF3CHN2 as the trifluoromethylation reagent. This reaction could be applied to construct silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers with moderate diastereoselectivities and high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Introduction of the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) into organic molecules in an enantioselective manner has attracted significant attention, but still remains a challenging problem. We herein report a catalytic asymmetric trifluoromethylation of cyclic ketones via a ScIII/chiral bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed homologation reaction by employing 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane (CF3CHN2) as the CF3 source. This desymmetrization process is highly efficient and generates two chiral centers with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, affording chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl cyclic ketones in a straightforward manner.

         <title>Electrochemical Desaturative &#946;&#8208;Acylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Aryl Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and simple method of electrochemical desaturative &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of cyclic N&#8208;aryl amines has been developed to access the desired &#946;&#8208;substituted enamines with excellent levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity under mild conditions. This procedure proved to be a powerful route to the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a straightforward, robust, and simple route to access &#946;&#8208;substituted desaturated cyclic amines via an electrochemically driven desaturative &#946;&#8208;functionalization of cyclic amines. This transformation is based on multiple single&#8208;electron oxidation processes using catalytic amounts of ferrocene. The reaction proceeds in the absence of stoichiometric amounts of electrolyte under mild conditions, affording the desired products with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The reaction was tolerant of a broad range of substrates and also enables late&#8208;stage &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of potentially valuable products. Preliminary mechanistic studies using cyclic voltammetry reveal the key role of ferrocene as a redox mediator in the reaction.

         <dc:description>
A rapid, practical, efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum method for the synthesis of highly versatile and synthetically useful ortho&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonylated anilines from N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and trifluoromethanesulfinic chloride is described.







Abstract
A metal&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free, practical and efficient method for the synthesis of highly versatile and synthetically useful ortho&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonylated anilines from arylhydroxylamines and trifluoromethanesulfinic chloride was developed. This rapid transformation proceeded smoothly with good yields and excellent ortho&#8208;selectivity in the absence of any metals or ligands. Mechanistically, the reaction comprised a noncanonical O&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfinylation of the arylhydroxylamine, and the subsequent [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to afford ortho&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonylated aniline derivatives. The practical application of this reaction was demonstrated by further conversion into a series of functional molecules under different reaction conditions.

         <title>Detection of Bacterial Rhamnolipid Toxin by Redox Liposome Single Impact Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is reported that the electrochemistry of redox liposome single impacts is a powerful and efficient analytical technique for sensing target toxins produced by pathogenic bacteria such as Rhamnolipid from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which interacts destructively with the lipid membrane of liposomes. A high sensitivity of sensing has been reached with a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid detected in less than 30&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
The detection of Rhamnolipid virulence factor produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in nosocomial infections is reported by using the redox liposome single impact electrochemistry. Redox liposomes based on 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine as a pure phospholipid and potassium ferrocyanide as an encapsulated redox content are designed for using the interaction of the target toxin with the lipid membrane as a sensing strategy. The electrochemical sensing principle is based on the weakening of the liposomes lipid membrane upon interaction with Rhamnolipid toxin which leads upon impact at an ultramicroelectrode to the breakdown of the liposomes and the release/electrolysis of its encapsulated redox probe. We present as a proof of concept the sensitive and fast sensing of a submicromolar concentration of Rhamnolipid which is detected after less than 30&#8197;minutes of incubation with the liposomes, by the appearing of current spikes in the chronoamperometry measurement.

         <title>A Lanthanum Ammonium Sulfate Double Salt with a Strong SHG Response and Wide Deep&#8208;UV Transparency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV sulfate La(NH4)(SO4)2, which exhibits a short&#8208;wavelength deep&#8208;UV absorption edge (below 190&#8197;nm) and the strongest SHG response among deep&#8208;UV NLO sulfates (2.4&#215;KDP), has been successfully synthesized by a double&#8208;salt strategy involving introduction of complementary cations.







Abstract
The targeted synthesis of deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, especially those with non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated sulfates, has experienced considerable difficulties due to the need to reconcile the oft&#8208;competing requirements for deep&#8208;UV transparency and strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). We report herein the designed synthesis of the first rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV sulfate La(NH4)(SO4)2 by a double&#8208;salt strategy involving introduction of complementary cations, together with optical studies that reveal a short&#8208;wavelength deep&#8208;UV absorption edge (below 190&#8197;nm) and the strongest SHG response among deep&#8208;UV NLO sulfates (2.4&#215;KDP). Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis suggest that the excellent balance between SHG response and deep&#8208;UV transparency can be attributed to a synergistic interaction of the hetero&#8208;cations La3+ and [NH4]+, which optimize alignment of the [SO4] tetrahedra and highly polarizable [LaO8] polyhedra.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Dithia[5]helicenes and their Postsynthetic Functionalization to Access Dithia[9]helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a chiral Au catalyst bearing an &#945;&#8208;cationic phosphonite as an ancillary ligand and two successive alkyne hydroarylation events allows the assembly of dithia[5]helicenes with excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, regioselective postsynthetic bromination of the dithia[5]helicene products generates starting materials for the efficient preparation of even more &#960;&#8208;expanded systems, such as dithia[9]helicenes.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective synthesis of 5,13&#8208;disubstituted dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes is reported. Key for the successful assembly of these helical architectures is the last two successive Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkyne hydroarylation events. Specifically, the second cyclization is the enantiodetermining step of the whole process and provides the desired helicenes with excellent ee values when a TADDOL&#8208;derived 1,2,3&#8208;(triazolium)phosphonite moiety (TADDOL: &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8242;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol) is employed as an ancillary ligand. The absolute stereochemistry of the newly prepared structures has been determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography to be P; the optical properties of these heterohelicenes are also reported. A three&#8208;step procedure was subsequently developed that allows the transformation of the initially obtained dithia[5]helicenes into dithia[9]helicenes without erosion of the enantiopurity.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Stereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Cross&#8208;Coupling of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes with Carbon Electrophiles by C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and benzyl electrophiles proceeds through nickel&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted C&#8722;F bond activation and shows excellent stereoselectivity and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Stereo&#8208; and enantioselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling involving C&#8722;F bond activation is reported. Treatment of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with racemic benzyl electrophiles in the presence of a chiral nickel complex using B2pin2 as a stoichiometric reductant allows the construction of a C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond under mild conditions, affording a broad range of monofluoroalkenes bearing stereogenic allylic centers. Initial mechanistic studies indicate that a radical chain pathway may be operating, wherein the ester group in the gem&#8208;difluoroalkene promotes C&#8722;F bond activation through oxidative addition to a Ni species.

Making the invisible visible. Reactive glycosylation intermediates are identified using chemical exchange saturation transfer NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The stereoselective introduction of the glycosidic bond remains one of the main challenges in carbohydrate synthesis. Characterizing the reactive intermediates of this reaction is key to develop stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Herein we report the characterization of low&#8208;populated, rapidly equilibrating mannosyl dioxanium ions that arise from participation of a C&#8208;3 acyl group using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR spectroscopy. Dioxanium ion structure and equilibration kinetics were measured under relevant glycosylation conditions and highly &#945;&#8208;selective couplings were observed suggesting glycosylation took place via this elusive intermediate.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Gut&#8208;Microbiota&#8208;Derived Lantibiotics Reveals a Subgroup of S8 Family Proteases for Class III Leader Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 6, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of rat gut&#8208;microbiota&#8208;derived class III lanthipeptides with moderate antimicrobial activities were discovered by genome mining. The investigation of their biosynthesis revealed a subgroup of S8 family serine proteases for the removal of class III leader peptides.







Abstract
Lanthipeptides are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides with diverse structural features and bioactivities. Gut&#8208;microbiota&#8208;derived lanthipeptides play important roles in gut homeostasis of the host. Herein, we report the discovery and biosynthesis of class III lantibiotics named amylopeptins, which are derived from the gut microbiota of Sprague&#8208;Dawley rats and display a narrow antimicrobial spectrum. In contrast to known class III lanthipeptides, the biosynthesis of amylopeptins employs AmyP, which belongs to a subgroup of S8 family serine proteases, to remove the leader of corresponding precursor peptides in a site&#8208;specific manner during the last step of their maturation. Overall, this study shows for the first time that S8 family proteases participate in the biosynthesis of class III lanthipeptides.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;based two&#8208;component excitonic switch utilizing high&#8208;performance diarylethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes but have rarely been used in materials science. Here, we have developed doubly methylated DAEs derived from 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine with high thermal stability and fatigue resistance. These new photoswitches not only outperform their predecessors but also rival classical non&#8208;nucleosidic DAEs. To demonstrate the utility of these new DAEs, we have designed an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides: one strand containing a fluorogenic double&#8208;methylated 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form a highly efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer (FRET) pair. The system was operated in liquid and solid phases and showed both strong distance&#8208; and orientation&#8208;dependent photochromic FRET. The superior ON/OFF contrast was maintained over up to 100 switching cycles, with no detectable fatigue.</dc:description>

         <title>Depositing Molecular Graphene Nanoribbons on Ag(111) by Electrospray &#8208; Controlled Ion Beam Deposition: Self&#8208;assembly and On&#8208;Surface Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical processing of low dimensional carbon nanostructures is crucial for their integration in future devices. Here we apply a new methodology in atomically precise engineering by combining multistep solution synthesis of N&#8208;doped molecular graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with mass&#8208;selected ultra&#8208;high vacuum electrospray &#8208; controlled ion beam deposition on surfaces and real space visualisation by scanning tunnelling microscopy. We demonstrate how this method yields solely a controllable amount of single, otherwise unsublimable, GNRs of 2.9 nm length on a planar Ag(111) surface. This methodology allows for further processing by employing on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols and exploiting the reactivity of the substrate. Following multiple chemical transformations, the GNRs provide reactive building blocks to form extended, metal&#8208;organic coordination polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasma Induced Nanocrystalline Domain Engineering and Surface Passivation in Mesoporous Chalcogenide Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of highly crystalline mesoporous materials is key to realizing high&#8208;performance chemical and biological sensors and optoelectronics. However, minimizing the surface oxidation and enhancing the domain size without affecting the porous nanoarchitecture are daunting challenges. Herein, we report a hybrid technique that combines bottom&#8208;up electrochemical growth with top&#8208;down plasma treatment to produce mesoporous semiconductors with large crystalline domain sizes and excellent surface passivation. By passivating unsaturated bonds without incorporating any chemical or physical layers, these films showed better stability and enhancement in the optoelectronic properties of mesoporous copper telluride (CuTe) with different pore diameters. These results provide exciting opportunities for the development of long&#8208;term, stable, and high&#8208;performance mesoporous semiconductor materials for future technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst: marked ORR activity in acidic media without the contribution by metal sites?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to be the most promising substitutes for benchmark Pt/C for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report that, a N&#8208;doped carbon materials with trace amount of iron (0&#8208;0.08 wt.%) show excellent ORR activity and durability comparable and even superior to those of Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic media without the significant contribution by the metal sites. Such a N&#8208;doped carbon (denoted as N&#8208;HPCs) features a hollow and hierarchically porous architecture, and more importantly, a non&#8208;covalent&#8208;bonded N&#8208;deficient/N&#8208;rich heterostructure providing the&#160;active sites for oxygen adsorption and activation owing to the efficient electron transfer between the layers. The primary Zn&#8208;air battery using N&#8208;HPCs as the cathode delivers a much higher power density of 158 mW cm&#8208;2, and the maximum power density in H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell reaches 486 mW cm&#8208;2, which is comparable to and even better than those using conventional Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts at cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Molecule Based High Performance Photothermal Organic Material for Efficient Water&#8208;Electric Cogeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, a unique donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated organic&#8208;small&#8208;molecule photothermal material, namely GDPA&#8208;QCN, is presented. Bulky dendritic triphenylamine (GDPA) was grafted onto quinoxaline&#8208;6,7&#8208;dicarbonitrile (QCN) with a phenyl ring as a bridge to form an &#8220;umbrella&#8221; architecture. Benefited from the particular molecular structure, in solid state, GDPA&#8208;QCN molecules adopted a loose packing mode due to the steric effect of &#8220;umbrella head&#8221; dendritic triphenylamine and flexible molecular structure feature, which allows efficient intramolecular motions and consequently elevates energy dissipation by taking the pathway of thermal deactivation within broad absorption range. The GDPA&#8208;QCN solid has high solar&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with an absorption range from 300 to 1100 nm, which can promote superior water purification and electricity generation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Terpenoid&#8208;Pyrrolobenzoxazine Hybrid Natural Product CJ&#8208;12662</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fungal natural product CJ&#8208;12662 is a structurally complex terpene&#8208;amino acid hybrid, and is a potent anthelmintic compound. The biosynthetic pathway of CJ&#8208;12662 is elucidated based on metabolite analysis from heterologous expression. We demonstrate the terpene portion is derived from successive P450&#8208;catalyzed oxidations of amorpha&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene, while three flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes are involved in morphing the esterified tryptophan into a chlorinated pyrrolobenzoxazine, utilizing a cascaded [1,2]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Gating Effects for Ion Transport in Three&#8208;Dimensional Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of bioinspired nano/subnano&#8208;sized (&lt; 2 nm) ion channels is still considered a great challenge due to the difficulty in precisely controlling pore's internal structure and chemistry. Herein, for the first time, we report that three&#8208;dimensional functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can act as an effective nanofluidic platform for intelligent modulating the ion transport. By a strategical attaching of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 groups to the monomers as ion&#8208;driver door locks, we demonstrate that gating effects of functionalized COFs can be activated by lithium ion. The obtained materials exhibit an outstanding selective ion transmission performance with a high gating ratio (up to 23.6 for JUC&#8208;590), which is among the highest values in metal ion&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state nanochannels reported so far. Furthermore, JUC&#8208;590 offer high tunability, selectivity, and recyclability of ion transport proved by the experimental and simulated studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Triptycene&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks with hea net for Hydrogen Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the confined building blocks and difficulty in structural identification, it remains a tremendous challenge to directionally design and synthesize three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with predetermined topologies. Herein, we report the first two cases of 3D COFs with the non&#8208;interpenetrated  hea  net, termed JUC&#8208;596 and JUC&#8208;597, by using the combination of tetrahedral and triangular prism building units. Due to the presence of triptycene functional group and fluorine atoms, JUC&#8208;596 exhibits an exceptional performance in the H  2  adsorption up to 305 cm  3  /g (or 2.72 wt%) at 77 K and 1 bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic materials reported so far. Furthermore, the strong interaction between H  2  and COF materials is validated through the DFT theoretical calculation. This work represents a triumphant example of rational design of functional COFs based on a reticular chemistry guide and demonstrates its promising application in clean energy storage.</dc:description>

Due to the presence of triptycene functional group and fluorine atoms, JUC-596 exhibits an exceptional performance in the H  2  adsorption up to 305 cm  3  /g (or 2.72 wt%) at 77 K and 1 bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic materials reported so far. Furthermore, the strong interaction between H  2  and COF materials is validated through the DFT theoretical calculation. This work represents a triumphant example of rational design of functional COFs based on a reticular chemistry guide and demonstrates its promising application in clean energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthetic structural proteins with super plasticity, extraordinary mechanical performance, biodegradability, biocompatibility and information storage ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Degradable bioplastics have attracted growing interest worldwide. However, it is challenging to develop bioplastics with simple processing procedure, strong mechanical performance, good biocompatibility, and adjustable physicochemical properties. Herein, we introduced structural proteins as building blocks and developed a simple environmental&#8208;friendly approach to fabricate diverse protein&#8208;based plastics. A cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;level production approach was developed through batch fermentation of  Escherichia coli  to product the biomaterials. These bioplastics possess super plasticity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high resistance to organic solvents. Their structural and mechanical properties can be precisely controlled. Besides, high density information storage and hemostatic applications were realized in the bioplastic system. The customizable bioplastics have great potential for applications in numerous fields and are capable to scale up to the industrial level.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic timing control over multicolor molecular emission by temporal chemical locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic control over molecular emission, especially in a time&#8208;dependent manner, holds a great promise for the development of smart luminescent materials. Here we report a series of dynamic multicolor fluorescent systems based on the time&#8208;encoded locking and unlocking of individual vibrational emissive units. The intramolecular cyclization reaction driven by adding chemical fuel acts as a chemical lock to decrease the conformational freedom of the emissive units, thus varying the fluorescence wavelength, while the resulting chemically locked state can be automatically unlocked by the hydrolysis reaction with water molecules. The dynamic molecular system can be driven by adding chemical fuels for multiple times. The emission wavelength and lifetime of the locking states can be readily controlled by elaborating the molecular structures, indicating this strategy as a robust and versatile way to modulate multi&#8208;color molecular emission in a time&#8208;encoded manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating built&#8208;in electric field via variable oxygen affinity for robust hydrogen evolution reaction in neutral media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Work function strongly impacts the surficial charge distribution, especially for metal&#8208;support electrocatalysts when a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is constructed. Therefore, studying the correlation between work function and BEF is crucial for understanding the intrinsic reaction mechanism. Herein, we present a Pt@CoO  x  electrocatalyst with a large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) and strong BEF, which shows outstanding hydrogen evolution activity in a neutral medium with a 4.5&#8208;fold mass activity higher than 20% Pt/C. Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the interfacial charge redistribution induced by the strong BEF, thus subtly optimizing hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption energy. This work not only provides fresh insights into the neutral hydrogen evolution mechanism but also proposes new design principles toward efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production in a neutral medium.</dc:description>
