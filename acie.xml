         <title>Allostery&#8208;Mimicking Self&#8208;assembly of Helical Poly(phenyacetylene) Block Copolymers and the Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allostery can regulate protein self&#8208;assembly which further affects biological acitivities, and achieving precise control over the chiral suprastructures during self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. Herein, to mimic the allosterical nature of proteins, the poly(phenyacetylene)s block copolymers PPA&#8208;  b  &#8208;PsmNap with the dynamic helical backbone were synthesized to investigate their conformational&#8208;transition&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. As the helical conformation of the block PsmNap spontaneously transforms from  cis&#8208;transiod  to  cis&#8208;cisoid,  the decreasing solubility of PsmNap blocks in THF induced self&#8208;assembly of PPA&#8208;  b  &#8208;PsmNap. The self&#8208;assembly structures of copolymers can sequentially evlove from vesicles to nanobelts to helical strands during the process of conformation transformation. The screw sense of final helical strands was closely correlated to the helicity of the block PsmNap. This is helpful to understand the mechanism of allostery&#8208;modulated self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>A general supramolecular approach to regulate protein functions by cucurbit[7]uril and unnatural amino acid recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of specific protein function is of great importance for both research and therapeutic development. Many small or large molecules have been developed to control specific protein function, but there is a lack of a universal approach to regulate the function of any given protein. Herein, we report a general host&#8211;guest molecular recognition approach involving modification of the protein functional surfaces with genetically encoded unnatural amino acids bearing guest side chains that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril. Using two enzymes and a cytokine as models, we showed that the activity of proteins bearing unnatural amino acid could be turned off by host molecule binding, which blocked its functional binding surface. Protein activity can be switched back by treatment with a competitive guest molecule. Our approach provides a general tool for reversibly regulating protein function through molecular recognition and can be expected to be valuable for studying protein functions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Long and Reversibly Self&#8208;Assembling 1&#8208;D DNA Nanostructure Built from Triplex and Quadruplex Hybrid Tiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new DNA nanostructure, an extended 1&#8208;dimensional composite built for the first time out of structurally robust yet conveniently disassembled DNA triple helices, interspersed with short stretches of G&#8208;quadruplexes. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructures require potassium ions and modestly acidic pH for their formation and are easily disassembled by changes to either of these requirements. We initially prepared and characterized a &#8220;monomeric&#8221; TQ Hybrid tile; followed by &#8220;sticky&#8221; TQ  s  tiles, incorporating unique guanine&#8208;only sticky ends, that enable efficient self&#8208;assembly via G&#8208;quartet formation of nanostructures &gt; 150 nm in length, as seen with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We anticipate that such DNA TQ Hybrid structures will find unique and varied application as communication modules within larger nanostructures, and as sensors, logic gates, as well as in other aspects of DNA nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomer controlled switchable copolymerization: A feasible route for the functionalization of poly(lactide)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switchable polymerization is an attractive strategy to enable the sequential selectivity of multi&#8208;block polyesters. Besides, these well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block polyesters could enable further modification for wider applications. Herein, based on the reversible insertion of CO  2  by Salen&#8208;Mn  III  , a new monomer controlled self&#8208;switchable polymerization route was developed. Chemoselective ring opening copolymerization of  O  &#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs) and lactide (LA) was explored without cocatalyst. The sequential conversion of OCAs and LA into the polymer chain could form multi&#8208;block polyesters. Based on this strategy, a series of multi&#8208;block polyesters with different pendant groups were synthesized. Furthermore, by modifying the propargyl&#8208;containing copolymers with quaternary ammonium groups, we have realized antibacterial functionalization of PLA. These results imply the potential application of this strategy for the fabrication of functional polymers for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Phosphonium Cations Enable Zn Metal Reversibility in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous rechargeable zinc metal batteries promise attractive advantages including safety, high volumetric energy density and low cost; however, such benefits cannot be unlocked unless Zn reversibility meets stringent commercial viability. Herein, we report remarkable improvements on Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes when phosphonium&#8208;based cations are used to reshape interfacial structures and interphasial chemistries, particularly when their ligands contain ether linkage. This novel aqueous electrolyte supports unprecedented Zn reversibility by showing dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping for over 6400 h at 0.5 mA cm  &#8211;2  , or over 280 h at 2.5 mA cm  &#8211;2  , with coulombic efficiency above 99% even with 20% Zn utilization per&#8208;cycle. Excellent full cell performance is demonstrated with Na  2  V  6  O  16  &#183;1.63H  2  O cathode, which cycles for 2000 times at 300 mA g  &#8211;1  .  The microscopic characterization and modeling identify the mechanism of unique interphase chemistry from phosphonium and its functionalities as the key factors responsible for dictating reversible Zn chemistry  .</dc:description>

         <title>Rotaxanes as cages to control DNA binding, cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of a small molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficacy of many drugs can be limited by undesirable properties such as poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; interactions in the body. To combat these deficiencies, various drug carriers have been investigated to enhance the pharmacological profile of therapeutic agents. Inspired by the high degree of spatiotemporal control afforded by photopharmacology, in this work we demonstrate the potential for using mechanical protection to &#8216;cage&#8217; a DNA&#8208;targeting metallodrug within a photodegradable rotaxane. More specifically, we report the synthesis of rotaxanes which incorporate as a stoppering unit a known G&#8208;quadruplex DNA binder, namely a PtII&#8208;salphen complex. This compound is prevented from interacting with DNA when it is part of the mechanically interlocked assembly. The second rotaxane stopper was designed to be cleaved by either light or the activity of an esterase. In the presence of such stimuli, the rotaxane breaks apart, releasing the PtII&#8208;salphen complex and activating its ability to bind to DNA. We also show the mechanically interlocked system shows enhanced cell permeability and limited cytotoxicity within osteosarcoma cells compared to the free drug. Light activation, however, leads to a dramatic increase in cytotoxicity, concluded to arise from translocation to the nucleus and subsequent binding to DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Bright Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles Based on Small&#8208;Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Photocatalyst Cascades: Merging Singlet Oxygen Photooxygenations with Photoredox Catalysis for the Synthesis of Alkaloid Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4335-4341, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New photocascades have been developed which transform simple and readily accessible substrates into three&#8208;dimensionally complex alkaloids in one pot. Both energy transfer and electron transfer are used within the reaction sequences. The strategy is underpinned by the development of a chemical switch that is used to &#8220;switch off&#8221; one photocatalyst allowing a second photocatalyst to take over control of the multi&#8208;photocatalyst process.







Abstract
The development of photocascades that rapidly transform simple and readily accessible furan substrates into polycyclic alkaloid frameworks or erythrina natural products is described. Each of the sequences developed makes use of photocatalyzed energy transfer processes, which generate singlet oxygen, to set up the substrates for the second photocatalyzed reaction, wherein electron transfer generates carbon&#8208;centered radicals for the cyclizations that give the final complex frameworks. A chemical switch has been developed that can &#8220;switch off&#8221; one photocatalyst; thus, allowing a second photocatalyst to take over control of the sequence. As a corollary, this strategy represents the first time it has been possible to use multiple photocatalysts in photocascades, and, as such, it expands significantly the reactions that can be included in such cascades and the order in which they can be initiated.

         <title>Randomly Distributed Sulfur Atoms in the Main Chains of CO2&#8208;Based Polycarbonates: Enhanced Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4315-4321, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terpolymers with randomly distributed sulfur atoms were synthesized via terpolymerization of cyclohexene oxide with a mixture of CO2 and COS in the presence of a dinuclear aluminum complex. Varying the CO2 pressure made tunable carbonate linkages possible. Terpolymers with comparable thiocarbonate and carbonate units exhibited a much higher Abbe number than the corresponding polycarbonates or polythiocarbonates.







Abstract
Polymeric materials possessing both high refractive indices and high Abbe numbers are much in demand for the development of advanced optical devices. However, the synthesis of such functional materials is a challenge because of the trade&#8208;off between these two properties. Herein, a synthetic strategy is presented for enhancing the optical properties of CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates by modifying the polymer's topological structure. Terpolymers with thiocarbonate and carbonate units randomly distributed in the polymers&#8217; main chain were synthesized via the terpolymerization of cyclohexene oxide with a mixture of CO2 and COS in the presence of metal catalysts, most notably a dinuclear aluminum complex. DFT calculations were employed to explain why different structural sequence were obtained with distinct bimetallic catalysts. Varying the CO2 pressure made it possible to obtain terpolymers with tunable carbonate linkages in the polymer chain. More importantly, optical property studies revealed that terpolymers with comparable thiocarbonate and carbonate units exhibited a refractive index of 1.501 with an enhanced Abbe number as high as 48.6, much higher than the corresponding polycarbonates or polythiocarbonates. Additionally, all terpolymers containing varying thiocarbonate content displayed good thermal properties with Tg&gt;109&#8201;&#176;C and Td&gt;260&#8201;&#176;C, suggesting little loss in the thermal stability compared to the polycarbonate. Hence, modification of the topological structure of the polycarbonate is an efficient method of obtaining polymeric materials with enhanced optical properties without compromising thermal performance.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Metal(IV) Carboxylate Metal&#8212;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4282-4288, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several micro/mesoporous metal(IV)&#8208;based metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs) with different functional groups were synthesized at room temperature using environmentally friendly conditions. The versatility of this strategy allows use of different reactants, and control of the MOF particle size. A synthesis using a pilot scale&#8208;up system demonstrates the potential of this approach for the industrial production of metal(IV)&#8208;based MOFs.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature syntheses of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are of interest to meet the demand of the sustainable chemistry and are a pre&#8208;requisite for the incorporation of functional compounds in water&#8208;stable MOFs. However, only few routes under ambient conditions have been reported to produce metal(IV)&#8208;based MOFs. Reported here is a new versatile one&#8208;step synthesis of a series of highly porous M6&#8208;oxocluster&#8208;based MOFs (M=Zr, Hf, Ce) at room temperature, including 8&#8208; or 12&#8208;connected micro/mesoporous solids with different functionalized organic ligands. The compounds show varying degrees of defects, particularly for 12&#8208;connected phases, while maintaining the chemical stability of the parent MOFs. Proposed here are first insights into in&#8197;situ kinetics observations for efficient MOF preparation. Remarkably, the synthesis has a high space&#8208;time yield and also provides the possibility to tune the particle size, therefore paving the way for their practical use.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Organoboron Helically Chiral Compounds: Cutouts from Extended Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4350-4357, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Configurationally stable and flexible organoboron helicenes consisting of either all&#8208;ortho&#8208;fused or a combination of angularly and linearly fused rings were synthesized by a modular approach from small achiral building blocks. A concept towards extended organoboron helices comprising both types of helically chiral compounds as primary substructures is presented.







Abstract
Two types of helically chiral compounds bearing one and two boron atoms were synthesized by a modular approach. Formation of the helical scaffolds was executed by the introduction of boron to flexible biaryl and triaryl derived from small achiral building blocks. All&#8208;ortho&#8208;fused azabora[7]helicenes feature exceptional configurational stability, blue or green fluorescence with quantum yields (&#934;fl) of 18&#8211;24&#8201;% in solution, green or yellow solid&#8208;state emission (&#934;fl up to 23&#8201;%), and strong chiroptical response with large dissymmetry factors of up to 1.12&#215;10&#8722;2. Azabora[9]helicenes consisting of angularly and linearly fused rings are blue emitters exhibiting &#934;fl of up to 47&#8201;% in CH2Cl2 and 25&#8201;% in the solid state. As revealed by the DFT calculations, their P&#8211;M interconversion pathway is more complex than that of H1. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis shows clear differences in the packing arrangement of methyl and phenyl derivatives. These molecules are proposed as primary structures of extended helices.

         <title>Metallic Barium: A Versatile and Efficient Hydrogenation Catalyst</title>

Just a pinch of Ba metal: Efficient hydrogenation of a wide range of substrates is achieved with metallic barium previously activated by metal vapor synthesis. A mechanism in which Ba0 and BaH2 are both essential is discussed.







Abstract
Ba metal was activated by evaporation and cocondensation with heptane. This black powder is a highly active hydrogenation catalyst for the reduction of a variety of unactivated (non&#8208;conjugated) mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, tetraphenylethylene, benzene, a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aldimines, ketimines and various pyridines. The performance of metallic Ba in hydrogenation catalysis tops that of the hitherto most active molecular group 2 metal catalysts. Depending on the substrate, two different catalytic cycles are proposed. A: a classical metal hydride cycle and B: the Ba metal cycle. The latter is proposed for substrates that are easily reduced by Ba0, that is, conjugated alkenes, alkynes, annulated rings, imines and pyridines. In addition, a mechanism in which Ba0 and BaH2 are both essential is discussed. DFT calculations on benzene hydrogenation with a simple model system (Ba/BaH2) confirm that the presence of metallic Ba has an accelerating effect.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective N&#8208;Formylation of Amines with CO2 and H2 Catalyzed by Porous Organometallic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4125-4132, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organometallic polymers (POMPs) with controllable porosity and enhanced CO2 adsorption capability were fabricated via the direct knitting strategy. Excellent selectivity and activity with a record turnover number (TON=1.58&#215;106) in the N&#8208;formylation reaction with CO2 and H2 to N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) were achieved under mild reaction conditions, and the POMPs could be reused up to 12 runs.







Abstract
The valorization of carbon dioxide (CO2) to fine chemicals is one of the most promising approaches for CO2 capture and utilization. Herein we demonstrated a series of porous organometallic polymers could be employed as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for this purpose. Synergetic effects of specific surface area, iridium content, and CO2 adsorption capability are crucial to achieve excellent selectivity and yields towards N&#8208;formylation of diverse amines with CO2 and H2 under mild reaction conditions even at 20&#8197;ppm catalyst loading. Density functional theory calculations revealed not only a redox&#8208;neutral catalytic pathway but also a new plausible mechanism with the incorporation of the key intermediate formic acid via a proton&#8208;relay process. Remarkably, a record turnover number (TON=1.58&#215;106) was achieved in the synthesis of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), and the solid catalysts can be reused up to 12 runs, highlighting their practical potential in industry.

         <title>The Network of Replication, Transcription, and Reverse Transcription of a Synthetic Genetic Cassette</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4175-4182, February 19, 2021. </description>

Alternative genetic information flow encoded in four non&#8208;canonical nucleotides can be carried out by natural biological systems. Natural polymerases can synthesize the entirely morphed DNA (DZA) using a DNA template that, in turn, can serve as a template to produce a fully modified RNA (RZA), and be reverse transcribed back to DZA. In bacteria, various DZA genes can successfully encode for a functional fluorescent protein.







Abstract
Synthetic nucleic acids, with four non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, can function as genetic materials. A comprehensive analysis of PCR amplification, transcription, reverse transcription, and cloning was done to screen for alternative genetic monomers. A small library of six modified nucleobases was selected: the modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (dZTPs) and ribonucleoside (rZTPs) triphosphates of 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;adenine, 5&#8208;chlorouracil, 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;guanine or inosine together with 5&#8208;fluorocytosine or 5&#8208;bromocytosine. The fragments composed of one to four modified nucleotides (denoted as DZA) have been successfully recognized and transcribed to natural or modified RNA (denoted as RZA) by T7 RNA polymerase. The fully modified RZA fragment could be reverse transcribed and then amplified in the presence of various dZTPs. Noticeably, modified fragments could function as genetic templates in&#8197;vivo by encoding the 678 base pair gene of a fluorescent protein in bacteria. These results demonstrate the existence of a fully simulated genetic circuit that uses synthetic materials.

         <title>Insights into the Redox Chemistry of Organosulfides Towards Stable Molecule Design in Nonaqueous Energy Storage Systems</title>

With the resonance strategy, a tetraethylthiuram disulfide molecule that shows high solubility in various organic solvents is explored as a promising active material for nonaqueous redox flow batteries based on the reversible redox chemistry of disulfide bonds. This work presents useful insights into designing stable organic redox&#8208;active molecules in nonaqueous systems.







Abstract
Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) have great potential to achieve high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, they have been limited by low solubility and poor stability of active materials. Here we demonstrate organosulfides as a new&#8208;type model material system to explore the rational design of redox&#8208;active molecules in nonaqueous systems. The tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TETD) molecule shows high solubility in various common organic solvents and achieves a high reversible capacity of ca. 50&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 at a high concentration of 1&#8197;M. The resonance structures in the reduced product endow the molecule with high electrochemical stability in different organic electrolytes. The underlying mechanism in redox chemistry of organodisulfides involving the cleavage and reformation of disulfide bonds is revealed by material/structural characterizations. This study provides a new perspective of molecule designs for the development of redox&#8208;active materials for high&#8208;performance nonaqueous RFBs.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Enabled General Radical Difluoromethylation Reaction with TMSCF2H</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4300-4306, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver&#8208;mediated oxidative difluoromethylation of styrenes and vinyltrifluoroborates with TMSCF2H to construct vinyl&#8722;CF2H bonds has been achieved for the first time. This protocol also provides a generic platform for radical difluoromethylation of a broad array of substrates including diverse alkenes, carboxylic acids, heteroarenes, and isonitriles, enabling expedient construction of diversified C&#8722;CF2H bonds.







Abstract
A silver&#8208;mediated oxidative difluoromethylation of styrenes and vinyl trifluoroborates with TMSCF2H is reported for the first time. This method enables direct and facile access to CF2H&#8208;alkenes from abundant alkenes with excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. Moreover, this Ag/TMSCF2H protocol could further enable a series of radical difluoromethylation reactions of a wide array of substrates, offering a generic and complementary platform for the construction of diversified C&#8722;CF2H bonds.

         <title>The Heterostructure of Ru2P/WO3/NPC Synergistically Promotes H2O Dissociation for Improved Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4110-4116, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterostructure of Ru2P/WO3@NPC was designed for electrochemically producing hydrogen in alkaline electrolyte. Electron transfer from NPC to Ru2P/WO3 and from Ru2P to WO3 accelerates the dissociation of water on W sites and desorption of hydrogen on Ru sites, thus promoting hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Facilitating the dissociation of water and desorption of hydrogen are both crucial challenges for improving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Herein, we report the synthesis of heterostructure of Ru2P/WO3@NPC (N, P co&#8208;doped carbon) by a simple hydrothermal reaction using ruthenium and tungsten salts as precursors, followed by pyrolyzing under an Ar atmosphere. The Ru2P/WO3@NPC electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding HER activity with an overpotential of 15&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and excellent durability in a 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and most reported electrocatalysts. Experimental results combined with density functional calculations reveal that the electron density redistribution in Ru2P/WO3@NPC is achieved by electron transfer from NPC to Ru2P/WO3 and from Ru2P to WO3, which directly promotes the dissociation of water on W sites in WO3 and desorption of hydrogen on Ru sites in Ru2P.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Gated Adaptation of Hydrogel Properties via Photo&#8208;Dynamic Multivalency in Associative Star Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4358-4367, February 19, 2021. </description>

Hydrogels adapt to different colors of light: This study introduces how the mechanical properties of photo&#8208;dynamic hydrogels precisely and reversibly adapt to light of different wavelengths by engineering photo&#8208;switchable multivalency effects in star polymer networks.







Abstract
Responsive materials, such as switchable hydrogels, have been largely engineered for maximum changes between two states. In contrast, adaptive systems target distinct functional plateaus between these maxima. Here, we demonstrate how the photostationary state (PSS) of an E/Z&#8208;arylazopyrazole photoswitch can be tuned by the incident wavelength across a wide color spectrum, and how this behavior can be exploited to engineer the photo&#8208;dynamic mechanical properties of hydrogels based on multivalent photoswitchable interactions. We show that these hydrogels adapt to the wavelength&#8208;dependent PSS and the number of arylazopyrazole units by programmable relationships. Hence, our material design enables the facile adjustment of the mechanical properties without laborious synthetic efforts. The concept goes beyond the classical switching from state A to B, and demonstrates pathways for a truly wavelength&#8208;gated adaptation of hydrogel properties potentially useful to engineer cell fate or in soft robotics.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Bidentate (P^N)Gold(III) Fluoride Complexes: Reactivity Platforms for Reductive Elimination Studies</title>

A new family of cationic bidentate (P^N)gold(III) fluoride complexes has been prepared and characterized. Ligand exchange with C(sp)&#8208;based nucleophiles enabled the first study of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) reductive elimination on (P^N)gold(III) species.







Abstract
A new family of cationic, bidentate (P^N)gold(III) fluoride complexes has been prepared and a detailed characterization of the gold&#8208;fluoride bond has been carried out. Our results correlate with the observed reactivity of the fluoro ligand, which undergoes facile exchange with both cyano and acetylene nucleophiles. The resulting (P^N)arylgold(III)C(sp) complexes have enabled the first study of reductive elimination on (P^N)gold(III) systems, which demonstrated that C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp) bond formation occurs at higher rates than those reported for analogous phosphine&#8208;based monodentate systems.

An unprecedented dyotropic rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactones has been realized, which provides an enabling tool for the synthesis of various structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones. Distinct from conventional dyotropic rearrangements, the present reactions proceed through either an asynchronous concerted or a stepwise mechanism.







Abstract
An unprecedented strain&#8208;driven dyotropic rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactones has been realized, which enables the efficient access of a wide range of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones displaying remarkable structural diversity. Several appealing features of the reaction, including excellent efficiency, high stereospecificity, predictable chemoselectivity and broad substrate scope, render it a powerful tool for the synthesis of MBL&#8208;containing molecules of either natural or synthetic origin. Both experimental and computational evidences suggest that the new variant of dyotropic rearrangements proceed in a dualistic pattern: while an asynchronous concerted mechanism most likely accounts for the reactions featuring hydrogen migration, a stepwise process involving a phenonium ion intermediate is favored in the cases of aryl migration. The great synthetic potential of the title reaction is exemplified by its application to the efficient construction of several natural products and relevant scaffolds.

A Rh&#8208;chiral diphosphine complex was found to catalyze desymmetrization of dihydrosilanes by formal intramolecular Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H dehydrogenative coupling reactions. This simple, mild, and practical method results in unprecedently high enantioselectivity and a broad substrate scope. The chiral monohydrosilanes could be further elaborated into various stereogenic silicon compounds in a stereospecific manner.







Abstract
The preparation of chiral monohydrosilanes remains a rarely achieved goal. To this end a Rh&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of dihydrosilanes by way of intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization under simple and mild conditions has now been developed. This method provides easy access to a broad range of chiral monohydrosilanes in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The resulting monohydrosilanes constitute a good platform to access stereogenic silicon compounds, as well as useful compounds to probe silicon stereochemistry.

         <title>Dynamic Activation of Adsorbed Intermediates via Axial Traction for the Promoted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>

An axial traction strategy is presented to reduce the energy barrier of the dynamic activation process over the M&#8208;N4 structure for boosting CO2RR activity.







Abstract
Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (M&#8208;N4) to accelerate overall reaction dynamics of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted extensive attention. Herein, we develop an axial traction strategy to optimize the electronic structure of the M&#8208;N4 moiety and construct atomically dispersed nickel sites coordinated with four nitrogen atoms and one axial oxygen atom, which are embedded within the carbon matrix (Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C). The Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C electrocatalyst exhibited excellent CO2RR performance with a maximum CO Faradic efficiency (FE) close to 100&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. The CO FE could be maintained above 90&#8201;% in a wide range of potential window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V. The superior CO2RR activity is due to the Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O active moiety composed of a Ni&#8208;N4 site with an additional oxygen atom that induces an axial traction effect.

         <title>Evidence of Highly Anharmonic Soft Lattice Vibrations in a Zintl Rattler</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4259-4265, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct evidences of bonding hierarchy and anharmonicity using the pair distribution function (PDF) and its consequent soft optical vibrations as observed from inelastic neutron scattering (INS) gives rise to low energy optical phonons. This effect scatters the heat carrying acoustic phonons and lowers the lattice thermal conductivity in Zintl type TlInTe2.







Abstract
Here, we present lattice dynamics associated with the local chemical bonding hierarchy in Zintl compound TlInTe2, which cause intriguing phonon excitations and strongly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity to an ultralow value (0.46&#8211;0.31&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1) in the 300&#8211;673&#8197;K. We established an intrinsic rattling nature in TlInTe2 by studying the local structure and phonon vibrations using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function (PDF) (100&#8211;503&#8197;K) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) (5&#8211;450&#8197;K), respectively. We showed that while 1D chain of covalently bonded 
 transport heat with Debye type phonon excitation, ionically bonded Tl rattles with a frequency ca. 30&#8197;cm&#8722;1 inside distorted Thompson cage formed by 
. This highly anharmonic Tl rattling causes strong phonon scattering and consequently phonon lifetime reduces to ultralow value of ca. 0.66(6)&#8197;ps, resulting in ultralow thermal conductivity in TlInTe2.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells with Imidazolium&#8208;Based Ionic Liquid for Surface Passivation and Charge Transport</title>

An ionic liquid, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMIMPF6), was used to passivate a perovskite to decrease the defects of Pb&#8208;cluster and Pb&#8208;I antisite, thereby reducing the energy barrier between the perovskite and hole transport layer. A perovskite solar cell attained a 23.25&#8201;% efficiency with a high stability due to hydrophobic DMIMPF6.







Abstract
Surface defects have been a key constraint for perovskite photovoltaics. Herein, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMIMPF6) ionic liquid (IL) is adopted to passivate the surface of a formamidinium&#8208;cesium lead iodide perovskite (Cs0.08FA0.92PbI3) and also reduce the energy barrier between the perovskite and hole transport layer. Theoretical simulations and experimental results demonstrate that Pb&#8208;cluster and Pb&#8208;I antisite defects can be effectively passivated by [DMIM]+ bonding with the Pb2+ ion on the perovskite surface, leading to significantly suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. As a result, the solar cell efficiency was increased to 23.25&#8201;% from 21.09&#8201;%. Meanwhile, the DMIMPF6&#8208;treated perovskite device demonstrated long&#8208;term stability because the hydrophobic DMIMPF6 layer blocked moisture permeation.

A castor&#8208;oil&#8208;based waterborne polyurethane (WPU) with high strength was developed. The PU networks demonstrated high tensile strength up to 38&#8197;MPa, excellent self&#8208;healing with a tensile strength of 100&#8201;%, and a maximum recovery of 100&#8201;% of the original mechanical strength after reprocessing four times. The broad glass&#8208;transition temperature of the samples endows the films with shape&#8208;memory effects.







Abstract
Materials with multifunctionality or multiresponsiveness, especially polymers derived from green, renewable precursors, have recently attracted significant attention resulting from their technological impact. Nowadays, vegetable&#8208;oil&#8208;based waterborne polyurethanes (WPUs) are widely used in various fields, while strategies for simultaneous realization of their self&#8208;healing, reprocessing, shape memory as well as high mechanical properties are still highly anticipated. We report development of a multifunctional castor&#8208;oil&#8208;based waterborne polyurethane with high strength using controlled amounts of dithiodiphenylamine. The polymer networks possessed high tensile strength up to 38&#8197;MPa as well as excellent self&#8208;healing efficiency. Moreover, the WPU film exhibited a maximum recovery of 100&#8201;% of the original mechanical properties after reprocessing four times. The broad glass&#8208;transition temperature of the samples endowed the films with a versatile shape&#8208;memory effect, including a dual&#8208;to&#8208;quadruple shape&#8208;memory effect.

The program package autodE transforms mechanistic hypotheses from 2D chemical sketches to conformationally sampled 3D geometries using current computational best practices. Amongst other functions, autodE can generate full reaction profiles for complex reactions in a fully automated way.







Abstract
Calculating reaction energy profiles to aid in mechanistic elucidation has long been the domain of the expert computational chemist. Here, we introduce autodE (https://github.com/duartegroup/autodE), an open&#8208;source Python package capable of locating transition states (TSs) and minima and delivering a full reaction energy profile from 1D or 2D chemical representations. autodE is broadly applicable to study organic and organometallic reaction classes, including addition, substitution, elimination, migratory insertion, oxidative addition, and reductive elimination; it accounts for conformational sampling of both minima and TSs and is compatible with many electronic structure packages. The general applicability of autodE is demonstrated in complex multi&#8208;step reactions, including cobalt&#8208; and rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation and an Ireland&#8211;Claisen rearrangement.

         <title>A Novel Class of 1H&#8208;MRI Contrast Agents Based on the Relaxation Enhancement Induced on Water Protons by 14N&#8208;Containing Imidazole Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4208-4214, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed new, metal&#8208;free, MRI contrast agents that differ completely from current clinical contrast agents, which contain potentially toxic paramagnetic metals. These sensors enhance image contrast thanks to the 14N of imidazole groups of histidine, which are conjugated to the PLGA polymeric chains forming pH&#8208;sensitive, biocompatible, and biodegradable nanoparticles.







Abstract
This study reports the development of a completely new class of MRI contrast agents, displaying remarkable relaxation effects in the absence of paramagnetic metal ions. Their detection requires the acquisition of images at variable magnetic field strength as provided by fast field cycling imaging scanners. They contain poly&#8208;histidine chains (poly&#8208;His), whose imidazole groups generate 14N&#8208;quadrupolar&#8208;peaks that cause a relaxation enhancement of water protons at a frequency (1.38&#177;0.3&#8197;MHz) that is readily detectable from the frequencies associated with endogenous proteins. The poly&#8208;His quadrupolar peaks are detectable only when the polymer is in a solid&#8208;like form, that is, at pH&gt;6.6. Above this value, their intensity is pH dependent and can be used to report on the occurring pH changes. On this basis, the poly&#8208;His moieties were conjugated to biocompatible polymers, such as polylactic and glycolic acid, in order to form stable nanoparticles able to encapsulate structured water in their core. FFC images were acquired to assess their contrast&#8208;generating ability.

         <title>A 34&#8208;Electron Superatom Ag78 Cluster with Regioselective Ternary Ligands Shells and Its 2D Rhombic Superlattice Assembly</title>

SD/Ag78a shows a core&#8211;shell structure comprised of an all&#8208;metallic Ag53 kernel surrounded by an Ag25 discontinuous metal&#8211;organic shell. Thiolate, phosphine, and chloride ligands are shown to regioselectively ligate on the surface of the Ag78 nanocluster.







Abstract
Herein, we report a 78&#8208;nuclei silver nanocluster (NC) [Ag78(iPrPhS)30(dppm)10Cl10]4+ (SD/Ag78a; dppm=bis&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)methane) that was synthesized through a one&#8208;pot reaction using [Ag(pz)]n as precursor (Hpz=pyrazole) and further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. SD/Ag78a shows a core&#8211;shell structure comprised of an all&#8208;metallic Ag53 kernel surrounded by an Ag25 discontinuous metal&#8211;organic shell. The Ag53 kernel is an Ag13 Ino decahedron encaged by an Ag40 drum&#8208;like shell, while the Ag25 shell consists of two Ag10S10P10Cl5 rings and five S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples. Three types of ligands regioselectively cap on the surface of the Ag78 NC, forming diverse metal&#8211;ligand interfacial structures. The NC is a closed&#8208;shell 34&#8208;electron superatom with +4 charge state and shows highly featured molecule&#8208;like absorption spectra in the UV/Vis region with a maximum around 493&#8197;nm. The rhombic superlattice assembled from SD/Ag78a through intercluster C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions can be formed by a simple drop&#8208;casting treatment.

Cs2CO3 reaction system enables stereospecific reaction of functionalized tertiary alkyl bromides and bulky alcohols. The reaction occurred with retention of configuration. 







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitutions, including SN1 and SN2, are classical and reliable reactions, but a serious drawback is their intolerance for both bulky nucleophiles and chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles for the synthesis of a chiral quaternary carbon center. An SRN1 reaction via a radical species is another conventional method used to carry out substitution reactions of bulky nucleophiles and alkyl halides, but chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles cannot be used. Therefore, a stereospecific nucleophilic substitution reaction using chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles and bulky nucleophiles has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we describe the reaction of tertiary alkyl alcohols and non&#8208;chiral or chiral &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides as a tertiary alkyl source for the formation of congested ether compounds possessing two different tertiary alkyl groups on the oxygen atom with stereoretention.

Carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate, a multifunctional C1&#8208;building block, was shown to be an excellent in situ CO surrogate. A variety of (hetero)aromatic amides, esters, ketones, and ynones were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields under palladium&#8208;catalyzed conditions without the use of a pressurized apparatus or a two&#8208;chamber set up. MIDA=N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid.







Abstract
The application of carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate (MIDA=N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) as an in situ CO surrogate for various palladium&#8208;catalyzed transformations is described. Carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate was previously shown to be a bench&#8208;stable boron&#8208;containing building block for the synthesis of borylated heterocycles. The present study demonstrates that, in addition to its utility as a precursor to heterocycle synthesis, carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate is an excellent in situ CO surrogate that is tolerant of reactive functionalities such as amines, alcohols, and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles. Its wide functional&#8208;group compatibility is highlighted in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, carbonylative Sonogashira coupling, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of aryl halides. A variety of amides, esters, (hetero)aromatic ynones, and bis(hetero)aryl ketones were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields in a one&#8208;pot fashion.

A variety of amides, esters, (hetero)aromatic ynones, and bis(hetero)aryl ketones were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields in a one&#8208;pot fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dissecting the Role of the Sergeants in Supramolecular Helical Catalysts: From Chain Capping to Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4183-4191, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;assemblies between a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) ligand (soldier) and different types of enantiopure BTAs (sergeants) are evaluated as helical catalysts. The selectivity is related to the helicity and structure of the supramolecular helices (length, composition) which strongly depend on the role adopted by the sergeant in the co&#8208;assembly process (from intercalation to pure chain capping).







Abstract
Controlling the properties of supramolecular assemblies requires unveiling the specific interactions between their components. In the present work, the catalytic properties and structure of co&#8208;assemblies composed of a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) ligand coordinated to copper (the soldier) and seven enantiopure BTAs (the sergeants) have been determined. Whatever the sergeant, the enantioselectivity of the reaction is directly proportional to the optical purity of the supramolecular helices. More strikingly, the role played by the sergeant in the co&#8208;assembly process differs significantly: from almost pure intercalator (when it is incorporated in the stacks of the soldier and generates long homochiral helices) to pure chain capper (when it leads to the formation of partly helically biased and short assemblies). The former situation leads to optimal enantioselectivity for the catalytic system under study (58&#8201;% ee) while the latter situation leads to very low selectivity (8&#8201;% ee). The successful rationalization of this high and unexpected difference is crucial for the development of more efficient catalysts and more elaborate supramolecular systems.

         <title>The Origin of Selective Adsorption of CO2 on Merlinoite Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4307-4314, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dominant mechanism of selective CO2 adsorption on intermediate&#8208;silica small&#8208;pore zeolites can change from cation gating to cooperative cation gating&#8208;breathing to breathing, depending on both the framework Si/Al ratio (or alkali cation concentration) and extraframework cation type and thus location, as well as on the framework topology.







Abstract
The CO2 adsorption behavior at 25&#8211;75&#8201;&#176;C and 0&#8211;1.0&#8197;bar of various alkali cation&#8208;exchanged forms of merlinoite (framework type MER) zeolites with Si/Al=2.3 and 3.8 is described. The adsorption isotherms at 25&#8201;&#176;C on the Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ forms of MER zeolite with Si/Al=2.3 are characterized by a clear step, the CO2 pressure of which differs notably according to the type of their extraframework cations. Structural analysis shows that CO2 adsorption on the former three zeolites includes the relocation of gating cations with high site occupancy and the remarkable concomitant structural breathing. We define this unusual adsorption phenomenon as a cooperative cation gating&#8208;breathing mechanism. The overall results suggest that the actual mechanism of selective CO2 adsorption on intermediate&#8208;silica small&#8208;pore zeolites can change from cation gating to cooperative cation gating&#8208;breathing to breathing, depending on a combination of their topological and compositional flexibilities.

         <title>Pathway and Length Control of Supramolecular Polymers in Aqueous Media via a Hydrogen Bonding Lock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4368-4376, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Length and pathway control of BODIPY&#8208;based supramolecular polymers in aqueous media has been achieved by programmable hydrogen bonding (intra&#8208; vs. intermolecular) using a new N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)amide supramolecular synthon as a hydrogen bonding lock. These findings open up new directions in the field of controlled supramolecular polymerization.







Abstract
Programming the organization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems into nanostructures of defined dimensions is a requirement for the preparation of functional materials. Herein, we have achieved high&#8208;precision control over the self&#8208;assembly pathways and fiber length of an amphiphilic BODIPY dye in aqueous media by exploiting a programmable hydrogen bonding lock. The presence of a (2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)amide group in the target BODIPY enables different types of intra&#8208; vs. intermolecular hydrogen bonding, leading to a competition between kinetically controlled discoidal H&#8208;type aggregates and thermodynamically controlled 1D J&#8208;type fibers in water. The high stability of the kinetic state, which is dominated by the hydrophobic effect, is reflected in the slow transformation to the thermodynamic product (several weeks at room temperature). However, this lag time can be suppressed by the addition of seeds from the thermodynamic species, enabling us to obtain supramolecular polymers of tuneable length in water for multiple cycles.

For typical electro&#8208;organic synthetic systems, three electro&#8208;descriptors, onset potential (Eonset), Tafel slope and effective voltage (Eeffective) are identified from CV diagram to characterize thermodynamic, electro&#8208;kinetic and empirical aspects of a given electro&#8208;organic reaction, providing an effective and powerful tool for machine learning or direct visual prediction of the reaction yield.







Abstract
Electrochemical organic synthesis has attracted increasing attentions as a sustainable and versatile synthetic platform. Quantitative assessment of the electro&#8208;organic reactions, including reaction thermodynamics, electro&#8208;kinetics, and coupled chemical processes, can lead to effective analytical tool to guide their future design. Herein, we demonstrate that electrochemical parameters such as onset potential, Tafel slope, and effective voltage can be utilized as electro&#8208;descriptors for the evaluation of reaction conditions and prediction of reactivities (yields). An &#8220;electro&#8208;descriptor&#8208;diagram&#8221; is generated, where reactive and non&#8208;reactive conditions/substances show distinct boundary. Successful predictions of reaction outcomes have been demonstrated using electro&#8208;descriptor diagram, or from machine learning algorithms with experimentally&#8208;derived electro&#8208;descriptors. This method represents a promising tool for data&#8208;acquisition, reaction prediction, mechanistic investigation, and high&#8208;throughput screening for general organic electro&#8208;synthesis.

         <title>Mild and Robust Stille Reactions in Water using Parts Per Million Levels of a Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Based Palladacycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4158-4163, February 19, 2021. </description>

Highly valued Stille couplings can now be done not only in water under mild reaction conditions, but with only 500&#8211;1000&#8197;ppm of Pd ligated with triphenylphosphine, derived from a new and readily prepared palladacycle.







Abstract
An inexpensive and new triphenylphosphine&#8208;based palladacycle has been developed as a pre&#8208;catalyst, leading to highly effective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions in water under mild reaction conditions. Only 500&#8211;1000&#8197;ppm of Pd suffices for couplings involving a variety of aryl/heteroaryl halides with aryl/hetaryl stannanes. Several drug intermediates can be prepared using this catalyst in aqueous nanoreactors formed by 2&#8197;wt&#8201;% Brij&#8208;30 in water.

&lt;p&gt;Highly valued Stille couplings can now be done not only in water under mild reaction conditions, but with only 500&#8211;1000&#8197;ppm of Pd ligated with triphenylphosphine, derived from a new and readily prepared palladacycle.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inexpensive and new triphenylphosphine&#8208;based palladacycle has been developed as a pre&#8208;catalyst, leading to highly effective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions in water under mild reaction conditions. Only 500&#8211;1000&#8197;ppm of Pd suffices for couplings involving a variety of aryl/heteroaryl halides with aryl/hetaryl stannanes. Several drug intermediates can be prepared using this catalyst in aqueous nanoreactors formed by 2&#8197;wt&#8201;% Brij&#8208;30 in water.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boosting the Energy Density of Aqueous Batteries via Facile Grotthuss Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4169-4174, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the promoting mechanism of Ni&#8208;doping on the Grotthuss proton transport in [2&#215;2] tunnels of &#945;&#8208;MnO2, attributing to a promoted TO distortion, which presents a general strategy for regulating the proton transport inside the tunnel structure of MnO2, as well as for designing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for future aqueous batteries.







Abstract
The recent developments in rechargeable aqueous batteries have witnessed a burgeoning interest in the mechanism of proton transport in the cathode materials. Herein, for the first time, we report the Grotthuss proton transport mechanism in &#945;&#8208;MnO2 which features wide [2&#215;2] tunnels. Exemplified by the substitution doping of Ni (&#8776;5 at.%) in &#945;&#8208;MnO2 that increases the energy density of the electrode by &#8776;25&#8201;%, we reveal a close link between the tetragonal&#8208;orthorhombic (TO) distortion of the lattice and the diffusion kinetics of protons in the tunnels. Experimental and theoretical results verify that Ni dopants can exacerbate the TO distortion during discharge, thereby facilitating the hydrogen bond formation in bulk &#945;&#8208;MnO2. The isolated direct hopping mode of proton transport is switched to a facile concerted mode, which involves the formation and concomitant cleavage of O&#8722;H bonds in a proton array, namely via Grotthuss proton transport mechanism. Our study provides important insight towards the understanding of proton transport in MnO2 and can serve as a model for the compositional design of cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Identifying the Critical Anion&#8211;Cation Coordination to Regulate the Electric Double Layer for an Efficient Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4215-4220, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electric double layer chemistry and structure are identified to play a predominate role in governing the competitive reactions during solid electrolyte interphase formation on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. This knowledge affords critical guidance on the targeted interface design to enable a stable working lithium anode.







Abstract
The persistent efforts to reveal the formation and evolution mechanisms of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are of fundamental significance for the rational regulation. In this work, through combined theoretical and experimental model investigations, we elucidate that the electric double layer (EDL) chemistry at the electrode/electrolyte interface beyond the thermodynamic stability of electrolyte components predominately controls the competitive reduction reactions during SEI construction on Li metal anode. Specifically, the negatively&#8208;charged surface of Li metal will prompt substantial cation enrichment and anion deficiency within the EDL. Necessarily, only the species participating in the solvation shell of cations could be electrostatically accumulated in proximity of Li metal surface and thereafter be preferentially reduced during sustained dynamic cycling. Incorporating multi&#8208;valent cation additives to more effectively drag the favorable anionic SEI enablers into EDL is validated as a promising strategy to upgrade the Li protection performance. The conclusions drawn herein afford deeper understandings to bridge the EDL principle, cation solvation, and SEI formation, shedding fresh light on the targeted regulation of reactive alkali metal interfaces.

         <title>Insights into the Capacity and Rate Performance of Transition&#8208;Metal Coordination Compounds for Reversible Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4142-4149, February 19, 2021. </description>

A remarkable improvement in capacity and rate performance for reversible lithium storage was obtained by changing the metal center in isostructural coordination compounds. DFT calculations and kinetic analysis revealed the influence of the metal center on the lithium&#8208;storage mechanism of coordination compounds.







Abstract
Coordination compounds are well&#8208;known compounds that are being used as new materials for lithium storage because of their unique advantages, that is, designable structures, abundant active sites, and facile as well as mild synthetic routes. However, the electrode stability, low rate performance, and cycle life of coordination compounds are currently the main issues preventing their application as electrode materials, and the lithium&#8208;storage mechanism in coordination networks is not well understood. Herein, isostructural one&#8208;dimensional coordination compounds were synthesized to study their lithium&#8208;storage performance. Co&#8208;HIPA and Ni&#8208;HIPA showed superior electrolyte stability than other M&#8208;HIPAs, and Co&#8208;HIPA displayed a superior reversible capacity and cycle stability, excellent rate performance, and clear voltage platform. DFT calculations and kinetic analysis revealed the influence of the metal center with different electronic structures on the lithium&#8208;storage mechanism.

An organoplatinum(II) complex exhibits ratiometric dual emission on assembly via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The excellent and unique characteristics of the complex enable the tracking of cell apoptosis, necrosis, and the inflammation process in zebrafish.







Abstract
The organoplatinum(II) complex [Pt(C^N^N)(Cl)] (C^N^N=5,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, Pt1) can assemble into nanoaggregates via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and complementary hydrogen bonds, rather than Pt&#8211;Pt interactions. Pt1 exhibits ratiometric dual emission, including rare blue emission (&#955;em=445&#8197;nm) and assembly&#8208;induced yellow emission (&#955;em=573&#8197;nm), under one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excitation. Pt1 displays blue emission in cells with an intact membrane due to its low cellular uptake. In cells where the membrane is disrupted, uptake of the complex is increased and at higher concentrations yellow emission is observed. The ratio of yellow to blue emission shows a linear relationship to the loss of cell membrane integrity. Pt1 is, to our knowledge, the first example of an assembly&#8208;induced two&#8208;photon ratiometric dual emission organoplatinum complex. The excellent and unique characteristics of the complex enabled its use for the tracking of cell apoptosis, necrosis, and the inflammation process in zebrafish.

         <title>Gel&#8208;Derived Amorphous Bismuth&#8211;Nickel Alloy Promotes Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation via Optimizing Nitrogen Adsorption and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4275-4281, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D amorphous BiNi alloy gives a significantly enhanced electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation. Ni substitution in Bi enables the chemisorption of nitrogen and a lower &#916;G for *NNH formation. Enhanced electron transfer and increased electrochemical surface area in the interconnected porous scaffold allow its efficient and stable activity for potential practical applications.







Abstract

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries by a Weakly Solvating Electrolyte**

A weakly solvating electrolyte affords a new path towards anion&#8208;derived interfacial chemistry in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. By formulating electrolyte with a non&#8208;polar solvent, ion pairs and aggregates prevail under normal concentrations and give rise to anion&#8208;derived interphases on graphite electrodes with superior electrochemical performances.







Abstract
The performance of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is highly dependent on their interfacial chemistry, which is regulated by electrolytes. Conventional electrolyte typically contains polar solvents to dissociate Li salts. Herein we report a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) that consists of a pure non&#8208;polar solvent, which leads to a peculiar solvation structure where ion pairs and aggregates prevail under a low salt concentration of 1.0&#8197;M. Importantly, WSE forms unique anion&#8208;derived interphases on graphite electrodes that exhibit fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;term cycling characteristics. First&#8208;principles calculations unravel a general principle that the competitive coordination between anions and solvents to Li ions is the origin of different interfacial chemistries. By bridging the gap between solution thermodynamics and interfacial chemistry in batteries, this work opens a brand&#8208;new way towards precise electrolyte engineering for energy storage devices with desired properties.

         <title>An Unexpected Split&#8208;Merge Pathway in the Assembly of the Symmetric Nonribosomal Peptide Antibiotic Closthioamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4104-4109, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Closthioamide is a symmetric perthioamidated nonribosomal peptide (NRP) produced by an atypical NRP&#8208;synthetase&#8208;independent biosynthetic pathway. Using a combination of genome editing and in&#8197;vitro biochemical assays, we elucidated the last steps of closthioamide biosynthesis and found an unexpected asymmetrical route involving novel enzyme functions for members of the aldo&#8208;keto reductase and transglutaminase protein families.







Abstract
Closthioamide (CTA) is a symmetric nonribosomal peptide (NRP) comprised of two diaminopropane&#8208;linked polythioamidated monomers. CTA is biosynthesized by Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum via an atypical NRP synthetase (NRPS)&#8208;independent biosynthetic pathway. Although the logic for monomer assembly was recently elucidated, the strategy for the biosynthesis and incorporation of the diamine linker remained a mystery. By means of genome editing, synthesis, and in&#8197;vitro biochemical assays, we demonstrate that the final steps in CTA maturation proceed through a surprising split&#8208;merge pathway involving the dual use of a thiotemplated intermediate. This pathway includes the first examples of an aldo&#8208;keto reductase catalyzing the reductive release of a thiotemplated product, and of a transthioamidating transglutaminase. In addition to clarifying the remaining steps in CTA assembly, our data shed light on largely unexplored pathways for NRPS&#8208;independent peptide biosynthesis.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Activation of Dual Catalytic and Anti&#8208;Cancer Activities of Organogold(I) Complexes in Living Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4133-4141, February 19, 2021. </description>

A novel bioorthogonal activation approach based on Pd(II)&#8208;mediated transmetallation was developed to controllably activate stable organometallic NHC&#8211;gold(I)&#8211;phenylacetylide complex. The gold(I) complex, upon transmetallation activation, can catalyze alkyne &#960;&#8208;bond activations and can meanwhile potently inhibit thioredoxin reductase and induce cytotoxicity towards cancer cells in vitro and in vivo with high spatiotemporal selectivity.







Abstract
Controllably activating the bio&#8208;reactivity of metal complexes in living systems is challenging but highly desirable because it can minimize off&#8208;target bindings and improve spatiotemporal specificity. Herein, we report a new bioorthogonal activation approach by employing Pd(II)&#8208;triggered transmetallation reactions to conditionally activate the bio&#8208;reactivity of NHC&#8211;Au(I)&#8211;phenylacetylide complexes (1&#8201;a) in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. A combination of 1H&#8197;NMR, LC&#8208;MS, DFT calculation and fluorescence screening assays reveals that 1&#8201;a displays a reasonable stability against biological thiols, but its phenylacetylide ligand can be efficiently transferred to Pd(II), leading to in&#8197;situ formation of labile NHC&#8211;Au(I) species that is catalytically active inside living cells and zebrafish, and can meanwhile effectively suppress the activity of thioredoxin reductase, potently inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and efficiently suppress angiogenesis in zebrafish models.

         <title>Tag&#8208;Free Internal RNA Labeling and Photocaging Based on mRNA Methyltransferases</title>

The N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase METTL3&#8208;METTL14 shows remarkable cosubstrate promiscuity, enabling sequence&#8208;specific internal labeling of RNA. The transfer of ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl and 6&#8208;nitropiperonyl groups allows enzymatic photocaging of RNA. METTL16 is less promiscuous but suitable for chemo&#8208;enzymatic labeling via click chemistry. Since both enzymes act on distinct sequence motifs, their combination enables the modification of different sites in a single RNA.







Abstract
The mRNA modification N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) is associated with multiple roles in cell function and disease. The methyltransferases METTL3&#8208;METTL14 and METTL16 act as &#8220;writers&#8221; for different target transcripts and sequence motifs. The modification is perceived by dedicated &#8220;reader&#8221; and &#8220;eraser&#8221; proteins, but not by polymerases. We report that METTL3&#8208;14 shows remarkable cosubstrate promiscuity, enabling sequence&#8208;specific internal labeling of RNA without additional guide RNAs. The transfer of ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl and 6&#8208;nitropiperonyl groups allowed enzymatic photocaging of RNA in the consensus motif, which impaired polymerase&#8208;catalyzed primer extension in a reversible manner. METTL16 was less promiscuous but suitable for chemo&#8208;enzymatic labeling using different types of click chemistry. Since both enzymes act on distinct sequence motifs, their combination allowed orthogonal chemo&#8208;enzymatic modification of different sites in a single RNA.

         <title>Anisotropic Seeded Growth of Ag Nanoplates Confined in Shape&#8208;Deformable Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4117-4124, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic seeded growth of silver nanoplates is performed in a shape&#8208;deformable polymer shell. The deformability of the shell provides unique adaptive control to the anisotropic growth and eventually turns itself into a conformal coating to protect the enclosed nanostructure against oxidative etching.







Abstract
Conventional templating synthesis confines the growth of seeds in rigid spaces to achieve faithful morphological replication. Herein, we explore the use of spherical shape&#8208;deformable polymeric nanoshells to regulate the anisotropic growth of Ag nanoplates. The flexible shells deform adaptively to accommodate the initial overgrowth of the seeds but restrict the growth in the directions where the shells are fully stretched, eventually producing nanoplates with an unconventional circular profile. The diameter of the final Ag nanoplates can be precisely predicted by stretching and flattering the nanoshells into a plate&#8208;like capsule while retaining their original internal surface area. Furthermore, unlike conventional templates, the polymer shells eventually turn themselves into a conformal coating that binds to the surface of the full&#8208;grown Ag nanoplates and significantly enhances their stability against oxidative etching.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;K2Sb(P2O7)F: Cairo Pentagonal Layer with Bifunctional Genes Reveal Optical Performance&#8221;</title>

Abstract
Compounds with the fresnoite structure type possess remarkable chemical diversity and a range of unique physical properties, including nonlinear optical (NLO) activity. K2Sb(P2O7)F, which was reported recently, belongs to this group and its structure is not novel in terms of either the topology or local coordination geometry around the Sb3+ cations. The crystallographic disorder observed in the fresnoite&#8208;type structures can be explained by twinning, which is frequent for non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystals.

Abstract
In their Correspondence, Sergey&#8197;V. Krivovichev and Luca Bindi argue that the novel excellent nonlinear optical material antimony pyrophosphate, K2Sb(P2O7)F, reported in our Research Article published in this journal belongs to the fresnoite Ba2[TiO(Si2O7)] group and its structure is not novel in terms of either topology or local coordination geometry around Sb3+ cations. We clarify that the statements regarding structural features of our original paper are valid in context.

Batteries By formulating electrolyte with a non&#8208;polar solvent, ion pairs and aggregates prevail under normal concentrations and give rise to anion&#8208;derived interphases on graphite electrodes with superior electrochemical performances. This concept is demonstrated by Qiang Zhang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;4090.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanoparticles: An Emerging Versatile Platform for Cancer Therapy</title>

This minireview surveys recent advances in research on molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) for cancer therapy and highlights the distinct features of nanoMIPs for the rational design and construction of cancer nanomedicines with desired performances, including extended circulation, active targeting, controlled drug release, and antitumor efficacy.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are chemically synthesized affinity materials with tailor&#8208;made binding cavities complementary to the template molecules in shape, size, and functionality. Recently, engineering MIP&#8208;based nanomedicines to improve cancer therapy has become a rapidly growing field and future research direction. Because of the unique properties and functions of MIPs, MIP&#8208;based nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) are not only alternatives to current nanomaterials for cancer therapy, but also hold the potential to fill gaps associated with biological ligand&#8208;based nanomedicines, such as immunogenicity, stability, applicability, and economic viability. Here, we survey recent advances in the design and fabrication of nanoMIPs for cancer therapy and highlight their distinct features. In addition, how to use these features to achieve desired performance, including extended circulation, active targeting, controlled drug release and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, is discussed and summarized. We expect that this minireview will inspire more advanced studies in MIP&#8208;based nanomedicines for cancer therapy.

This minireview highlights the recent progress in and emerging applications of cucurbituril&#8208;based biomacromolecular assemblies with peptides, nucleic acids, and proteins. This rapidly developing area involves precise control over intermolecular communication at multidimensional levels and holds great promise for the creation of innovative biomaterials and therapeutic methods.







Abstract
The construction of controlled biomacromolecular assemblies has become a thriving area of supramolecular chemistry. In this context, cucurbiturils (CBs), a class of macrocyclic receptors having robust skeletons, hydrophobic cavities, and carbonyl&#8208;laced portals, have been drawn into the limelight because of their advantageous molecular recognition characteristics with a variety of biomacromolecules, including peptides, nucleic acids, and proteins. In this minireview, we focus on the impressive advances in CB&#8208;based biomacromolecular assemblies, such as in biosensors and assays, the regulation of biochemical reactions, and the treatment of serious diseases. CB&#8208;promoted subcellular bioimaging has also been demonstrated in different organelles. The case studies presented herein demonstrate the numerous applications, from fundamental research to translational applications, of diverse CB&#8208;based supra/biomacromolecular architectures.

         <title>Understanding the Interaction of Polyelectrolyte Architectures with Proteins and Biosystems</title>

Polyelectrolytes such as DNA or heparin are long linear or branched macromolecules onto which charges are appended. The counterions neutralizing these charges can dissociate in water and this will largely determine the interaction of such polyelectrolytes with biomolecules, particularly with proteins. This Review discusses studies on the interaction of proteins with polyelectrolytes and how this knowledge can be used for medical applications.







Abstract
The counterions neutralizing the charges on polyelectrolytes such as DNA or heparin may dissociate in water and greatly influence the interaction of such polyelectrolytes with biomolecules, particularly proteins. In this Review we give an overview of studies on the interaction of proteins with polyelectrolytes and how this knowledge can be used for medical applications. Counterion release was identified as the main driving force for the binding of proteins to polyelectrolytes: Patches of positive charge become multivalent counterions of the polyelectrolyte and lead to the release of counterions from the polyelectrolyte and a concomitant increase in entropy. This is shown from investigations on the interaction of proteins with natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes. Special emphasis is paid to sulfated dendritic polyglycerols (dPGS). The Review demonstrates that we are moving to a better understanding of charge&#8211;charge interactions in systems of biological relevance. Research along these lines will aid and promote the design of synthetic polyelectrolytes for medical applications.

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208;Aminoisothiocyanation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes Under Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4085-4089, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;aminoisothiocyanation of the conjugated dienes was realized in a highly chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective manner using N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as donors of amidyl radicals. A facile isomerization of allyl thiocyanate to allyl isothiocyanate under photoredox catalytic conditions at room temperature is uncovered.







Abstract
Selective three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;diamination of 1,3&#8208;dienes with concurrent introduction of two orthogonally protected amino groups remains unknown despite its significant synthetic potential. We report herein that reaction of conjugated dienes with N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and TMSNCS affords 1,2&#8208;aminoisothiocyanation products in a highly chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective manner under mild photoredox catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate that the facile isomerization of allyl thiocyanates to allyl isothiocyanates under photocatalytic conditions is responsible for the selective formation of the observed products. The mild isomerization protocol is expected to find applications in the synthesis of allyl isothiocyanates in a broad sense.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Red Phosphors and Their Core&#8211;Shell Structure for Improved Water&#8208;Resistance for Laser Diodes Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3940-3945, February 19, 2021. </description>

Single&#8208;crystal red phosphors easily grown by solvent exchange exhibit considerably better efficiency and stability. To further improve the chemical stability, a core&#8211;shell CTFM@CTF single crystal was prepared through an epitaxial growth route and a unique three&#8208;step PL intensity change has been proposed.







Abstract
A solvent&#8208;vapor transport route produces centimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal red phosphors. The epitaxial growth route to yield its core&#8211;shell structure at ambient temperature was adopted. These red phosphors could be applied in all&#8208;inorganic WLED devices. Cs2TiF6:Mn4+ (CTFM) single crystal provides enhancement of quantum efficiency, moisture resistance, and thermal stability compared to polycrystalline powders. The internal quantum efficiency can reach as high as 98.7&#8201;%. To further improve waterproof stability, the Cs2TiF6 (CTF) shell with tunable thickness has been epitaxially grown on the CTFM single crystal surface and a unique three&#8208;step photoluminescence intensity evolution mechanism has been proposed. By combining as&#8208;prepared CTFM@CTF core&#8211;shell structured single crystal, YAG:Ce single crystal and blue&#8208;chip, warm WLEDs with excellent color rendition (Ra=90, R9=94), low correlated color temperature (CCT=3155&#8197;K), and high luminous efficacy were fabricated without any organic resins.

         <title>Dearomatization&#8208;Rearomatization Strategy for ortho&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Phenols with Primary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4043-4048, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization strategy was developed for palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of phenols and inexpensive primary alcohols to site&#8208;specifically generate ortho&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted phenols. Water was the sole by&#8208;product of the reaction, making it a green method for site&#8208;specific synthesis of these phenols.







Abstract
Phenols are common precursors and core structures of a variety of industrial chemicals ranging from pharmaceuticals to polymers. However, the synthesis of site&#8208;specifically substituted phenols is challenging, and thus the development of new methods for this purpose would be highly desirable. Reported here is a protocol for palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;selective alkylation reactions of phenols with primary alcohols by a dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization strategy, with water as the sole by&#8208;product. Various substituted phenols and primary alcohols were compatible with the standard reaction conditions. The detailed mechanism of this transformation was also investigated.

         <title>Effective Enantioselective Recognition by Chiral Amino&#8208;Phosphonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4023-4027, February 19, 2021. </description>

New examples of an enantiomeric pair of phosphonium salts were synthesized and shown to exhibit high enantioselective recognition and discrimination capabilities for various chiral guest molecules with functional groups, such as carboxylic acid, amine, and alcohol.







Abstract
The research on chiral recognition and selection is not only fundamental in deciding the mystery of homochirality, but also informative in terms of substrate recognition in biological processes and asymmetric catalysis. We report an enantiomeric pair of phosphonium salts having chiral (R and S) amino substituents that are utilized towards the enantioselective recognition of a variety of chiral compounds having functional groups, such as carboxylic acid, amine, and alcohol. These simple phosphonium salts are found to exhibit a high enantiomeric discrimination for 1&#8208;cyclohexylethylamine (CY). A remarkable guest selectivity (&#958;) value of 5.3&#215;108 is achieved for the enantiomer of R&#8208;CY over S&#8208;CY by using the R&#8208;isomer of the phosphonium salt. Such high binding selectivities and discrimination capabilities is attributed to multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between the host and guest molecules as inferred from the DFT optimized structures of the host&#8211;guest pairs.

&lt;p&gt;New examples of an enantiomeric pair of phosphonium salts were synthesized and shown to exhibit high enantioselective recognition and discrimination capabilities for various chiral guest molecules with functional groups, such as carboxylic acid, amine, and alcohol.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research on chiral recognition and selection is not only fundamental in deciding the mystery of homochirality, but also informative in terms of substrate recognition in biological processes and asymmetric catalysis. We report an enantiomeric pair of phosphonium salts having chiral (R and S) amino substituents that are utilized towards the enantioselective recognition of a variety of chiral compounds having functional groups, such as carboxylic acid, amine, and alcohol. These simple phosphonium salts are found to exhibit a high enantiomeric discrimination for 1&#8208;cyclohexylethylamine (CY). A remarkable guest selectivity (&lt;i&gt;&#958;&lt;/i&gt;) value of 5.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved for the enantiomer of &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;CY over &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;&#8208;CY by using the R&#8208;isomer of the phosphonium salt. Such high binding selectivities and discrimination capabilities is attributed to multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between the host and guest molecules as inferred from the DFT optimized structures of the host&#8211;guest pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Loading Pt/CeO2 Catalysts: Ceria Facet Effect Affords Improved Pairwise Selectivity for Parahydrogen Enhanced NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4038-4042, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stronger interactions are observed between Pt and the (111) surface facets of the CeO2 octahedra compared with the (100) surfaces of the CeO2 cubes. These interactions result in more stable and electron&#8208;poor Pt species on the CeO2 octahedra, which translates to higher pairwise selective addition of parahydrogen to propene and enhanced NMR signals compared with the electron&#8208;rich nanoparticle Pt on the CeO2 cubes.







Abstract
Oxide supports with well&#8208;defined shapes enable investigations on the effects of surface structure on metal&#8211;support interactions and correlations to catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, a modified atomic layer deposition technique was developed to achieve ultra&#8208;low loadings (8&#8211;16&#8197;ppm) of Pt on shaped ceria nanocrystals. Using octahedra and cubes, which expose exclusively (111) and (100) surfaces, respectively, the effect of CeO2 surface facet on Pt&#8208;CeO2 interactions under reducing conditions was revealed. Strong electronic interactions result in electron&#8208;deficient Pt species on CeO2 (111) after reduction, which increased the stability of the atomically dispersed Pt. This afforded significantly higher NMR signal enhancement in parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization experiments compared with the electron&#8208;rich platinum on CeO2 (100), and a factor of two higher pairwise selectivity (6.1&#8201;%) in the hydrogenation of propene than any previously reported monometallic heterogeneous Pt catalyst.

         <title>Radical Fluorosulfonylation: Accessing Alkenyl Sulfonyl Fluorides from Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3956-3960, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of FSO2 radicals under photoredox conditions, leading to the realization of radical fluorosulfonylation of alkenes is reported. With this new method for the synthesis of alkenyl sulfonyl fluorides many structures that would otherwise be challenging to synthesize become accessible. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have widespread applications in many fields. In particular, their unique biological activity has drawn considerable research interest in the context of chemical biology and drug discovery in the past years. Therefore, new and efficient methods for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides are highly in demand. In contrast to extensive studies on FSO2+&#8208;type reagents, a radical fluorosulfonylation reaction with a fluorosulfonyl radical (FSO2.) remains elusive so far, probably owing to its instability and difficulty in generation. Herein, the development of the first radical fluorosulfonylation of alkenes based on FSO2 radicals generated under photoredox conditions is reported. This radical approach provides a new and general access to alkenyl sulfonyl fluorides, including structures that would otherwise be challenging to synthesize with previously established cross&#8208;coupling methods. Moreover, extension to the late&#8208;stage fluorosulfonylation of natural products is also demonstrated.

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of Potassium Acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from Boronic Acids and the Thioimidate KAT Transfer Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3918-3922, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) proceeds by a formal CO insertion into the C&#8722;B bond of widely available boronic acids, boronic acid pinacol esters, or potassium organotrifluoroborates with the thioimidate KAT transfer reagent. A variety of KATs can be prepared with good functional group tolerance in high yields. The direct modification of KATs allows for the preparation of amides, &#945;&#8208;aminotrifluoroborates, and other aryl products.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of boronic acids and the thioimidate KAT transfer reagent. The combination of widely available aryl&#8208; and vinylboronic acids with commercially available thioimidate 1 using catalytic PdII and a CuII additive enables the preparation of KATs in high yields and with good functional group tolerance. This formal insertion of CO into organoboronic acids can also be applied to boronic acid pinacol esters and potassium organotrifluoroborates using a slightly modified procedure. The cross&#8208;coupling can be telescoped into the one&#8208;pot synthesis of amides and &#945;&#8208;aminotrifluoroborates by exploiting the unique chemistry of KATs and their trifluoroborate iminium (TIM) derivatives.

The Ni&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkylamines is reported. The mild protocol and broad (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide scope, encompassing base&#8208;sensitive substrates and enantioretentive transformations, is unmatched by any previously reported catalyst system.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkylamines with broad scope is reported for the first time. Use of the air&#8208;stable pre&#8208;catalyst (PAd2&#8208;DalPhos)Ni(o&#8208;tol)Cl allows for reactions to be conducted at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C, NaOtBu), or by use of a commercially available dual&#8208;base system (100&#8201;&#176;C, DBU/NaOTf), to circumvent decomposition of the N&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl)aniline product. The mild protocols disclosed herein feature broad (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide scope (X=Cl, Br, I, and for the first time phenol&#8208;derived electrophiles), encompassing base&#8208;sensitive substrates and enantioretentive transformations, in a manner that is unmatched by any previously reported catalyst system.

This communication describes the carrier transport mechanism employing conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM) by controlling the oxygen vacancies (Ovac) distribution for grain boundaries (GBs) in crystalline TiO2. Compared to Ovac distributed along the GBs, the Ovac inside the grains could narrow the depletion layer in grain&#8208;GB&#8208;grain junction to facilitate electron tunneling across GBs, improving the electron collection at the photoelectrode surface.







Abstract
Silicon is a promising photocathode material in photoelectrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production, but it is primarily limited by photocorrosion in aqueous electrolytes. As an extensively used protective material, crystalline TiO2 could protect Si photoelectrode against corrosion. However, a large number of grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline TiO2 would induce excessive recombination centers, impeding the carrier transport. This paper describes the introduction of oxygen vacancies (Ovac) with controllable spatial distribution for GBs to promote carrier transport. Two kinds of Ovac distribution, Ovac along GBs and Ovac inside grains, are compared, where the latter one is demonstrated to facilitate carrier transport owing to the formation of tunneling paths across GBs. Consequently, a simple p&#8208;Si/TiO2/Pt heterojunction photocathode with controllable Ovac distribution in TiO2 shows a +400&#8197;mV onset potential shift and yields an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 5.9&#8201;%, which is the best efficiency reported among silicon photocathodes except for silicon homojunction.

         <title>Hydrazine Formation via Coupling of a Nickel(III)&#8211;NH2 Radical</title>

Nix(NyHz) complexes are synthesized and characterized as intermediates in a homogenous nickel&#8208;mediated ammonia oxidation cycle. Data on the key N&#8722;N bond formation step are consistent with the homocoupling of a NiIII&#8211;NH2 species to yield a nickel(II)&#8208;bound hydrazine adduct.







Abstract
M(NHx) intermediates involved in N&#8722;N bond formation are central to ammonia oxidation (AO) catalysis, an enabling technology to ultimately exploit ammonia (NH3) as an alternative fuel source. While homocoupling of a terminal amide species (M&#8208;NH2) to form hydrazine (N2H4) has been proposed, well&#8208;defined examples are without precedent. Herein, we discuss the generation and electronic structure of a NiIII&#8208;NH2 species that undergoes bimolecular coupling to generate a NiII2(N2H4) complex. This hydrazine adduct can be further oxidized to a structurally unusual Ni2(N2H2) species; this releases N2 in the presence of NH3, thus establishing a synthetic cycle for Ni&#8208;mediated AO. Distribution of the redox load for H2N&#8208;NH2 formation via NH2 coupling between two metal centers presents an attractive strategy for AO catalysis using Earth&#8208;abundant, late first&#8208;row metals.

         <title>Chemical Amination/Imination of Carbonothiolated Nucleosides During RNA Hydrolysis</title>

Discovery of amino/imino ribonucleoside artifacts that are generated during RNA hydrolysis under ammonium&#8208;buffered mild basic conditions is described. The general approach for discovery uses higher&#8208;energy collisional dissociation&#8208;mass spectrometry (HCD&#8208;MS) and isotope labeling of RNA.







Abstract
Liquid chromatography&#8208;tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS/MS) has become the gold&#8208;standard technique to study RNA and its various modifications. While most research on RNA nucleosides has been focused on their biological roles, discovery of new modifications remains of interest. With state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology, the presence of artifacts can confound the identification of new modifications. Here, we report the characterization of a non&#8208;natural mcm5isoC ribonucleoside in S. cerevisiae total tRNA hydrolysate by higher&#8208;energy collisional dissociation (HCD)&#8208;based fingerprints and isotope labeling of RNA. Its discovery revealed a class of amino/imino ribonucleoside artifacts that are generated during RNA hydrolysis under ammonium&#8208;buffered mild basic conditions. We then identified digestion conditions that can reduce or eliminate their formation. These finding and method enhancements will improve the accurate detection of new RNA modifications.

The iLCL (iodoacetamide&#8208;assisted lipoate&#8208;cyclooctyne ligation) strategy enables chemoselective tagging, cellular imaging, and proteomic profiling of a rare but central post&#8208;translational modification, namely protein lipoylation in both bacteria and mammalian cells.







Abstract
Protein lipoylation is a post&#8208;translational modification of emerging importance in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, labeling and large&#8208;scale profiling of protein lipoylation remain challenging. Here, we report the development of iLCL (iodoacetamide&#8208;assisted lipoate&#8208;cyclooctyne ligation), a chemoselective reaction that enables chemical tagging of protein lipoylation. We demonstrate that the cyclic disulfide of lipoamide but not linear disulfides can selectively react with iodoacetamide to produce sulfenic acid, which can be conjugated with cyclooctyne probes. iLCL enables tagging of lipoylated proteins for gel&#8208;based detection and cellular imaging. Furthermore, we apply iLCL for proteomic profiling of lipoylated proteins in both bacteria and mammalian cells. In addition to all of the eight known lipoylated proteins, we identified seven candidates for novel lipoylated proteins. The iLCL strategy should facilitate uncovering the biological function of protein lipoylation.

         <title>The pH&#8208;Induced Selectivity Between Cysteine or Histidine Coordinated Heme in an Artificial &#945;&#8208;Helical Metalloprotein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3974-3978, February 19, 2021. </description>

A pH&#8208;dependent preference for the heme ligation is achieved when using self&#8208;assembling &#945;&#8208;helical coiled coils having Cys and His as binding sites. EPR and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopies uncovered a switch in heme axial ligand from His (6&#8804;pH&#8804;8.5) to Cys (9&#8804;pH&#8804;11), mimicking the heme sites in cyt&#8201;P450 monooxygenase, chloroperoxidase and peroxidases, all three in a single artificial protein.







Abstract
De Novo metalloprotein design assesses the relationship between metal active site architecture and catalytic reactivity. Herein, we use an &#945;&#8208;helical scaffold to control the iron coordination geometry when a heme cofactor is allowed to bind to either histidine or cysteine ligands, within a single artificial protein. Consequently, we uncovered a reversible pH&#8208;induced switch of the heme axial ligation within this simplified scaffold. Characterization of the specific heme coordination modes was done by using UV/Vis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopies. The penta&#8208; or hexa&#8208;coordinate thiolate heme (9&#8804;pH&#8804;11) and the penta&#8208;coordinate imidazole heme (6&#8804;pH&#8804;8.5) reproduces well the heme ligation in chloroperoxidases or cyt&#8201;P450 monooxygenases and peroxidases, respectively. The stability of heme coordination upon ferric/ferrous redox cycling is a crucial property of the construct. At basic pHs, the thiolate mini&#8208;heme protein can catalyze O2 reduction when adsorbed onto a pyrolytic graphite electrode.

Characterization of the specific heme coordination modes was done by using UV/Vis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopies. The penta&#8208; or hexa&#8208;coordinate thiolate heme (9&#8804;pH&#8804;11) and the penta&#8208;coordinate imidazole heme (6&#8804;pH&#8804;8.5) reproduces well the heme ligation in chloroperoxidases or cyt&#8201;P450 monooxygenases and peroxidases, respectively. The stability of heme coordination upon ferric/ferrous redox cycling is a crucial property of the construct. At basic pHs, the thiolate mini&#8208;heme protein can catalyze O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction when adsorbed onto a pyrolytic graphite electrode.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Olefin&#8208;Supported Cationic Copper Catalysts for Photochemical Synthesis of Structurally Complex Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3989-3993, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described here is a new catalytic method for the [2+2] photocycloaddition of simple aliphatic alkenes. The CuI catalyst features a weakly coordinating anion that enables the formation of a long&#8208;lived Cu bis(alkene) complex and supporting olefin ligands that stabilize the cationic CuI center without disrupting its photochemistry. This catalyst enjoys increased reaction rates and substrate scope compared to previous Cu&#8208;templated photocycloaddition methods.







Abstract
The sole method available for the photocycloaddition of unconjugated aliphatic alkenes is the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Salomon&#8211;Kochi reaction. The [Cu(OTf)]2&#8901;benzene catalyst that has been standard in this reaction for many decades, however, is air&#8208;sensitive, prone to photodecomposition, and poorly reactive towards sterically bulky alkene substrates. Using bench&#8208;stable precursors, an improved catalyst system with superior reactivity and photostability has been designed, and it offers significantly expanded substrate scope. The utility of this new catalyst for the preparation of sterically crowded cyclobutane structures is highlighted through the preparation of the cores of the natural products sulcatine G and perforatol.

         <title>Efficient Suppression of Chain Transfer and Branching via Cs&#8208;Type Shielding in a Neutral Nickel(II) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4018-4022, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;H elimination event that brings about chain transfer and branch formation in neutral nickel&#8208;catalyzed olefin insertion polymerization is now fully addressed by a Cs&#8208;type shielding of both apical positions of a neutral NiII catalyst. Thus, strictly linear (&lt;0.1&#8197;brs/1000C) ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylenes (UHMWPEs; 5050&#8197;kDa) are now accessible.







Abstract
An effective shielding of both apical positions of a neutral NiII active site is achieved by dibenzosuberyl groups, both attached via the same donors&#8217; N&#8208;aryl group in a Cs&#8208;type arrangement. The key aniline building block is accessible in a single step from commercially available dibenzosuberol. This shielding approach suppresses chain transfer and branch formation to such an extent that ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylenes (5&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) are accessible, with a strictly linear microstructure (&lt;0.1 branches/1000C). Key features of this highly active (4.3&#215;105&#8197;turnovers&#8201;h&#8722;1) catalyst are an exceptionally facile preparation, thermal robustness (up to 90&#8201;&#176;C polymerization temperature), ability for living polymerization and compatibility with THF as a polar reaction medium.

         <title>Supramolecular Bait to Trigger Non&#8208;Equilibrium Co&#8208;Assembly and Clearance of A&#946;42</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4014-4017, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a non&#8208;equilibrium state of interaction between supramolecular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and A&#946;42, an aggregate&#8208;prone protein that causes Alzheimer's disease (AD), was identified. Oscillation of the non&#8208;equilibrium state for co&#8208;assembly and clearance of A&#946;42 is triggered through the use of a supramolecular bait. Since the impaired clearance of toxic A&#946;42 deposits correlates with AD pathology, the LPS and A&#946;42 non&#8208;equilibrium could represent a useful target for developing AD therapeutics.







Abstract
In living systems, non&#8208;equilibrium states that control the assembly&#8208;disassembly of cellular components underlie the gradual complexification of life, whereas in nonliving systems, most molecules follow the laws of thermodynamic equilibrium to sustain dynamic consistency. Little is known about the roles of non&#8208;equilibrium states of interactions between supramolecules in living systems. Here, a non&#8208;equilibrium state of interaction between supramolecular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and A&#946;42, an aggregate&#8208;prone protein that causes Alzheimer's disease (AD), was identified. Structurally, A&#946;42 presents a specific groove that is recognized by the amphiphilicity of LPS bait in a non&#8208;equilibrium manner. Functionally, the transient complex elicits a cellular response to clear extracellular A&#946;42 deposits in neuronal cells. Since the impaired clearance of toxic A&#946;42 deposits correlates with AD pathology, the non&#8208;equilibrium LPS and A&#946;42 could represent a useful target for developing AD therapeutics.

         <title>Azide Radical Initiated Ring Opening of Cyclopropenes Leading to Alkenyl Nitriles and Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds</title>

A radical amination of cyclopropenes has been developed. The transformation proceeds through a cleavage of the three&#8208;membered ring and provides access to alkenyl nitriles, without the need of an external cyanide source. With 1,2&#8208;diaryl substituted cyclopropenes, a one&#8208;pot process could be developed to access a wide range of highly functionalized polycyclic aromatic compounds.







Abstract
We report herein a radical&#8208;mediated amination of cyclopropenes. The transformation proceeds through a cleavage of the three&#8208;membered ring after the addition of an azide radical on the strained double bond and leads to tetrasubstituted alkenyl nitrile derivatives upon loss of N2. With 1,2&#8208;diaryl substituted cyclopropenes, this methodology could be extended to a one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly functionalized polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). This transformation allows the synthesis of nitrile&#8208;substituted alkenes and aromatic compounds from rapidly accessed cyclopropenes using only commercially available reagents.

         <title>Titanium Germylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3951-3955, February 19, 2021. </description>

Two novel titanium germylene phosphine and isocyanide complexes, Cp2Ti(L)=Ge[Si3(SiMetBu2)4] (L=Me3P and XylNC), were synthesized and fully characterized. On the basis of their structural characteristics and calculated atomic charges, both complexes are classified as the Schrock&#8208;type titanium germylidenes, as the germanium versions of the widely known titanium alkylidenes.







Abstract
Two novel 18&#8208;electron titanium germylene complexes, Cp2Ti(L)=Ge[Si3(SiMetBu2)4] 3&#8201;b (L=Me3P) and 3&#8201;c (L=XylNC), were synthesized, isolated, and structurally characterized. The length of the titanium&#8208;germanium bonds of 2.5387(3)&#8197;&#197; and 2.5276(3)&#8197;&#197; (in 3&#8201;b and 3&#8201;c, respectively) well match those expected for the double bond, which was further supported by the DFT study. Based on their structural characteristics, as well as their atomic charges calculations which revealed Ti(&#948;+)=Ge(&#948;&#8722;) bond polarization, both 3&#8201;b and 3&#8201;c are classified as the Schrock&#8208;type titanium germylidenes, as the germanium analogues of the widely known titanium alkylidenes.

&lt;p&gt;Two novel titanium germylene phosphine and isocyanide complexes, Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(L)=Ge[Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiMe&lt;sup&gt;

On the basis of their structural characteristics and calculated atomic charges, both complexes are classified as the Schrock&#8208;type titanium germylidenes, as the germanium versions of the widely known titanium alkylidenes.

&lt;p&gt;Two novel 18&#8208;electron titanium germylene complexes, Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(L)=Ge[Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiMe&lt;sup&gt;

The length of the titanium&#8208;germanium bonds of 2.5387(3)&#8197;&#197; and 2.5276(3)&#8197;&#197; (in &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, respectively) well match those expected for the double bond, which was further supported by the DFT study. Based on their structural characteristics, as well as their atomic charges calculations which revealed Ti(&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;+)=Ge(&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;) bond polarization, both &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; are classified as the Schrock&#8208;type titanium germylidenes, as the germanium analogues of the widely known titanium alkylidenes. By contrast, germylene complexes of the group 6 metals &lt;b&gt;8&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; (M=Mo) and &lt;b&gt;8&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; (M=W) are better described as Fischer&#8208;type germylene complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed and Proton&#8208;Directed Selective Hydroxymethylation of Alkynes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3984-3988, February 19, 2021. </description>

A protic switch was applied into the newly developed copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxymethylation of alkynes with CO2. Allylic alcohols and &#946;&#8208;chiral branched alkyl alcohols were selectively delivered with high levels of Z/E, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
An intriguing strategy for copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxymethylation of alkynes with CO2 and hydrosilane was developed. Switched on/off a proton source, for example, tBuOH, direct hydroxymethylation and reductive hydroxymethylation could be triggered selectively, delivering a series of allylic alcohols and homobenzylic alcohols, respectively, with high levels of Z/E, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Such a selective synthesis is attributed to the differences in response of vinylcopper intermediate to proton and CO2. The protonation of vinylcopper species is demonstrated to be prior to hydroxymethylation, thus allowing a diversion from direct alkyne hydroxymethylation to reductive hydroxymethylation in the presence of suitable proton.

         <title>Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)s Functionalized with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes as Robust and Conductive Ligands for the Stabilization of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3912-3917, February 19, 2021. </description>

Br&#8208;NHC&#8208;AuI complexes were designed as starting points of Kumada polymerizations to grow regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)s&#8208;NHC&#8208;AuI, which were reduced to afford P3HT&#8208;NHC@Au&#8197;NPs. In addition to excellent thermal as well as redox stability, the corresponding NPs show improved charge transfer behavior due to the effective electron delocalization over the gold/P3HT interface benefiting from the robust and conductive NHC linkages.







Abstract
Recently, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are explored as anchor groups to bind organic ligands to colloidal gold (i.e. gold nanoparticles, Au&#8201;NPs), yet these efforts are confined to non&#8208;conjugated ligands so far&#8212;that is, focused solely on exploiting the stability aspect. Using NHCs to link Au&#8201;NPs and electronically active organic components, for example, conjugated polymers (CPs), will allow capitalizing on both the stability as well as the inherent conductivity of the NHC anchors. Here, we report three types of Br&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;X (X=Cl, Br) complexes, which, when used as starting points for Kumada polymerizations, yield regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophenes)&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au (P3HTs&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au) with narrow molecular weight distributions. The corresponding NPs are obtained via direct reduction and show excellent thermal as well as redox stability. The NHC anchors enable electron delocalization over the gold/CP interface, resulting in an improved electrochromic response behavior in comparison with P3HT&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au.

         <title>Probing the Consequences of Cubic Particle Shape and Applied Field on Colloidal Crystal Engineering with DNA</title>

         <dc:description>
Assembly of magnetic nanoparticles results from a competition between dipole and surface interactions. To modulate these forces, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were functionalized with DNA to explore the assembly behavior in a magnetic field. X&#8208;ray scattering elucidates that orientation is controlled across length scales due to the altered arrangement of particles.







Abstract
In a magnetic field, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibit assembly behavior that is a consequence of a competition between magnetic dipole&#8211;dipole and ligand interactions. In most cases, the interactions between short hydrophobic ligands dominate and dictate assembly outcome. To better tune the face&#8208;to&#8208;face interactions, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were functionalized with DNA. Their assembly behaviors were investigated both with and without an applied magnetic field. Upon application of a field, the tilted orientation of cubes, enabled by the flexible DNA ligand shell, led to an unexpected crystallographic alignment of the entire superlattice, as opposed to just the individual particles, along the field direction as revealed by small and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. This observation is dependent upon DNA length and sequence and cube dimensions. Taken together, these studies show how combining physical and chemical control can expand the possibilities of crystal engineering with DNA.

         <title>Mixed Group 14&#8211;15 Metalates as Model Compounds for Doped Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3906-3911, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic nature of Sb&#8208; and Bi&#8208;doped lead halide perovskites is an area of current scientific debate. Model compounds featuring [PbE2I16]8&#8722; (E=Sb, Bi) anions that represent precise cut&#8208;outs of doped perovskites are presented. The compounds display surprisingly low band gaps owing to an excellent electronic match between PbI6 and EI6 units and represent the first members of a promising new class of metal halide materials.







Abstract
Doping and alloying are valuable tools for modifying and enhancing the properties and performance of lead halide perovskites. However, the effects of heterovalent doping with Sb3+ and Bi3+ cations are still a matter of current investigation. Due to the different charge of the dopants compared to the constituting Pb2+ ions, a simultaneous creation of defects is unavoidable and the influence of these defects and the actual metal substitution become entangled. Herein, we present the first 14&#8211;15 iodido metalates, (BED)4PbE2I16 (BED=N&#8208;benzylethylenediammonium; E=Sb (1), Bi (2)), which are model compounds for doped lead iodide perovskites and display surprisingly low band gaps of 2.01 (1) and 1.88&#8197;eV (2). Quantum chemical investigations show that this stems from a good electronic match between the PbI6 and EI6 units of the compounds. Our results provide a model system for doped perovskites, but also represent the first examples of a promising new class of metal halide materials.

         <title>Furin&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly of Olsalazine Nanoparticles for Targeted Raman Imaging of Tumors</title>

Based on a furin&#8208;mediated CBT&#8208;Cys click condensation reaction followed by intracellular nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly, we report the development of a new furin&#8208;specific Raman reporter Olsa&#8208;RVRR and demonstrate its in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo utility in tumor detection.







Abstract
Olsalazine (Olsa) is a broad&#8208;spectrum anti&#8208;cancer agent acting as a DNA&#8208;methylation inhibitor. When conjugated to 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;6&#8208;aminobenzothiazole and a peptide substrate specific for the tumor&#8208;overexpressed enzyme furin, it can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles that can be detected by chemical&#8208;exchange saturation&#8208;transfer magnetic&#8208;resonance imaging (CEST MRI). We report here that these nano&#8208;assemblies can also be detected with high specificity in furin&#8208;overexpressing tumor cells by Raman spectroscopy with a distinct scattering signature and demonstrate the utility of this sensing mechanism in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Our findings suggest that Raman spectroscopy could be used for high&#8208;resolution image&#8208;guided surgery to precisely delineate tumor margins during and after resection in real&#8208;time as well as to determine microscopic tumor invasion and multifocal locoregional tumor spread, which are currently impossible to visualize with available imaging technologies, including CEST MRI.

         <title>Rapid and Selective Chemical Editing of Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides (RiPPs) via CuII&#8208;Catalyzed &#946;&#8208;Borylation of Dehydroamino Acids</title>

Dehydroamino&#8208;acid&#8208;containing natural peptides and proteins were rapidly and selectively borylated at the &#946;&#8208;position using copper(II) catalysis. The introduced boronic&#8208;acid functionalities are valuable handles for chemical mutagenesis and, in a reversible click reaction with triols, for the pH&#8208;controlled labeling of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs).







Abstract
We report the fast and selective chemical editing of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) by &#946;&#8208;borylation of dehydroalanine (Dha) residues. The thiopeptide thiostrepton was modified efficiently using CuII&#8208;catalysis under mild conditions and 1D/2D NMR of the purified product showed site&#8208;selective borylation of the terminal Dha residues. Using similar conditions, the thiopeptide nosiheptide, lanthipeptide nisin&#8197;Z, and protein SUMO_G98Dha were also modified efficiently. Borylated thiostrepton showed an up to 84&#8208;fold increase in water solubility, and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays showed that antimicrobial activity was maintained in thiostrepton and nosiheptide. The introduced boronic&#8208;acid functionalities were shown to be valuable handles for chemical mutagenesis and in a reversible click reaction with triols for the pH&#8208;controlled labeling of RiPPs.

         <title>Improved Asparaginyl&#8208;Ligase&#8208;Catalyzed Transpeptidation via Selective Nucleophile Quenching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4004-4008, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asparaginyl ligases are catalytically efficient transpeptidases. A generalizable means of improving their transpeptidation capabilities via selectively quenching the nucleophilicity of the peptides released over the reaction course is reported. By reducing reaction reversibility, this approach facilitates efficient peptide&#8211;peptide, protein&#8211;peptide, and protein&#8211;protein conjugation reactions.







Abstract
The use of enzymes for the site&#8208;specific modification of proteins/peptides has become a highly accessible, widespread approach to study protein/peptide functions or to generate therapeutic conjugates. Asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) that preferentially catalyze transpeptidation reactions (AEP ligases) have emerged as enticing alternatives to established approaches, such as bacterial sortases, due to their catalytic efficiency and short tripeptide recognition motifs. However, under standard conditions, a substantial excess of the nucleophile to be conjugated is needed to reach desirable yields. Herein we report a versatile approach to shift the AEP&#8208;catalyzed transpeptidation equilibrium toward product formation via selectively quenching the nucleophilicity of the competing leaving&#8208;group peptide. Our metal&#8208;complexation&#8208;based strategy enables efficient peptide/protein labeling at the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus with near&#8208;equimolar concentrations of nucleophile label. Furthermore, we show that this approach can enhance protein&#8211;protein ligation and facilitate the formation of transpeptidation products that are otherwise unattainable.

         <title>Molecular Chemiluminescent Probes with a Very Long Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Wavelength for in&#8197;Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3999-4003, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared chemiluminophores with modular structures amenable to the construction of activatable molecular probes are synthesized, which turn on their chemiluminescence in the presence of the biomarker of interest, with a very long emission wavelength of above 750&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence imaging is imperative for diagnostics and imaging due to its intrinsically high sensitivity. To improve in&#8197;vivo detection of biomarkers, chemiluminophores that simultaneously possess near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and modular structures amenable to construction of activatable probes are highly desired; however, these are rare. Herein, we report two chemiluminophores with record long NIR emission (&gt;750&#8197;nm) via integration of dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;benzothiopyran or dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;benzoselenopyran with dioxetane unit. Caging of the chemiluminophores with different cleavable moieties produces NIR chemiluminescence probes (NCPs) that only produce signals upon reaction with reactive oxygen species or enzymes, for example, &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, with a tissue&#8208;penetration depth of up to 2&#8197;cm. Thus, this study provides NIR chemiluminescence molecular scaffolds applicable for in vivo turn&#8208;on imaging of versatile biomarkers in deep tissues.

         <title>Stereoselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylcyclopropanation via Generation of a Sulfur&#8208;Substituted Vinyl Carbene Equivalent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4070-4074, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic gold(I)&#8208;coordinated vinylcarbene species can be generated from simple propargylaldehyde ethylenedithioacetal and engages a wide range of alkenes in a catalytic stereoselective cyclopropanation. This method was used as a key step to elaborate the polycyclic framework of cephalotaxus alkaloids.







Abstract
A stereoselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed vinylcyclopropanation of alkenes has been developed. A gold&#8208;coordinated cationic vinyl carbene species, readily generated via a rearrangement of the ethylenedithioacetal of propargyl aldehyde, reacts with a wide range of alkenes to afford thio&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropanes. The gold&#8208;catalyzed vinyl cyclopropanation proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature and is generally selective for the formation of cis&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. The reaction allows the formal introduction of a &#8220;naked&#8221; vinyl carbene, by subsequent chemoselective hydrodesulfurisation of the ethylenedithio&#8208;bridge. The synthetic utility of the new method is demonstrated by a short, racemic formal synthesis of the alkaloid cephalotaxin, hinging on a key vinyl cyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene rearrangement.

A gold&#8208;coordinated cationic vinyl carbene species, readily generated via a rearrangement of the ethylenedithioacetal of propargyl aldehyde, reacts with a wide range of alkenes to afford thio&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropanes. The gold&#8208;catalyzed vinyl cyclopropanation proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature and is generally selective for the formation of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. The reaction allows the formal introduction of a &#8220;naked&#8221; vinyl carbene, by subsequent chemoselective hydrodesulfurisation of the ethylenedithio&#8208;bridge. The synthetic utility of the new method is demonstrated by a short, racemic formal synthesis of the alkaloid cephalotaxin, hinging on a key vinyl cyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reshaping the Cathodic Catalyst Layer for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells: From Heterogeneous Catalysis to Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4049-4054, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular catalyst (TMPPCo) was anchored on the side chain of a polyfluorene ionomer to establish a homogeneous catalytic system for fuel cells in which the catalyst is in the same ion&#8208;flow channels as the reaction substances. With interconnected nanoreactors throughout the catalyst layer, the electrochemical kinetic activity, mass transfer, utilization of catalyst active sites, and the fuel cell performance were significantly improved.







Abstract
In anion exchange membrane fuel cells, catalytic reactions occur at a well&#8208;defined three&#8208;phase interface, wherein conventional heterogeneous catalyst layer structures exacerbate problems, such as low catalyst utilization and limited mass transfer. We developed a structural engineering strategy to immobilize a molecular catalyst tetrakis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)porphyrin cobalt(II) (TMPPCo) on the side chains of an ionomer (polyfluorene, PF) to obtain a composite material (PF&#8208;TMPPCo), thereby achieving a homogeneous catalysis environment inside ion&#8208;flow channels, with greatly improved mass transfer and turnover frequency as a result of 100&#8201;% utilization of the catalyst molecules. The unique structure of the homogeneous catalysis system comprising interconnected nanoreactors exhibits advantages of low overpotential and high fuel&#8208;cell power density. This strategy of reshaping of the catalyst layer structure may serve as a new platform for applications of many molecular catalysts in fuel cells.

         <title>Supramolecular Non&#8208;Helical One&#8208;Dimensional Channels and Microtubes Assembled from Enantiomers of Difluorenol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3979-3983, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented supramolecular non&#8208;helical channel structure based on racemic 9,9&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifluorene]&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;diol enantiomers is achieved. Two pairs of racemic enantiomers can form a C2&#8208;symmetric closed loop via the stereoscopic herringbone assembly. The etching of solvent in 1D channels leads to the formation of microtubes with a lithium&#8208;ion conductivity of 1.77&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm.







Abstract
The design and assembly of photoelectro&#8208;active molecular channel structures is of great importance because of their advantages in charge mobility, photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, proton conduction, and exciton transport. Herein, we report the use of racemic 9,9&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifluorene]&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;diol (DPFOH) enantiomers to produce non&#8208;helical 1D channel structures. Although the individual molecule does not present any molecular symmetry, two pairs of racemic DPFOH enantiomers can form a C2&#8208;symmetric closed loop via the stereoscopic herringbone assembly. Thanks to the special symmetry derived from the enantiomer pairs, the multiple supramolecular interactions, and the padding from solvent molecules, this conventionally unstable topological structure is achieved. The etching of solvent in 1D channels leads to the formation of microtubes, which exhibit a significant lithium&#8208;ion conductivity of 1.77&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm, indicating the potential research value of this novel 1D channel structure.

         <title>Bright and Stable NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;Aggregated AIE Dibodipy&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probe for Dynamic In&#8197;Vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3967-3973, February 19, 2021. </description>

A J&#8208;aggregated AIE dibodipy&#8208;based fluorescent probe, THPP, was synthesized. The probe exhibits enhanced fluorescence intensity in the NIR&#8208;II window for dynamic in&#8197;vivo imaging.







Abstract
Organic dyes emitting in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 900&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window, with high molar extinction coefficients (MEC) and quantum yields (QY) in aqueous, are essential for in&#8197;vivo bioimaging and biosensing. In this work, we developed a dibodipy&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorescent probe, THPP, to meet this aim. THPP exhibits a high MEC and has intensified absorption and emission in J&#8208;aggregated state, which significantly enhance the fluorescence intensity (&#8776;55 folds) and extend the maximal absorption/emission wavelengths to 970/1010&#8197;nm in NIR&#8208;II region. Based on the bright THPP, imaging with a high frame rate (34 frames per second) at a deep &#8220;valid penetration depth&#8221; up to 6&#8197;mm can be achieved. This enabled simultaneous and dynamic imaging of vasculatures and deep tissues. Besides, we succeeded in monitoring the respiratory rate of acute&#8208;lung&#8208;injury mice and tracing the collateral circulation process with a high frame rate.

A nickel hydride catalyzed highly selective migratory hydroalkenylation proceeds through competitive hydrometalation and oxidative addition. Catalytic enantioselective hydroalkenylation of styrenes was observed when a chiral bisoxazoline ligand was employed. The mild conditions of the reaction produced the benzylic alkenylation products exclusively, leaving the olefinic product intact.







Abstract
A NiH&#8208;catalyzed migratory hydroalkenylation reaction of olefins with alkenyl bromides has been developed, affording benzylic alkenylation products with high yields and excellent chemoselectivity. The mild conditions of the reaction preclude olefinic products from undergoing further isomerization or subsequent alkenylation. Catalytic enantioselective hydroalkenylation of styrenes was achieved by using a chiral bisoxazoline ligand.

         <title>Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Orientation of Quasiplanar Donor and Acceptor Enables Highly Efficient Intramolecular Exciplex Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3994-3998, February 19, 2021. </description>

The orientations of donor and acceptor have been controlled for the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters featuring intramolecular through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer excited states. With maximized cofacial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the quasiplanar donor and acceptor segments, a substantial enhancement of radiative decay rate together with a suppressed nonradiative decay resulted in an emission efficiency of almost unity.







Abstract
Intramolecular through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) excited states have been exploited for developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, but the tuning of excited state dynamics by conformational engineering remains sparse.

     alt="Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Orientation of Quasiplanar Donor and Acceptor Enables Highly Efficient Intramolecular Exciplex Fluorescence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The orientations of donor and acceptor have been controlled for the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters featuring intramolecular through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer excited states. With maximized cofacial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the quasiplanar donor and acceptor segments, a substantial enhancement of radiative decay rate together with a suppressed nonradiative decay resulted in an emission efficiency of almost unity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intramolecular through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) excited states have been exploited for developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, but the tuning of excited state dynamics by conformational engineering remains sparse. Designed here is a series of TSCT emitters with precisely controlled alignment of the donor and acceptor segments. With increasing intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, the radiative decay rate of the lowest singlet excited state (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) progressively increased together with a suppression of nonradiative decay, leading to significantly enhanced photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.99 in doped thin films. A high&#8208;efficiency electroluminescence device, with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.96&#8201;%, was achieved and maintains &amp;gt;20&#8201;% at a brightness of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work sheds light on the importance of conformation control for achieving high&#8208;efficiency intramolecular exciplex emitters.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Iminophosphonamido&#8208;Chlorosilylene as a Strong &#963;&#8208;Donating NHSi Ligand: Synthesis and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 4055-4059, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new NHSi supported by an iminophosphonamide ligand was synthesized. Silylene, which shows a high energy level of its HOMO, displays strong &#963;&#8208;donating properties relative to common NHCs as well as unique coordination behavior. Specifically, when silylene was treated with 1/4 or 1/6 of an equivalent of [RhCl(cod)]2, the 14&#8208;electron Y&#8208;shaped RhI complex or the cationic tris(silylene)&#8208;RhI complex was isolated.







Abstract
The N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene (NHSi) [Ph2P(tBuN)2]SiCl (1), supported by an iminophosphonamide ligand, was obtained from the dehydrochlorination of [Ph2P(tBuN)2]SiHCl2 (2) with LiN(SiMe3)2. NHSi 1 contains an extremely high&#8208;energy HOMO level and consequently displays unique coordination behavior toward RhI complexes. When 1 was treated with 1/4 of an equivalent of [RhCl(cod)]2 (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), the 14&#8208;electron Y&#8208;shaped bis(chlorosilylene) RhI complex 5 was obtained as dark purple crystals. The reaction of 1 with 1/6 of an equivalent of [RhCl(cod)]2 yielded the cationic tris(silylene)&#8208;RhI complex [6]+&#8901;Cl&#8722; as red crystals, wherein a two&#8208;coordinated silylene ligand engages in a Si=Rh double bond. A structural analysis of 5 and [6]+&#8901;Cl&#8722; revealed that the central rhodium atoms adopt trigonal and square&#8208;planar coordination geometries, respectively, with considerably shortened Si&#8208;Rh bonds [5: 2.1605(5)&#8197;&#197;; [6]+: 2.133(1)&#8197;&#197;].

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive, Reversible Emulsification and Demulsification of Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Pickering Emulsions for Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 8, Page 3928-3933, February 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;responsive Pickering emulsion was designed and prepared, which could be reversibly switched between stable and unstable upon exposure to visible and UV light, respectively. The reversible, light&#8208;responsive phase behavior of the Pickering emulsion enabled its use as a microreactor, allowing highly efficient catalytic hydrogenation, followed by product separation and emulsifier and catalyst recycling.







Abstract
Pickering emulsions are an excellent platform for interfacial catalysis. However, developing simple and efficient strategies to achieve product separation and catalyst and emulsifier recovery is still a challenge. Herein, we report the reversible transition between emulsification and demulsification of a light&#8208;responsive Pickering emulsion, triggered by alternating between UV and visible light irradiation. The Pickering emulsion is fabricated from Pd&#8208;supported silica nanoparticles, azobenzene ionic liquid surfactant, n&#8208;octane, and water. This phase behavior is attributed to the adsorption of azobenzene ionic liquid surfactant on the surface of the nanoparticles and the light&#8208;responsive activity of ionic liquid surfactant. The Pickering emulsion can be used as a microreactor that enables catalytic reaction, product separation as well as emulsifier and catalyst recycling. Catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons at room temperature and atmospheric pressure has been performed in this system to demonstrate product separation and emulsifier and catalyst re&#8208;use.

Biogenesis of amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides from their precursor protein can be tracked in endocytic compartments of living cells by a molecular beacon labeling strategy based on genetic code expansion. 







Abstract
Polypeptides generated from proteolytic processing of protein precursors, or proteolytic proteoforms, play an important role in diverse biological functions and diseases. However, their often&#8208;small size and intricate post&#8208;translational biogenesis preclude the use of simple genetic tagging in their cellular studies. Herein, we develop a labeling strategy for this class of proteoforms, based on residue&#8208;specific genetic code expansion labeling with a molecular beacon design. We demonstrate the utility of such a design by creating a molecular beacon reporter to detect amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides, known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as they are produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) along the endocytic pathway of living cells.

         <title>Accessing the Next Generation of Synthetic Mussel&#8208;Glue Polymers via Mussel&#8208;Inspired Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of mussel&#8208;glue&#8208;inspired polymers by using simple one&#8208;pot chemistry based on commodity monomers that are available in large scale offers many opportunities. A chemical oxidation route to convert commodity monomers to bisquinones is presented. These can be polymerized in Michael&#8208;type polyaddition reactions with various dithiols, which provides a modular set of glues with adhesive thiol&#8211;catechol connectivities in their backbones.







Abstract
The formation of cysteinyldopa as biogenic connectivity in proteins is used to inspire a chemical pathway toward mussel&#8208;adhesive mimics. The mussel&#8208;inspired polymerization (MIPoly) exploits the chemically diverse family of bisphenol monomers that is oxidizable with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid to give bisquinones. Those react at room temperature with dithiols in Michael&#8208;type polyadditions, which leads to polymers with thiol&#8211;catechol connectivities (TCC). A set of TCC polymers proved adhesive behavior even on challenging poly(propylene) substrates, where they compete with commercial epoxy resins in dry adhesive strength. MIPoly promises facile scale up and exhibits high modularity to tailor adhesives, as proven on a small library where one candidate showed wet adhesion on aluminum substrates in both water and sea water models.

         <title>Scan and Unlock: A Programmable DNA Molecular Automaton for Cell&#8208;Selective Activation of Ligand&#8208;Based Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent molecular&#8208;lock device of signaling ligand proteins, termed &#8220;scan and unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA), is presented. The SUDA employs DNA chemical reaction networks to autonomously scan and logically evaluate the cell&#8208;surface&#8208;protein profile of the designated cell type, selectively unlocking the signaling ligand&#8211;receptor interactions for cell&#8208;specific signaling.







Abstract
Selective modulation of ligand&#8211;receptor interaction is essential in targeted therapy. In this study, we design an intelligent &#8220;scan and unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA) system to equip a native protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;identity recognition and receptor&#8208;mediated signaling in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Using embedded DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs) on the cell surface, SUDA scans and evaluates molecular profiles of cell&#8208;surface proteins via Boolean logic circuits. Therefore, it achieves cell&#8208;specific signal modulation by quickly unlocking the protein&#8208;ligand in proximity to the target cell&#8208;surface to activate its cognate receptor. As a proof of concept, we non&#8208;genetically engineered hepatic growth factor (HGF) with distinct logic SUDAs to elicit target cell&#8208;specific HGF signaling and wound healing behaviors in multiple heterogeneous cell types. Furthermore, the versatility of the SUDA strategy was shown by engineering tumor necrotic factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;) to induce programmed cell death of target cell subpopulations through cell&#8208;specific modulation of TNFR1 signaling.

         <title>Cooperative Stapling of Native Peptides at Lysine and Tyrosine or Arginine with Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cooperative strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine and nearby tyrosine or arginine residues with formaldehyde is reported.







Abstract
Stapling of peptides by intramolecular crosslinking of two neighboring amino acid side chains offers an important tool to modulate the structure and properties of peptides. In comparison to the stapling of artificially engineered peptide substrates, methods for stapling native peptides are more desirable for easier accessibility and genetic encodability. However, the existing strategy for selectivity control in the stapling of native peptides is relatively limited: the site of anchoring is often dominated by Cys, and the means for achieving the position selectivity among the same type of residues at different locations is lacking. We have developed a simple and powerful strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine residues with formaldehyde by the cooperation of nearby tyrosine or arginine residues. The stapling reactions can proceed with high efficiency and residue selectivity under mild conditions, and generate linchpins with distinct physiochemical properties. The new method for peptide stapling enables unique control of position&#8208;selectivity for substrates bearing multiple reaction sites by reactivity that can be readily built in the peptide sequence.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Approach in Polyoxometalate Synthesis: Formation of a New Divacant Lacunary Polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O36]7&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine&#8208;induced selective structure transformation of lacunary polyoxomolybdate [A&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722; led to a previously unknown divacant lacunary polyoxomolybdate bearing pyridine molecules (py) as protecting groups, [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O34(py)2]3&#8722;, in organic solvents. Lacunary polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O34(py)2]3&#8722; can act as a synthetic precursor of a POM&#8211;organic hybrid structure.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have received increasing attention over the last decades for extending their application and properties that originate from novel structures. For the synthesis of a variety of POM structures, multivacant lacunary POMs are key precursors, which are typically synthesized by empirically controlling the complex equilibrium in aqueous solvents. Unfortunately, despite the excellent catalytic and electrochemical properties of &#8220;polyoxomolybdates&#8221;, only one multivacant lacunary species, i.e., [A&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722;, has been identified and isolated because multivacant lacunary polyoxomolybdates are typically unstable. Here we report a ligand&#8208;directed approach for the selective formation of an unprecedented lacunary polyoxomolybdate in organic solvents. By structure transformation of a pyridine&#8208;coordinated [A&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722;, a new &#947;&#8208;Keggin&#8208;type divacant lacunary polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O36]7&#8722; was obtained, which can be further used as a precursor for synthesizing a POM&#8211;organic hybrid.

         <title>Intramolecular Electric Field Construction in Metal Phthalocyanine as Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transporting Material for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;21&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units with a strong intramolecular electric field is prepared and used as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The best efficiency of the PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTM realizes a record efficiency of 21.23&#8201;% (certified 21.03&#8201;%). The PSCs also exhibit the excellent stability.







Abstract
Low conductivity and hole mobility in the pristine metal phthalocyanines greatly limit their application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). Here, we prepare a Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units as HTMs. In NiPc, the two oxygen atoms in peripheral substituent have a modified effect on the dipole direction, while the central Ni atom contributes more electron to phthalocyanine ring, thus efficiently increasing the intramolecular dipole. Calculation analyses reveal the extracted holes within NiPc are mainly concentrated on the phthalocyanine core induced by the intramolecular electric field, and further to be transferred by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking space channel between NiPc molecules. Finally, the best efficiency of PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTMs realizes a record value of 21.23&#8201;% (certified 21.03&#8201;%). The PSCs also exhibit the good moisture, heating and light stabilities. This work provides a novel way to improve the performance of PSCs with free&#8208;doped metal phthalocyanines as HTMs.

         <title>Interrupted Pyridine Hydrogenation: Asymmetric Synthesis of &#948;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;catalzed hydrogenation of arenes is a well&#8208;known and powerful transformation to yield saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Yet, this transformation is limited to the sole formation of C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we present a method to synthesize enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams from readily available oxazolidinone&#8208;substituted pyridines. Crucial for this reaction is the interruption of the arene reduction by nucleophilic substitution.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an effective method to transform readily available arenes into saturated motifs, however, current hydrogenation strategies are limited to the formation of C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds. The stepwise addition of hydrogen yields reactive unsaturated intermediates that are rapidly reduced. In contrast, the interruption of complete hydrogenation by further functionalization of unsaturated intermediates offers great potential for increasing chemical complexity in a single reaction step. Overcoming the tenet of full reduction in arene hydrogenation has been seldom demonstrated. In this work we report the synthesis of sought&#8208;after, enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams from oxazolidinone&#8208;substituted pyridines and water by an interrupted hydrogenation mechanism.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electrochemical Reduction with Atomically Precise Surface Modification on Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modification with Cd atom doping generates the Au19Cd2(SR)16 nanocluster, which exhibits significantly boosted CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance, doubling that of the undoped Au23. DFT calculations reveal that local surface Cd doping leads to a dynamic behavior of the sulfur active site on Au19Cd2 when interacting with CO, contributing to the energetically favorable formation of CO on the exposed sulfur active site that facilitates the overall CO2RR.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters (NCs) are promising catalytic materials for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this work an atomic level modification of a Au23 NC is made by substituting two surface Au atoms with two Cd atoms, and it enhances the CO2RR selectivity to 90&#8211;95&#8201;% at the applied potential between &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;0.9&#8197;V, which is doubled compared to that of the undoped Au23. Additionally, the Cd&#8208;doped Au19Cd2 exhibits the highest CO2RR activity (2200&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) among the reported NCs. This synergetic effect between Au and Cd is remarkable. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that the exposure of a sulfur active site upon partial ligand removal provides an energetically feasible CO2RR pathway. The thermodynamic energy barrier for CO formation is 0.74&#8197;eV lower on Au19Cd2 than on Au23. These results reveal that Cd doping can boost the CO2RR performance of Au NCs by modifying the surface geometry and electronic structure, which further changes the intermediate binding energy. This work offers insights into the surface doping mechanism of the CO2RR and bimetallic synergism.

         <title>Histone H4 Tails in Nucleosomes: a Fuzzy Interaction with DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
15N relaxation data suggest that amino&#8208;terminal histone H4 tails in reconstituted nucleosome are flexible. This result is rationalized by suitably designed MD simulations, showing that H4 tails are involved in a fuzzy interaction with nucleosomal DNA while retaining their disordered character.







Abstract
The interaction of positively charged N&#8208;terminal histone tails with nucleosomal DNA plays an important role in chromatin assembly and regulation, modulating their susceptibility to post&#8208;translational modifications and recognition by chromatin&#8208;binding proteins. Here, we report residue&#8208;specific 15N NMR relaxation rates for histone H4 tails in reconstituted nucleosomes. These data indicate that H4 tails are strongly dynamically disordered, albeit with reduced conformational flexibility compared to a free peptide with the same sequence. Remarkably, the NMR observables were successfully reproduced in a 2&#8208;&#956;s MD trajectory of the nucleosome. This is an important step toward resolving an apparent inconsistency where prior simulations were generally at odds with experimental evidence on conformational dynamics of histone tails. Our findings indicate that histone H4 tails engage in a fuzzy interaction with nucleosomal DNA, underpinned by a variable pattern of short&#8208;lived salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which persists at low ionic strength (0&#8211;100&#8197;mM NaCl).

         <title>Embedment of Quantum Dots and Biomolecules in a Dipeptide Hydrogel Formed In Situ Using Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dipeptide hydrogel was obtained by dynamic assembly in the confined space of continuous&#8208;flow microfluidics. Organic porphyrins and inorganic quantum dots (QDs) were integrated in the system for energy transfer, and dynamic structural control over hydrogel formation and QD integration occurred within the microchannel network (see picture).







Abstract
As low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators, dipeptide hydrogel materials are suited for embedding multiple organic molecules and inorganic nanoparticles. Herein, a simple but precisely controllable method is presented that enables the fabrication of dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogels by supramolecular assembly inside microfluidic channels. Water&#8208;soluble quantum dots (QDs) as well as premixed porphyrins and a dipeptide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were injected into a Y&#8208;shaped microfluidic junction. At the DMSO/water interface, the confined fabrication of a dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogel was initiated. Thereafter, the as&#8208;formed hydrogel flowed along a meandering microchannel in a continuous fashion, gradually completing gelation and QD entrapment. In contrast to hydrogelation in conventional test tubes, microfluidically controlled hydrogelation led to a tailored dipeptide hydrogel regarding material morphology and nanoparticle distribution.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance of 1,4&#8208;Azaborine Derivatives as Models of BN&#8208;doped PAHs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule conductance of 1,4&#8208;azaborine acene&#8208;type compounds studied using the scanning tunneling microscope break&#8208;junction technique. This substitution ensures an unambiguous electron path through both heteroatoms. A moderate change in conductance is observed when compared to the parent all&#8208;carbon structure. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transport calculations support the experimental results.







Abstract
The single&#8208;molecule conductance of a series of BN&#8208;acene&#8208;like derivatives has been measured by using scanning tunneling break&#8208;junction techniques. A strategic design of the target molecules has allowed us to include azaborine units in positions that unambiguously ensure electron transport through both heteroatoms, which is relevant for the development of customized BN&#8208;doped nanographenes. We show that the conductance of the anthracene azaborine derivative is comparable to that of the pristine all&#8208;carbon anthracene compound. Notably, this heteroatom substitution has also allowed us to perform similar measurements on the corresponding pentacene&#8208;like compound, which is found to have a similar conductance, thus evidencing that B&#8211;N doping could also be used to stabilize and characterize larger acenes for molecular electronics applications. Our conclusions are supported by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transport calculations.

         <title>An Efficient Turing&#8208;Type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 Multi&#8208;Interfacial Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Electrocatalyst**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 structure has been synthesized, which possesses rich Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 interfaces, exhibiting a 221&#8197;mV overpotential at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte with a high anodic energy efficiency of 84.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although the Turing structures, or stationary reaction&#8208;diffusion patterns, have received increasing attention in biology and chemistry, making such unusual patterns on inorganic solids is fundamentally challenging. We report a simple cation exchange approach to produce Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se on CoSe2 nanobelts relied on diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The resultant Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 material is highly effective to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes with an 84.5&#8201;% anodic energy efficiency. Electrochemical measurements show that the intrinsic OER activity correlates linearly with the length of Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 interfaces, determining that such Turing&#8208;type interfaces are more active sites for OER. Combing X&#8208;ray absorption and computational simulations, we ascribe the excellent OER performance to the optimized adsorption energies for critical oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates at the unconventional interfaces.

Electrochemical measurements show that the intrinsic OER activity correlates linearly with the length of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&#8208;CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces, determining that such Turing&#8208;type interfaces are more active sites for OER. Combing X&#8208;ray absorption and computational simulations, we ascribe the excellent OER performance to the optimized adsorption energies for critical oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates at the unconventional interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Topological&#8208;Distortion&#8208;Driven Amorphous Spherical Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Quality Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous spherically&#8208;shaped metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) microcavities have been constructed by amorphizing MOFs with a topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks, which possess a Q factor as high as &#8776;104 and can provide sufficient feedback for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. The results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOFs&#8208;based photonic components.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as appealing platforms to construct microlasers owing to their compelling characters combining the excellent stability of inorganic materials and processable characters of organic materials. However, MOF microstructures developed thus far are generally composed of multiple edge boundaries due to their crystalline nature, which consequently raises significant scattering losses that are detrimental to lasing performance. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome the above drawback by designing spherically shaped MOFs microcavities. Such spherical MOF microstructures are constructed by amorphizing MOFs with a topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks into the growth environment. With an ultra&#8208;smooth surface and excellent circular boundaries, the acquired spherical microcavities possess a Q factor as high as &#8776;104 and can provide sufficient feedback for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. We hope that these results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOF&#8208;based photonic components.

         <title>Reactivity and Selectivity in Ruthenium Sulfur&#8208;Chelated Diiodo Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diiodo trifluoromethyl sulfur&#8208;chelated ruthenium benzylidene complex was synthesized as precatalyst for olefin metathesis, allowing ring&#8208;opening metathesis of dicyclopentadiene in the presence of a methylene donor to produce 1,3&#8208;divinyl&#8208;hexahydropentalenes and depolymerization of polybutadiene upon green light irradiation. The selectivity displayed by the catalyst is attained through a fine balance between its rate of pre&#8208;activation and deactivation.







Abstract
A trifluoromethyl sulfur&#8208;chelated ruthenium benzylidene, Ru&#8208;S&#8208;CF3&#8208;I, was synthesized and characterized. This latent precatalyst provides a distinct activity and selectivity profiles for olefin metathesis reactions depending on the substrate. For example, 1,3&#8208;divinyl&#8208;hexahydropentalene derivatives were efficiently obtained by ring&#8208;opening metathesis (ROM) of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). Ru&#8208;S&#8208;CF3&#8208;I also presented a much more effective photoisomerization process from the inactive cis&#8208;diiodo to the active trans&#8208;diiodo configuration after exposure to 510&#8197;nm (green light), allowing for a wide scope of photoinduced olefin metathesis reactions. DFT calculations suggest a faster formation and enhanced stability of the active trans&#8208;diiodo species of Ru&#8208;S&#8208;CF3&#8208;I compared with Ru&#8208;S&#8208;Ph&#8208;I, explaining its higher reactivity. In addition, the photochemical release of chloride anions by irradiation of Cl&#8208;BODIPY in the presence of DCPD derivatives with diiodo Ru benzylidenes, led to in situ generation of chloride complexes, which quickly produced the corresponding cross&#8208;linked polymers. Thus, novel selective pathways that use visible light to guide olefin metathesis based synthetic sequences is presented.

         <title>Leveraging Free Volume Manipulation to Improve the Membrane Separation Performance of Amine&#8208;Functionalized PIM&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protection/deprotection strategy was developed to enhance the separation performance of amine&#8208;functionalized PIM&#8208;1. Thermal deprotection yielded a synergistic boost in size&#8208;sieving and CO2 diffusion, ultimately surpassing the H2/CH4, O2/N2 and H2/N2 upper bounds and boosting CO2 permeability by 200&#8201;%.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;separation polymer membranes display a characteristic permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off that has limited their industrial use. The most comprehensive approach to improving performance is to devise strategies that simultaneously increase fractional free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and enhance sorption selectivity, but generalizable methods for such approaches are exceedingly rare. Here, we present an in&#8197;situ crosslinking and solid&#8208;state deprotection method to access previously inaccessible sorption and diffusion characteristics in amine&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity. Free volume element (FVE) size can be increased while preserving a narrow FVE distribution, enabling below&#8208;upper bound polymers to surpass the H2/N2, H2/CH4, and O2/N2 upper bounds and improving CO2&#8208;based selectivities by 200&#8201;%. This approach can transform polymers into chemical analogues with improved performance, thereby overcoming traditional permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;offs.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Engineered DNAzyme Sensor for Cell&#8208;Selective Imaging of Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activatable engineering strategy was developed to generate a new DNAzyme sensor technology. The catalytic sensing probe remained silent in normal cells but could be reactivated by a cancer&#8208;specific enzyme, thus enabling metal&#8208;ion signals to be identified as occurring in tumor cells as opposed to normal cells both in vitro and in vivo (see picture).







Abstract
There is intense interest in imaging intracellular metal ions because of their vital roles in many cellular processes. The challenge has been to develop chemical approaches that can detect metal ions in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Herein we report the design of an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor technology that can distinguish metal&#8208;ion signals in tumor cells from those in normal cells both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, the sensing activity of a traditional DNAzyme sensor was inhibited by engineering with a blocking sequence containing an abasic site that can be cleaved by cancer&#8208;specific enzymes and thus enables the selective recovery of metal&#8208;ion sensing capability in cancer cells. We demonstrated that the DNAzyme sensor not only enables cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective sensing and imaging of metal ions through an enzymically activated pathway, but also precise control over its metal&#8208;ion sensing activity in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. We envision the use of this biosensing technology to probe the biological roles of diverse metal ions in specific diseases.

         <title>From Parkesine to Celluloid: The Birth of Organic Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The period beginning with the 20th century has been referred to as the Age of Plastics. While many trace the start of this to the production of Bakelite in 1907, this was proceeded by semi&#8208;synthetic plastics dating back to the mid&#8208;1800s. The history and development of these early materials is presented, while also attempting to clarify the differences between the related materials collodion, Parkesine, and celluloid.







Abstract
The birth of modern organic plastics can be traced back to the mid&#8208;1800s with various semi&#8208;synthetic plastics derived from cellulose nitrate. Examples of such materials include Parkesine introduced by Alexander Parkes in 1860 and celluloid introduced by John Wesley Hyatt in 1870. The history and development of these early materials is presented, while also attempting to clarify the differences between the related materials collodion, Parkesine, and celluloid.

     alt="From Parkesine to Celluloid: The Birth of Organic Plastics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period beginning with the 20th century has been referred to as the Age of Plastics. While many trace the start of this to the production of Bakelite in 1907, this was proceeded by semi&#8208;synthetic plastics dating back to the mid&#8208;1800s. The history and development of these early materials is presented, while also attempting to clarify the differences between the related materials collodion, Parkesine, and celluloid.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Arylation of NH&#8208;Sulfoximines with Aryl Halides via Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel strategy for  N  &#8208;arylation of  NH&#8208;  sulfoximines has been developed by merging nickel catalysis and electrochemistry (in an undivided cell), thereby providing a practical method for the construction of sulfoximine derivatives. Paired electrolysis is employed in this protocol, so a sacrificial anode is not required. Owing to the mild reaction conditions, excellent functional group tolerance and yield are achieved. A preliminary mechanistic study indicates that the anodic oxidation of a Ni(II) species is crucial to promote the C&#8211;N bond reductive elimination from the resulting Ni(III) species at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes with Gold(I)&#8208;Cavitands: Total Synthesis of Mafaicheenamine C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral gold(I) cavitand complexes have been developed for the enantioselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This enantioselective cyclization has been applied for the first total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid (+)&#8208;mafaicheenamine C, and its enantiomer, stablishing its configuration as R. The cavity effect was also evaluated in the cycloisomerization of dienynes. A combination of experiments and theoretical studies demonstrates that the cavity of the gold(I) complexes forces the enynes to adopt constrained conformations, which results in the high observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocyclic Ring&#8208;Opening of Nanographene on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclodehydrogenation is of importance to induce planarization of molecules on noble surfaces by annealing. In con&#8208;trast to a number of successful syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by forming carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, it is still scarce to conduct conjugation and cleavage of carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds in molecules. Here, we present a systematic transformation of the C&#8208;N bonds with 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraazaanthraquinodimethane as well as three other derivatives on Au(111). With bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we discovered novel "heterocyclic segregation" reaction of one pyrazine ring with two nitrogen atoms into two quinoline rings with one nitrogen each. Density functional theory calculations showed that the intramolecular ring&#8208;forming and &#8208;opening of nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles are strongly affected by the initial hydrogen&#8208;substrate interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Peptide Permeation Through a Membrane Channel:
Understanding Protamine Translocation Through CymA from Klebsiella Oxytoca</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantifying the passage of the large peptide protamine (Ptm) across CymA, a passive channel for cyclodextrin uptake, is in the focus of this study. Using a reporter&#8208;pair based fluorescence membrane assay we detected the entry of Ptm into liposomes containing CymA. The kinetics of the Ptm entry was independent of its concentration suggesting that the permeation across CymA is the rate&#8208;limiting factor. Furthermore, we reconstituted single CymA channels into planar lipid bilayers and recorded the ion current fluctuations in the presence of Ptm. To this end, we were able to resolve the voltage&#8208;dependent entry of single Ptm peptide molecules into the channel. Extrapolation to zero voltage revealed about 1&#8208;2 events per second and long dwell times, in agreement with the liposome study. Applied&#8208;field and steered molecular dynamics simulations provided an atomistic view on the permeation. It can be concluded that a concentration gradient of 1 &#956;M Ptm leads to a translocation rate of about 1 molecule per second and per channel.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise asymmetric syntheses of streptazone A and abikoviromycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptazone A and abikoviromycin are alkaloids that both feature an unusual arrangement of reactive functionalities within a compact tricyclic ring system. Here, we report a highly concise asymmetric synthesis of both natural products. The route first constructs another family member, streptazone B1, using a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed distal selective allene&#8208;ynamide Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction. A regio&#8208; and enantioselective epoxidation under chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions directly afforded streptazone A in 8 steps overall. In one additional step, a chemoselective, iridium&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the enaminone&#8208;system then gave abikoviromycin. The reactivity of streptazone A towards a cysteine mimic, N&#8208;acetylcysteamine, was studied and revealed unanticipated transformations, including bis&#8208;thiol conjugation which may proceed via formation of a cyclopentadienone intermediate. With flexible access to these compounds, studies aimed to identify their direct biological targets are now possible.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;gated Photochemical Synthesis of Phenalene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we pioneer a dual wavelength gated synthesis route to phenalene diimides. Consecutive Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of methylisophthalaldehydes and maleimides, afford hexahydro&#8208;phenalene&#8208;1,6&#8208;diol diimides  via  5&#8208;formyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;benzo[  f  ]isoindoles as the intermediate. Both photoreactions are efficient (82&#8208;99 % yield) and exhibit excellent diastereoselectivity (62&#8208;98 % d.r.). The wavelength&#8208;gated nature of the stepwise reaction enables the modular construction of phenalene diimide scaffolds by choice of substrate and wavelength. Importantly, this synthetic methodology opens a facile avenue to a new class of persistent phenalenyl diimide neutral radicals, constituting a versatile route to spin&#8208;active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the structure diversity of protein building blocks with biosynthesized noncanonical amino acids from aromatic thiols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of structurally novel noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins is valuable for both scientific and biomedical applications. To expand the structural diversity of available ncAAs and to reduce the burden of chemically synthesizing them, we have developed a general and simple biosynthetic method for genetically encoding novel ncAAs into recombinant proteins by feeding cells with economical commercially available or synthetically accessible aromatic thiols. We demonstrate that nearly 50 ncAAs with a diverse array of structures can be biosynthesized from these simple small&#8208;molecule precursors by hijacking the cysteine biosynthetic enzymes, and the resulting ncAAs can subsequently be incorporated into proteins via an expanded genetic code. Moreover, we demonstrate that bio&#8208;orthogonal reactive groups such as aromatic azides and aromatic ketones can be incorporated into green fluorescent protein or a therapeutic antibody with high yields, allowing for subsequent chemical conjugation, which will be useful both for research applications and for the development of homogeneously modified protein therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Chemical Upcycling of Mixed Plastics Guided by a Thermally Stable Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic differences for the glycolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and PET in the presence of a protic ionic salt TBD:MSA catalyst enables the selective and sequential depolymerisation of these two commonly employed polymers. Functionalised cyclic carbonates can be obtained from both mixed plastic wastes and industrial polymer blend.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of plastic waste represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration, and potentially offers a solution to the environmental consequences of increased plastic waste. Most plastics that are widely used today are designed for durability, hence currently available depolymerisation methods typically require harsh conditions and when applied to blended and mixed plastic feeds generate a mixture of products. Herein, we demonstrate that the energetic differences for the glycolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and PET in the presence of a protic ionic salt TBD:MSA catalyst enables the selective and sequential depolymerisation of these two commonly employed polymers. Employing the same procedure, functionalised cyclic carbonates can be obtained from both mixed plastic wastes and industrial polymer blend. This methodology demonstrates that the concept of catalytic depolymerisation offers great potential for selective polymer recycling and also presents plastic waste as a &#8220;greener&#8221; alternative feedstock for the synthesis of high added value molecules.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Alkene Difunctionalization by Direct and Selective Activation of Aliphatic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization method for the direct and selective activation of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds is developed. The significant advantages of this strategy are that the most abundant hydrocarbons are used as feedstocks, and various highly functionalized tertiary, secondary and primary C(sp3)&#8208;hybrid centers can be easily installed. The practicability of this strategy is demonstrated in the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and the concise synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules including Piragliatin.







Abstract
Catalytic alkene difunctionalization is a powerful strategy for the rapid assembly of complex molecules and has wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry. Despite significant progress, a compelling challenge that still needs to be solved is the installation of highly functionalized C(sp3)&#8208;hybridized centers without requiring pre&#8208;activated substrates. We herein report that inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize decatungstate photo&#8208;HAT, in combination with nickel catalysis, provides a versatile platform for three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization through direct and selective activation of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. Compared with previous studies, the significant advantages of this strategy are that the most abundant hydrocarbons are used as feedstocks, and various highly functionalized tertiary, secondary, and primary C(sp3)&#8208;hybrid centers can be easily installed. The practicability of this strategy is demonstrated in the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and the concise synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules including Piragliatin.

         <title>Dynamic Polymer Networks: A New Avenue towards Sustainable and Advanced Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer networks cross&#8208;linked through bonds capable of exchanging with one another have a high potential for increasing the sustainability of polymeric materials. However, the adaptive and responsive properties of these networks can also enhance the properties of electroactive polymers in smart and functional devices. This Minireview highlights recent work at this emerging research boundary and discusses future directions for dynamic polymer networks in soft machine applications.







Abstract
While the fascinating field of soft machines has grown rapidly over the last two decades, the materials they are constructed from have remained largely unchanged during this time. Parallel activities have led to significant advances in the field of dynamic polymer networks, leading to the design of three&#8208;dimensionally cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials that are able to adapt and transform through stimuli&#8208;induced bond exchange. Recent work has begun to merge these two fields of research by incorporating the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of dynamic polymer networks into soft machine components. These include dielectric elastomers, stretchable electrodes, nanogenerators, and energy storage devices. In this Minireview, we outline recent progress made in this emerging research area and discuss future directions for the field.

         <title>Enriching Structural Diversity of Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters with Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of chloride and alkynyl as protecting agents leads to the formation of large gold nanoclusters. Silica gel column chromatography results in the successful isolation and crystallization atomically precise gold nanoclusters [HNEt3]3[Au67L32Cl4] (Au67), [HNEt3]4[Au106L40Cl12] (Au106), where L=3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. They are all superatomic clusters, and show size&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of alkynyl/chloride&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters is described. Silica gel column chromatography is effective in isolating gold nanoclusters from the as&#8208;synthesized cluster mixture to give the clusters Na[Au25L18] (Au25), [HNEt3]3[Au67L32Cl4] (Au67), [HNEt3]4[Au106L40Cl12] (Au106), L=3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. Au67 and Au106 are new clusters; the structures were determined by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Au67 contains a distorted Au18 Marks decahedron shelled by an irregular Au32 and further protected with two V&#8208;shaped Au2L3, 13 linear AuL2 staples and 4 chlorides. Au67 is the first structurally determined 34e superatomic gold nanocluster. Au106 is composed of 106 Au atoms co&#8208;protected by alkynyls and chlorides. It has a Au79 kernel, like in Au102(p&#8208;MBA)44. The surface structure of Au106 includes 20 linear Au&#8208;alkynyl staples, 5 Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl and 2 Cl&#8208;Au motifs. These three gold nanoclusters show size&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and isolation of alkynyl/chloride&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters is described. Silica gel column chromatography is effective in isolating gold nanoclusters from the as&#8208;synthesized cluster mixture to give the clusters Na[Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), [HNEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Au&lt;sub&gt;67&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;67&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), [HNEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Au&lt;sub&gt;106&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;106&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), L=3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;67&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;106&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; are new clusters; the structures were determined by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;67&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; contains a distorted Au&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; Marks decahedron shelled by an irregular Au&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; and further protected with two V&#8208;shaped Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 13 linear AuL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; staples and 4 chlorides. &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;67&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is the first structurally determined 34e superatomic gold nanocluster. &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;106&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is composed of 106 Au atoms co&#8208;protected by alkynyls and chlorides. It has a Au&lt;sub&gt;79&lt;/sub&gt; kernel, like in Au&lt;sub&gt;102&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;MBA)&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;. The surface structure of &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;106&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; includes 20 linear Au&#8208;alkynyl staples, 5 Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl and 2 Cl&#8208;Au motifs. These three gold nanoclusters show size&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Unlocking Hyperpolarization with Metabolism**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proton singlet state on fumarate derived from parahydrogen can be broken by enzymatic conversion to malate, which releases hyperpolarized NMR signals. We demonstrate two &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;phase echo&#8221; pulse sequences to convert the I1zI2z state into net proton magnetization, and show how this can be used for hyperpolarized 1H imaging.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization&#8208;enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can be used to study biomolecular processes in the body, but typically requires nuclei such as 13C, 15N, or 129Xe due to their long spin&#8208;polarization lifetimes and the absence of a proton&#8208;background signal from water and fat in the images. Here we present a novel type of 1H imaging, in which hyperpolarized spin order is locked in a nonmagnetic long&#8208;lived correlated (singlet) state, and is only liberated for imaging by a specific biochemical reaction. In this work we produce hyperpolarized fumarate via chemical reaction of a precursor molecule with para&#8208;enriched hydrogen gas, and the proton singlet order in fumarate is released as antiphase NMR signals by enzymatic conversion to malate in D2O. Using this model system we show two pulse sequences to rephase the NMR signals for imaging and suppress the background signals from water. The hyperpolarization&#8208;enhanced 1H&#8208;imaging modality presented here can allow for hyperpolarized imaging without the need for low&#8208;abundance, low&#8208;sensitivity heteronuclei.

         <title>An Efficient Photochemical Route Towards Triplet Ethynylphosphinidene, HCCP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet HCCP is produced as the final product of the UV induced rearrangement and subsequent dehydrogenation of phosphapropyne, CH3C&#8801;P, in solid Ar. Phosphaallene CH2=C=PH, and ethynylphosphine, HC&#8801;CPH2 are produced as H atoms are transferred along the CCP skeleton prior to dehydrogenation.







Abstract
While the archetypal free phosphinidene, H&#8208;P, has been studied for over a century, reports on uncomplexed, univalent phosphorus compounds are very sparse. Here we demonstrate production of HCCP in solid argon through the UV&#8208;induced rearrangement and subsequent dehydrogenation of phosphapropyne, CH3CP. Migration of H atoms along the CCP backbone of CH3CP resulted in production of the previously unobserved species 1&#8208;phosphapropadiene, CH2=C=PH, followed by ethynylphosphine, HCCPH2.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trifluoromethyl group represents one of the most functional and widely used fluoroalkyl groups in drug design and screening, while the drug candidates containing chiral trifluoromethyl&#8208;bearing carbons are still few due to the lack of efficient methods for the asymmetric introduction of trifluoromethyl group into organic molecules. Herein, we described a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of aryl iodides, for the first time, by utilizing reductive cross&#8208;coupling in enantioselective fluoroalkylation. This novel method has demonstrated high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional group tolerance, especially for substrates containing diverse pharmaceutical and bioactive molecules moieties.

         <title>Exclusively Relativistic:

Periodic Trends in the Melting and Boiling Points of Group 12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>First&#8208;principles simulations can advance our understanding of phase transitions but are often too costly for the heavier elements, which require a relativistic treatment.
Addressing this challenge, we recently composed an indirect approach: A precise incremental calculation of absolute Gibbs energies for the solid and liquid with a relativistic Hamiltonian that enables an accurate determination of melting and boiling points (MPs and BPs).
Here, we apply this approach to the Group 12 elements Zn, Cd, Hg, and Cn, whose MPs and BPs we calculate with a mean absolute deviation of only 5\% and 1\%, respectively, while we confirm the previously predicted liquid aggregate state of Cn.
At a non&#8208;relativistic level of theory, we obtain surprisingly similar MPs and BPs of 650&#177;30 K and 1250&#177;20 K, suggesting that periodic trends in this group are exclusively relativistic in nature. Ultimately, we discuss these results and their implication for Groups 11 and 14.</dc:description>

Here, we apply this approach to the Group 12 elements Zn, Cd, Hg, and Cn, whose MPs and BPs we calculate with a mean absolute deviation of only 5\% and 1\%, respectively, while we confirm the previously predicted liquid aggregate state of Cn.
At a non&#8208;relativistic level of theory, we obtain surprisingly similar MPs and BPs of 650&#177;30 K and 1250&#177;20 K, suggesting that periodic trends in this group are exclusively relativistic in nature. Ultimately, we discuss these results and their implication for Groups 11 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Guidelines for Tuning the Excited State H&#252;ckel&#8208;Baird Hybrid Aromatic Character of Pro&#8208;Aromatic Quinoidal Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pro&#8208;aromatic molecules have higher&#8208;energy diradicaloid states that are significantly influenced by resonance structures in which conjugated rings take on H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic character. Recently, it has been argued that there are also pro&#8208;aromatic molecules that adopt central units with 4  n  &#960;&#8208;electron Baird&#8208;aromatic character in the T  1  state, although detailed analysis suggests that these compounds are better labelled as T  1  H&#252;ckel&#8208;Baird hybrid molecules where H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromaticity dominates. Herein, we consider a series of symmetrically substituted conjugated rings with potential Baird aromaticity in the lowest excited triplet and singlet states. Our computational results allow us to establish general guidelines for the rational design of molecules with excited state H&#252;ckel/Baird aromaticity in pro&#8208;aromatic quinoidal compounds. We found two main strategies to promote high Baird aromatic character: (  i  ) anionic and small conjugated rings with electron donating groups as substituents and small exocyclic groups with electron withdrawing substituents, or (  ii  ) electron deficient conjugated rings with exocyclic electron&#8208;donor substitution.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Toward a Photoinduced Single&#8208;Chain Magnet Showing Large Coercivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of photoswitchable molecular nanomagnets with substantial coercivity, which is indispensable for information storage and process applications, is quite challenging. Introducing photo&#8208;responsive spin&#8208;crossover units provides a feasible means of controlling the magnetic anisotropy, interactions and overall nanomagnet properties. Herein, we report a cyanide&#8208;bridged chain    1&#183;12H  2  O    ({[(  Pz  Tp)Fe  III  (CN)  3  ]  2  Fe  II  (Pmat)  2  }  n  &#183;12H  2  O ) generated by linking the Fe  II  &#8208;based spin&#8208;crossover unit with the [(  Pz  Tp)Fe(CN)  3  ]&#160;  &#8210;&#160;  (  Pz  Tp: tetrakis(pyrazolyl)borate) building block in the presence of asymmetric ditopic ligand Pmat ((4&#8208;pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyleneamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole). Structural characterization revealed that the introduction of this asymmetric ligand led to a distorted coordination environment of Fe  II  ions, which were equatorially coordinated by four cyanide N atoms, and apically coordinated by one pyridine N atom and one triazole N atom. Upon 808&#8208;nm light irradiation,    1&#183;12H  2  O    underwent photoinduced spin&#8208;crossover and exhibited single&#8208;chain magnet behavior with a coercive field of up to 1.3 T. This represents a 3d&#8208;based photoinduced single&#8208;chain magnets exhibiting pronounced hysteresis.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Radical&#8208;Mediated Photocaged Cyanine under Hypoxia for in vivo Precision Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocaging with noninvasive nature and remote control holds promise for fine manipulation of biological events in space and time. However, current near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocages are oxygen&#8208;dependent photolysis and lack of timely feedback regulation, proven to be the major bottleneck for targeted therapy. Herein, we discovered a radical&#8208;mediated photo&#8208;activation mechanism of dialkylamine&#8208;substituted cyanine (Cy&#8208;NH) under hypoxia accompaning with emissive fragments generation, which efficiently validated with retrosynthesis and spectral analysis. For the first time, we have realized orthogonal manipulation of this radical&#8208;mediated photocaging and dual&#8208;modal optical signals in living cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice, making a breakthrough in directly spatiotemporal control and timely in vivo feedback regulation. This discovery of unique radical&#8208;mediated photoactivation conquers the limitation of hypoxia, allowing site&#8208;specifically remote control for targeted therapy, which paves a new way for expanding the photo&#8208;triggered toolboxes for on&#8208;demand drug release, especially in a physiological context with dual&#8208;mode optical imaging under hypoxia.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene plays an important role in light&#8208;olefin chemical industry. However, the conversion and selectivity remain a fundamental challenge at low temperatures.

The top&#8208;layer Mo ions with unsaturated Mo&#8208;N  1/6  and Mo&#8208;N  1/3  coordination structures create high&#8208;density Lewis acid sites at surfaces, leading to the effective activation of C&#8208;H bond without over cracking of C&#8208;C bond during the non&#8208;oxidative propane dehydrogenation. We demonstrate ~11% of propane conversion and ~95% of propylene selectivity with porous single&#8208;crystalline Mo  2  N and MoN monoliths at 500 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Thermotropic 3D and 2D Double Gyroid Nanostructures with Sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm Feature Size from Scalable Sugar&#8208;Polyolefin Conjugates</title>

         <title>Complex&#8208;Solid&#8208;Solution Electrocatalyst Discovery by Computational Prediction and High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex solid solutions (&#8220;high&#8208;entropy alloys&#8221;) promise a paradigm change in electrocatalysis but expose the challenge of almost unlimited options in adjusting their compositions. We propose the utilisation of computational models, combined with high&#8208;throughput experimentation for the verification of the model assumptions, which allows for model refinement in iterative loops, understanding of binding mechanisms, and discovery of the most active composition.







Abstract
Complex solid solutions (&#8220;high entropy alloys&#8221;), comprising five or more principal elements, promise a paradigm change in electrocatalysis due to the availability of millions of different active sites with unique arrangements of multiple elements directly neighbouring a binding site. Thus, strong electronic and geometric effects are induced, which are known as effective tools to tune activity. With the example of the oxygen reduction reaction, we show that by utilising a data&#8208;driven discovery cycle, the multidimensionality challenge raised by this catalyst class can be mastered. Iteratively refined computational models predict activity trends around which continuous composition&#8208;spread thin&#8208;film libraries are synthesised. High&#8208;throughput characterisation datasets are then used as input for refinement of the model. The refined model correctly predicts activity maxima of the exemplary model system Ag&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru. The method can identify optimal complex&#8208;solid&#8208;solution materials for electrocatalytic reactions in an unprecedented manner.

         <title>Cocrystal Engineering: Toward Solution&#8208;Processed Near&#8208;Infrared 2D Organic Cocrystals for Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;area cocrystal film is designed and fabricated in a low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed method. Attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;transfer absorption in the NIR region, the generation of long&#8208;lived free carriers, and the device configuration optimization, the cocrystal film&#8208;based photodetector exhibits a high responsivity to a wide spectra range, coupled with fast response times and large EQE.







Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D cocrystals with strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption have been designed and prepared. Driven by the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (donor) and C60 (acceptor) self&#8208;assemble into a NIR cocrystal with absorption wavelength up to 1080&#8197;nm. By tailoring the growth solvents and processes, the cocrystal morphologies can be tuned from 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets to large&#8208;area 2D cocrystal films with length reaching several millimeters. Owing to the highly ordered donor&#8211;acceptor arrangement, the CT absorption in the 2D cocrystals is enhanced and is comparable to singlet absorption. The uniform 2D cocrystals, with enhanced CT absorption in the NIR region, displays a high responsivity of 2424&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 to NIR light and a fast response time of 0.6&#8197;s. The excellent device performance is attributed to the generation of long&#8208;lived free charge carriers as revealed by transient absorption spectroscopy and optimization of device configuration.

         <title>Guest Exchange by a Partial Energy Ratchet in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cucurbiturils can be prime components to build energy ratchets in water. Guest molecules can be exchanged in the synthetic macrocycle cucurbit[7]uril by involving kinetic traps, and in such a way as modulating energy wells and kinetic barriers using pH, light, and redox stimuli







Abstract
Molecular machines are ubiquitous in nature and function away from equilibrium by consuming fuels to produce appropriate work. Chemists have recently excelled at mimicking the fantastic job performed by natural molecular machines with synthetic systems soluble in organic solvents. In efforts toward analogous systems working in water, we show that guest molecules can be exchanged in the synthetic macrocycle cucurbit[7]uril by involving kinetic traps, and in such a way as modulating energy wells and kinetic barriers using pH, light, and redox stimuli. Ditolyl&#8208;viologen can also be exchanged using the best kinetic trap and interfaced with alginate, thus affording pH&#8208;responsive blue, fluorescent hydrogels. With tunable rate and binding constants toward relevant guests, cucurbiturils may become excellent ring molecules for the construction of advanced molecular machines working in water.

         <title>Efficient Separation of Acetylene and Carbon Dioxide in a Decorated Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A decorated zeolite material, Cu@FAU, exhibits highly selective adsorption of acetylene and thus efficient separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide, unlocking the potential of zeolite materials in challenging industrial separations.







Abstract
The almost identical molecular sizes and volatilities of acetylene and carbon dioxide make their separation extremely challenging in industry. Reported here is the efficient separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide (v/v=2/1, which is relevant to that in the industrial cracking stream) in faujasite zeolites decorated with atomically&#8208;dispersed copper(II) sites under ambient conditions. In situ neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering confirm that the confined copper(II) site displays chemoselective yet reversible binding to acetylene, whereas adsorbed carbon dioxide molecules are stabilized by weak host&#8211;guest supramolecular interactions with the framework oxygen centers, thus resulting in the efficient separation of these two gases under flow conditions. A designed adsorption&#8208;purging&#8208;desorption system based upon Cu@FAU is established for the recovery of high purity acetylene (98&#8211;99&#8201;%) from the mixture of acetylene and carbon dioxide, offering an unprecedented separation factor of 22.2 with an effective dynamic uptake of acetylene of 1.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K.

         <title>Tuning Photoinduced Electron Transfer in POM&#8208;Bodipy Hybrids by Controlling the Environment: Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer of a series of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;bodipy hybrids were examined. The data show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact on the relaxation dynamics of the excited states by modifying the solvation shell around the POM. The experimental findings were corroborated with a computational investigation combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulation methods.







Abstract
The optical and electrochemical properties of a series of polyoxometalate (POM) oxoclusters decorated with two bodipy (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) light&#8208;harvesting units were examined. Evaluated here in this polyanionic donor&#8208;acceptor system is the effect of the solvent and associated counterions on the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer. The results show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact upon the energy of the charge&#8208;transfer state by modifying the solvation shell around the POMs. This modification leads to a significantly shorter charge separation time in the case of smaller counterion and slower charge recombination in a less polar solvent. These results were rationalized in terms of Marcus theory and show that solvent and counterion both affect the driving force for photoinduced electron transfer and the reorganization energy. This was corroborated with theoretical investigations combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Unveiling the Hydration Structure of Ferrihydrite for Hole Storage in Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [FeO6] polyhedral hydration structure of ferrihydrite is responsible for its hole storage function. With the continuous loss of three molecules of crystal water, the quantity of stored photogenerated holes for PEC water oxidation gradually decreases, accompanied by the destruction of the hydration structure.







Abstract
Ferrihydrite (Fh) has been demonstrated acting as a hole&#8208;storage layer (HSL) in photoelectrocatalysis system. However, the intrinsic structure responsible for the hole storage function for Fh remains unclear. Herein, by dehydrating the Fh via a careful calcination, the essential relation between the HSL function and the structure evolution of Fh material is unraveled. The irreversible and gradual loss of crystal water molecules in Fh leads to the weakening of the HSL function, accompanied with the arrangement of inner structure units. A structure evolution of the dehydration process is proposed and the primary active structure of Fh for HSL is identified as the [FeO6] polyhedral units bonding with two or three molecules of crystal water. With the successive loss of chemical crystal water, the coordination symmetry of [FeO6] hydration units undergoes mutation and a more ordered structure is formed, causing the difficulty for accepting photogenerated holes as a consequence.

         <title>A Highly Ordered Quantum Dot Supramolecular Assembly Exhibiting Photoinduced Emission Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly ordered coaggregates of quantum dots (QDs) with inter&#8208;QD interaction can be created by using the self&#8208;assembled azobenzene derivatives. Furthermore, the inter&#8208;QD interaction can be reversibly controlled by photoirradiation and time&#8208;aging.







Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular assembly systems enable the generation of materials with outstanding properties, not obtained from single&#8208;component systems, via a synergetic effect. Herein, we demonstrate a novel supramolecular coassembly system rendering highly ordered quantum dot (QD) arrangement structures formed via the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene derivatives, where the photocontrollable photoluminescence (PL) properties of the QDs are realized based on photoisomerization. Upon mixing the assembled azobenzene derivatives and QDs in apolar media, a time&#8208;evolution coaggregation into hierarchical nanosheets with a highly ordered QD arrangement structure occurs. Upon photoirradiation, the nanosheets transform into ill&#8208;defined aggregates without arranged QDs together with enhancing the PL intensity. In days, the photoirradiated coaggregates undergo recovery of the PL properties corresponding to the arranged QDs through thermal isomerization.

         <title>Fused Quinoidal Dithiophene&#8208;Based Helicenes: Facile Synthesis via Intramolecular Radical&#8208;Radical Coupling Reaction and Dynamics of Interconversion of Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of fused quinoidal dithiophene&#8208;based double and triple helicenes (  1&#8208;M  ,  2&#8208;M  ,  2&#8208;M&#8208;Cl  ,  3&#8208;M  ,  3&#8208;M&#8208;Cl  ) were synthesized by intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling followed by oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. These helical molecules show dynamic interconversion of enantiomers in solution as revealed by variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements, and the energy barriers are correlated to the substituents and topological structures. Notably, dynamic high performance liquid chromatography was used to quantitatively investigate the room&#8208;temperature racemization process between the (P,P,M)&#8208; and (P,M,M)&#8208; enantiomers of the triple helical  3&#8208;M&#8208;Cl  , which gave an interconversion energy barrier in consistent with density functional theory calculations. Their optical and electrochemical properties are dependent on the fusion mode. Our studies provide both new synthetic strategy and new dynamic analytical method for helicenes with unique electronic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Implantable biosupercapacitor inspired by the cellular redox system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn supercapacitor has high potential for in vivo energy storage because it can be used in aqueous environments and stitched to inner parts of the body, such as blood vessels. The biocompatibility issue for frequently used pseudocapacitive materials, such as metal oxides, is controversial in the human body. Here, we report an implantable CNT yarn supercapacitor inspired by the cellular redox system. In all living cells, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Based on this redox system, CNT yarn electrodes were fabricated by inserting a twist in CNT sheets with electrochemically deposited NAD and benzoquinone for redox shuttling. Consequently, the NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes exhibited the maximum area capacitance (55.73 mFcm  &#8722;2  ) under physiological conditions, such as phosphate&#8208;buffered saline and serum. In addition, the yarn electrodes showed a negligible loss of capacitance after 10,000 repeated charge/discharge cycles and deformation tests (bending/knotting). More importantly, NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes implanted into the abdominal cavity of a rat&#8217;s kin exhibited the stable in vivo electrical performance of a supercapacitor. Therefore, these findings demonstrate a redox biomolecule&#8208;applied platform for implantable energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immunoregulatory enzyme IDO1 strengthens cancer immune escape, and inhibition of IDO1 by means of new chemotypes and mechanisms of action is considered a promising opportunity to IDO1 inhibitor discovery. IDO1 is a cofactor&#8208;binding, redox&#8208;sensitive protein which calls for monitoring of IDO1 activity in its native cellular environment. We developed a new, robust fluorescence&#8208;based assay amenable to high throughput, which detects kynurenine in cells. Screening of a ca. 150,000&#8208;member compound library discovered unprecedented, potent IDO1 modulators with different mechanisms of action, including direct IDO1 inhibitors, regulators of IDO1 expression and inhibitors of heme synthesis. Three IDO1&#8208;modulator chemotypes were identified that bind to apo&#8208;IDO1 and compete with the heme cofactor. Our new cell&#8208;based technology opens up novel opportunities for medicinal chemistry programs in immuno&#8208;oncology.</dc:description>

         <title>&#951; 3&#8208;Coordination and Functionalization of the 2&#8208;Phosphaethynthiolate Anion at Lanthanum(III)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the  &#951;  3  &#8208;coordination of the 2&#8208;phosphaethynthiolate anion in the complex (PN)  2  La(SCP) (  2  ) [PN =  N  &#8208;(2&#8208;(diisopropylphosphanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylanilide)]. Structural comparison with dinuclear thiocyanate bridged (PN)  2  La(  &#956;  &#8208;1,3&#8208;SCN)  2  La(PN)  2  (  3  ) and azide bridged (PN)  2  La(  &#956;  &#8208;1,3&#8208;N  3  )  2  La(PN)  2  (  4  ) complexes indicates that the [SCP]  &#8211;  coordination mode is mainly governed by electronic, rather than steric factors. Quantum mechanical investigations reveal large contributions of the antibonding &#960;&#8208;orbital of the [SCP]  &#8211;  ligand to the LUMO of complex  2  , rendering it the ideal precursor for the first functionalization of the [SCP]  &#8211;  anion. Complex  2  was therefore reacted with CAACs which induced a selective rearrangement of the [SCP]  &#8211;  ligand to form the first CAAC stabilized group 15 &#8211; group 16 fulminate&#8208;type complexes (PN)2La{SPC(  R  CAAC)} (  5a,b  ) (R = Ad, Me). A detailed reaction mechanism for the SCP to SPC isomerization is proposed based on DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Highly Ordered Glyco&#8208;Inside Nano&#8208;Assemblies through RAFT Dispersion Polymerization of Galactose&#8208;decorated Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glyco&#8208;assemblies derived from amphiphilic sugar&#8208;decorated block copolymers (ASBCs) have emerged prominently due to their wide application e.g. in biomedicine and as drug carriers. However, to efficiently construct these glyco&#8208;assemblies is still a challenge. Here, we report an efficient technology for the synthesis of glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies by utilizing RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated methacrylate for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Using this approach, a series of highly ordered glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing intermediate morphologies were fabricated by adjusting the length of the hydrophobic glycoblock and the polymerization solids content. A specific morphology of complex vesicles was captured during the PISA process and the formation mechanism is explained by the morphology of its precursor and intermediate. Thus, this method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to enable the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photoelectrochemical Conversion of Methane into Ethylene Glycol by WO3 Nanobar Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of methane (CH  4  ) has been extensively explored for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals, yet remains a great challenge in high selectivity toward C  2+  products. Herein, we report the optimization of the reactivity of hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) on WO  3  via facet tuning to achieve efficient ethylene glycol production from PEC CH  4  conversion. A combination of materials simulation and radicals trapping test provides insight into the reactivity of &#8226;OH on different facets of WO  3  , showing the highest reactivity of surface&#8208;bound &#8226;OH on {010} facets. As such, the WO  3  with the highest {010} facet ratio exhibits a superior PEC CH  4  conversion efficiency, reaching an ethylene glycol production rate of 0.47 &#181;mol cm  &#8211;2  h  &#8211;1  . Based on  in&#8208;situ  characterization, the methanol, which could be attacked by reactive &#8226;OH to form hydroxymethyl radicals, is confirmed to be the main intermediate for the production of ethylene glycol. Our finding is expected to provide new insight for the design of active and selective catalysts toward PEC CH  4  conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Borrowing Alkylation of 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols in the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;Aminobutyric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time we have been able to employ enantiopure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols derived from abundant amino acids in C&#8208;C bond forming hydrogen borrowing alkylation reactions. These reactions are facilitated by the use of the aryl ketone Ph*COMe. Racemisation of the amine stereocentre during alkylation can be prevented by the use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric base and protection of the nitrogen with a sterically hindered triphenylmethane (trityl) or benzyl group. The Ph* and trityl groups are readily cleaved in one pot to give &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) products as their HCl salts without further purification. Both steps may be performed in sequence without isolation of the hydrogen borrowing intermediate, removing the need for column chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer Blocking Strategy Inhibits SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Virus Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is threating global health. Inhibiting interaction of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein (S RBD) and human ACE2 receptor is a promising treatment strategy. However, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 neutralizing antibodies are compromised by their risk of antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) and unfavorably large size for intranasal delivery. To avoid the limitations of neutralizing antibodies, we proposed and demonstrated an aptamer blocking strategy by engineering aptamers&#8217; binding to the region on S  RBD  that directly mediates ACE2 receptor engagement, leading to block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. With aptamer selection against S  RBD  and molecular docking, aptamer CoV2&#8208;6 was identified and successfully applied to prevent, compete, and substitute ACE2 from binding to S  RBD  protein. CoV2&#8208;6 was further shortened and engineered as a circular bivalent apamer CoV2&#8208;6C3 (cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3) to improve the stability, affinity, and inhibition efficacy. With its circular form, cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3 aptamer was found to be stable in serum for more than 12 hours and can be stored at room temperature for more than 14 days. The circular bivalent aptamer binds to S  RBD  with high affinity (Kd of 0.13 nM) and blocks authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus with a half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.42 nM. With its excellent affinity, stability, safety and programmability, our aptamer showed its capability to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection, suggesting aptamer blocking strategy as a new direction for developing therapeutic agents against COVID&#8208;19 and other emerging infectious diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE&#8208;active Chiral [3]Rotaxanes with Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches with multiple switchable emission states and high dissymmetry factors (glum) has attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications in diverse fields such as the development of smart devices and sensors. Herein, a new family of AIE&#8208;active chiral [3]rotaxanes were designed and synthesized, from which a novel CPL switching system was successfully constructed. The switching process was realized through the controlled motions of the chiral pillar[5]arene macrocycles along the axle through the addition or removal of the acetate anions, which not only modulated the chirality information transfer but also tuned the aggregations of the integrated [3]rotaxanes, thus resulting in reversible transformations between two emission states with both high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and high dissymmetry factors (glum) values.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;mediated Intermolecular Coupling of Alkenes with Ketones via Acyloxy Nitroso Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Unveiling the photoinduced electron&#8208;donating character of MoS2 in covalently linked hybrids featuring perylenediimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The covalent functionalization of MoS  2  with a perylenediimide (PDI) is reported and the study is accompanied by detailed characterization of the newly prepared MoS  2  &#8208;PDI hybrid material. Covalently functionalized MoS  2  interfacing organic photoactive species have shown electron and/or energy accepting, energy reflecting or bi&#8208;directional electron accepting features. Herein, a rationally designed PDI, unsubstituted at the perylene core to act as electron acceptor, forces MoS  2  to fully demonstrate for the first time its electron donor capabilities. The photophysical response of MoS  2  &#8208;PDI is visualized in an energy&#8208;level diagram, while femtosecond transient absorption studies disclose the formation of MoS  2  &#8226;+  &#8208;PDI  &#8226;&#8211;  charge separated state. The tunable electronic properties of MoS  2  , as a result of covalently linking photoactive organic species with precise characteristics, unlock their potentiality and enable their application in light&#8208;harvesting and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomic level control over the position and growth of a single and continuous metal chain is an ambitious goal that often requires complex and costly processes. Herein, we demonstrate that  1Pd&#8208;DNA  molecules, comprising a continuous single chain of Pd  II  ions, can be prepared by a simple self&#8208;assembly reaction between the complex [Pd(  Cheld  )(CH  3  CN)] (  1Pd_CH  3  CN  ) (  Cheld  = chelidamic acid) and single&#8208;stranded DNA homopolymers (ss&#8208;DNA) containing adenine (  A  ) or 7&#8208;deazaadenine (  X  ) bases. The single Pd  II  &#8208;base pairs  [1Pd(  N1&#8208;  A)]  and  [1Pd(  N1  &#8208;X)]  were synthesized and characterized in solution and solid&#8208;state (X&#8208;ray diffraction) revealing an arrangement similar to that of natural Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs. Subsequently,  1Pd&#8208;DNA  hybrids were prepared, characterized, and their structures studied by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results indicate that the  1Pd&#8208;DNA  structures resemble that of double&#8208;stranded DNA, with one strand being replaced by a supramolecular stack of continuous Pd  II  complexes. Overall, this study presents a simple strategy for the fabrication of 1D nano&#8208;architectures based on Pd&#8208;DNA systems whose properties could be customized by a rational design of the Pd  II  complex.Overall, this study presents a simple strategy for the fabrication of 1D nano&#8208;architectures based on Pd&#8208;DNA systems whose properties could be customized by a rational design of the Pd  II  complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered, Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Self&#8208;Assembly of Aqueous Arylazopyrazoles at the Air&#8211;Water Interface and Switching of Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopically oriented, large polar crystalline films were fabricated at the air&#8211;water interface by photoisomerization of a cis&#8208;arylazopyrazole derivative dissolved in the aqueous phase. The trans&#8208;film formed on the solid substrate showed reversible photo&#8208;induced phase changes between the polar crystal and liquid phase, which lead to an on/off photo&#8208;switching of the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation intensity.







Abstract
Trans&#8208;p&#8208;methoxy arylazopyrazole spontaneously forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar crystals, which reversibly undergo liquefaction upon photoisomerization to the cis&#8208;isomer. This liquid cis&#8208;isomer has a large electric dipole moment and is highly soluble in water (solubility up to &#8776;58&#8197;mM), which is remarkably higher than that of the trans&#8208;isomer (690&#8197;&#956;M). Vis&#8208;light illumination of the aqueous cis&#8208;isomer generates macroscopically oriented, non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystals at the air&#8211;water interface. Polar crystals are also formed in sandwich glass cells (spacing, 20&#8197;&#956;m) upon photo&#8208;induced crystallization of the liquid cis&#8208;isomer. The trans&#8208;crystals thus formed showed second harmonic generation (SHG) whose intensity is switched on/off in response to the photo&#8208;induced phase transition.

         <title>Carbodicarbene Bismaalkene Cations: Unravelling the Complexities of Carbene versus Carbone in Heavy Pnictogen Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented low&#8208;coordinate carbodicarbene bismaalkene cations have been prepared which feature C
Bi double dative bonds. The synthesis of these compounds represents a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C=Bi double&#8208;bond character.







Abstract
We report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the first examples of carbodicarbene&#8201;(CDC)&#8208;stabilized bismuth complexes, which feature low&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth centers with C=Bi multiple&#8208;bond character. Monocations [(CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl][SbF6] (8) and [(CDC)BiBr2(THF)2][SbF6] (11), dications [(CDC)Bi(Ph)][SbF6]2 (9) and [(CDC)BiBr(THF)3][NTf2]2 (12), and trication [(CDC)2Bi][NTf2]3 (13) have been synthesized via sequential halide abstractions from (CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl2 (7) and (CDC)BiBr3 (10). Notably, the dications and trication exhibit C
Bi double dative bonds and thus represent unprecedented bismaalkene cations. The synthesis of these species highlights a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C&#8722;Bi &#960;&#8208;bonding character. The CDC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (7&#8211;13) were compared with related NHC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (1, 3&#8211;6) and show substantially different structural properties. Indeed, the CDC ligand has a remarkable influence on the overall stability of the resulting low&#8208;coordinate Bi complexes, suggesting that CDC is a superior ligand to NHC in heavy pnictogen chemistry.

         <title>A Chiral Pentafluorinated Isopropyl Group via Iodine(I)/(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iodine(I)/(III) catalysed construction of an enantioenriched fluorinated isostere of the iPr group is reported. The difluorination of readily accessible &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;styrenes is enabled by the in situ generation of a chiral ArIF2 species to forge a stereocentre with the substituents F, CH2F and CF3 (up to 95&#8201;%, &gt;20:1 vic:gem difluorination). Catalyst editing for preliminary validation of enantioselectivity is placed on a structural foundation.







Abstract
An I(I)/(III) catalysis strategy to construct an enantioenriched fluorinated isostere of the iPr group is reported. The difluorination of readily accessible &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;styrenes is enabled by the in situ generation of a chiral ArIF2 species to forge a stereocentre with the substituents F, CH2F and CF3 (up to 95&#8201;%, &gt;20:1 vicinal:geminal difluorination). The replacement of the metabolically labile benzylic proton results in a highly preorganised scaffold as was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography (&#960;&#8594;&#963;* and stereoelectronic gauche &#963;&#8594;&#963;* interactions).

         <title>Activation of Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane: Access to (tBuCP)n (n=2,&#8197;4) Ligand Frameworks by P&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of (tBuCP)2 with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nickel(I) and nickel(0) complexes result in P&#8722;C bond scission and the coupling of (tBuCP)2 units. The resulting metal complexes feature uncommon phosphaorganic frameworks and an intriguing subsequent reactivity. These results illustrate that (tBuCP)2 can be used as a building block for unusual phosphaorganometallic compounds.







Abstract
The first mixed phosphatetrahedranes were reported only recently and their reactivity is virtually unexplored. Herein, we present a reactivity study on di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane (1), which is the dimer of tert&#8208;butylphosphaalkyne. The (tBuCP)2 tetrahedron is activated selectively by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nickel(I) and nickel(0) complexes, resulting in novel complexes featuring diverse (tBuCP)n&#8208;frameworks (n=2,&#8197;4). Release of the (tBuCP)4 framework from one of the complexes was achieved by addition of CO gas. Furthermore, 1 can be used as a source for P2&#8197;units by elimination of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylacetylene in the coordination sphere of nickel.

         <title>Robust Supramolecular Nano&#8208;Tunnels Built from Molecular Bricks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linear ionic molecule forms a stable framework with open pores through X&#8208;aggregation packing, facilitated by a combination of trident&#8208;type ionic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The nano&#8208;tunnel exhibits anisotropic guest diffusion, excellent chemical stability, large CO2 uptake with high CO2/CH4 selectivity, and vapochrometric behavior.







Abstract
Herein we report a linear ionic molecule that assembles into a supramolecular nano&#8208;tunnel structure through synergy of trident&#8208;type ionic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The nano&#8208;tunnel crystal exhibits anisotropic guest adsorption behavior. The material shows good thermal stability and undergoes multi&#8208;stage single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transformations to a nonporous structure on heating. The material exhibits a remarkable chemical stability under both acidic and basic conditions, which is rarely observed in supramolecular organic frameworks and is often related to structures with designed hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Because of the high polarity of the tunnels, this molecular crystal also shows a large CO2&#8208;adsorption capacity while excluding other gases at ambient temperature, leading to high CO2/CH4 selectivity. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission of the molecules gives the bulk crystals vapochromic properties.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterogenolysis of Carbon Oxygen Bonds towards Deuterated Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and easily scalable protocol for deuterogenolysis of carbon oxygen bonds was developed, which leads to a practical approach to synthetically valuable benzyl&#8208;deuterated building blocks and deuterium medicines, including atomoxetine, tesmilifene, amiodarone, and ibuprofen. Combining the in&#8197;situ electrocatalytic heavy water&#8208;splitting, this protocol enables the direct utilization of D2O for construction of high value&#8208;added deuterated chemicals and pharmaceuticals from low costing and easily available alcohols and ketones.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of deuterium into drug molecules to study and improve their biological properties is crucial for drug discovery and development. Herein, we describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed room&#8208;temperature deuterogenolysis of carbon&#8211;oxygen bonds in alcohols and ketones with D2 balloon for practical synthesis of deuterated pharmaceuticals and chemicals with benzyl&#8208;site (sp3 C&#8722;H) D&#8208;incorporation. The highlights of this deoxygenative deuteration strategy are mild conditions, broad scope, practicability and high chemoselectivity. To enable the direct use of D2O, electrocatalytic D2O&#8208;splitting is adapted to in&#8197;situ supply D2 on demand. With this system, the precise incorporation of deuterium in the metabolic position (benzyl&#8208;site) of ibuprofen is demonstrated in a sustainable and practical way with D2O.

         <title>Innovative Synthetic Procedures for Luminogens Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative synthetic procedures involving transition metals, acid, or base are being rapidly developed for the facile synthesis of a diverse range of luminogens that show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgens). These emerging synthetic possibilities will enable AIEgens to be used in a wealth of multidisciplinary applications.







Abstract
As a consequence of their intrinsic advantageous properties, luminogens that show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgens) have received increasing global interest for a wide range of applications. Whereas general synthetic methods towards AIEgens largely rely on tedious procedures and limited reaction types, various innovative synthetic methods have now emerged as complementary, and even alternative, strategies. In this Review, we systematically highlight advancements made in metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization and metal&#8208;free&#8208;promoted pathways for the construction of AIEgens over the past five years, and briefly illustrate new perspectives in this area. The development of innovative synthetic procedures will enable the facile synthesis of AIEgens with great structural diversity for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Oxythiophosphate Approaching the Good Balance with Wide Ultraviolet Transparency, Strong Second Harmonic Effect, and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on first&#8208;principles and experimental studies, the design strategy from (PO4)3&#8722; to (PO3S)3&#8722; is confirmed to enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining large band gap. The oxythiophosphate KH2PO3S with novel motif of (H2PO3S)&#8722; is accordingly predicted to exhibit better UV NLO balance than KH2PO4, including larger birefringence, stronger SHG effect, and shorter phase&#8208;matching SHG wavelength.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) transparency, second harmonic effect and optical birefringence are three vital but mutually restrictive factors in the application of UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. It is difficult for traditional phosphates to achieve a good balance among these factors. In this communication, we propose that the structural evolution of the NLO motif from traditional phosphate to oxythiophosphate would enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining wide UV transparency, which is confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations and preliminary experimental measurements. Following this strategy, we predict that, compared with the well&#8208;known NLO phosphate KH2PO4, the oxythiophosphate KH2PO3S exhibits better balance for the UV NLO performance, including wide UV transparency (UV cutoff down to 203&#8197;nm), strong SHG effect (ca. 0.9&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1), and large birefringence (ca. 0.1 at 1&#8197;&#956;m) with short phase&#8208;matching SHG output wavelength (&#8776;214&#8197;nm).

&lt;p&gt;Based on first&#8208;principles and experimental studies, the design strategy from (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to (PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is confirmed to enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining large band gap. The oxythiophosphate KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S with novel motif of (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is accordingly predicted to exhibit better UV NLO balance than KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, including larger birefringence, stronger SHG effect, and shorter phase&#8208;matching SHG wavelength.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultraviolet (UV) transparency, second harmonic effect and optical birefringence are three vital but mutually restrictive factors in the application of UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. It is difficult for traditional phosphates to achieve a good balance among these factors. In this communication, we propose that the structural evolution of the NLO motif from traditional phosphate to oxythiophosphate would enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining wide UV transparency, which is confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations and preliminary experimental measurements. Following this strategy, we predict that, compared with the well&#8208;known NLO phosphate KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the oxythiophosphate KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S exhibits better balance for the UV NLO performance, including wide UV transparency (UV cutoff down to 203&#8197;nm), strong SHG effect (ca. 0.9&#8197;pm&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and large birefringence (ca. 0.1 at 1&#8197;&#956;m) with short phase&#8208;matching SHG output wavelength (&#8776;214&#8197;nm).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Twin Pathways: Discerning the Origins of Multiply Twinned Colloidal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Critical concepts for understanding the formation pathways of colloidal multiply twinned nanoparticles are reviewed. As the direct observation of two pathways has recently been achieved, new opportunities exist for acquiring a deeper understanding of twin formation and symmetry breaking. This knowledge will improve the synthetic control of nanoparticle shape and provide important insight into the thermodynamics of nanoscale systems.







Abstract
The structure of multiply twinned particles (MTPs) provides an example of how specific crystallographic features dictate the geometric shape of finite&#8208;sized crystals. The formation of MTPs during colloidal synthesis can occur through at least two different pathways: 1)&#8197;growth from multiply twinned seeds or 2)&#8197;the stepwise formation of new twin boundaries on single&#8208;crystalline seeds (either by particle overgrowth or multiparticle attachment). By utilizing in&#8197;situ transmission electron microscopy, recent studies have provided real&#8208;time evidence for both pathways. Looking forward, the knowledge of specific evolution pathways that occur under a given synthetic condition will aid in the design of robust MTP syntheses. More importantly, further studies pertaining to the structural evolution and energetics of nanoparticles are needed to provide a complete understanding of MTP formation pathways.

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Small&#8208;Molecule DNA Aptamer Isolation, Characterization, and Sensor Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamers, oligonucleotide&#8208;based recognition elements isolated from random libraries, have several favorable attributes for biosensing. This Review examines state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods and advances in the isolation and characterization of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;binding aptamers and their use in various biosensors. Factors limiting aptamer&#8208;based sensors and potential solutions to these issues are also discussed.







Abstract
Aptamers are short oligonucleotides isolated in vitro from randomized libraries that can bind to specific molecules with high affinity, and offer a number of advantages relative to antibodies as biorecognition elements in biosensors. However, it remains difficult and labor&#8208;intensive to develop aptamer&#8208;based sensors for small&#8208;molecule detection. Here, we review the challenges and advances in the isolation and characterization of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;binding DNA aptamers and their use in sensors. First, we discuss in vitro methodologies for the isolation of aptamers, and provide guidance on selecting the appropriate strategy for generating aptamers with optimal binding properties for a given application. We next examine techniques for characterizing aptamer&#8211;target binding and structure. Afterwards, we discuss various small&#8208;molecule sensing platforms based on original or engineered aptamers, and their detection applications. Finally, we conclude with a general workflow to develop aptamer&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule sensors for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Lewis Acid Strength of Interfacial Metal Sites Drives CH3OH Selectivity and Formation Rates on Cu&#8208;based CO2 Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CH  3  OH formation rates in CO  2  &#160;hydrogenation on Cu&#8208;based catalysts sensitively depend on the nature of the support and the presence of promoters. In this context, Cu nanoparticles supported on tailored supports (highly dispersed M on SiO  2  ; M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta) were prepared via Surface Organometallic Chemistry, and their catalytic performance was systematically investigated for CO  2&#160;  hydrogenation to CH  3  OH. The presence of Lewis acid sites enhances CH  3  OH formation rate, likely originating from stabilization of formate and methoxy surface intermediates at the periphery of Cu nanoparticles, as evidenced by metrics of Lewis acid strength and detection of surface intermediates. The stabilization of surface intermediates depends on the strength of Lewis acid M sites, described by pyridine adsorption enthalpies and&#160;  13  C chemical shifts of &#8208;OCH  3  &#160;coordinated to M; these chemical shifts are demonstrated here to be a molecular descriptor for Lewis acid strength and reactivity in CO  2  &#160;hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Smelling Principle of Vetiver Oil, Unveiled by Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the advance of modern analytic techniques, the smelling principle of vetiver oil is still unknown owing to its extremely complex matrix of over 150&#8197;compounds. A concise stereoselective total synthesis proves (+)&#8208;2&#8208;epi&#8208;ziza&#8208;6(13)en&#8208;3&#8208;one to be the key to the quasi&#8208;pheromone&#8208;like aura of vetiver that magically resembles the effect of Iso&#8197;E&#8197;Super.







Abstract
Vetiver oil, produced on a multiton&#8208;scale from the roots of vetiver grass, is one of the finest and most popular perfumery materials, appearing in over a third of all fragrances. It is a complex mixture of hundreds of molecules and the specific odorant, responsible for its characteristic suave and sweet transparent, woody&#8208;ambery smell, has remained a mystery until today. Herein, we prove by an eleven&#8208;step chemical synthesis, employing a novel asymmetric organocatalytic Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael addition, that (+)&#8208;2&#8208;epi&#8208;ziza&#8208;6(13)en&#8208;3&#8208;one is the active smelling principle of vetiver oil. Its olfactory evaluation reveals a remarkable odor threshold of 29&#8197;picograms per liter air, responsible for the special sensuous aura it lends to perfumes and the quasi&#8208;pheromone&#8208;like effect it has on perfumers and consumers alike.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;deposited mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx) is introduced as an inexpensive, robust, easily synthesizable and recyclable material that functions as an integrated dual photocatalytic system. This material overcomes the need of expensive photosensitizers, organic ligands and additives as well as limitations of catalyst deactivation in the existing photo/Ni dual catalytic cross coupling reactions. The dual catalytic Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx is demonstrated for C&#8211;O coupling between aryl halides and aliphatic alcohols under mild condition. The reaction affords the ether product in good to excellent yields (60&#8208;92%) with broad substrate scope, including heteroaryl and aryl halides bearing electron withdrawing, donating and neutral groups. The heterogeneous Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx can be easily recovered from the reaction mixture and reused over multiple cycles without loss of activity. The findings highlight exciting opportunities for dual catalysis promoted by a fully heterogeneous system.</dc:description>

         <title>B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn gas diffusion electrodes for CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products at high current densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO  2  to multi&#8208;carbon products has attracted considerable attention as it provides an avenue to high&#8208;density renewable energy storage. However, the selectivity and stabi&#173;lity under high current densities are rarely reported. Herein, B&#8208;doped Cu (B&#8208;Cu) and B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) were deve&#173;loped for highly selective and stable CO  2  conversion to C  2+  products at industrially relevant current densities. The B&#8208;Cu GDE exhibited a high Faradaic efficiency of 79% for C  2+  products formation at a current density of &#8722;200 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  and a potential of &#8722;0.45 V vs. RHE. The long&#8208;term stability for C  2+  formation was substantially improved by incorpo&#173;rating an optimal amount of Zn. Operando Raman spectra confirm the retained Cu  +  species under CO  2  reduction conditions and the lower overpotential for *OCO formation upon incorporation of Zn, which leads to the excellent conversion of CO  2  to C  2+  products on B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn GDEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Pairing Interactions in a Molecular Switch Evidenced by Ion Mobility Spectrometry and Infrared Ion Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The digital revolution sets a milestone in the progressive miniaturization of working devices and in the underlying advent of molecular machines. Foldamers involving mechanically entangled components with modular secondary structures are among the most promising designs for molecular switch&#8208;based applications. Characterizing the nature and dynamics of their intramolecular network following the application of a stimulus is the key to their performance. Here, we use non&#8208;dissociative electron transfers as a reductive stimulus in the gas phase and probe the consecutive co&#8208;conformational transitions of a donor&#8208;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamer using electrospray mass spectrometry interfaced with ion mobility and infrared ion spectroscopy. The comparison of collision cross section distributions for analogous closed&#8208;shell and radical molecular ions sheds light on their respective formation energetics while variations in their respective infrared absorption bands evidence different intramolecular organizations as the foldamer gets compact. These differences are compatible with the advent of radical&#8208;pairing interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Copper&#8208;Arylacetylide Polymerization and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of new polymerization reactions is very intriguing in fundamental and practical research, which will advance reaction theories and produce various functional materials. Herein, we report a new polymerization method based on the reaction of Cu(I) and arylacetylide, which generates linear polymers with high molecular weight and low polydispersity index of molecular weight. The Cu&#8208;arylacetylide polymerization exhibits different characteristics with traditional polymerizations such as mild reaction temperature; air atmosphere reaction; high molecular weight; fast polymerization rate; imprecise molar ratio between monomers. The bond formation path and activation energy of each step was investigated by density functional theory calculations to understand the reaction mechanism. The poly(Cu&#8208;arylacetylide)s exhibit strong fluorescence emission and inherent semiconductive properties, which have been used to fabricate an electronic device for streptavidin sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Cobalt Catalyst&#160;for Nitrile/Alkyne [2+2+2] Cycloaddition: Synthesis of Polyarylpyridines and Their Mechanochemical Cyclodehydrogenation to Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Polyaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of nitriles and alkynes has been extensively developed as a straightforward and atom&#8208;economical synthetic approach to pyridines over the last several decades using various transition metal catalysts, both precious and non&#8208;precious. Despite this long history, cycloadditions of this type have often relied on the use of tethered diyne or cyanoalkyne as one of the reactants. Thus, examples of efficient, fully intermolecular catalytic [2+2+2] pyridine synthesis, especially those employing unactivated nitriles and internal alkynes leading to pentasubstituted pyridines, remain scarce. Herein, we report on simple and inexpensive catalytic systems based on cobalt(II) iodide, 1,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, and Zn that promote [2+2+2] cycloaddition of various nitriles and diarylacetylenes without using a large excess of the nitrile. The present systems allow for the synthesis of broad range of polyarylated pyridines, many of which have not been previously accessed by the [2+2+2] manifold. Computational studies have supported a reaction pathway involving oxidative coupling of two alkynes, insertion of the nitrile into cobaltacyclopentadiene, and C&#8211;N reductive elimination. We also demonstrate that tetra&#8208; and pentaarylpyridines can serve as precursors to hitherto unprecedented nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via mechanochemically assisted multifold reductive cyclodehydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Porous Pd Metallene for Enhanced Alkaline Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallene with fantastic physicochemical properties is considered as a potential candidate for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Controlling the morphology and structure of metallene can provide a great opportunity to improve its catalytic performance. Herein, defect&#8208;rich ultrathin porous Pd metallene (a sub&#8208;nanometer and curved metal nanosheet) is developed by facile wet&#8208;chemistry strategy for efficient and stable ORR electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte. The defect&#8208;rich porous Pd metallene provides abundant highly active sites and vacancy defects, showing superior ORR activity of 0.892 A mgPd&#8208;1 at 0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The mass activity is 5.1 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C, respectively, and maintains well after 5000 cycles. The strain effect and tunable electronic structure derived from highly curved sub&#8208;nanometer nanosheet morphology contribute to the excellent ORR performance by the optimization of oxygen binding ability on Pd. The superior catalytic performance of Pd metallene may open an avenue to design other metallene materials for various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Haliclonin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of haliclonin A was accomplished. Starting from 3,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzoic acid, a functionalized cyclohexanone fused to a 17&#8208;membered ring was prepared through a Birch reduction/alkylation sequence, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, intramolecular cyclopropanation, and stereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition of an organocopper reagent to an enone moiety. Reductive C&#8208;N bond formation via an  N  ,  O  &#8208;acetal forged the 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core. The allyl alcohol moiety was constructed by a sequence involving stereoselective &#945;&#8208;selenylation of an aldehyde via an enamine,  syn  &#8208;elimination of a selenoxide, and allylation of the aldehyde with an allylboronate. Formation of the 15&#8208;membered ring containing a skipped diene was achieved by ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and final transformations led to the synthesis of haliclonin A.</dc:description>

Starting from 3,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzoic acid, a functionalized cyclohexanone fused to a 17&#8208;membered ring was prepared through a Birch reduction/alkylation sequence, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, intramolecular cyclopropanation, and stereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition of an organocopper reagent to an enone moiety. Reductive C&#8208;N bond formation via an  N  ,  O  &#8208;acetal forged the 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core. The allyl alcohol moiety was constructed by a sequence involving stereoselective &#945;&#8208;selenylation of an aldehyde via an enamine,  syn  &#8208;elimination of a selenoxide, and allylation of the aldehyde with an allylboronate. Formation of the 15&#8208;membered ring containing a skipped diene was achieved by ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and final transformations led to the synthesis of haliclonin A.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Stereoselective Stetter Reaction Catalyzed by Benzaldehyde Lyase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reliable design and prediction of enzyme promiscuity to access transformations not observed in nature remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we present the first example of intramolecular stereoselective Stetter reaction catalyzed by benzaldehyde lyase guided by the rational structure screening of various ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. After optimization, high productivity (up to 99%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99:1 e.r.) for this novel enzyme function was achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Photoelectrocatalytic Activities for CH3OH to HCHO Conversion on Fe2O3/MoO3: Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo Covalency Dominates the Intrinsic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constrained by low selectivity and low activity, catalytic alcohols conversion under mild conditions is a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate a hollow nanotube Fe2O3/MoO3 heterojunction (FeMo&#8208;2) for photoelectrocatalytic small&#8208;molecule alcohols conversion. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the optical carrier transfer rate is enhanced by constructing interfacial internal electric fields and Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo charge transfer channels. For the formox process, heterojunctions possess superior HCHO selective reaction paths and free energy transitions, optimizing the selectivity of HCHO and enhancing the reactivity. The FeMo&#8208;2 exhibits greatly improved performance than single Fe2O3, the photocurrent density of FeMo&#8208;2 reaches 0.66 mA cm&#8208;2, which is 3.88 times of Fe2O3 (0.17 mA cm&#8208;2), the Faraday efficiency of CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO is 95.7%. This work may deepen the understanding of interfacial charge separation and has potential application to the production of HCHO and conversion reactions of other small molecule alcohols at cryogenic temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of polynitrogen anions in tantalum&#8208;nitrogen compounds at high pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of polynitrogen compounds is of great importance due to their potential as high energy density materials (HEDM), but because of the intrinsic instability of these compounds, their synthesis and stabilization is a fundamental challenge. Polymeric nitrogen units which may be stabilized in compounds with metals at high pressure are now restricted to non&#8208;branched chains with an average N&#8208;N bond order of 1.25, limiting their HEDM performances. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a novel polynitrogen compound TaN  5  via a direct reaction between tantalum and nitrogen in a diamond anvil cell at ~100 GPa. TaN  5  is the first example of a material containing branched all&#8208;single&#8208;bonded nitrogen chains [N  5  5&#8208;  ]  &#8734;  . Apart from that we discover two novel Ta&#8208;N compounds: TaN  4  with finite N  4  4&#8208;  chains and incommensurately modulated compound TaN  2&#8208;x  , which is recoverable at ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A hybrid electronic and ionic conductor was proposed to build a solid&#8208;state air electrode that transforms the solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 battery electrochemical mechanism from a three&#8208;phase to a two&#8208;phase process and further enhances the battery performance. The electrochemical effect of the hybrid conductor was shown by an in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy process.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 batteries possess the ability to deliver high energy density with enhanced safety. However, designing a highly functional solid&#8208;state air electrode is the main bottleneck for its further development. Herein, we adopt a hybrid electronic and ionic conductor to build solid&#8208;state air electrode that makes the transition of Li&#8208;O2 battery electrochemical mechanism from a three&#8208;phase process to a two&#8208;phase process. The solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 battery with this hybrid conductor solid&#8208;state air electrode shows decreased interfacial resistance and enhanced reaction kinetics. The Coulombic efficiency of Li&#8208;O2 battery is also significantly improved, benefiting from the good contact between discharge products and electrode materials. In&#8197;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy under oxygen was used to illustrate the reversible deposition and decomposition of discharge products on the surface of this hybrid conductor, visually verifying the two&#8208;phase reaction.

Electrochemical rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] cycloadditions to assemble seven&#8208;membered benzoxepines have been accomplished guided by detailed mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Electrooxidative annulations involving mild transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation have emerged as a transformative strategy for the rapid construction of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. In contrast, we herein describe the first electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] cycloadditions to assemble valuable seven&#8208;membered benzoxepine skeletons by C&#8722;H/O&#8722;H activation. The efficient alkyne annulation featured ample substrate scope, using electricity as the only oxidant. Mechanistic studies provided strong support for a rhodium(III/I) regime, involving a benzoxepine&#8208;coordinated rhodium(I) sandwich complex as the catalyst resting state, which was re&#8208;oxidized to rhodium(III) by anodic oxidation.

         <title>A Broad&#8208;Spectrum Catalytic Amidation of Sulfonyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) was identified as an efficient nucleophilic catalyst to activate sulfonyl fluorides and fluorosulfates for a broad&#8208;spectrum, catalytic amidation to prepare various sulfonamides and sulfamates, including sterically hindered ones. The potential of this methodology in medicinal and process chemistry has been demonstrated by multidecagram&#8208;scale synthesis of an amantadine derivative and synthesis of the drug Fedratinib.







Abstract
A broad&#8208;spectrum, catalytic method has been developed for the synthesis of sulfonamides and sulfamates. With the activation by the combination of a catalytic amount of 1&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and silicon additives, amidations of sulfonyl fluorides and fluorosulfates proceeded smoothly and excellent yields were generally obtained (87&#8211;99&#8201;%). Noticeably, this protocol is particularly efficient for sterically hindered substrates. Catalyst loading is generally low and only 0.02&#8197;mol&#8201;% of catalyst is required for the multidecagram&#8208;scale synthesis of an amantadine derivative. In addition, the potential of this method in medicinal chemistry has been demonstrated by the synthesis of the marketed drug Fedratinib via a key intermediate sulfonyl fluoride 13. Since a large number of amines are commercially available, this route provides a facile entry to access Fedratinib analogues for biological screening.

         <title>NiSn Atomic Pair on an Integrated Electrode for Synergistic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiSn atomic&#8208;pair electrocatalyst (NiSn&#8208;APC) that consists of adjacent Ni and Sn, each coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N4&#8208;Ni&#8208;Sn&#8208;N4), has been synthesized. By virtue of the synergistic effect and the enhanced utilization degree of the active site, NiSn&#8208;APC exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains a challenge. Demonstrated here is a NiSn atomic&#8208;pair electrocatalyst (NiSn&#8208;APC) on a hierarchical integrated electrode, which exhibits a synergistic effect in simultaneously promoting the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR to formate. The NiSn atomic pair consists of adjacent Ni and Sn, each coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N4&#8208;Ni&#8208;Sn&#8208;N4). The as&#8208;prepared NiSn&#8208;APC displays exceptional activity for the CO2RR to formate with a turnover frequency of 4752&#8197;h&#8722;1, a formate productivity of 36.7&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gSn&#8722;1 and an utilization degree of active sites (57.9&#8201;%), which are superior to previously reported single&#8208;atomic catalysts. Both experimental data and density&#8208;functional theory calculations verify the electron redistribution of Sn imposed by adjacent Ni, which reduces the energy barrier of the *OCHO intermediate and makes this potential&#8208;determining step thermodynamically spontaneous. This synergistic catalysis provides a successful paradigm for rational design and preparation of atomic&#8208;pair electrocatalysts with enhanced performance.

         <title>Hydrogen Purification through a Highly Stable Dual&#8208;Phase Oxygen&#8208;Permeable Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantages of the high chemical stability and moderate reduction of Ti and Ce ions under reducing atmosphere, a novel Ti&#8208;based dual&#8208;phase oxygen&#8208;permeable membrane was developed for H2 purification. The Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8722;&#948;/Pr0.1Sr0.9Mg0.1Ti0.9O3&#8722;&#948; (CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti) membrane has excellent chemical stability and mixed oxygen ionic&#8208;electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres.







Abstract
Using oxygen permeable membranes (OPMs) to upgrade low&#8208;purity hydrogen is a promising concept for high&#8208;purity H2 production. At high temperatures, water dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen permeates through OPM and oxidizes hydrogen in a waste stream on the other side of the membrane. Pure hydrogen can be obtained on the water&#8208;splitting side after condensation. However, the existing Co&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based OPMs are chemically instable as a result of the over&#8208;reduction of Co and Fe ions under reducing atmospheres. Herein, a dual&#8208;phase membrane Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8722;&#948;&#8208;Pr0.1Sr0.9Mg0.1Ti0.9O3&#8722;&#948; (CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti) with excellent chemical stability and mixed oxygen ionic&#8208;electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres was developed for H2 purification. An acceptable H2 production rate of 0.52&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at 940&#8201;&#176;C. No obvious degradation during 180&#8197;h of operation indicates the robust stability of CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti membrane. The proven mixed conductivity and excellent stability of CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti give prospective advantages over existing OPMs for upgrading low&#8208;purity hydrogen.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Porous Molybdenum Phosphide/Nitride Heterojunction Nanosheets for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D porous MoP/Mo2N Heterojunction nanosheets have been created based on a PEG&#8208;mediated assembly strategy, which exhibit outstanding performance for HER over wide pH ranges even out&#8208;performing the Pt/C benchmark at large current density. A series of tests and DFT calculations shows the synergy of the heterojunctions, pores and 2D nanosheets for promoting the HER performance.







Abstract
Herein, we present a new strategy for the synthesis of 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets based on the pyrolysis of 2D [PMo12O40]3&#8722;&#8208;melamine (PMo12&#8208;MA) nanosheet precursor from a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;mediated assembly route. The heterostructure nanosheets are ca. 20&#8197;nm thick and have plentiful pores (&lt;5&#8197;nm). These structure features offer advantages to promote the HER activity, including the favorable water dissociation kinetics around heterojunction as confirmed by theoretical calculations, large accessible surface of 2D nanosheets, and enhanced mass&#8208;transport ability by pores. Consequently, the 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets exhibit excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 89, 91 and 89&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes, respectively. The HER performance is superior to the commercial Pt/C at a current density &gt;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in neutral medium and &gt;190&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline medium.

The HER performance is superior to the commercial Pt/C at a current density &amp;gt;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in neutral medium and &amp;gt;190&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in alkaline medium.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Radical&#8208;Promoted Distal C&#8722;H Functionalization of C(sp3) Centers with Fluorinated Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organofluorine chemistry in the focus: Novel transformations based on a radical process were designed recently, offering new synthetic tools for the selective functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with a fluorinated group at a remote position to a functional group. This Minireview highlights these recent advances based on a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer or a &#946;&#8208;fragmentation process.







Abstract
Due to their unique properties, fluorinated scaffolds are pivotal compounds in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science. Over the last years, the development of versatile strategies for the selective synthesis of fluorinated molecules by direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization has attracted a lot of attention. In particular, the design of novel transformations based on a radical process was a bottleneck for distal C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, offering synthetic solutions for the selective introduction of fluorinated groups. This Minireview highlights the major contributions in this blossoming field. The development of new methodologies for the remote functionalization of aliphatic derivatives with various fluorinated groups based on a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process and a &#946;&#8208;fragmentation reaction will be showcased and discussed.

         <title>Coplanar Pt/C Nanomeshes with Ultrastable Oxygen Reduction Performance in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes with high surface distortion has been developed. This electrocatalyst showed superior activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction in a fuel cell.







Abstract
Developing highly stable and efficient catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction is important for the long&#8208;term operation in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Reported herein is a facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes (NMs) that are composed of highly distorted Pt networks (neck width of 2.05&#177;0.72&#8197;nm) and carbon. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy demonstrated the metallic state of Pt in the coplanar Pt/C NMs. Fuel cell tests verified the excellent activity of the coplanar Pt/C NM catalyst with the peak power density of 1.21&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and current density of 0.360&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.80&#8197;V in the H2/O2 cell. Moreover, the coplanar Pt/C NM electrocatalysts showed superior stability against aggregation, with NM structures preserved intact for a long&#8208;term operation of over 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles for electrode measurement, and the working voltage loss was negligible after 120&#8197;h in the H2/O2 single cell operation. Density&#8208;functional theory analysis indicates the increased vacancy formation energy of Pt atoms for coplanar Pt/C NMs, restraining the tendency of Pt dissolution and aggregation.

         <title>Gradient Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Lithium&#8208;Ion Solvation Regulated by Bisfluoroacetamide for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient SEI structure with C&#8722;F rich surface for strong Li+ adsorption and LiF rich bottom for fast Li+ diffusion is designed by applying bisfluoroacetamide as electrolyte additive, which also helps to form a stable CEI on cathode, endowing stable lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
The structures and components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are extremely important to influence the performance of full cells, which is determined by the formulation of electrolyte used. However, it is still challenging to control the formation of high&#8208;quality SEI from structures to components. Herein, we designed bisfluoroacetamide (BFA) as the electrolyte additive for the construction of a gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure that consists of a lithophilic surface with C&#8722;F bonds to uniformly capture Li ions and a LiF&#8208;rich bottom layer to guide the rapid transportation of Li ions, endowing the homogeneous deposition of Li ions. Moreover, the BFA molecule changes the Li+ solvation structure by reducing free solvents in electrolyte to improve the antioxidant properties of electrolyte and prevent the extensive degradation of electrolyte on the cathode surface, which can make a superior cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) with high&#8208;content LiF.

         <title>Locally Ordered Graphitized Carbon Cathodes for High&#8208;Capacity Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC), interconnected with disordered carbon, is able to weaken the van der Waals interactions between adjacent graphene sheets and thus reduce the anion&#8208;intercalating voltage. Conversely, disordered carbon not only interconnects the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffer severe anion&#8211;anion repulsions and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) inherently suffer from limited energy density. Proposed here is a strategy to effectively tackle this issue by employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion&#8211;anion repulsions and severe expansion at the deep&#8208;charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible. The LOGC interconnected with disordered carbon is predicted to weaken the interlaminar van der Waals interactions, while disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffer severe anion&#8211;anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, ketjen black (KB) with LOGC was used as a model cathode for a potassium&#8208;based DIB (KDIB). The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, a good rate capability of 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, and excellent cycling stability of 1000&#8197;cycles without obvious capacity fading.

         <title>Selectively upgrading lignin derivatives into carboxylates through electrochemical oxidative C(OH)&#8208;C bonds cleavage by a Mn&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8208;C bonds to afford carboxylates is of significant importance for petrochemical industry and biomass valorization. Here we report an efficient electrochemical strategy for selective upgrading of lignin derivatives into carboxylates by a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide (MnCoOOH) catalyst. A wide range of lignin&#8208;derived substrates with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C units undergo efficient cleavage to corresponding carboxylates in excellent yields (80&#8208;99%) and operational stability (200 h). Detailed investigations reveal a tandem oxidation mechanism that base from electrolyte promotes the transformation of secondary alcohols and their derived ketones to reactive nucleophiles, which are oxidized by electrophilic oxygen species on MnCoOOH from water. As proof of concept, this approach demonstrated its applications for downstream upgrading lignin derivatives with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, achieving convergent transformation of lignin&#8208;derived mixtures to benzoate and KA oil to adipate with 91.5% and 64.2% yields, respectively. This work provides a sustainable alternative to conventional processes for C(OH)&#8208;C cleavage and an effective strategy to promote H  2  evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding the Complex Free Radical Cascade by a DNA Framework&#8208;Based Artificial DNA Encoder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;based molecular communications (DMC) are critical for regulating biological networks to maintain stable organismic functions. However, the complicated, time&#8208;consuming information transmission process involved in genome&#8208;coded DMC and the limited, vulnerable decoding activity generally lead to communication impairment or failure, in response to external stimuli. Herein, we present a conceptually innovative DMC strategy mediated by the DNA framework&#8208;based artificial DNA encoder. With the free&#8208;radical cascade as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, the artificial DNA encoder shows active sensing and real&#8208;time actuation, in situ and broad free radical&#8208;decoding efficacy, as well as robust resistance to environmental noises. It can also block undesirable short to medium&#8208;range communications between free radicals and inflammatory networks, leading to a synergistic antiobesity effect. The artificial DNA encoder&#8208;based DMC may be generalized to other communication systems for a variety of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Nitrones by Chemoselective Intramolecular Allylic Alkylation of Oximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantio&#8208; and chemoselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed  N  &#8208;allylation of oximes is described for the first time. Intramolecular kinetic resolution provides access to cyclic nitrones and enantioenriched aliphatic allylic alcohols. Salient features of this transformation are its ability to employ  E  /  Z  &#8208;isomeric mixtures of oxime starting materials convergently and high functional group tolerance. The implementation of  N  &#8208;allylation/1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction sequences furnish tricyclic isoxazolidines in highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective fashion. The synthetic utility of the approach is demonstrated by the efficient, formal synthesis of the marine natural product (+)&#8208;halichlorine.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical characterization of single layer graphene / electrolyte interface: effect of solvent on the interfacial capacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of the basic understanding of the charge storage mechanisms in electrodes for energy storage applications needs deep characterization of the electrode / electrolyte interface. In this work, we studied the charge of the double layer capacitance at single layer graphene (SLG) electrode used as a model material, in neat (EMIm&#8208;TFSI) and solvated (with acetonitrile) ionic liquid electrodes. The combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gravimetric electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements evidence that the presence of solvent drastically increases the charge carrier density at the SLG / ionic liquid interface. The capacitance is thus governed not only by the electronic properties of the graphene, but also by the specific organization of the electrolyte side at the SLG surface originating from the strong interactions existing between the EMIm  +  cations and SLG surface. EQCM measurements also show that the carbon structure, with the presence of sp&#178; carbons, affects the charge storage mechanism by favoring counter&#8208;ion adsorption on SLG electrode versus ion exchange mechanism in amorphous porous carbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent, Strain&#8208;Release Reactions of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Carbinols: Semipinacol or Spiroepoxy Azetidine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The azetidine moiety is a privileged motif in medicinal chemistry and new methods that access them efficiently are highly sought after. Towards this goal, we have found that azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl carbinols, readily obtained from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB), can undergo divergent strain&#8208;release reactions upon N&#8208;activation. Treatment with trifluoroacetic anhydride or triflic anhydride triggered a semipinacol rearrangement to give keto 1,3,3&#8208;substituted azetidines. More than 20 examples were explored, enabling us to evaluate selectivity and the migratory aptitude of different groups. Alternatively, treatment of the same alcohols with benzyl chloroformate in the presence of NaI led to iodohydrin intermediates which gave spiroepoxy azetidines upon treatment with base. The electronic nature of the activating agent dictates which pathway operates.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Arylation of Enantiotopic Secondary C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral IBiox ligands show an exceptional reactivity and a high enantioselectivity in the Pd0&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective arylation of enantiotopic secondary C&#8722;H bonds. This reaction leads to a variety of scalemic indane products, containing a tertiary stereocenter, from easily accessible precursors.







Abstract
The enantioselective functionalization of nonactivated enantiotopic secondary C&#8722;H bonds is one of the greatest challenges in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation proceeding by an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism. Such reactions have remained elusive within the realm of Pd0 catalysis. Reported here is the unique reactivity profile of the IBiox ligand family in the Pd0&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular arylation of such nonactivated secondary C&#8722;H bonds. Chiral C2&#8208;symmetric IBiox ligands led to high enantioselectivities for a broad range of valuable indane products containing a tertiary stereocenter, as well as the arylation of secondary C&#8722;H bonds adjacent to amides. Depending on the amide substituents and upon control of reaction time, indanes containing labile tertiary stereocenters were also obtained with high enantioselectivities. Analysis of the steric maps of the IBiox ligands indicated that the level of enantioselectivity correlates with the difference between the two most occupied and the two less occupied space quadrants, and provided a blueprint for the design of even more efficient ligands.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Shell Singlet SnI&#8197;Diradical and H2&#8197;Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative 4 with two&#8208;coordinated SnI atoms has been isolated as a green crystalline solid. The ground state of 4 is an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) with the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EOS&#8211;T) of 4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (according to CASSCF, &#916;ES&#8211;T=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Consequently, 4 exhibits a half&#8208;field EPR signal at 100&#8197;K and undergoes H2 splitting at room temperature to quantitatively yield the SnII hydride 5 as an orange solid.







Abstract
The first SnI diradical [(ADCPh)Sn]2 (4) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADCPh={CN(Dipp)}2CPh; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) scaffold has been isolated as a green crystalline solid by KC8 reduction of the corresponding bis&#8208;chlorostannylene [(ADCPh)SnCl]2 (3). The six&#8208;membered C4Sn2&#8208;ring of 4 containing six &#960;&#8208;electrons shows a diatropic ring current, thus 4 may also be regarded as the first 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative. DFT calculations suggest an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) ground state of 4 with a remarkably small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EOS&#8211;T=4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), which is consistent with CASSCF (&#916;ES&#8211;T=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and diradical character y=37&#8201;%) calculations. The diradical 4 splits H2 at room temperature to yield the bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADCPh)SnH]2 (5). Further reactivity of 4 has been studied with PhSeSePh and MeOTf.

         <title>Growth of Colloidal Nanocrystals by Liquid&#8208;Like Coalescence**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles grow by liquid&#8208;like coalescence rather than Ostwald ripening in the absence of supersaturation. The effective activation energy of the coalescence process is associated with two factors: one is proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles and the other is related to the reconstruction. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles.







Abstract
We here describe, model, and predict the growth kinetics of amine&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles in the absence of supersaturation. The particles grow by coalescence rather than by Ostwald ripening. A comparison of different models indicates that the effective activation energy of coalescence (67.65&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is associated with two terms: a term proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles, and a constant term. Our Brownian dynamics simulations show (i) how the remarkably low activation energy (or large rate constants) are most likely due to the large difference in size between the particles and their mean free path of diffusion, and (ii) how the low polydispersity is the likely result of the suppression of collision rates between rare populations due to crowding. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles, therefore enabling the precise control of the average particle size without the need of supersaturation.

         <title>Piptides: New, Easily Accessible Chemotypes For Interactions With Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piptides, a new form of chemotype, are accessible from natural amino acids in either configuration, hence can conveniently display all the side chain pharmacophores found in peptides and proteins. They can be made in solution or on supports and are proteolytically&#8208;/pH&#8208;robust. Piptide&#8208;based disruption of EGF&#8901;EGFR was chosen as an initial challenge and Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) was used to evaluate candidates.







Abstract
Small molecule probe development is pivotal in biomolecular science. Research described here was undertaken to develop a non&#8208;peptidic chemotype, piptides, that is amenable to convenient, iterative solid&#8208;phase syntheses, and useful in biomolecular probe discovery. Piptides can be made from readily accessible pip acid building blocks and have good proteolytic and pH stabilities. An illustrative application of piptides against a protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target was explored. The Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) strategy was used to evaluate piptide candidates for this. A library of only 14 piptides contained five members that disrupted epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor, EGFR, at low micromolar concentrations. These piptides also caused apoptotic cell death, and antagonized EGF&#8208;induced phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues in EGFR.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concentration&#8208;dependent number and brightness (cdN&amp;B), a fluorescence fluctuation technique that can be implemented on a standard confocal microscope and report on the thermodynamics of membrane protein association in the native plasma membrane. cdN&amp;B uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant.







Abstract
We introduce concentration&#8208;dependent number and brightness (cdN&amp;B), a fluorescence fluctuation technique that can be implemented on a standard confocal microscope and can report on the thermodynamics of membrane protein association in the native plasma membrane. It uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant. We discuss artifacts in cdN&amp;B that are concentration&#8208;dependent and can distort the oligomerization curves, and we outline procedures that can correct for them. Using cdN&amp;B, we characterize the association of neuropilin&#8197;1 (NRP1), a protein that plays a critical role in the development of the embryonic cardiovascular and nervous systems. We show that NRP1 associates into a tetramer in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, and we quantify the strength of the association. This work demonstrates the utility of cdN&amp;B as a powerful tool in biophysical chemistry.

         <title>Stabilization of Undercooled Metals via Passivating Oxide Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential effect of the static surface tensor for metal alloy surfaces is found to be significantly larger than size&#8208;related effects as demonstrated by oxide shell and stabilizing ligand composition. Considering these finds, the free&#8208;energy equation related to solid&#8211;liquid phase transformation, under the classical nucleation theory, is extended to incorporate the stress&#8208;component resulting from the passivating shell.







Abstract
Undercooling metals relies on frustration of liquid&#8211;solid transition mainly by an increase in activation energy. Passivating oxide layers are a way to isolate the core from heterogenous nucleants (physical barrier) while also raising the activation energy (thermodynamic/kinetic barrier) needed for solidification. The latter is due to composition gradients (speciation) that establishes a sharp chemical potential gradient across the thin (0.7&#8211;5&#8197;nm) oxide shell, slowing homogeneous nucleation. When this speciation is properly tuned, the oxide layer presents a previously unaccounted for interfacial tension in the overall energy landscape of the relaxing material. We demonstrate that 1)&#8197;the integrity of the passivation oxide is critical in stabilizing undercooled particle, a key tenet in developing heat&#8208;free solders, 2)&#8197;inductive effects play a critical role in undercooling, and 3)&#8197;the magnitude of the influence of the passivating oxide can be larger than size effects in undercooling.

         <title>Cationic Boron Formazanate Dyes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic properties of boron formazanate dyes are usually tuned by varying the substituents of the formazan moiety. We show that the wavelength and type of the lowest&#8208;energy electronic excitation of these compounds can also be modulated through variation of the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom.







Abstract
Incorporation of cationic boron atoms into molecular frameworks is an established strategy for creating chemical species with unusual bonding and reactivity but is rarely thought of as a way of enhancing molecular optoelectronic properties. Using boron formazanate dyes as examples, we demonstrate that the wavelengths, intensities, and type of the first electronic transitions in BN heterocycles can be modulated by varying the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy measurements and density&#8208;functional (DFT) calculations show that these modulations are caused by changes in the geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the boron formazanate ring. These findings suggest a new strategy for designing optoelectronic materials based on &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocycles containing boron and other main&#8208;group elements.

         <title>Enantioselective, Stereoconvergent Resolution Copolymerization of Racemic cis&#8208;Internal Epoxides and Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoconvergence is observed in the enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis&#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, where the selectivity factor for chiral copolymer formation significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted substrate at various conversions.







Abstract
Unprecedented enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis&#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides was mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, affording optically active polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers, and the unreacted substrates in good enantioselectivity. Unexpected stereoconvergence is observed in this resolution copolymerization, where the selectivity factor for the enantioselective formation of copolymer significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted epoxide at various conversions. Catalytic activity and copolymer enantioselectivity are strongly influenced by the phenolate ortho&#8208;substituents of the ligand set, as well as the axial linker and its chirality. An enantiopure binaphthol&#8208;linked bimetallic AlIII complex allows stereoconvergent access to the stereoregular semi&#8208;crystalline polyesters and a concomitant kinetic resolution of the epoxide substrates.

         <title>Advancing the Logic of Chemical Synthesis: C&#8722;H Activation as Strategic and Tactical Disconnections for C&#8722;C Bond Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of new synthetic methods has historically motivated the evolution of retrosynthetic logic. A significant recent advance is C&#8722;C bond formation enabled by C&#8722;H activation, but it has only seen modest application in synthesis. This Review compares traditional synthetic routes towards complex targets with reconceptualized ones utilizing C&#8722;H activation, highlighting the strategic advantages of this powerful approach.







Abstract
The design of synthetic routes by retrosynthetic logic is decisively influenced by the transformations available. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a powerful strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation, with myriad methods developed for diverse substrates and coupling partners. However, its uptake in total synthesis has been tepid, partially due to their apparent synthetic intractability, as well as a lack of comprehensive guidelines for implementation. This Review addresses these issues and offers a guide to identify retrosynthetic opportunities to generate C&#8722;C bonds by C&#8722;H activation processes. By comparing total syntheses accomplished using traditional approaches and recent C&#8722;H activation methods, this Review demonstrates how C&#8722;H activation enabled C&#8722;C bond construction has led to more efficient retrosynthetic strategies, as well as the execution of previously unattainable tactical maneuvers. Finally, shortcomings of existing processes are highlighted; this Review illustrates how some highlighted total syntheses can be further economized by adopting next&#8208;generation ligand&#8208;enabled approaches.
