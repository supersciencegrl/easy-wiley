         <title>Reducing the Ir&#8211;O Coordination Number in Anodic Catalysts based on IrOx&#160;Nanoparticles towards Enhanced Proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the robust oxidation conditions in strong acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER), developing an OER electrocatalyst with high efficiency remains challenging in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer. Recent theoretical research suggested that reducing the coordination number of Ir&#8208;O is feasible to reduce the energy barrier of the&#160;rate&#8208;determination step, potentially accelerating the OER. Inspired by this, we experimentally verified the Ir&#8208;O coordination number&#8217;s role at model catalysts, then synthesized low&#8208;coordinated IrOx&#160;nanoparticles toward a durable PEM water electrolyzer. We first conducted model studies on commercial rutile&#8208;IrO2&#160;using plasma&#8208;based defect engineering. The combined in&#8208;situ EXAFS analysis and computational studies clarify why the decreased coordination numbers increase catalytic activity. Next, under the model studies&#8217; guidelines, we explored a low&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;based catalyst with a lower overpotential of 231 mV@10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;accompanied by long durability (100 h) in an acidic OER. Finally, the assembled PEMWE cell delivers a low voltage (1.72 V) at a current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2&#160;as well as excellent stability exceeding 1200 h (@1 A cm&#8208;2) without obvious decay. This work provides a unique insight into the role of coordination numbers, paving the way for designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts for PEM water electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Electrolyte Cations Dependent Kinetics on CoOOH&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrolyte cations&#8208;dependent kinetics have been widely observed in many fields of electrocatalysis, however, the exact mechanism of the influence on catalytic performance is still a controversial topic of considerable discussion. Herein, combined with operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), we verify that the electrolyte cations could intercalate into the layer of pristine CoOOH catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, while the bigger cations lead to enlarged interlayer spacing and increased OER activity, following the order Cs+ &gt; K+ &gt; Na+ &gt; Li+. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ Raman, in situ Ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8208;vis) spectroscopy, in situ XAS spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and theoretical calculations reveal that the intercalation of electrolyte cations efficiently modify the oxidation states of Co by enlarging the Co&#8211;O bonds, which in turn enhance the d&#8208;band center of Co, optimize the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates, facilitate the formation of OER active Co(IV) species, and reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determing step (RDS), thereby enhancing the OER activity. This work not only provides an informative picture to understand the complicated dependence of OER kinetics on electrolyte cations, but also sheds light on understanding the mechanism of other electrolyte cation&#8208;targeted electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalently Stapled H+/Cl&#8208; Ion Channels Activatable by Visible Light for Targeted Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive artificial H+/Cl&#8208; ion channels, capable of specifically disturbing the intracellular ion homeostasis of cancer cells, presents an intriguing opportunity for achieving high selectivity in cancer therapy. Herein, we describe a novel family of non&#8208;covalently stapled self&#8208;assembled artificial channels activatable by biocompatible visible light at 442 nm, which enables the co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8208; across the membrane with H+/Cl&#8208; transport selectivity of 6.0. Upon photoirradiation of the caged C4F&#8208;L for 10 min, 90% of ion transport efficiency can be restored, giving rise to a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells (IC50 = 8.5 &#956;M). The mechanism underlying cancer cell death mediated by the H+/Cl&#8208; channels involves the activation of the caspase 9 apoptosis pathway as well as the scarcely reported disruption of the autophagic processes. In the absence of photoirradiation, C4F&#8208;L exhibits minimal toxicity towards normal intestine cells, even at a concentration of 200 &#956;M.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Topochemical Synthesis of a Collagen&#8208;inspired Covalent Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is much demand for crystalline covalent helical polymers. Inspired by the helical structure of collagen, we synthesized a covalent helical polymer wherein the repeating Gly&#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly units are connected by triazole linkages. We synthesized an azide and alkyne&#8208;modified dipeptide monomer made up of the repeating amino acid sequence of collagen. In its crystals, the monomer molecules aligned in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion with proximally placed azide and alkyne forming supramolecular helices. At 60 &#176;C, the monomer underwent single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a covalent helical polymer as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Compared to the monomer crystals, the polymer single&#8208;crystals were very strong and showed three&#8208;fold increase in Young&#8217;s modulus, which is higher than collagen, many synthetic polymers and other materials. The crystals of this covalent helical polymer could bear loads as high as 1.5 million times of their own weight without deformation. These crystals could also withstand high compression force and did not disintegrate even at an applied force of 98 kN. Such light&#8208;weight strong materials are in demand for various technological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Six&#8208;electron&#8208;redox iodine electrodes for high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodine (I2) shows great promising as the active material in aqueous batteries due to its distinctive merits of high abundance in ocean and low cost. However, in conventional aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries, the energy storage mechanism of I&#8208;/I2 conversion is only two&#8208;electron redox reaction, limiting their energy density. Herein, six&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I2 electrodes is achieved via the synergistic effect of redox&#8208;ion charge&#8208;carriers and halide ions in electrolytes. The redox&#8208;active Cu2+ ions in electrolytes induce the conversion between Cu2+ ions and I2 to CuI at low potential. Simultaneously, the Cl&#8208; ions in electrolytes activate the I2/ICl redox couple at high potential. As a result, in our case, I2&#8208;based battery system with six&#8208;electron redox is developed. Such energy storage mechanism with six&#8208;electron redox leads to high discharge potential and capacity, excellent rate capability, as well as stable cycling behavior of I2 electrodes. Impressively, six&#8208;electron&#8208;redox I2 cathodes can match various aqueous metal (e.g. Zn, Mn and Fe) anodes to construct metal||I2 hybrid batteries. These hybrid batteries not only deliver enhanced capacities, but also exhibit higher operate voltages, which contributes to superior energy densities. Therefore, this work broadens the horizon for the design of high&#8208;energy aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of a Metal&#8208;Organic Polymer for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion and Zinc Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal molecular engineering strategy is developed to enhance electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene to modulate the electronic state of metal centers. The resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone shows a much higher ammonia FE of 97.7&#8201;% than copper 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene (85.1&#8201;%).

Metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based materials are promising single&#8208;site catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) on account of well&#8208;defined structures and functional tunability but still lack a molecular&#8208;level understanding for designing the high&#8208;efficient catalysts. Here, we proposed a molecular engineering strategy to enhance electrochemical NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene (BTA) based metal&#8208;organic polymer to precisely modulate the electronic state of metal centers. Due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the carbonyl group, metal centers can be converted to an electron&#8208;deficient state, fascinating the NO3&#8722; adsorption and promoting continuous hydrogenation reactions to produce NH3. Compared to CuBTA with a low NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion efficiency of 85.1&#8201;%, quinone group functionalization endows the resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone (CuTABQ) distinguished performance with a much higher NH3 FE of 97.7&#8201;%. This molecular engineering strategy is also universal, as verified by the improved NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion performance on different metal centers, including Co and Ni. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery based on CuTABQ cathode can deliver a high power density of 12.3&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides advanced insights into the rational design of metal complex catalysts through the molecular&#8208;level regulation for NO3&#8722; electroreduction to value&#8208;added NH3.

&lt;p&gt;A universal molecular engineering strategy is developed to enhance electrochemical nitrate-to-ammonia conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5-tetraaminobenzene to modulate the electronic state of metal centers. The resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone shows a much higher ammonia FE of 97.7&#8201;% than copper 1,2,4,5-tetraaminobenzene (85.1&#8201;%). It can be also applied as the catalyst cathode for rechargeable Zn-nitrate battery.

         <title>On the Electride Nature of Na&#8208;hP4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Na&#8208;hP4 phase, a high pressure electride, contains clusters of eleven sodium atoms within which charge is localized. Quantum chemical calculations show that this build&#8208;up of interstitial charge stems from the overlap of pd hybrid orbitals on the sodium atoms comprising this cluster, resulting in the formation of a multicentered bond, increased density, and semiconducting behavior.







Abstract
Early quantum mechanical models suggested that pressure drives solids towards free&#8208;electron metal behavior where the ions are locked into simple close&#8208;packed structures. The prediction and subsequent discovery of high&#8208;pressure electrides (HPEs), compounds assuming open structures where the valence electrons are localized in interstitial voids, required a paradigm shift. Our quantum chemical calculations on the iconic insulating Na&#8208;hP4 HPE show that increasing density causes a 3s&#8594;3pd electronic transition due to Pauli repulsion between the 1s2s and 3s states, and orthogonality of the 3pd states to the core. The large lobes of the resulting Na&#8208;pd hybrid orbitals point towards the center of an 11&#8208;membered penta&#8208;capped trigonal prism and overlap constructively, forming multicentered bonds, which are responsible for the emergence of the interstitial charge localization in Na&#8208;hP4. These multicentered bonds facilitate the increased density of this phase, which is key for its stabilization under pressure.

         <title>Nitrite and Nitric Oxide Interconversion at Mononuclear Copper(II): Insight into the Role of the Red Copper Site in Denitrification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent geometric preference on the bidirectional reactivity of NOx at mononuclear copper(II) sites was investigated. The involvement of the same copper(II) coordination motif in both nitrite reductase (NIR) and nitric oxide oxidase (NOO) activities provides insight into the functional roles of unusual red copper protein in interconverting nitrite and NO.







Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) and nitric oxide (NO) interconversion is crucial for maintaining optimum NO flux in mammalian physiology. Herein we demonstrate that [L2CuII(nitrite)]+ moieties (in 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b; where, L&#8201;=&#8201;Me2PzPy and Me2PzQu) with distorted octahedral geometry undergo facile reduction to provide tetrahedral [L2CuI]+ (in 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b) and NO in the presence of biologically relevant reductants, such as 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (4&#8208;MeO&#8208;2,6&#8208;DTBP, a tyrosine model) and N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH, a NAD(P)H model). Interestingly, the reaction of excess NO gas with [L2CuII(MeCN)2]2+ (in 1&#8201;a) provides a putative {CuNO}10 species, which is effective in mediating the nitrosation of various nucleophiles, such as thiol and amine. Generation of the transient {CuNO}10 species in wet acetonitrile leads to NO2&#8722; as assessed by Griess assay and 14N/15N&#8208;FTIR analyses. A detailed study reveals that the bidirectional NOx&#8208;reactivity, namely, nitrite reductase (NIR) and NO oxidase (NOO), at a common CuII site, is governed by the geometric&#8208;preference&#8208;driven facile CuII/CuI redox process. Of broader interest, this study not only highlights potential strategies for the design of copper&#8208;based catalysts for nitrite reduction, but also strengthens the previous postulates regarding the involvement of red copper proteins in denitrification.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Nitrogen Cluster Providing a Local Proton for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of isostructural Cu6 clusters (Cu6&#8722;NH, Cu6&#8722;N and Cu6&#8722;py) enabled the structure&#8722;activity relationship in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to be studied at the atomic level. The protonated pyrimidine N in Cu6&#8722;NH could act as a proton relay station to provide a local proton, enabling the formation of the key *COOH intermediate during CO generation, which significantly improved the photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Atomically precise Cu clusters are highly desirable as catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and they provide an appropriate model platform for elaborating their structure&#8211;activity relationship. However, an efficient overall photocatalytic CO2RR with H2O using assembled Cu&#8208;cluster aggregates as single component photocatalyst has not been reported. Herein, we report a stable crystalline Cu&#8722;S&#8722;N cluster photocatalyst with local protonated N&#8722;H groups (denoted as Cu6&#8722;NH). The catalyst exhibits suitable photocatalytic redox potentials, high structural stability, active catalytic species, and a narrow band gap, which account for its outstanding photocatalytic CO2RR performance under visible light, with &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity for CO evolution. Remarkably, systematic isostructural Cu&#8208;cluster control experiments, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed that the protonated pyrimidine N atoms in the Cu6&#8722;NH cluster act as a proton relay station, providing a local proton during the photocatalytic CO2RR. This efficiently lowers the energy barrier for the formation of the *COOH intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step, efficiently enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work lays the foundation for the development of atomically precise metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based photocatalysts.

A metallic nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) loaded with Pt was fabricated, which has dual&#8208;active&#8208;sites for separately boosting atmospheric CO2 capture and in situ photocatalytic conversion under infrared light irradiation. This finding opens a promising route to use conductive MOFs as new generation photocatalysts for efficient conversion of trace CO2 via energy&#8208;efficient methods.







Abstract
Infrared light driven photocatalytic reduction of atmospheric CO2 is challenging due to the ultralow concentration of CO2 (0.04&#8201;%) and the low energy of infrared light. Herein, we develop a metallic nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework loaded with Pt (Pt/Ni&#8208;MOF), which shows excellent activity for thermal&#8208;photocatalytic conversion of atmospheric CO2 with H2 even under infrared light irradiation. The open Ni sites are beneficial to capture and activate atmospheric CO2, while the photogenerated electrons dominate H2 dissociation on the Pt sites. Simultaneously, thermal energy results in spilling of the dissociated H2 to Ni sites, where the adsorbed CO2 is thermally reduced to CO and CH4. The synergistic interplay of dual&#8208;active&#8208;sites renders Pt/Ni&#8208;MOF a record efficiency of 9.57&#8201;% at 940&#8197;nm for converting atmospheric CO2, enables the procurement of CO2 to be independent of the emission sources, and improves the energy efficiency for trace CO2 conversion by eliminating the capture media regeneration and molecular CO2 release.

         <title>Reconfigurable Photonic Crystal Reversibly Exhibiting Single and Double Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconfigurable photonic crystal composed of a colloidal nanosheet dispersed in water reversibly exhibits the single structural color and the double structural color when annealed under homogeneous&#8208;temperature and gradient&#8208;temperature conditions, respectively. This finding will expand the design freedom of structural colors, leading to the next&#8208;generation color materials.







Abstract
Unlike absorption&#8208;based colors of dyes and pigments, reflection&#8208;based colors of photonic crystals, so called &#8220;structural colors&#8221;, are responsive to external stimuli, but can remain unfaded for over ten million years, and therefore regarded as a next&#8208;generation coloring mechanism. However, it is a challenge to rationally design the spectra of structural colors, where one structure gives only one reflection peak defined by Bragg's law, unlike those of absorption&#8208;based colors. Here, we report a reconfigurable photonic crystal that exhibits single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak structural colors. This photonic crystal is composed of a colloidal nanosheet in water, which spontaneously adopts a layered structure with single periodicity (407&#8197;nm). After a temperature&#8208;gradient treatment, the photonic crystal segregates into two regions with shrunken (385&#8197;nm) and expanded (448&#8197;nm) periodicities, and thus exhibits double reflection peaks that are blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted from the original one, respectively. Notably, the transition between the single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak states is reversible.

         <title>Advanced Lithium Extraction Membranes Derived from Tagged&#8208;Modification of Polyamide Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tagged&#8208;modification approach has been developed to selectively modify the top and bottom parts of a polyamide membrane, thereby resulting in the highest current Mg2+/Li+ separation performance that is stable over a 30&#8208;day test. A large&#8208;area (0.24&#8197;m2) membrane was prepared and made into spiral&#8208;wound modules, which show high efficacy in extracting lithium from simulated brines.







Abstract
Efficient Mg2+/Li+ separation is crucial to combating the lithium shortage worldwide, yet current nanofiltration membranes suffer from low efficacy and/or poor scalability, because desirable properties of membranes are entangled and there is a trade&#8208;off. This work reports a &#8220;tagged&#8208;modification&#8221; approach to tackle the challenge. A mixture of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;trimethylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium bromide (E1) and 3&#8208;aminopropyltrimethylazanium (E2) was designed to modify polyethylenimine &#8211; trimesoyl chloride (PEI&#8208;TMC) membranes. E1 and E2 reacted with the PEI and TMC, respectively, and thus, the membrane properties (hydrophilicity, pore sizes, charge) were untangled and intensified simultaneously. The permeance (34.3&#8197;L m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1) and Mg2+/Li+ selectivity (23.2) of the modified membranes are about 4&#8197;times and 2&#8197;times higher than the pristine membrane, and they remain stable in a 30&#8208;days test. The permeance is the highest among all analogous nanofiltration membranes. The tagged&#8208;modification method enables the preparation of large&#8208;area membranes and modules that produce high&#8208;purity lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) from simulated brine.

         <title>Azoxy Compounds&#8212;From Synthesis to Reagents for Azoxy Group Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein is the synthesis of sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds from nitroso arenes and iminoiodinanes by using visible light irradiation. The bench&#8208;stable sulfonyl azoxy compounds can be used in azoxy group transfer reactions for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of ether molecules and 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of vinyl ethers.







Abstract
The azoxy functional group is an important structural motif and represents the formally oxidized counterpart of the azo group. Azoxy compounds find numerous applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to functional materials, yet their synthesis remains underdeveloped with a main focus on the formation symmetric azoxy compounds. To overcome challenges in the synthesis of such unsymmetric azoxy compounds, we designed a process employing readily accessible nitroso compounds and iminoiodinanes. This method builds on the use of visible light irradiation to generate a triplet nitrene from iminoiodinanes, which is trapped by nitroso arenes to give access to sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds with a good substrate scope and functional group tolerance. We further describe two applications of these sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds as radical precursors in synthesis, where the whole azoxy group can be transferred and employed in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of ethers or 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of vinyl ethers. All of the reactions occurred at room temperature under visible light irradiation without the addition of any photoredox catalysts and additives. Control experiments, mechanism investigations, and DFT studies well explained the observed reactivity.

         <title>Dual Tunability for Uncatalyzed N&#8208;Alkylation of Primary Amines Enabled by Plasma&#8208;Microdroplet Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uncatalyzed N&#8208;alkylation of primary amines via a dual tunable plasma&#8208;microdroplet reaction platform is enabled by the in situ generation of reactive oxygen species during electrospray. Tuning the initial reagent concentration and timescale of the plasma&#8208;microdroplet system allows selected N&#8208;alkylation products to be collected under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The fusion of non&#8208;thermal plasma with charged microdroplets facilitates catalyst&#8208;free N&#8208;alkylation for a variety of primary amines, without halide salt biproduct generation. Significant reaction enhancement (up to &gt;200&#215;) is observed over microdroplet reactions generated from electrospray. This enhancement for the plasma&#8208;microdroplet system is attributed to the combined effects of energetic collisions and the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS (e.g., O2&#8901;&#8722;) act as a proton sink to increase abundance of free neutral amines in the charged microdroplet environment. The effect of ROS on N&#8208;alkylation is confirmed through three unique experiments: (i) utilization of radical scavenging reagent, (ii) characterization of internal energy distribution, and (iii) controls performed without plasma, which lacked reaction acceleration. Establishing plasma discharge in the wake of charged microdroplets as a green synthetic methodology overcomes two major challenges within conventional gas&#8208;phase plasma chemistry, including the lack of selectivity and product scale&#8208;up. Both limitations are overcome here, where dual tunability is achieved by controlling reagent concentration and residence time in the microdroplet environment, affording single or double N&#8208;alkylated products. Products are readily collected yielding milligram quantities in eight hours. These results showcase a novel synthetic strategy that represents a straightforward and sustainable C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming process.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation and Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Optimization of Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Dimerization of Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining high&#8208;throughput experimentation and machine learning technologies, we developed the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dimerization of two sulfoxonium ylides, leading to various unsymmetrical E&#8208;alkenes. Excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility under mild conditions enable this protocol to be of practical significance. A machine learning model for yield prediction further demonstrated its utilities and generalities.







Abstract
A novel and convenient approach that combines high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) with machine learning (ML) technologies to achieve the first selective cross&#8208;dimerization of sulfoxonium ylides via iridium catalysis is presented. A variety of valuable amide&#8208;, ketone&#8208;, ester&#8208;, and N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical E&#8208;alkenes are synthesized in good yields with high stereoselectivities. This mild method avoids the use of diazo compounds and is characterized by simple operation, high step&#8208;economy, and excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility. The combined experimental and computational studies identify an amide&#8208;sulfoxonium ylide as a carbene precursor. Furthermore, a comprehensive exploration of the reaction space is also performed (600 reactions) and a machine learning model for reaction yield prediction has been constructed.

         <title>Chemoselective Quinoline and Isoquinoline Reduction by Energy Transfer Catalysis Enabled Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkene and a (hetero)arene, to be reduced or retained? In contrast to conventional processes, in the reported hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) protocol enabled by energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, the benzenoid ring of a quinoline is more easily reduced than an electron&#8208;deficient alkene. Furthermore, many reducing labile moieties, such as aryl iodides, electron&#8208;deficient alkynes, benzsulfamides, and benzyl ethers, are compatible with this method.







Abstract
(Hetero)arene reduction is one of the key avenues for synthesizing related cyclic alkenes and alkanes. While catalytic hydrogenation and Birch reduction are the two broadly utilized approaches for (hetero)arene reduction across academia and industry over the last century, both methods have encountered significant chemoselectivity challenges. We hereby introduce a highly chemoselective quinoline and isoquinoline reduction protocol operating through selective energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, which enables subsequent hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The design of this protocol bypasses the conventional metric of reduction reaction, that is, the reductive potential, and instead relies on the triplet energies of the chemical moieties and the kinetic barriers of energy and hydrogen atom transfer events. Many reducing labile functional groups, which were incompatible with previous (hetero)arene reduction reactions, are retained in this reaction. We anticipate that this protocol will trigger the further advancement of chemoselective arene reduction and enable the current arene&#8208;rich drug space to escape from flatland.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Lewis Pairs in the Assembly of Supramolecular Macrocycles, Molecular Cages, Polymers, and 3D Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;nitrogen Lewis pairs (LPs) serve as versatile motifs that not only facilitate self&#8208;assembly but also endow macromolecules with unique characteristics. The dynamic nature of the dative bonding is exploited in the generation of new macrocycles, molecular cages, 1D polymers, and 3D networks with interesting optical and electronic properties, host&#8211;guest characteristics, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and shape&#8208;shifting properties.







Abstract
Covering an exceptionally wide range of bond strengths, the dynamic nature and facile tunability of dative B&#8722;N bonds is highly attractive when it comes to the assembly of supramolecular polymers and materials. This Minireview offers an overview of advances in the development of functional materials where Lewis pairs (LPs) play a key role in their assembly and critically influence their properties. Specifically, we describe the reversible assembly of linear polymers with interesting optical, electronic and catalytic properties, discrete macrocycles and molecular cages that take up diverse guest molecules and undergo structural changes triggered by external stimuli, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with intriguing interlocked structures that can embed and separate gases such as CO2 and acetylene, and soft polymer networks that serve as recyclable, self&#8208;healing, and responsive thermosets, gels and elastomeric materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Radical Oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;Substituted Styrenes via Late&#8208;Stage Stereomutation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed radical oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;substituted styrenes has been developed, providing a convenient and efficient approach to enantioenriched trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;difunctionalized products. The key of the success is the development of a formal late&#8208;stage stereomutation strategy, which could enable chiral cis&#8208;isomers to be converted into trans&#8208;isomer, thus achieving high diastereocontrol.







Abstract
Herein, we report an unprecedented copper&#8208;catalyzed highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective radical oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;substituted styrenes. The lynchpin of success is ascribed to the development of a late&#8208;stage stereomutation strategy, which enables enantioenriched cis&#8208;isomers among a couple of early&#8208;generated diastereomers to be converted into trans&#8208;isomer counterparts, thus fulfilling high diastereocontrol; while the degree of enantio&#8208;differentiation is determined by the borocupration process of the C=C bond. This reaction provides an efficient protocol to access enantioenriched trans&#8208;1,2&#8208; dioxygenation products. The value of this method has further been highlighted in a diversity of follow&#8208;up stereospecific transformations and further modifying complex molecules.

         <title>Tailored Design of &#960;&#8208;Extended Multi&#8208;Resonance Organoboron using Indolo[3,2&#8208;b]Indole as a Multi&#8208;Nitrogen Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pure&#8208;green multiple resonance emitter IDID2BN using indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole skeleton is obtained without sophisticated purification. It has a narrow green emission at 524&#8197;nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25&#8197;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%. The corresponding electroluminescence device shows a high external quantum efficiency of 36.6&#8201;% as well as an extremely small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.1&#8201;% at 10,000&#8197;cd/m2.







Abstract
Extending the &#960;&#8208;skeletons of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) organoboron emitters can feasibly modulate their optoelectronic properties. Here, we first adopt the indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole (32bID) segment as a multi&#8208;nitrogen bridge and develop a high&#8208;efficiency &#960;&#8208;extended narrowband green emitter. This moiety establishes not only a high&#8208;yield one&#8208;shot multiple Bora&#8211;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction towards a &#960;&#8208;extended MR skeleton, but a compact N&#8208;ethylene&#8208;N motif for a red&#8208;shifted narrowband emission. An emission peak at 524&#8197;nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25&#8197;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;% are concurrently obtained in dilute toluene. The extended molecular plane also results in a large horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio of 87&#8201;%. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% and a maximum power efficiency of 135.2&#8197;lm/W are thereafter recorded for the corresponding device, also allowing a low efficiency roll&#8208;off with EQEs of 34.5&#8201;% and 28.1&#8201;% at luminance of 1,000&#8197;cd/m2 and 10,000&#8197;cd/m2, respectively.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Modulated Facet&#8208;selective Charge Separation in Bi4NbO8Cl Single Crystal for Boosting Visible&#8208;light Driven Bifunctional Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive charge transfer channels were constructed by collaborating with the modest polarization electric field and facet junction induced built&#8208;in electric field, which strengthens the facet&#8208;selective charge separation in Bi4NbO8Cl single crystal nanosheets for boosting visible&#8208;light driven bifunctional water splitting for H2 and O2 evolution.







Abstract
Developing bifunctional water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts is meaningful, but challenged by the harsh requirements of specific&#8208;facet single crystals with spatially separated reactive sites and anisotropic charge transfer paths contributed by well&#8208;built charge driving force. Herein, tunable ferroelectric polarization is introduced in Bi4NbO8Cl single crystal nanosheets to strengthen the orthogonal charge transfer channels. By manipulating the in&#8208;plane polarization from octahedral off&#8208;centering of Nb5+ and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization from lone pair electron effect of anisotropic Bi3+, both the fast charge recombination in bulk catalyst and the process of charge trapping into surface states can be effectively modulated. Collaborating with modest polarization electric field and facet junction induced built&#8208;in electric field, cooperative charge tractive force is constructed, which reinforces the spatial separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes to {110} reductive site facet and {001} oxidation site facet, respectively. While excessive polarization charges impair the facet&#8208;selective charge separation characteristics and conversely promote charge recombination on the surface. As a result, polarity&#8208;optimized Bi4NbO8Cl shows an excellent H2 and O2 evolution rate of 54.21 and 36.08&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in the presence of sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation. This work unveils the function of ferroelectric polarization in tuning the intrinsic facet&#8208;selective charge transfer process of photocatalysts.

         <title>Hyperbranched Polyborosiloxanes: Non&#8208;traditional Luminescent Polymers with Red Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of dual heteroatom&#8208;induced electron delocalization and through&#8208;space O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions has been used to construct non&#8208;traditional fluorescence polymers with long emission wavelengths and fluorescence lifetimes. This has led to a hyperbranched polyborosiloxane that exhibits red emission at 640&#8197;nm and delayed fluorescence with a lifetime of 9.73&#8197;&#956;s.







Abstract
Non&#8208;traditional fluorescent polymers have attracted significant attention for their excellent biocompatibility and diverse applications. However, designing and preparing non&#8208;traditional fluorescent polymers that simultaneously possess long emission wavelengths and long fluorescence lifetime remains challenging. In this study, a series of novel hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes (P1&#8211;P4) were synthesized. As the electron density increases on the monomer diol, the optimal emission wavelengths of the P1&#8211;P4 polymers gradually red&#8208;shift to 510, 570, 575, and 640&#8197;nm, respectively. In particular, P4 not only exhibits red emission but also demonstrates delayed fluorescence with a lifetime of 9.73&#8197;&#956;s and the lowest critical cluster concentration (1.76&#8197;mg/mL). The experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic effect of dual heteroatom&#8208;induced electron delocalization and through&#8208;space O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction was the key factor contributing to the red&#8208;light emission with delayed fluorescence. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in dual&#8208;information encryption. This study provides a universal design strategy for the development of unconventional fluorescent polymers with both delayed fluorescence and long&#8208;wavelength emission.

         <title>An&#160; Extended NIR&#8208;II Superior Imaging Window from 1500 to 1900 nm for High&#8208;resolution in vivo Multiplexed Imaging  based on Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;resolution in vivo optical multiplexing in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) is vital to biomedical research. Presently, limited by bio&#8208;tissue scattering, only luminescent probes located at NIR&#8208;IIb (1500&#8208;1700 nm) window can provide high&#8208;resolution in vivo multiplexed imaging.  However, the number of available luminescent probes in this narrow NIR&#8208;IIb region is limited, which hampers the available multiplexed channels of in vivo imaging.  To overcome the above challenges, through theoretical simulation we expanded the traditional NIR&#8208;IIb window to NIR&#8208;II superior imaging window (SIW, 1500&#8208;1900 nm) on the basis of photon&#8208;scattering and water&#8208;absorption. Then, we developed a series of novel lanthanide luminescent nanoprobes with emission wavelengths from 1852 nm to 2842 nm. Furthermore, SIW nanoprobes enabled high&#8208;resolution in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging on blood vessels and intestines, and provided multi&#8208;channels imaging on lymph tubes, tumors and intestines. The proposed SIW probes without mutual interference are powerful tools for high&#8208;contrast in vivo multiplexed detection, which holds promise for revealing physiological process in living body.</dc:description>

         <title>The Construction of Highly Substituted Piperidines via Dearomative Functionalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen heterocycles play a vital role in pharmaceuticals and natural products, with the six&#8208;membered aromatic and aliphatic architectures being commonly used. While synthetic methods for aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles are well&#8208;established, the synthesis of their aliphatic functionalized analogues, particularly piperidine derivatives, poses a significant challenge. In that regard, we propose a stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction for the construction of highly decorated piperidine derivatives with diverse functional handles. We also discuss challenges related to site&#8208;selectivity, regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, and provide insights into the reaction mechanism through mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two exotic 6&#8208;cantilever small molecular platforms, characteristic of quite different molecular configurations of propeller and quasi&#8208;plane, are established by extremely two&#8208;dimensional conjugated extension. When applied in small molecular acceptors, the only two cases of CH25 and CH26 that could contain six terminals and such broad conjugated backbones have been afforded thus far, rendering featured absorptions, small reorganization and exciton binding energies. Moreover, their distinctive but completely different molecular geometries result in sharply contrasting nanoscale film morphologies. Finally, CH26 contributes to the best device efficiency of 15.41% among acceptors with six terminals, demonstrating two pioneered yet highly promising 6&#8208;cantilever molecular innovation platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Criteria for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting Revealed by Studying Carrier Dynamics in a Model Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overall water splitting (OWS) using semiconductor photocatalysts is a promising method for solar fuel production. Achieving a high quantum efficiency is one of the most important prerequisites for photocatalysts to realize high solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency. In a recent study (Nature, 2020, 58, 411&#8208;414), a quantum efficiency of almost 100% has been achieved in an aluminum&#8208;doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Al) photocatalyst. Herein, using the SrTiO3:Al as a model photocatalyst, we reveal the criteria for efficient photocatalytic water splitting by investigating the carrier dynamics through a comprehensive photoluminescence study. It is found that the Al doping suppresses the generation of Ti3+ recombination centers in SrTiO3, the surface band bending facilitates charge separation, and the in&#8208;situ photo&#8208;deposited Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOOH co&#8208;catalysts render efficient charge extraction. By suppressing photocarrier recombination and establishing a facile charge separation and extraction mechanism, high quantum efficiency can be achieved even on photocatalysts with a very short (sub&#8208;ns) intrinsic photocarrier lifetime, challenging the belief that a long carrier lifetime is a fundamental requirement. Our findings could provide guidance on the design of OWS photocatalysts toward more efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversification of a Novel &#945;&#8208;Galactosyl Ceramide Hotspot Boosts the Adjuvant Properties in Parenteral and Mucosal Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of potent adjuvants is an important step for improving the performance of subunit vaccines. CD1d agonists, such as the prototypical &#945;&#8208;galactosyl ceramide (&#945;&#8208;GalCer), are of special interest due to their ability to activate iNKT cells and trigger rapid dendritic cell maturation and B&#8208;cell activation. Here, we introduce a novel derivatization hotspot at the &#945;&#8208;GalCer skeleton, namely the N&#8208;substituent at the amide bond. The multicomponent diversification of this previously unexplored glycolipid chemotype space permitted the introduction of a variety of extra functionalities that can either potentiate the adjuvant properties or serve as handles for further conjugation to antigens toward the development of self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccines. This strategy led to the discovery of compounds eliciting enhanced antigen&#8208;specific T cell stimulation and a higher antibody response when delivered either by parenteral or mucosal route, compared to a known potent CD1d agonist. Notably, various functionalized &#945;&#8208;GalCer analogs showed a more potent adjuvant effect after intranasal immunization than a PEGylated &#945;&#8208;GalCer analog previously optimized for this purpose. Ultimately, this work could open multiple avenues of opportunity for the use of mucosal vaccines against microbial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging of Single Molecular Behaviors Under Bifurcated Three&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic visualization of single thiophene probes was performed to recognize single framework Al T&#8208;sites with atomic resolution, and reveal the bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonding behaviors of single thiophenes at confined acid T&#8208;sites in zeolites.







Abstract
The mechanism for interaction and bonding of single guest molecules with active sites fundamentally determines the sorption and subsequent catalytic processes occurring in host zeolitic frameworks. However, no real&#8208;space studies on these significant issues have been reported thus far, since atomically visualizing guest molecules and recognizing single Al T&#8208;sites in zeolites remain challenging. Here, we atomically resolved single thiophene probes interacting with acid T&#8208;sites in the ZSM&#8208;5 framework to study the bonding behaviors between them. The synergy of bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions can &#8220;freeze&#8221; the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and make it stable enough to be imaged. By combining the imaging results with simulations, direct atomic observations enabled us to precisely locate the single Al T&#8208;sites in individual straight channels. Then, we statistically found that the thiophene bonding probability of the T11 site is 15&#8197;times higher than that of the T6 site. For different acid T&#8208;sites, the variation in the interaction synergy changes the inner angle of the host&#8211;guest O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond, thereby affecting the stability of the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and leading to considerable bonding inhomogeneities.

         <title>Precise Recognition in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity: Tuning the Complementarity of Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endo&#8208;functionalized hosts with different rigid skeletons were successfully synthesized. The well&#8208;controlled in distances of the recognition sites within the hydrophobic cavities enable the highly selective recognition of structurally similar guests. This approach presents a viable solution for achieving the precise recognition of specific guests in aqueous environments through adjustments in the distance of recognition sites.







Abstract
Precise binding towards structurally similar substrates is a common feature of biomolecular recognition. However, achieving such selectivity&#8212;especially in distinguishing subtle differences in substrates&#8212;with synthetic hosts can be quite challenging. Herein, we report a novel design strategy involving the combination of different rigid skeletons to adjust the distance between recognition sites within the cavity, which allows for the highly selective recognition of hydrogen&#8208;bonding complementary substrates, such as 4&#8208;chromanone. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the distance of endo&#8208;functionalized groups within the rigid cavity is crucial for achieving high binding selectivity through hydrogen bonding. The thermodynamic data and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a significant influence of the hydrophobic cavity on the binding affinity. The new receptor possesses both high selectivity and high affinity, which provide valuable insights for the design of customized receptors.

         <title>Detection of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by Interrupted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;harvesting ability of a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) has been used to amplify the emission of an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye through an electron&#8208;exchange&#8208;based energy transfer to afford a fluorescence sensor that can detect aqueous per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at &#956;g/L levels. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS diminishes the efficiency of the energy transfer and leads to a ratiometric fluorescence response.







Abstract
The ubiquitous presence of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aqueous environments has aroused societal concern. Nonetheless, effective sensing technologies for continuous monitoring of PFAS within water distribution infrastructures currently do not exist. Herein, we describe a ratiometric sensing approach to selectively detect aqueous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations of &#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Our method relies on the excitonic transport in a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) to amplify a ratiometric emission signal modulated by an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye. The electronic coupling between the polymer and dye occurs through overlap of &#960;&#8208;orbitals and is designed such that energy transfer is dominated by an electron&#8208;exchange (Dexter) mechanism. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS perturbs the orbital interactions between the squaraine dye and the polymer backbone, thereby diminishing the efficiency of the energy transfer and producing a &#8220;polymer&#8208;ON/dye&#8208;OFF&#8221; response. These polymer/dye combinations were evaluated in spin&#8208;coated films and polymer nanoparticles and were able to selectively detect PFAS at concentrations of ca. 150 ppb and ca. 50 ppb, respectively. Both polymer films and nanoparticles are not affected by the type of water, and similar responses to PFAS were found in milliQ and well water.

Nonetheless, effective sensing technologies for continuous monitoring of PFAS within water distribution infrastructures currently do not exist. Herein, we describe a ratiometric sensing approach to selectively detect aqueous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations of &#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our method relies on the excitonic transport in a highly fluorinated poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) to amplify a ratiometric emission signal modulated by an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye. The electronic coupling between the polymer and dye occurs through overlap of &#960;-orbitals and is designed such that energy transfer is dominated by an electron-exchange (Dexter) mechanism. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS perturbs the orbital interactions between the squaraine dye and the polymer backbone, thereby diminishing the efficiency of the energy transfer and producing a &#8220;polymer-ON/dye-OFF&#8221; response. These polymer/dye combinations were evaluated in spin-coated films and polymer nanoparticles and were able to selectively detect PFAS at concentrations of ca. 150 ppb and ca. 50 ppb, respectively. Both polymer films and nanoparticles are not affected by the type of water, and similar responses to PFAS were found in milliQ and well water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Photoswitching of Diphosphene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemically and thermally reversible photoisomerization of &#951;2&#8208; to &#951;1&#8208;diphosphene complexes is described. The origins of this remarkable photochromic behavior lie in the S1 excited state, as elucidated by theoretical studies. The findings underscore the potential of previously overlooked transition metal diphosphene complexes, revealing their promising photochromic properties and distinctive photoswitching behavior.







Abstract
Although diphosphene transition metal complexes are known to undergo E to Z isomerization upon irradiation with UV light, their potential for photoswitching has remained poorly explored. In this study, we present diphosphene complexes capable of reversible photoisomerizations through haptotropic rearrangements. The compounds [(2&#8208;&#954;2P,&#954;6C)Mo(CO)2][OTf] (3&#8201;a[OTf]), [(2&#8208;&#954;2P,&#954;6C)Fe(CO)][OTf] (3&#8201;b[OTf]), and [(2&#8208;&#954;2P)Fe(CO)4][OTf] (4[OTf]) were prepared using the triflate salt [(LC)P=P(Dipp)][OTf] (2[OTf) as a precursor (LC=4,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisiopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisiopropylphenyl, OTf=triflate). Upon exposure to blue or UV light (&#955;=400&#8197;nm, 470&#8197;nm), the initially red&#8208;colored &#951;2&#8208;diphosphene complexes 3&#8201;a,b[OTf] readily undergo isomerization to form blue&#8208;colored &#951;1&#8208;complexes [(2&#8208;&#954;1P,&#954;6C)M(CO)n][OTf] (5&#8201;a,b[OTf]; a: M=Mo, n=2; b: M=Fe, n=1). This haptotropic rearrangement is reversible, and the (&#954;2P,&#954;6C)&#8208;coordination mode gradually reverts back upon dissolution in coordinating solvents or more rapidly upon exposure to yellow or red irradiation (&#955;=590&#8197;nm, 630&#8197;nm). The electronic reasons for the reversible visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoswitching observed for 3&#8201;a,b[OTf] are elucidated by DFT calculations. These calculations indicate that the photochromic isomerization originates from the S1 excited state and proceeds through a conical intersection.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Mediator Duality of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene in Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) Bond Formation with Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical approaches to form C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bonds have focused on coupling C(sp3) electrophiles that form stabilized carbon&#8208;centered radicals upon reduction or oxidation. Whereas alkyl bromides are desirable C(sp3) coupling partners owing to their availability and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their tendency to undergo radical&#8208;radical homocoupling makes them challenging substrates for electroreductive cross&#8208;coupling. Herein, we disclose a metal&#8208;free regioselective cross&#8208;coupling of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene, a useful precursor to aromatic nitriles, and alkyl bromides. Alkyl bromide reduction is mediated directly by 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene radical anions, leading to negligible homocoupling and high cross&#8208;selectivity to form 1,4&#8208;alkyl cyanobenzenes. The cross&#8208;coupling scheme is compatible with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups such as amines and alcohols, which have proven difficult to incorporate in alternative electrochemical approaches using carboxylic acids as C(sp3) precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Desymmetrization of Geminal Difluoromethylenes using a Palladium/Copper/Lithium Ternary System for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Fluorinated Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization of geminal difluoromethylenes using a palladium/copper/lithium ternary system was developed for the stereodivergent synthesis of chiral fluorinated amino acids. This ternary system afforded the allylic and benzylic substituted fluorinated &#945;&#8208;amino acids in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities in a stereodivergent manner (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr)







Abstract
Fluorinated amino acids and related peptides/proteins have been found widespread applications in pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds. However, strategies for introducing a C&#8722;F bond into amino acids in an enantioselective manner are still limited and no such asymmetric catalysis strategy has been reported. Herein, we have successfully developed a Pd/Cu/Li ternary system for stereodivergent synthesis of chiral fluorinated amino acids. This method involves a sequential desymmetrization of geminal difluoromethylenes and allylic substitution with amino acid Schiff bases via Pd/Li and Pd/Cu dual activation, respectively. A series of non&#8208;natural amino acids bearing a chiral allylic/benzylic fluorine motif are easily synthesized in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). A density functional theory (DFT) study revealed the F&#8722;Cu interaction of the allylic substrate and the Cu catalyst significantly influence the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Efficient Catalytic Production of Hydrogen Peroxide Using Tin&#8208;containing Zeolite Fixed Palladium Nanoparticles with Oxidation Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd nanoparticles were fixed in the SnOx&#8208;containing zeolite, exhibiting superior performance in directly producing hydrogen peroxide rather than water from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at &#8776;10,170&#8197;mmol gPd&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The metal surfaces tend to be oxidized in air through dissociation of the O&#8722;O bond of oxygen to reduce the performances in various fields. Although several ligand modification routes have alleviated the oxidation of bulky metal surfaces, it is still a challenge for the oxidation resistance of small&#8208;size metal nanoparticles. Herein, we fixed the small&#8208;size Pd nanoparticles in tin&#8208;contained MFI zeolite crystals, where the tin acts as an electron donor to efficiently hinder the oxidation of Pd by weakening the adsorption of molecular oxygen and suppressing the O&#8722;O cleavage. This oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd catalyst exhibited superior performance in directly synthesizing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at &#8776;10,170&#8197;mmol gPd&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, steadily outperforming the catalysts tested previously. This work leads to the hypothesis that tin is an electron donor to realize oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd within zeolite crystals for efficient catalysis to overcome the limitation of generally supported Pd catalysts and further motivates the use of oxidation&#8208;resistant metal nanoparticles in various fields.

         <title>Stability and Crystallinity of Sodium Poly(Heptazine Imide) in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI&#8722;Na) ultrathin nanosheets with high crystallinity were synthesized, by enhancing contact of melamine and NaCl via dissolution&#8208;evaporation and ball&#8208;milling joint treatment, and exhibit high photocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution from water splitting, but, unconventionally, remarkable photochemical instability owing to gradual Na+ loss, which, interestingly, can be retarded by the common ion effect.







Abstract
Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) salts, as crystalline carbon nitrides, exhibit high photocatalytic activity and are being extensively researched, but its photochemical instability has not drawn researchers&#8217; attention yet. Herein, sodium PHI (PHI&#8722;Na) ultrathin nanosheets with increased crystallinity, synthesized by enhancing contact of melamine with NaCl functioning as a structure&#8208;induction agent and hard template, exhibits improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, but low photochemical stability, owing to Na+ loss in the photocatalytic process, which, interestingly, can be enhanced by the common ion effect, e.g., addition of NaCl that is also able to remarkably increase the photoactivity with the apparent quantum yield at 420&#8197;nm reaching 41.5&#8201;%. This work aims at attracting research peers&#8217; attention to photochemical instability of PHI salts and provides a way to enhance their crystallinity.

         <title>Asymmetric N&#8208;Alkylation of 1H&#8208;Indoles via Carbene Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular enantioselective N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 1H&#8208;indoles has been developed enabled by cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed N&#8722;H bond insertion reaction. The reaction provides the N&#8208;alkyl indoles with a newly formed stereocenter adjacent to the indole nitrogen atom in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee).







Abstract
An intermolecular enantioselective N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 1H&#8208;indoles has been developed by cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed N&#8722;H bond insertion reaction. N&#8208;Alkyl indoles with newly formed stereocenter adjacent to the indole nitrogen atom are produced in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Importantly, both &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;&#8208;alkyl diazoacetates are tolerated, which is extremely rare in asymmetric X&#8722;H (X=N, O, S et&#8197;al.) and C&#8722;H insertion reactions. With this method, only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of rhodium catalyst and 2.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral phosphoric acid are required to complete the conversion as well as achieve the high enantioselectivity. Computational studies reveal the cooperative relay of rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid, and the origin of the chemo and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aminoalkylative Cyclization Enables Modular Synthesis of Exocyclic 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented three&#8208;component reaction building on palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminoalkylative cyclization between an aminoenyne, an aldehyde and a boronic acid or diphenylsilane is developed. This provides a facile access to multisubstituted exocyclic 1,3&#8208;dienes bearing 5 to 8&#8208;membered saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in a regioselective and stereodivergent fashion.







Abstract
A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and stereodivergent ring&#8208;closing reaction of aminoenynes with aldehydes and boronic acids or hydrosilane is developed. This three&#8208;component reaction allows for the modular synthesis of a series of exocyclic 1,3&#8208;dienes bearing 5&#8208; to 8&#8208;membered saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. The reactions utilize a simple Pd&#8208;catalyst and work with broad range of aminoenynes, aldehydes and organometallic reagents under mild reaction conditions. The products represent useful intermediates for chemical synthesis due to the versatility of the conjugated diene. Preliminary mechanistic details of the method are also revealed.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Plasmon Resonance Coupling Promoting Directional Photosynthesis of Nitrate from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;plasmon coupling structure (Bi/CsxWO3) generates a localized electromagnetic field enhancement to improve the formation efficiency and delay the self&#8208;thermalization of energetic hot carriers, which facilitates the directional overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes, thereby boosting the activation of inert nitrogen molecules into nitrates under mild conditions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis, particularly plasmon&#8208;mediated photocatalysis, offers a green and sustainable approach for direct nitrogen oxidation into nitrate under ambient conditions. However, the unsatisfactory photocatalytic efficiency caused by the limited localized electromagnetic field enhancement and short hot carrier lifetime of traditional plasmonic catalysts is a stumbling block to the large&#8208;scale application of plasmon photocatalytic technology. Herein, we design and demonstrate the dual&#8208;plasmonic heterojunction (Bi/CsxWO3) achieves efficient and selective photocatalytic N2 oxidation. The yield of NO3&#8722; over Bi/CsxWO3 (694.32&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) are 2.4&#8197;times that over CsxWO3 (292.12&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation. The surface dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect generates a surge of localized electromagnetic field intensity to boost the formation efficiency and delay the self&#8208;thermalization of energetic hot carriers. Ultimately, electrons participate in the formation of &#8901;O2&#8722;, while holes involve in the generation of &#8901;OH and the activation of N2. The synergistic effect of multiple reactive oxygen species drives the direct photosynthesis of NO3&#8722;, which achieves the overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes in photocatalytic reaction. The concept that the dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect facilitates the directional overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited carriers will pave a new way for the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Water Activation Triggered by Cu&#8722;Co Double&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Silane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8722;Co double&#8208;atom was precisely synthesized and exhibited better catalytic performance for silane oxidation with H2O. DFT calculations revealed that different mechanisms were observed for DACs and SACs where H2O was dissociated into H* and OH* species by the CuCo&#8208;DAC while the H2O acted as a nucleophile by Cu/Co&#8208;SAC.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance catalysts sufficient to significantly reduce the energy barrier of water activation are crucial in facilitating reactions that are restricted by water dissociation. Herein we present a Cu&#8722;Co double&#8208;atom catalyst (CuCo&#8208;DAC), which possesses a uniform and well&#8208;defined CuCoN6(OH) structure, and works together to promote water activation in silane oxidation. The catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance far exceeding that of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Various functional silanes are converted into silanols with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic studies show that the activation energy of silane oxidation by CuCo&#8208;DAC is significantly lower than that of Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu&#8208;SAC) and Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (Co&#8208;SAC). Theoretical calculations demonstrate two different reaction pathways where water splitting is the rate&#8208;determining step and it is accelerated by CuCo&#8208;DAC, whereas H2 formation is key for its single&#8208;atom counterpart.

The catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance far exceeding that of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Various functional silanes are converted into silanols with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic studies show that the activation energy of silane oxidation by CuCo-DAC is significantly lower than that of Cu single-atom catalyst (Cu-SAC) and Co single-atom catalyst (Co-SAC). Theoretical calculations demonstrate two different reaction pathways where water splitting is the rate-determining step and it is accelerated by CuCo-DAC, whereas H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation is key for its single-atom counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Super&#8208;Oxidizing Covalent Triazine Framework Electrocatalyst for Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) are a class of extended porous organic network with tunable redox properties. A CTF with high oxidizing property is reported here that can selectively generate hydrogen peroxide by stepwise oxidation of water, detailing the mechanism both experimentally and theoretically. This is the first example of a beyond&#8208;carbon metal&#8208;free catalyst showing better performance than most contemporary electrode materials.







Abstract
Electrochemical two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e WOR) is gaining surging research traction for sustainable hydrogen peroxide production. However, the strong oxidizing environment and thermodynamically competitive side&#8208;reaction (4e WOR) posit as thresholds for the 2e WOR. We herein report a custom&#8208;crafted covalent triazine network possessing strong oxidizing properties as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept metal&#8208;free functional organic network electrocatalyst for catalyzing 2e WOR. As the first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind, the material shows a maximum of 89.9&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and 1428&#8197;&#956;mol/h/cm2 H2O2 production rate at 3.0&#8197;V bias potential (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), which are either better or comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. We have experimentally confirmed a stepwise 2e WOR mechanism which was further computationally endorsed by density functional theory studies.

         <title>Synergistic Combination of Reductive Covalent Functionalization and Atomic Layer Deposition&#8212;Towards Spatially Defined Graphene&#8208;Organic&#8208;Inorganic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented covalent three dimensionally patterned graphene heterostructures consisting of a graphene monolayer, a tailor&#8208;made organophenyl bridging layer, and three metal oxide films (ZnO, Al2O3, and CuO) were constructed. These spatially resolved and hierarchically structured nano&#8208;ensembles are generated via a 2D&#8208;functionalization&#8208;mediated atomic layer deposition growth process.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) well&#8208;ordered and highly integrated graphene hybrid architectures are considered to be next&#8208;generation multifunctional graphene materials but still remain elusive. Here, we report the first realization of unprecedented 3D&#8208;patterned graphene nano&#8208;ensembles composed of a graphene monolayer, a tailor&#8208;made structured organophenyl layer, and three metal oxide films, providing the first example of such a hybrid nano&#8208;architecture. These spatially resolved and hierarchically structured quinary hybrids are generated via a two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;functionalization&#8208;mediated atomic layer deposition growth process, involving an initial lateral molecular programming of the graphene lattice via lithography&#8208;assisted 2D functionalization and a subsequent stepwise molecular assembly in these regions in the z&#8208;direction. Our breakthrough lays the foundation for the construction of emerging 3D&#8208;patterned graphene heterostructures.

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte Interphase Layers for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated multifunctional Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer with inorganic/organic hybrid construction can effectively reinforce sodium metal anodes (SMAs). The synergistic collaboration between inorganic and organic components in SEI leverages their respective strengths, contributing to dendrite&#8208;free SMAs and prolonging the lifespan of sodium metal batteries.







Abstract
Constructing a stable and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for achieving dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, maintaining the integrity of SEI during prolonged cycle life under high current densities poses a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an integrated multifunctional SEI layer with inorganic/organic hybrid construction (IOHL&#8722;Na) to enhance the durability of sodium metal anode during reduplicative plating/stripping processes. The inorganic components with high mechanical strength and strong sodiophilicity demonstrate optimized ionic conduction efficiency and dendrite inhibition ability. Simultaneously, the organic component contributes to the formation of a dense and elastic membrane structure, preventing fracture and delamination issues during volume fluctuations. The symmetrical batteries of IOHL&#8722;Na achieve stable cycling over 2000&#8197;hours with an extremely low voltage hysteresis of around 15.8&#8197;mV at a high current density of 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the Na&#8722;O2 batteries sustain exceptional long&#8208;term stability and impressive capacity retention, exploiting a promising approach for constructing durable SEI and dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes.

         <dc:description>
Here we have developed Lateral Flow Assays that employ as functional elements DNA&#8208;based structures decorated with reporter tags and recognition elements. With these analytical platforms we have demonstrated the rapid, sensitive and quantitative detection of several targets including small molecules, antibodies and proteins.







Abstract
Here we develop Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs) that employ as functional elements DNA&#8208;based structures decorated with reporter tags and recognition elements. We have rationally re&#8208;engineered tile&#8208;based DNA tubular structures that can act as scaffolds and can be decorated with recognition elements of different nature (i.e. antigens, aptamers or proteins) and with orthogonal fluorescent dyes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle we have developed sandwich and competitive multiplex lateral flow platforms for the detection of several targets, ranging from small molecules (digoxigenin, Dig and dinitrophenol, DNP), to antibodies (Anti&#8208;Dig, Anti&#8208;DNP and Anti&#8208;MUC1/EGFR bispecific antibodies) and proteins (thrombin). Coupling the advantages of functional DNA&#8208;based scaffolds together with the simplicity of LFAs, our approach offers the opportunity to detect a wide range of targets with nanomolar sensitivity and high specificity.

         <title>Super&#8208;fast Charging Biohybrid Batteries through a Power&#8208;to&#8208;formate&#8208;to&#8208;bioelectricity Process by Combining Microbial Electrochemistry and CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the cutting&#8208;edge advancements in microbial electrochemistry and CO2 electrolysis, a revolutionary biohybrid battery is developed. This biohybrid battery stands out for its remarkable super&#8208;fast charging and long&#8208;duration discharging capabilities. Moreover, the recovered bioelectricity from this battery can be utilized to assess water biotoxicity.







Abstract
Extensive study on renewable energy storage has been sparked by the growing worries regarding global warming. In this study, incorporating the latest advancements in microbial electrochemistry and electrochemical CO2 reduction, a super&#8208;fast charging biohybrid battery was introduced by using pure formic acid as an energy carrier. CO2 electrolyser with a slim&#8208;catholyte layer and a solid electrolyte layer was built, which made it possible to use affordable anion exchange membranes and electrocatalysts that are readily accessible. The biohybrid battery only required a 3&#8208;minute charging to accomplish an astounding 25&#8208;hour discharging phase. In the power&#8208;to&#8208;formate&#8208;to&#8208;bioelectricity process, bioconversion played a vital role in restricting both the overall Faradaic efficiency and Energy efficiency. The CO2 electrolyser was able to operate continuously for an impressive total duration of 164&#8197;hours under Gas Stand&#8208;By model, by storing N2 gas in the extraction chamber during stand&#8208;by periods. Additionally, the electric signal generated during the discharging phase was utilized for monitoring water biotoxicity. Functional genes related to formate metabolism were identified in the bioanode and electrochemically active bacteria were discovered. On the other hand, Paracoccus was predominantly found in the used air cathode. These results advance our current knowledge of exploiting biohybrid technology.

Functional genes related to formate metabolism were identified in the bioanode and electrochemically active bacteria were discovered. On the other hand, &lt;i&gt;Paracoccus&lt;/i&gt; was predominantly found in the used air cathode. These results advance our current knowledge of exploiting biohybrid technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Cephalotanin B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Possessing an extraordinarily congested heptacyclic skeleton, three lactone units, and nine consecutive stereocenters, (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B is a structurally unusual member of the Cephalotaxus diterpenoids, natural products with intriguing molecular frameworks and promising biological properties. An enantioselective route to (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B is reported that is also applicable to (+)&#8208;cephalotanin B.







Abstract
Cephalotaxus diterpenoids are attractive natural products with intriguing molecular frameworks and promising biological features. As a structurally unusual member, (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B possesses an extraordinarily congested heptacyclic skeleton, three lactone units, and nine consecutive stereocenters. Herein, we report an enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B based on a divergent asymmetric Michael addition reaction, a novel Pauson&#8211;Khand/deacyloxylation process discovered in the development of a second&#8208;generation stereoselective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction protocol, and an epoxide&#8208;opening/elimination/dual&#8208;lactonization cascade to construct the challenging propeller&#8208;shaped A&#8211;B&#8211;C ring system as key transformations.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Phomactin Platelet Activating Factor Antagonist Requires a Two&#8208;Enzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of diverse phomactins in nature only requires two enzymes: a type I diterpene cyclase PhmA and a P450 monooxygenase PhmC. PhmA catalyzes the conversion of GGPP into phomactatriene, while PhmC, in a sequential manner, orchestrates the oxidation of multiple sites within phomactatriene. This finely coordinated enzymatic cascade ultimately results in the production of a fascinating array of structurally diverse phomactins.







Abstract
Phomactin diterpenoids possess a unique bicyclo[9.3.1]pentadecane skeleton with multiple oxidative modifications, and are good platelet&#8208;activating factor (PAF) antagonists that can inhibit PAF&#8208;induced platelet aggregation. In this study, we identified the gene cluster (phm) responsible for the biosynthesis of phomactins from a marine fungus, Phoma sp. ATCC 74077. Despite the complexity of their structures, phomactin biosynthesis only requires two enzymes: a type I diterpene cyclase PhmA and a P450 monooxygenase PhmC. PhmA was found to catalyze the formation of the phomactatriene, while PhmC sequentially catalyzes the oxidation of multiple sites, leading to the generation of structurally diverse phomactins. The rearrangement mechanism of the diterpene scaffold was investigated through isotope labeling experiments. Additionally, we obtained the crystal complex of PhmA with its substrate analogue FGGPP and elucidated the novel metal&#8208;ion&#8208;binding mode and enzymatic mechanism of PhmA through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. This study provides the first insight into the biosynthesis of phomactins, laying the foundation for the efficient production of phomactin natural products using synthetic biology approaches.

         <title>Exploiting the Catenane Mechanical Bond Effect for Selective Halide Anion Transmembrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catenanes have been shown to be capable of anion transport across a lipid bilayer. The catenanes convergently encapsulate Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; via halogen and hydrogen bonding motifs, markedly enhancing the binding affinity and membrane transport efficiency for Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; relative to constituent macrocycles. The catenanes also showed exceptional transport selectivity for chloride over OH&#8722; and oxoanion NO3&#8722;.







Abstract
The first examples of [2]catenanes capable of selective anion transport across a lipid bilayer are reported. The neutral halogen bonding (XB) [2]catenanes were prepared via a chloride template&#8208;directed strategy in an unprecedented demonstration of using XB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions to direct catenane assembly from all&#8208;neutral components. Anion binding experiments in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media revealed strong halide over oxoanion selectivity, and a marked enhancement in the chloride and bromide affinities of the catenanes relative to their constituent macrocycles. The catenanes additionally displayed an anti&#8208;Hofmeister binding preference for bromide over the larger iodide anion, illustrating the efficacy of employing sigma&#8208;hole interactions in conjunction with the mechanical bond effect to tune receptor selectivity. Transmembrane anion transport studies conducted in POPC LUVs revealed that the catenanes were more effective anion transporters than the constituent macrocycles, with high chloride over hydroxide selectivity, which is critical to potential therapeutic applications of anionophores. Remarkably these outperform existing acyclic halogen bonding anionophores with regards to this selectivity. Record chloride over nitrate anion transport selectivity was also observed. This represents a rare example of the direct translation of intrinsic anion binding affinities to anion transport behaviour, and demonstrates the key role of the catenane mechanical bond effect for enhanced anion transport selectivity.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituents Allow Boosted NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence in J&#8208;Type Aggregates for Bioimaging and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent (&#8722;NO2) strategy is reported to construct J&#8208;type aggregates with boosted NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, which can promote slip&#8208;stacked J&#8208;type movement via increased electrostatic repulsion as well as facilitate intermolecular tight stacking by hydrogen bond. This method can be used to manipulate different kinds of organic fluorophores to obtain enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state.







Abstract
Developing molecular fluorophores with enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state for the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to the lack of reliable design guidelines. Herein, we report an aromatic substituent strategy to construct highly bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates. Introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at 3,5&#8208;aryl and meso positions of classic boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton can promote slip&#8208;stacked J&#8208;type arrangement and further boost NIR&#8208;II fluorescence of J&#8208;aggregates via increased electrostatic repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction. Notably, NOBDP&#8208;NO2 with three nitro groups (&#8722;NO2) shows intense NIR&#8208;II fluorescence at 1065&#8197;nm and high absolute quantum yield of 3.21&#8201;% in solid state, which can be successfully applied in bioimaging, high&#8208;level encoding encryption, and information storage. Moreover, guided by this electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent strategy, other skeletons (thieno&#8208;fused BODIPY, aza&#8208;BODIPY, and heptamethine cyanine) modified with &#8722;NO2 are converted into J&#8208;type aggregates with enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, showing great potential to convert aggregation caused emission quenching (ACQ) dyes into brilliant J&#8208;aggregates. This study provides a universal method for construction of strong NIR&#8208;II emissive J&#8208;aggregates by rationally manipulating molecular packing and establishing relationships among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and fluorescence properties.

         <title>Correlating the Solvating Power of Solvents with the Strength of Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction in Electrolytes of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvating power describes the strength of ion&#8208;dipole interaction, which is not necessarily related to the coordination number. The solvation structure originates from the competition between ion&#8208;ion interaction and ion&#8208;dipole interaction. With the similar strength of ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;dipole interactions, more anions enter the solvation sheath and form a stable electrode interface.







Abstract
The solvation structure of Li+ plays a significant role in determining the physicochemical properties of electrolytes. However, to date, there is still no clear definition of the solvating power of different electrolyte solvents, and even the solvents that preferentially participate in the solvation structure remain controversial. In this study, we comprehensively discuss the solvating power and solvation process of Li+ ions using both experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Our findings reveal that the solvating power is dependent on the strength of the Li+&#8208;solvent (ion&#8208;dipole) interaction. Additionally, we uncover that the anions tend to enter the solvation sheath in most electrolyte systems through Li+&#8208;anion (ion&#8208;ion) interaction, which is weakened by the shielding effect of solvents. The competition between the Li+&#8208;solvent and Li+&#8208;anion interactions ultimately determines the final solvation structures.

     alt="Correlating the Solvating Power of Solvents with the Strength of Ion-Dipole Interaction in Electrolytes of Lithium-ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solvating power describes the strength of ion-dipole interaction, which is not necessarily related to the coordination number. The solvation structure originates from the competition between ion-ion interaction and ion-dipole interaction. With the similar strength of ion-ion and ion-dipole interactions, more anions enter the solvation sheath and form a stable electrode interface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solvation structure of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; plays a significant role in determining the physicochemical properties of electrolytes. However, to date, there is still no clear definition of the solvating power of different electrolyte solvents, and even the solvents that preferentially participate in the solvation structure remain controversial. In this study, we comprehensively discuss the solvating power and solvation process of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions using both experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Our findings reveal that the solvating power is dependent on the strength of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-solvent (ion-dipole) interaction. Additionally, we uncover that the anions tend to enter the solvation sheath in most electrolyte systems through Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-anion (ion-ion) interaction, which is weakened by the shielding effect of solvents. The competition between the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-solvent and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-anion interactions ultimately determines the final solvation structures. This insight into the fundamental understanding of the solvation structure of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; provides inspiration for the design of multifunctional mixed-solvent electrolytes for advanced batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Entropy Confinement Promotes Hydrogenolysis Activity for Polyethylene Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamically unstable adsorption of macromolecular chains on the catalyst surface poses a challenge to the chemical recycling of waste plastics. This work provides an approach that involves the implementation of a space&#8208;confined catalytic strategy to mitigate the conformational entropy of the macromolecular chains, ultimately leading to the stabilization of the transition state and a substantial enhancement in catalytic activity.







Abstract
Chemical upcycling that catalyzes waste plastics back to high&#8208;purity chemicals holds great promise in end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics valorization. One of the main challenges in this process is the thermodynamic limitations imposed by the high intrinsic entropy of polymer chains, which makes their adsorption on catalysts unfavorable and the transition state unstable. Here, we overcome this challenge by inducing the catalytic reaction inside mesoporous channels, which possess a strong confined ability to polymer chains, allowing for stabilization of the transition state. This approach involves the synthesis of p&#8208;Ru/SBA catalysts, in which Ru nanoparticles are uniformly distributed within the channels of an SBA&#8208;15 support, using a precise impregnation method. The unique design of the p&#8208;Ru/SBA catalyst has demonstrated significant improvements in catalytic performance for the conversion of polyethylene into high&#8208;value liquid fuels, particularly diesel. The catalyst achieved a high solid conversion rate of 1106&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gRu&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 230&#8201;&#176;C. Comparatively, this catalytic activity is 4.9&#8197;times higher than that of a control catalyst, Ru/SiO2, and 14.0&#8197;times higher than that of a commercial catalyst, Ru/C, at 240&#8201;&#176;C. This remarkable catalytic activity opens up immense opportunities for the chemical upcycling of waste plastics.

         <title>A Protocol for Activated Bioorthogonal Fluorescence Labeling and Imaging of 4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase in Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A protocol for activated bioorthogonal fluorescence labeling and imaging of 4&#8208;hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase in plants is developed.







Abstract
4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) plays a crucial role in the synthesis of nutrients needed to maintain optimal plant growth. Its level is closely linked to the extent of abiotic stress experienced by plants. Moreover, it is also the target of commercial herbicides. Therefore, labeling of HPPD in plants not only enables visualization of its tissue distribution and cellular uptake, it also facilitates assessment of abiotic stress of plants and provides information needed for the development of effective environmentally friendly herbicides. In this study, we created a method for fluorescence labeling of HPPD that avoids interference with the normal growth of plants. In this strategy, a perylene&#8208;linked dibenzyl&#8208;cyclooctyne undergoes strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with an azide&#8208;containing HPPD ligand. The activation&#8208;based labeling process results in a significant emission enhancement caused by the change in the fluorescent forms from an excimer to a monomer. Notably, this activated bioorthogonal strategy is applicable to visualizing HPPD in Arabidopsis thaliana, and assessing its response to multiple abiotic stresses. Also, it can be employed to monitor in vivo levels and locations of HPPD in crops. Consequently, the labeling strategy will be a significant tool in investigations of HPPD&#8208;related abiotic stress mechanisms, discovering novel herbicides, and uncovering unknown biological functions.

         <title>Efficient Removal of Antibiotic Resistance Genes through 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d Gradient Orbital Coupling Mediated Fenton&#8208;Like Redox Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective gradient 4f&#8211;2p&#8208;3d orbital coupling precisely regulates the electron distribution of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Co active center microenvironment, thereby realizing efficient PMS activation to rapidly generate more radical and nonradical (&#8901;OH, SO4&#8901;&#8722;, and 1O2), and enabling excellent degradation activity of antibiotic resistance genes.







Abstract
Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) mediated radical and nonradical active substances can synergistically achieve the efficient elimination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, enhancing interface electron cycling and optimizing the coupling of the oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates to improve PMS activation kinetics remains a major challenge. Here, Co doped CeVO4 catalyst (Co&#8722;CVO) with asymmetric sites was constructed based on Ce&#8197;4f&#8722;O&#8197;2p&#8722;Co&#8197;3d gradient orbital coupling. The catalyst achieved approximately 2.51&#215;105 copies/mL of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) removal within 15&#8197;minutes, exhibited ultrahigh degradation rate (k=1.24&#8197;min&#8722;1). The effective gradient 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d orbital coupling precisely regulates the electron distribution of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Co active center microenvironment, while optimizing the electronic structure of Co&#8197;3d states (especially the occupancy of eg), promoting the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The generated radical and nonradical generated by interfacial electron cycling enhanced by the reduction reaction of PMS at the Ce site and the oxidation reaction at the Co site achieved a significant mineralization rate of ARGs (83.4&#8201;%). The efficient removal of ARGs by a continuous flow reactor for 10&#8197;hours significantly reduces the ecological risk of ARGs in actual wastewater treatment.

         <title>Synergistic Activation&#160;of Nitrite and Thiocarbonyl Compounds Affords NO and Sulfane Sulfur via (Per)thionitrite (SNO&#8211;/SSNO&#8211;)</title>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although there are many methods for the asymmetric synthesis of monosubstituted allylic fluorides, construction of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides has not been reported. To address this gap, we report an enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides using chiral diene&#8208;ligated rhodium catalyst, Et3N&#8226;3HF as a source of fluoride, and Morita Baylis Hillman (MBH) trichloroacetimidates. Kinetic studies show that one enantiomer of racemic MBH substrate reacts faster than the other. Computational studies reveal that both syn and anti &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes are formed upon ionization of allylic substrate, and the syn complexes are slightly energetically favorable. This is in contrast to our previous observation for formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates, in which the syn &#960;&#8208;allyl conformation is strongly preferred. In addition, the presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C2 position of racemic MBH substrate renders 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate formation endergonic and reversible. To compare, formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates was exergonic and irreversible. DFT calculations and kinetic studies support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process wherein the rate of isomerization of the 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allylrhodium complexes is faster than that of fluoride addition onto the more reactive intermediate. The 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides were obtained in good yields, enantioselectivity, and branched selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol in Water on ZnO&#8208;Supported CuAu Nanoalloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing processes and materials for the valorization of CO2 to hydrogen carriers or platform chemicals is a key step for mitigating global warming and for the sustainable use of renewables. We report here on the hydrogenation of CO2 in water on ZnO&#8208;supported CuAu nanoalloys, based on &#8804; 7 mol% Au. CuxAuy/ZnO catalysts were characterized using 197Au M&#246;ssbauer, in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption (Au LIII&#8208; and Cu K&#8208;edges), and ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXP), together with X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy. At 200 &#176;C, the conversion of CO2 showed a significant increase by 34 times (from 0.1 to 3.4 %) upon increasing Cu93Au7 loading from 1 to 10 wt.%, while maintaining methanol selectivity at 100%. Limited CO selectivity (4&#8208;6%) was observed upon increasing temperature up to 240 &#176;C but associated with a ~3&#8208;fold increase in CO2 conversion. Based on APXPS during CO2 hydrogenation in an H2O&#8208;rich mixture, Cu segregates preferentially to the surface in mainly metallic state, while slightly charged Au submerges deeper into the subsurface region. These results and detailed structural analyses are topics of present contribution.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Divergent Generations and Transformations of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Cations from Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Carbonyl cations are the umpolung forms of the synthetically fundamental &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbanions. They are highly reactive yet rarely studied and utilized species and their precursors were rather limited. Herein, we report the catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent generations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations from single alkyne functionalities and the interception of them via Wagner&#8208;Meerwein rearrangement. Two chemodivergent catalytic systems have been established, leading to two different types of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations and, eventually, two different types of products, i.e. the &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Broad spectrum of alkynes including aryl alkyne, ynamide, alkynyl ether, and alkynyl sulfide could be utilized and the migration priorities of different groups in the Wagner&#8208;Meerwein rearrangement step was elucidated. DFT calculations further supported the intermediacy of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations via the N&#8208;O bond cleavage in both the two catalytic systems. Another key feature of this methodology was the fragmentation of synthetically inert tert&#8208;butyl groups into readily transformable olefin functionalities. The synthetic potential was highlighted by the scale&#8208;up reactions and the downstream diversifications including the formal synthesis of nicotlactone B and galbacin.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Local CO2 Adsorption by L&#8208;histidine Incorporation for Selective Formate Production Over the Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce valuable chemicals is a promising pathway to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming issues. However, simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current densities of CO2RR in a wide potential range remains as a huge challenge for practical implements. Herein, we demonstrate that incorporating bismuth&#8208;based (BH) catalysts with L&#8208;histidine, a common amino acid molecule of proteins, is an effective strategy to overcome the inherent trade&#8208;off between the activity and selectivity. Benefiting from the significantly enhanced CO2 adsorption capability and promoted electron&#8208;rich nature by L&#8208;histidine integrity, the BH catalyst exhibits excellent FEformate in the unprecedented wide potential windows (&gt; 90% within &#8208;0.1 ~ &#8208;1.8 V and &gt; 95% within &#8208;0.2 ~ &#8208;1.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Excellent CO2RR performance can still be achieved under the low&#8208;concentration CO2 feeding (e.g., 20 vol.%). Besides, an extremely low onset potential of &#8208;0.05 VRHE (close to the theoretical thermodynamic potential of &#8208;0.02 VRHE) is detected by in situ ultraviolet measurements, together with stable operation over 50 h with preserved FEformate of ~ 95% and a high partial current density of 326.2 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;1.0 VRHE.</dc:description>

However, simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current densities of CO2RR in a wide potential range remains as a huge challenge for practical implements. Herein, we demonstrate that incorporating bismuth-based (BH) catalysts with L-histidine, a common amino acid molecule of proteins, is an effective strategy to overcome the inherent trade-off between the activity and selectivity. Benefiting from the significantly enhanced CO2 adsorption capability and promoted electron-rich nature by L-histidine integrity, the BH catalyst exhibits excellent FEformate in the unprecedented wide potential windows (&amp;gt; 90% within -0.1 ~ -1.8 V and &amp;gt; 95% within -0.2 ~ -1.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Excellent CO2RR performance can still be achieved under the low-concentration CO2 feeding (e.g., 20 vol.%). Besides, an extremely low onset potential of -0.05 VRHE (close to the theoretical thermodynamic potential of -0.02 VRHE) is detected by in situ ultraviolet measurements, together with stable operation over 50 h with preserved FEformate of ~ 95% and a high partial current density of 326.2 mA cm-2 at -1.0 VRHE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activatable Near&#8208;infrared Versatile Fluorescent and Chemiluminescent Dyes based on DCM Core: From Design to Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activatable fluorescent and chemiluminescent dyes with near&#8208;infrared emission have indispensable roles in the field of bioimaging, molecular prodrugs, and phototheranostic agents. As one of the most popular fluorophore scaffolds, the dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran scaffold has been applied to fabricate a large number of versatile activatable optical dyes for analytes detection and diseases diagnosis and treatment by virtue of its high photostability, large Stokes shift, considerable two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section, and structural modifiability. This review mainly discusses the molecular design strategies, recognition mechanisms, and both in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;applications (especially for diagnosis and therapy of tumors) of activatable dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran dyes. The final section describes the current shortcomings and future development prospects of this topic.</dc:description>

         <title>How Acyl Carrier Proteins (ACPs) Direct Fatty Acid and Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Megasynthases, such as type I fatty acid and polyketide synthases (FASs and PKSs), are multienzyme complexes responsible for producing primary metabolites and complex natural products. Fatty acids (FAs) and polyketides (PKs) are built by assembling and modifying small acyl moieties in a stepwise manner. A central aspect of FA and PK biosynthesis involves the shuttling of substrates between the domains of the multienzyme complex. This essential process is mediated by small acyl carrier proteins (ACPs). The ACPs must navigate to the different catalytic domains within the multienzyme complex in a particular order to guarantee the fidelity of the biosynthesis pathway. However, the precise mechanisms underlying ACP&#8208;mediated substrate shuttling, particularly the factors contributing to the programming of the ACP movement, still need to be fully understood. This review illustrates the current understanding of substrate shuttling, including concepts of conformational and specificity control, and proposes a confined ACP movement within type I megasynthases.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The viscosity and crowding of biological environment are considered vital for the correct cellular function, and alterations in these parameters are known to underly a number of pathologies including diabetes, malaria, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, to name a few. Over the last decades, fluorescent molecular probes termed molecular rotors proved extremely useful for exploring viscosity, crowding, and underlying molecular interactions in biologically relevant settings. In this review, we will discuss the basic principles underpinning the functionality of these probes and will review advances in their use as sensors for lipid order, protein crowding and conformation, temperature and non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures in live cells and other relevant biological settings.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with pH&#8208;responsive properties suggest&#160;merits in biological analyses. This work establishes a general and effective method to obtain pH&#8208;responsive NIR emissive gold nanoclusters by introducing aliphatic tertiary amine (TA) groups into the ligands. Computational study suggests that the pH&#8208;responsive NIR emission is&#160;associated with electronic structure change upon protonation and deprotonation of TA groups. Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer between deprotonated TA groups and the surface Au&#8208;S motifs of gold nanoclusters can disrupt the radiative transitions and thereby decrease the photoluminescence intensity in basic environments (pH=7&#8208;11). By contrast, protonated TA groups curb the electron transfer and restore the photoluminescence intensity in acidic environments (pH=4&#8208;7). The pH&#8208;responsive NIR&#8208;emitting gold nanoclusters serve as a specific and sensitive probe for the lysosomes in the cells, offering non&#8208;invasive emissions without interferences from intracellular autofluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Radius&#8208;Controlled Sn&#8722;O Bond Length Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling Sn&#8722;O bond length via A&#8208;site cation radius of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides was a reliable strategy to boost their CO2 electroreduction properties. With Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3 (x from 0 to 1) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it was demonstrated that their activity/selectivity for HCOOH featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, with a maximum point corresponding to Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3.







Abstract
Despite the intriguing potential shown by Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides in CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), the rational optimization of their CO2RR properties is still lacking. Here we report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples of Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3, as the A&#8208;site cation average radii decrease from 1.61 to 1.44&#8197;&#197;, their Sn&#8722;O bonds are precisely shortened from 2.06 to 2.02&#8197;&#197;. Our CO2RR measurements show that the activity and selectivity of these samples for HCOOH production exhibit volcano&#8208;type trends with the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. Among these samples, the Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3 features the optimal activity (753.6&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (90.9&#8201;%) for HCOOH, better than those of the reported Sn&#8208;based oxides. Such optimized CO2RR properties could be attributed to favorable merits conferred by the precisely controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, e.g., the regulated band center, modulated adsorption/activation of intermediates, and reduced energy barrier for *OCHO formation. This work brings a new avenue for rational design of advanced Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides toward CO2RR.

         <title>Ferric Single&#8208;Site Catalyst Confined in a Zeolite Framework for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site catalyst comprised of ferric iron confined in an MFI&#8208;type zeolite framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal method involving rapid mixing at high temperature. The isolated Fe species in the framework formed distorted tetrahedra, which were beneficial for the selective dehydrogenation of propane. The catalyst had a silanol&#8208;free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable, and resistant to coking.







Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a highly efficient approach for industrial preparation of propene that is commonly catalyzed by noble Pt or toxic Cr catalysts and suffers from coking. In this work, ferric catalyst confined in a zeolite framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal procedure. The isolated Fe in the framework formed distorted tetrahedra, which were beneficial for the selective dehydrogenation of propane and reached over 95&#8201;% propene selectivity and over 99&#8201;% total olefins selectivity. This catalyst had a silanol&#8208;free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable, and coke free, with a deactivation constant of 0.01&#8197;h&#8722;1. This study provided guidance for the synthesis of structural heteroatomic zeolite and efficient propane non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation over early transition metals.

         <title>Rationalizing In Situ Active Repair in Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysis via Non&#8208;Invasive Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the light&#8208;independent active repair of a bridged dinuclear RuII&#8208;tpphz&#8208;PtII photocatalyst highly active in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via ammonium persulfate. This enables improved revitalization of the photocatalyst, which &#8211; along with the innovative detection of hydrogen via rotational Raman spectroscopy &#8211; enhances the applicability of this repair mechanism for a wide field of reductive catalysts.







Abstract
Currently, most photosensitizers and catalysts used in the field of artificial photosynthesis are still based on rare earth metals and should thus be utilized as efficiently and economically as possible. While repair of an inactivated catalyst is a potential mitigation strategy, this remains a challenge. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods are crucial for characterizing reaction products during photocatalysis and repair, and are currently based on invasive analysis techniques limiting real&#8208;time access to the involved mechanisms. Herein, we use an innovative in situ technique for detecting both initially evolved hydrogen and after active repair via advanced non&#8208;invasive rotational Raman spectroscopy. This facilitates unprecedently accurate monitoring of gaseous reaction products and insight into the mechanism of active repair during light&#8208;driven catalysis enabling the identification of relevant mechanistic details along with innovative repair strategies.

&lt;p&gt;We report the light-independent active repair of a bridged dinuclear Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-tpphz-Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; photocatalyst highly active in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via ammonium persulfate. This enables improved revitalization of the photocatalyst, which &#8211; along with the innovative detection of hydrogen via rotational Raman spectroscopy &#8211; enhances the applicability of this repair mechanism for a wide field of reductive catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, most photosensitizers and catalysts used in the field of artificial photosynthesis are still based on rare earth metals and should thus be utilized as efficiently and economically as possible. While repair of an inactivated catalyst is a potential mitigation strategy, this remains a challenge. State-of-the-art methods are crucial for characterizing reaction products during photocatalysis and repair, and are currently based on invasive analysis techniques limiting real-time access to the involved mechanisms. Herein, we use an innovative &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; technique for detecting both initially evolved hydrogen and after active repair via advanced non-invasive rotational Raman spectroscopy. This facilitates unprecedently accurate monitoring of gaseous reaction products and insight into the mechanism of active repair during light-driven catalysis enabling the identification of relevant mechanistic details along with innovative repair strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;to&#8208;Small Molecule Converter through Amplified Hairpin DNA Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

We realize the conversion of nucleic acid input into small molecule output using hairpin DNA circuits. The systems are combined with the biorthogonal Staudinger reduction to release fluorophore, dye, and anticancer agent triggered by oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Our approach would have great potential for efficient detection and chemotherapy of cancers based on nucleic acid expression profiles.







Abstract
Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are characteristically found in cancer cells, making miRNAs promising marker biomolecules for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. However, it is challenging to use miRNA as a cancer signature because it is difficult to convert the nucleic acid sequence information into molecular functionality. To address this challenge, we realize nucleic acid&#8208;to&#8208;small molecule converters using hairpin DNA circuits. Harnessing a Staudinger reduction as a trigger for the conversion, we constructed hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) circuits that respond to oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Fluorophore and dye molecules were released in response to miR&#8208;21 through the HCR, providing fluorogenic and chromogenic readouts. Selective cytotoxicity in miR&#8208;21&#8208;abundant cells was realized by the CHA to release the anticancer drug SN&#8208;38. This would be the first example of selective activation of a small&#8208;molecule prodrug triggered by oncogenic miRNA in human living cells.

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Halides as Selectively Bifunctional Catalysts Enabling the Syntheses of Recyclable High Molecular Weight Salicylic Acid&#8208;Based Copolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalysis system of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester (salicylic methyl glycolide), and yields salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters with high molecular weights (Mn=361.8&#8197;kg/mol, &#272;=1.25). Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation can synergistically activate monomer and initiator. Moreover, these polymers can be recycled to monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.







Abstract
To synthesize high molecular weight poly(phenolic ester) via a living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester monomers remains a critical challenge due to serious transesterification and back&#8208;biting reactions. Both phenolic ester bonds in monomer and polymer chains are highly active, and it is difficult so far to distinguish them. In this work, an unprecedented selectively bifunctional catalytic system of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered to mediate the syntheses of high molecular weight salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters via a living ROP of salicylate cyclic esters (for poly(salicylic methyl glycolide) (PSMG), Mn=361.8&#8197;kg/mol, &#208;&lt;1.30). Compared to previous catalysis systems, the side reactions were suppressed remarkably in this catalysis system because phenolic ester bond in monomer can be selectively cleaved over that in polymer chains during ROP progress. Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation work synergistically, where the alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation moiety interacts with the carbonyl group of substrates via non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding. Moreover, these salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters can be recycled to dimeric monomer under solution condition, and can be recycled to original monomeric monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Electrolyte Concentration and Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Surface toward Actuating Fast Zn2+ Dehydration for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic process of Zn2+ dehydration when migrating into the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coated on a Zn anode is unraveled. General optimization strategies are proposed by fine&#8208;tuning the MOF surface with hydrophilic groups to lower the dehydration energy by &#8776;1&#8197;eV and by reducing the effective coating thickness to only &#8776;16&#8197;nm, paving a way to achieve long&#8208;term stable zinc anodes at high capacities.







Abstract
Functional porous coating on zinc electrode is emerging as a powerful ionic sieve to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions, thereby improving highly reversible aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, the ultrafast charge rate is limited by the substantial cation transmission strongly associated with dehydration efficiency. Here, we unveil the entire dynamic process of solvated Zn2+ ions&#8217; continuous dehydration from electrolyte across the MOF&#8208;electrolyte interface into channels with the aid of molecular simulations, taking zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;7 as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The moderate concentration of 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolyte being advantageous over other concentrations possesses the homogeneous water&#8208;mediated ion pairing distribution, resulting in the lowest dehydration energy, which elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying such concentration adopted by numerous experimental studies. Furthermore, we show that modifying linkers on the ZIF&#8208;7 surface with hydrophilic groups such as &#8722;OH or &#8722;NH2 can weaken the solvation shell of Zn2+ ions to lower the dehydration free energy by approximately 1&#8197;eV, and may improve the electrical conductivity of MOF. These results shed light on the ions delivery mechanism and pave way to achieve long&#8208;term stable zinc anodes at high capacities through atomic&#8208;scale modification of functional porous materials.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Poor Acridones and Acridiniums as Super Photooxidants in Molecular Photoelectrochemistry by Unusual Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under photoelectrochemical conditions, dicyanated acridones are precatalysts for acridinium ions as closed&#8208;shell, highly potent arene photooxidants. Despite the lifetime permitting diffusion&#8208;controlled quenching, a preassembly with substrate nonetheless operates. Highlighting the profound influence of preassembly on photocatalysis, quenching diverts from single to double electron transfer reduction of the excited state to an acridinide anion.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient acridones and in situ generated acridinium salts are reported as potent, closed&#8208;shell photooxidants that undergo surprising mechanisms. When bridging acyclic triarylamine catalysts with a carbonyl group (acridones), this completely diverts their behavior away from open&#8208;shell, radical cationic, &#8216;beyond diffusion&#8217; photocatalysis to closed&#8208;shell, neutral, diffusion&#8208;controlled photocatalysis. Br&#248;nsted acid activation of acridones dramatically increases excited state oxidation power (by +0.8&#8197;V). Upon reduction of protonated acridones, they transform to electron&#8208;deficient acridinium salts as even more potent photooxidants (*E1/2=+2.56&#8211;3.05&#8197;V vs SCE). These oxidize even electron&#8208;deficient arenes where conventional acridinium salt photooxidants have thusfar been limited to electron&#8208;rich arenes. Surprisingly, upon photoexcitation these electron&#8208;deficient acridinium salts appear to undergo two electron reductive quenching to form acridinide anions, spectroscopically&#8208;detected as their protonated forms. This new behaviour is partly enabled by a catalyst preassembly with the arene, and contrasts to conventional SET reductive quenching of acridinium salts. Critically, this study illustrates how redox active chromophoric molecules initially considered photocatalysts can transform during the reaction to catalytically active species with completely different redox and spectroscopic properties.

         <title>Boosting the &#8220;Solid&#8211;Liquid&#8211;Solid&#8221; Conversion Reaction via Bifunctional Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life Potassium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

A bifunctional concentration electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate) with high ion conductivity is developed to reduce the dissolution of polysulfides and stabilize the K anode for advanced K&#8722;S batteries. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries based on &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; conversion mechanism display superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) batteries have attracted wide attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the intractable shuttle effect of K polysulfides results in poor cyclability of K&#8722;S batteries, which severely limits their practical application. Herein, a bifunctional concentrated electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate (EC)) with high ionic conductivity and low viscosity is developed to regulate the dissolution behavior of polysulfides and induce uniform K deposition. The organic groups in the cathode electrolyte interphase layer derived from EC can effectively block the polysulfide shuttle and realize a &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; reaction mechanism. The KF&#8208;riched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase inhibits K dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries display a high reversible capacity of 654&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles and a long lifespan over 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Dispersion of Rhodium Clusters into Isolated Single Atoms at Low Temperature and the Consequences for CO Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh clusters undergo partial dispersion upon exposure to oxygen at room temperature. The extent of dispersion increases at higher temperatures and is higher for smaller clusters. The dispersed Rh single atoms show two orders of magnitude higher activity than nanoparticles.







Abstract
Understanding the dynamic structural evolution of supported metal clusters under reaction conditions is crucial to develop structure reactivity relations. Here, we followed the structure of different size Rh clusters supported on Al2O3 using in situ/operando spectroscopy and ex situ aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy. We report a dynamic evolution of rhodium clusters into thermally stable isolated single atoms upon exposure to oxygen and during CO oxidation. Rh clusters partially disperse into single atoms at room temperature and the extent of dispersion increases as the Rh size decreases and as the reaction temperature increases. A strong correlation is found between the extent of dispersion and the CO oxidation kinetics. More importantly, dispersing Rh clusters into single atoms increases the activity at room temperature by more than two orders of magnitude due to the much lower activation energy on single atoms (40 vs. 130&#8197;kJ/mol). This work demonstrates that the structure and reactivity of small Rh clusters are very sensitive to the reaction environment.

         <title>Exploiting the Use of the Decarboxylative S&#8208;Alkylation Reaction to Produce Self&#8208;Blowing, Recyclable Polycarbonate Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;blown polycarbonate foam was prepared by exploiting the use of decarboxylative S&#8208;alkylation to generate CO2 in situ.







Abstract
Polymeric foams are widely used in many industrial applications due to their light weight and superior thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Currently, increasing research efforts is being directed towards the development of greener foam formulations that circumvent the use of isocyanates/blowing agents that are commonly used in the production of foam materials. Here, a straightforward, one&#8208;pot method is presented to prepare self&#8208;blown polycarbonate (PC) foams by exploiting the (decarboxylative) S&#8208;alkylation reaction for in situ generation of the blowing agent (CO2). The concomitant formation of a reactive alcohol intermediate promotes a cascade ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonates to yield a cross&#8208;linked polymer network. It is shown that these hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized polycarbonate&#8208;based foams can be easily recycled into films through thermal compression molding. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that complete hydrolytic degradation of the foams is possible, thus offering the potential for zero&#8208;waste materials. This straightforward and versatile process broadens the scope of isocyanate&#8208;free, self&#8208;foaming materials, opening a new pathway for next&#8208;generation environmentally friendly foams.

         <title>Manipulating Intermetallic Charge Transfer for Switchable External Stimulus&#8208;Enhanced Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transfer between metal sites in a Prussian blue structure serves as a switch to alter the water oxidation catalytic mechanism to an external stimulus&#8208;sensitive spin&#8208;crossover pathway.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic processes involving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) present a kinetic bottleneck due to the existence of linear&#8208;scaling relationships, which bind the energies of the different intermediates in the mechanism limiting optimization. Here, we offer a way to break these scaling relationships and enhance the electrocatalytic activity of a Co&#8722;Fe Prussian blue modified electrode in OER by applying external stimuli. Improvements of &#8776;11&#8201;% and &#8776;57&#8201;% were achieved under magnetic field (0.2&#8197;T) and light irradiation (100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively, when working at fixed overpotential, &#951;=0.6&#8197;V at pH&#8197;7. The observed enhancements strongly tie in with the intermetallic charge transfer (IMCT) intensity between Fe and Co sites. Density Functional Theory simulations suggest that tuning the IMCT can lead to a change of the OER mechanism to an external stimuli&#8208;sensitive spin crossover&#8208;based pathway, which opens the way for switchable electrocatalytic devices.

         <title>Liposomal Enzyme Nanoreactors Based on Nanoconfinement for Efficient Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed liposome&#8208;based enzyme nanoreactors that enable efficient cascade reactions for catalytic antitumor therapy. These nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting tumor nutrient supply and by producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), marrying liposomes biocompatibility with high efficiency of tandem enzymatic reactions making them promising for antitumor nanomedicines.







Abstract
Enzymatic reactions can consume endogenous nutrients of tumors and produce cytotoxic species and are therefore promising tools for treating malignant tumors. Inspired by nature where enzymes are compartmentalized in membranes to achieve high reaction efficiency and separate biological processes with the environment, we develop liposomal nanoreactors that can perform enzymatic cascade reactions in the aqueous nanoconfinement of liposomes. The nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by consuming tumor nutrients (glucose and oxygen) and producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH). Co&#8208;compartmentalization of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in liposomes could increase local concentration of the intermediate product hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as well as the acidity due to the generation of gluconic acid by GOx. Both H2O2 and acidity accelerate the second&#8208;step reaction by HRP, hence improving the overall efficiency of the cascade reaction. The biomimetic compartmentalization of enzymatic tandem reactions in biocompatible liposomes provides a promising direction for developing catalytic nanomedicines in antitumor therapy.

&lt;p&gt;We developed liposome-based enzyme nanoreactors that enable efficient cascade reactions for catalytic antitumor therapy. These nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting tumor nutrient supply and by producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), marrying liposomes biocompatibility with high efficiency of tandem enzymatic reactions making them promising for antitumor nanomedicines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzymatic reactions can consume endogenous nutrients of tumors and produce cytotoxic species and are therefore promising tools for treating malignant tumors. Inspired by nature where enzymes are compartmentalized in membranes to achieve high reaction efficiency and separate biological processes with the environment, we develop liposomal nanoreactors that can perform enzymatic cascade reactions in the aqueous nanoconfinement of liposomes. The nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by consuming tumor nutrients (glucose and oxygen) and producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH). Co-compartmentalization of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in liposomes could increase local concentration of the intermediate product hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as the acidity due to the generation of gluconic acid by GOx. Both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and acidity accelerate the second-step reaction by HRP, hence improving the overall efficiency of the cascade reaction. The biomimetic compartmentalization of enzymatic tandem reactions in biocompatible liposomes provides a promising direction for developing catalytic nanomedicines in antitumor therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Directed Pyrolysis via Thermally Morphing Surface Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

Taming fire: Using morphing surfaces to control ignition and mass transport turns combustion to pyrolysis, hence slows rate of thermal degradation. Pyrolysis leads to incomplete combustion, hence graphitic tubes. This being a surface process, nm to &#956;m wide tubes are produced.







Abstract
Combustion is often difficult to spatially direct or tune associated kinetics&#8212;hence a run&#8208;away reaction. Coupling pyrolytic chemical transformation to mass transport and reaction rates (Damk&#246;hler number), however, we spatially directed ignition with concomitant switch from combustion to pyrolysis (low oxidant). A &#8216;surface&#8208;then&#8208;core&#8217; order in ignition, with concomitant change in burning rate,is therefore established. Herein, alkysilanes grafted onto cellulose fibers are pyrolyzed into non&#8208;flammable SiO2 terminating surface ignition propagation, hence stalling flame propagating. Sustaining high temperatures, however, triggers ignition in the bulk of the fibers but under restricted gas flow (oxidant and/or waste) hence significantly low rate of ignition propagation and pyrolysis compared to open flame (Li&#241;&#225;n's equation). This leads to inside&#8208;out thermal degradation and, with felicitous choice of conditions, formation of graphitic tubes. Given the temperature dependence, imbibing fibers with an exothermically oxidizing synthon (MnCl2) or a heat sink (KCl) abets or inhibits pyrolysis leading to tuneable wall thickness. We apply this approach to create magnetic, paramagnetic, or oxide containing carbon fibers. Given the surface sensitivity, we illustrate fabrication of nm&#8208; and &#956;m&#8208;diameter tubes from appropriately sized fibers.

         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimulus color&#8208;tunable afterglow polymeric system incorporating dynamic responsive spiropyran molecular conversion is reported. The amorphous copolymer exhibited obviously abundant and changeable multi&#8208;color afterglow emission from green to orange&#8208;red under different light stimulation and pH based on energy transfer. Lastly, this smart material is successfully employed in programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting field.







Abstract
The stimulus&#8208;responsive room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have endowed wide potential applications. In this work, by introducing naphthalene and spiropyran (SP) into polyacrylamide as the energy donor and acceptor respectively, a new kind of brilliant dynamic color&#8208;tunable amorphous copolymers were prepared with good stability and processibility, and afterglow emissions from green to orange in response to the stimulus of photo or acid, thanks to multi&#8208;responsibility of SP and the energy transfer between naphthalene and SP. In addition to the deeply exploring of the inherent mechanism, these copolymers have been successfully applied in dynamically controllable applications in information protection and delivery.

         <title>Magnetoresistance in Organic Spin Valves Based on Acid&#8208;Exfoliated 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid exfoliation strategy was employed to achieve covalent organic frameworks (COFs) films with excellent free&#8208;standing ability, which were then transferred onto La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 electrodes for the first attempt to fabricate organic spin valves (OSVs). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSVs based on COF materials demonstrated a magnetoresistance signal of &#8722;26.5&#8201;% at 30&#8197;K, indicating the exceptional spin transport potential of this class of materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a burgeoning class of crystalline porous materials, have made significant progress in their application to optoelectronic devices such as field&#8208;effect transistors, memristors, and photodetectors. However, the insoluble features of microcrystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF powders limit development of their thin film devices. Additionally, the exploration of spin transport properties in this category of &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton materials remains vacant thus far. Herein, an imine&#8208;linked 2D Py&#8208;Np COF nanocrystalline powder was synthesized by Schiff base condensation of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehyde. Then, we prepared a large&#8208;scale free&#8208;standing Py&#8208;Np COF film via a top&#8208;down strategy of chemically assisted acid exfoliation. Moreover, high&#8208;quality COF films acted as active layers were transferred onto ferromagnetic La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) electrodes for the first attempt to fabricate organic spin valves (OSVs) based on 2D COF materials. This COF&#8208;based OSV device with a configuration of LSMO/Py&#8208;Np COF/Co/Au demonstrated a remarkable magnetoresistance (MR) value up to &#8722;26.5&#8201;% at 30&#8197;K. Meanwhile, the MR behavior of the COF&#8208;based OSVs exhibited a highly temperature dependence and operational stability. This work highlights the enormous application prospects of 2D COFs in organic spintronics and provides a promising approach for developing electronic and spintronic devices based on acid&#8208;exfoliated COF thin films.

         <title>Improbable Rotaxanes Constructed From Surrogate Malonate Rotaxanes as Encircled Methylene Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surrogate malonate&#8208;based rotaxanes allow the construction of improbable rotaxanes, with the final dumbbell&#8208;shaped component assembled from two different stoppers and the only structure inherited from the malonate rotaxane being a methylene group. The syntheses of improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components demonstrate the practicality and generality of this approach.







Abstract
We have developed a new approach for the synthesis of &#8220;improbable&#8221; rotaxanes by using malonate&#8208;centered rotaxanes as interlocked surrogate precursors. Here, the desired dumbbell&#8208;shaped structure can be assembled from two different, completely separate, portions, with the only residual structure introduced from the malonate surrogate being a methylene group. We have synthesized improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components to demonstrate the potential structural flexibility and scope of the guest species that can be interlocked when using this approach.

A perylene diimide (PDI) S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst selectively cleaves the C&#8722;C bond of a lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Rigid polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) enhances organic solvent solubility and inhibits agglomeration of the PDI. Synergy between POSS and S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions enables efficient dispersion of POSS&#8208;PDI on a carbon nitride surface for better solar utilization and accelerated charge separation.







Abstract
3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PDI) is one of the best n&#8208;type organic semiconductors and an ideal light&#8208;driven catalyst for lignin depolymerization. However, the charge localization effect and the excessively strong intermolecular aggregation trend in PDI result in rapid electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8722;h+) recombination, which limits photocatalytic performance. Herein, polymeric carbon nitride/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane PDI (p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared by the solvent evaporation&#8208;deposition method for C&#8722;C bond selective cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Based on the material characterization results, the synergic role of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and S&#8208;scheme heterojunction maintains appropriate aggregation domains, achieves better solar light utilization, faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, and greater redox capacity. Notably, the 3&#8201;% p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI heterostructure exhibits a remarkable enhancement in cleavage conversion efficiency, achieving approximately 16.42 and 2.57 times higher conversion rates compared to polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane modified PDI (POSS&#8208;PDI) and polymeric carbon nitride (p&#8208;CN), respectively.

         <title>Construction of Negative Electrostatic Pore Environments in a Scalable, Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8208;organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>

Negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;303) are generated. The material gives benchmark one&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary mixtures, combining the unique and overall advantages of excellent separation performance, stability, low cost, green and easily scalable bulk synthesis.







Abstract
One&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary C2 mixtures by physisorbents remains a challenge to combine excellent separation performance with high stability, low cost, and easy scalability for industrial applications. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (MOF&#8208;303) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 separation. This material exhibits not only record high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes, but also top&#8208;tier C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities at ambient conditions. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that multiple N/O sites on pore channels can build a negative electro&#8208;environment to provide stronger interactions with C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance for ternary mixtures, affording one of the highest C2H4 productivity of 1.35&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. This material is highly stable and can be easily synthesized at kilogram&#8208;scale from cheap raw materials using a water&#8208;based green synthesis. The benchmark combination of excellent separation properties with high stability and low cost in scalable MOF&#8208;303 has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Oriented Design Based on Elementary Reactions (CODER) for Triarylamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst design strategy designated &#8220;catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER)&#8221; enabled the development of a Pd catalyst based on cyclopropane skeleton, which improves the efficiency of catalytic C&#8722;N coupling reaction by up to 3 orders of magnitude, and is expected to be applied to the efficient production of triarylamine optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
Recently, the application of computational tools to the rational design of catalysts has received considerable attention, but progress has been limited by the reliance on databases and because mechanistic data have been almost neglected. Herein, we report a new strategy for catalyst design, designated catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER), which fully utilizes mechanistic data, combines the strengths of computational tools and researcher experience. CODER enabled the development of extremely efficient Pd catalysts for C&#8722;N coupling, which markedly improved the efficiency of the synthesis of widely used triarylamine optoelectronic materials by enhancing the turnover numbers (up to 340000) to 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude towards literature values.

         <title>Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane and Propane over Copper&#8208;Containing Mordenite: Insights into Reaction Mechanism and Product Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite is capable of the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane to ethylene and propylene, respectively. The process requires lower temperature as compared to methane hydroxylation, which is associated with a different reaction mechanism. Produced olefins form highly stable complexes with copper(I) sites, realizing a product protection strategy and enabling high selectivity.







Abstract
Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite (CuMOR) is capable of activation of C&#8722;H bonds in C1&#8208;C3 alkanes, albeit there are remarkable differences between the functionalization of ethane and propane compared to methane. The reaction of ethane and propane with CuMOR results in the formation of ethylene and propylene, while the reaction of methane predominantly yields methanol and dimethyl ether. By combining in situ FTIR and MAS NMR spectroscopies as well as time&#8208;resolved Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the reaction mechanism was derived, which differs significantly for each alkane. The formation of ethylene and propylene proceeds via oxidative dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes with selectivity above 95&#8201;% for ethane and above 85&#8201;% for propane. The formation of stable &#960;&#8208;complexes of olefins with CuI sites, formed upon reduction of CuII&#8208;oxo species, protects olefins from further oxidation and/or oligomerization. This is different from methane, the activation of which proceeds via oxidative hydroxylation leading to the formation of surface methoxy species bonded to the zeolite framework. Our findings constitute one of the major steps in the direct conversion of alkanes to important commodities and open a novel research direction aiming at the selective synthesis of olefins.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

Molecular recognition of structural analogues in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy is achieved by inducing charge and geometry complementarity between 4&#8208;mercaptopyridine probe and chondroitin sulfate (CS) isomers. By &#8220;locking&#8221; each CS in a unique complex geometry via site&#8208;specific, multidentate interactions, our platform mimics molecular docking events to enable high spectral specificity and multiplex quantification.







Abstract
Molecular recognition of complex isomeric biomolecules remains challenging in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy due to their small Raman cross&#8208;sections and/or poor surface affinities. To date, the use of molecular probes has achieved excellent molecular sensitivities but still suffers from poor spectral specificity. Here, we induce &#8220;charge and geometry complementarity&#8221; between probe and analyte as a key strategy to achieve high spectral specificity for effective SERS molecular recognition of structural analogues. We employ 4&#8208;mercaptopyridine (MPY) as the probe, and chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharides with isomeric sulfation patterns as our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Our experimental and in silico studies reveal that &#8220;charge and geometry complementarity&#8221; between MPY's binding pocket and the CS sulfation patterns drives the formation of site&#8208;specific, multidentate interactions at the respective CS isomerism sites, which &#8220;locks&#8221; each CS in its analogue&#8208;specific complex geometry, akin to molecular docking events. Leveraging the resultant spectral fingerprints, we achieve &gt; 97&#8201;% classification accuracy for 4 CSs and 5 potential structural interferences, as well as attain multiplex CS quantification with &lt; 3&#8201;% prediction error. These insights could enable practical SERS differentiation of biologically important isomers to meet the burgeoning demand for fast&#8208;responding applications across various fields such as biodiagnostics, food and environmental surveillance.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling in Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difluoro&#8208;bicycloheptatriene has been trapped in cryogenic matrices and full spectroscopic characterization is reported. This is in stark contrast to the parent bicycloheptatriene, which remains elusive to this day. A heavy&#8208;atom tunneling rearrangement of the difluoro derivative to cycloheptatetraene is observed and calculations suggest that the lifetime of the parent bicycloheptatriene is too short to be detected in cryogenic matrices.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom tunneling limits the lifetime and observability of bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene, a key intermediate in the rearrangement of phenylcarbene. Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene had been proposed as the primary intermediate of the rearrangement of phenylcarbene, but despite many efforts evaded its characterization even in cryogenic matrices. By introducing fluorine substituents into the ortho&#8208;positions of the phenyl ring of phenylcarbene, the highly strained cyclopropene 1,5&#8208;difluorobicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene becomes stable enough to be characterized in argon matrices. However, even at 3&#8197;K this cyclopropene is only metastable and rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to the corresponding cycloheptatetraene. Calculations suggest that fluorination is necessary to slow down the tunneling rearrangement of the bicycloheptatriene. The parent bicycloheptatriene rapidly rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunneling and therefore cannot be detected under matrix isolation conditions.

         <title>Rapid, Selective Extraction of Silver from Complex Water Matrices with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/Oligomer Composite Constructed via Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable ScCO2&#8208;assisted method was developed as a new strategy to construct metal&#8211;organic framework/oligomer composites. One such composite, denoted as MIL&#8208;127/PoPD, was subsequently used for the extraction of silver ions from several highly complex matrices.







Abstract
Every year vast quantities of silver are lost in various waste streams; this, combined with its limited, diminishing supply and rising demand, makes silver recovery of increasing importance. Thus, herein, we report a controllable, green process to produce a host of highly porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/oligomer composites using supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO2) as a medium. One resulting composite, referred to as MIL&#8208;127/Poly&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine (PoPD), has an excellent Ag+ adsorption capacity, removal efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) and provides rapid Ag+ extraction in as little as 5&#8197;min from complex liquid matrices. Notably, the composite can also reduce sliver concentrations below the levels (&lt;0.1&#8197;ppm) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Using theoretical simulations, we find that there are spatially ordered polymeric units inside the MOF that promote the complexation of Ag+ over other common competing ions. Moreover, the oligomer is able to reduce silver to its metallic state, also providing antibacterial properties.

         <title>Varying the Stiffness and Diffusivity of Rod&#8208;Shaped Microgels Independently through Their Molecular Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, it is not yet fully understood how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of microgels and how this affects specific biomedical applications. We reveal how the architecture and molar mass of PEG precursor molecules affect fundamental properties of bulk PEG hydrogels and microgels, such as chemical crosslinking, stiffness and diffusion, as well as cell interaction.







Abstract
Microgels are water&#8208;swollen, crosslinked polymers that are widely used as colloidal building blocks in scaffold materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Microgels can be controlled in their stiffness, degree of swelling, and mesh size depending on their polymer architecture, crosslink density, and fabrication method&#8212;all of which influence their function and interaction with the environment. Currently, there is a lack of understanding of how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of soft microgels and how this morphology affects specific biomedical applications. In this report, we systematically vary the architecture and molar mass of polyethylene glycol&#8208;acrylate (PEG&#8208;Ac) precursors, as well as their concentration and combination, to gain insight in the different parameters that affect the internal structure of rod&#8208;shaped microgels. We characterize the mechanical properties and diffusivity, as well as the conversion of acrylate groups during photopolymerization, in both bulk hydrogels and microgels produced from the PEG&#8208;Ac precursors. Furthermore, we investigate cell&#8208;microgel interaction, and we observe improved cell spreading on microgels with more accessible RGD peptide and with a stiffness in a range of 20&#8197;kPa to 50&#8197;kPa lead to better cell growth.

         <title>FINDER: A Fluidly Confined CRISPR&#8208;Based DNA Reporter on Living Cell Membranes for Rapid and Sensitive Cancer Cell Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is of great significance. Herein, we developed a fluidly confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) on living cell membranes for rapid and sensitive cancer cells identification. The FINDER can rapidly identify target cancer cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieve over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells in clinical blood samples.







Abstract
The accurate, rapid, and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is significant in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the naturally confined enzymes on fluid cell membranes, a fluidly confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) was developed on living cell membranes, which was successfully applied for rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification in clinical blood samples. Benefiting from the spatial confinement effect for improved local concentration, and membrane fluidity for higher collision efficiency, the activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a was, for the first time, found to be significantly enhanced on living cell membranes. This new phenomenon was then combined with multiple aptamer&#8208;based DNA logic gate for cell recognition, thus a FINDER system capable of accurate, rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification was constructed. The FINDER rapidly identified target cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieved over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells presented in clinical blood samples, indicating its potential application in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering.

Inspired by the naturally confined enzymes on fluid cell membranes, a &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;luidly conf&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;ed CRISPR-based &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;NA report&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;er&lt;/span&gt; (FINDER) was developed on living cell membranes, which was successfully applied for rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification in clinical blood samples. Benefiting from the spatial confinement effect for improved local concentration, and membrane fluidity for higher collision efficiency, the activity of CRISPR-Cas12a was, for the first time, found to be significantly enhanced on living cell membranes. This new phenomenon was then combined with multiple aptamer-based DNA logic gate for cell recognition, thus a FINDER system capable of accurate, rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification was constructed. The FINDER rapidly identified target cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieved over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells presented in clinical blood samples, indicating its potential application in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Minimalist Design of Wireframe DNA Nanotubes: Tunable Geometry, Size, Chirality, and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalist design of robust DNA nanotubes from only 4 DNA strands, with tunable geometry, chirality, length, and assembly dynamics is reported. The method leads to robust nanotubes under physiologically relevant conditions, as cost&#8208;efficient nanomaterial templates or drug&#8208;delivery vehicles.







Abstract
DNA nanotubes (NTs) have attracted extensive interest as artificial cytoskeletons for biomedical, synthetic biology, and materials applications. Here, we report the modular design and assembly of a minimalist yet robust DNA wireframe nanotube with tunable cross&#8208;sectional geometry, cavity size, chirality, and length, while using only four DNA strands. We introduce an h&#8208;motif structure incorporating double&#8208;crossover (DX) tile&#8208;like DNA edges to achieve structural rigidity and provide efficient self&#8208;assembly of h&#8208;motif&#8208;based DNA nanotube (H&#8208;NT) units, thus producing programmable, micrometer&#8208;long nanotubes. We demonstrate control of the H&#8208;NT nanotube length via short DNA modulators. Finally, we use an enzyme, RNase H, to take these structures out of equilibrium and trigger nanotube assembly at a physiologically relevant temperature, underlining future cellular applications. The minimalist H&#8208;NTs can assemble at near&#8208;physiological salt conditions and will serve as an easily synthesized, DNA&#8208;economical modular template for biosensors, plasmonics, or other functional materials and as cost&#8208;efficient drug&#8208;delivery vehicles for biomedical applications.

         <title>Eutectic&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte with the Enhanced Lithium Salt Dissociation for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of eutectic&#8208;based solid polymer electrolyte is elaborately designed and prepared. The experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations confirm that the electrophilic succinonitrile (SN) interacts with poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA), which effectively promotes the dissociation of lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB), thus resulting in excellent comprehensive electrochemical performances.







Abstract
The deployment of lithium metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries with polymer electrolytes has been recognized as a promising approach to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density technologies. However, the practical application of the polymer electrolytes is currently constrained by various challenges, including low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrochemical window, and poor interface stability. To address these issues, a novel eutectic&#8208;based polymer electrolyte consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) is developed. The research results demonstrate that the interactions between SN and PEGMEA promote the dissociation of the lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) salt and increase the concentration of free Li+. The well&#8208;designed eutectic&#8208;based PAN1.2&#8208;SPE (PEGMEA: SN=1: 1.2 mass ratio) exhibits high ionic conductivity of 1.30&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C and superior interface stability with Li anode. The Li/Li symmetric cell based on PAN1.2&#8208;SPE enables long&#8208;term plating/stripping at 0.3 and 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Li/LiFePO4 cell achieves superior long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 80.3&#8201;% after 1500 cycles). Moreover, Li/LiFePO4 and Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 pouch cells employing PAN1.2&#8208;SPE demonstrate excellent cycling and safety characteristics. This study presents a new pathway for designing high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes and promotes the practical application of high&#8208;stable lithium metal batteries.

         <title>A Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Enhancing Curcumin&#8208;Based Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;exchange strategy is proposed to enhance the efficacy of curcumin for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. The strategy employs hollow mesoporous copper silicate nanoparticles to load Zn&#8208;curcumin, which can not only form a Cu&#8722;Cur complex with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect in arthritic area for anti&#8208;inflammation, but also promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts for bone tissue repair.







Abstract
Curcumin (Cur) has been clinically used for rheumatoid arthritis treatment by the means of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and immune microenvironment regulation. However, this compound has a poor water solubility and moderate antioxidative activity, favoring no further broadened application. Metal complexes of curcumin such as zinc&#8208;curcumin (Zn&#8722;Cur) features enhanced water solubilities, while copper&#8208;curcumin (Cu&#8722;Cur) shows a higher antioxidant activity but lower solubility than Zn&#8722;Cur. Based on their inherent biological properties, this work proposes a nanomedicine&#8208;based ion&#8208;exchange strategy to enhance the efficacy of Cur for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Copper silicate nanoparticles with hollow mesoporous structure were prepared to load water&#8208;soluble Zn&#8722;Cur for constructing a composite nanomedicine, which can degrade in acidic microenvironment of arthritic region, releasing Cu2+ and Zn&#8722;Cur. Cu2+ then substitute for Zn2+ in Zn&#8722;Cur to form Cu&#8722;Cur with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect, capable of efficiently scavenging ROS in M1 macrophages, promoting their transition to an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, the silicate released after nanocarrier degradation and the Zn2+ released after ion exchange reaction synergistically promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts. This work provides a new approach for enhancing the antiarthritic effect of Cur via an ion&#8208;exchange strategy.

         <title>Work&#8208;Function&#8208;Induced Interfacial Electron/Ion Transport in Carbon Hosts toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon fiber host with high work function was designed to promote electron transfer and surface Li+ diffusion, thus leading to uniform dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition on the fiber scaffold. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibited high reversibility and long&#8208;term cycling stability (EVac: vacuum level; Ef : Fermi level; EVBM: maximum valence&#8208;band energy level; ECBM: minimum conduction&#8208;band energy level).







Abstract
Coupled electron/ion transport is a decisive feature of Li plating/stripping, wherein the compatibility of electron/ion transport rates determines the morphology of deposited Li. Local Li+ hotspots form due to inhomogeneous interfacial charge transfer and lead to uncontrolled Li deposition, which decreases the Li utilization rate and safety of Li metal anodes. Herein, we report a method to obtain dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes by driving electron pumping and accumulating and boosting Li ion diffusion by tuning the work function of a carbon host using cobalt&#8208;containing catalysts. The results reveal that increasing the work function provides an electron deviation from C to Co, and electron&#8208;rich Co shows favorable binding to Li+. The Co catalysts boost Li+ diffusion on the carbon fiber scaffolds without local aggregation by reducing the Li+ migration barrier. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99.0&#8201;%, a cycle life of over 2000&#8197;h, a Li utilization rate of 50&#8201;%, and a capacity retention of 83.4&#8201;% after 130 cycles in pouch cells at a negative/positive capacity ratio of 2.5. These findings provide a novel strategy to stabilize Li metal by regulating the work function of materials using electrocatalysts.

The as-obtained dendrite-free Li metal anode exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99.0&#8201;%, a cycle life of over 2000&#8197;h, a Li utilization rate of 50&#8201;%, and a capacity retention of 83.4&#8201;% after 130 cycles in pouch cells at a negative/positive capacity ratio of 2.5. These findings provide a novel strategy to stabilize Li metal by regulating the work function of materials using electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interphasial Pre&#8208;lithiation and Reinforcement of Micro&#8208;Si Anode through Fluorine&#8208;free Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bi&#8208;functional fluorine&#8208;free electrolyte was specifically designed for the micro&#8208;Si anodes. Benefiting from pre&#8208;lithiation of the native SiOx, limited accumulation of LiF&#8208;free interphase with high modulus and fast interphasial kinetics, the optimized micro&#8208;Si anode (&gt;5 mAh/cm2) exhibits exceptional performance, which can be comparable to the best one reported for a particular fluorinated electrolyte.







Abstract
Micro&#8208;sized silicon (mSi) anodes offer advantages in cost and tap density over nanosized counterparts. However, its practical application still suffers from poor cyclability and low initial and later&#8208;cycle coulombic efficiency (CE), caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and irreversible lithiation of the surface oxide layer. Herein, a bifunctional fluorine (F)&#8208;free electrolyte was designed for the mSi anode to stabilize the interphase and improve the CE. A combined analysis revealed that this electrolyte can chemically pre&#8208;lithiate the native oxide layer by the reductive LiBH4, and relieve SEI formation and accumulation to preserve the internal conductive network. The significance of this F&#8208;free electrolyte brings unprecedented F&#8208;free interphase that also enables the high&#8208;performance mSi electrode (80&#8197;wt&#8201;% mSi), including high specific capacity of 2900&#8197;mAh/g, high initial CE of 94.7&#8201;% and excellent cyclability capacity retention of 94.3&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C. This work confirms the feasibility of F&#8208;free interphase, thus opening up a new avenue toward cost&#8208;advantaged and environmentally friendly electrolytes for more emerging battery systems.

         <title>Spleen SORT LNP Generated in situ CAR T Cells Extend Survival in a Mouse Model of Lymphoreplete B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spleen Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) transfected splenic T cells after intravenous administration without active targeting ligands to generate in situ Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells. In situ generated CAR T cells increased survival and reduced tumor liver metastasis by increasing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a lymphoreplete B cell lymphoma model.







Abstract
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy is revolutionizing treatment for patients suffering from B&#8208;cell lymphoma (BL). However, the current method of CAR T cell production is complicated and expensive, requiring collection of patient blood to enrich the T cell population, ex vivo engineering/activation, and quality assessment before the patient can receive the treatment. Herein we leverage Spleen Selective ORgan Targeted (SORT) Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) to produce CAR T cells in situ and bypass the extensive and laborious process currently used. Optimized Spleen SORT LNPs containing 10&#8201;% 18&#8201;:&#8201;1 PA transfected CD3+, CD8+, and CD4+ T cells in wild&#8208;type mice. Spleen SORT LNPs delivered Cre recombinase mRNA and CAR encoding mRNA to T cells in reporter mice and in a lymphoreplete B cell lymphoma model (respectively) after intravenous injection without the need for active targeting ligands. Moreover, in situ CAR T cells increased the overall survival of mice with a less aggressive form of B cell lymphoma. In addition, in situ transfected CAR T cells reduced tumor metastasis to the liver by increasing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Overall, these results offer a promising alternative method for CAR T cell production with pre&#8208;clinical potential to treat hematological malignancies.

         <title>Wetting vs Droplet Aggregation: A Broadband Rotational Spectroscopic Study of 3&#8208;Methylcatechol&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Water Clusters</title>

How does microsolvation occur in 3&#8208;methylcatechol? Wetting or droplet aggregation? Using a combination of rotational spectroscopic and computational techniques, we discover an unexpected hydration pathway by following the solvation process one water molecule at a time.







Abstract
Two competing solvation pathways of 3&#8208;methylcatechol (MC), an atmospherically relevant aromatic molecule, with up to five water molecules were explored in detail by using a combination of broadband rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Theoretically, two different pathways of solvation emerge: the commonly observed droplet pathway which involves preferential binding among the water molecules while the solute serves as an anchor point for the formation of a water cluster, and an unexpected wetting pathway which involves interactions between the water molecules and the aromatic face of MC, i.e., a wetting of the &#960;&#8208;surface. Conclusive identification of the MC hydrate structures, and therefore the wetting pathway, was facilitated by rotational spectra of the parent MC hydrates and several H218O and 13C isotopologues which exhibit splittings associated with methyl internal rotation and/or water tunneling motions. Theoretical modelling and analyses offer insights into the tunneling and conversion barriers associated with the observed hydrate conformers and the nature of the non&#8208;covalent interactions involved in choosing the unusual wetting pathway.

         <title>Sulfur Changes the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Pathway over Cu Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

S atoms adsorbed on metallic Cu surfaces can significantly inhibit CO2 reduction to CO while promoting formate formation in the electrochemical reduction of CO2.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals or fuels offers a promising approach to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely reported as capable of reducing CO2 to produce a variety of multicarbon products (e.g., ethylene and ethanol). In this work, we develop sulfur&#8208;doped Cu2O electrocatalysts, which instead can electrochemically reduce CO2 to almost exclusively formate. We show that a dynamic equilibrium of S exists at the Cu2O&#8208;electrolyte interface, and S&#8208;doped Cu2O undergoes in situ surface reconstruction to generate active S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu sites during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu surface can not only promote the formation of the *OCHO intermediate but also greatly suppress *H and *COOH adsorption, thus facilitating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion during the electrochemical CO2RR.

         <title>Unravelling the Molecular Structure and Confining Environment of an Organometallic Catalyst Heterogenized within Amorphous Porous Polymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural elucidation of active sites in amorphous host materials is demonstrated by combining cutting&#8208;edge NMR techniques with pair distribution function analysis and computational chemistry. The detailed structure of the heterogenized organometallic complex and its confinement within two amorphous porous organic polymers is revealed by computation and confirmed by dedicated NMR techniques.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of multifunctional, microporous materials is directly linked to the spatial arrangement of their structural building blocks. Despite great achievements in the design and incorporation of isolated catalytically active metal complexes within such materials, a detailed understanding of their atomic&#8208;level structure and the local environment of the active species remains a fundamental challenge, especially when these latter are hosted in non&#8208;crystalline organic polymers. Here, we show that by combining computational chemistry with pair distribution function analysis, 129Xe NMR, and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization enhanced NMR spectroscopy, a very accurate description of the molecular structure and confining surroundings of a catalytically active Rh&#8208;based organometallic complex incorporated inside the cavity of amorphous bipyridine&#8208;based porous polymers is obtained. Small, but significant, differences in the structural properties of the polymers are highlighted depending on their backbone motifs.

&lt;p&gt;Structural elucidation of active sites in amorphous host materials is demonstrated by combining cutting-edge NMR techniques with pair distribution function analysis and computational chemistry. The detailed structure of the heterogenized organometallic complex and its confinement within two amorphous porous organic polymers is revealed by computation and confirmed by dedicated NMR techniques.

         <title>Sabatier Relations in Electrocatalysts Based on High&#8208;entropy Alloys with Wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band Centers for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is enabled by a high&#8208;entropy strategy to achieve wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band centers. The typical volcano&#8208;type correlation of d&#8208;band center and catalytic activity as demonstrated by the Sabatier principle has been observed. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle for designing LOB catalysts and provides insights into adjusting d&#8208;band centers in wide range.







Abstract
Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is a promising &#8220;beyond Li&#8208;ion&#8221; technology with ultrahigh theoretical energy density (3457&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1), while currently impeded by the sluggish cathodic kinetics of the reversible gas&#8208;solid reaction between O2 and Li2O2. Despite many catalysts are developed for accelerating the conversion process, the lack of design guidance for achieving high performance makes catalysts exploring aleatory. The Sabatier principle is an acknowledged theory connecting the scaling relationship with heterogeneous catalytic activity, providing a tradeoff strategy for the topmost performance. Herein, a series of catalysts with wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band centers (i.e., wide range of adsorption strength) are elaborately constructed via high&#8208;entropy strategy, enabling an in&#8208;depth study of the Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for LOBs. A volcano&#8208;type correlation of d&#8208;band center and catalytic activity emerges. Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that a moderate d&#8208;band center with appropriate adsorption strength propels the catalysts up to the top. As a demonstration of concept, the LOB using FeCoNiMnPtIr as catalyst provides an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of over 80&#8201;%, and works steadily for 2000&#8197;h with a high fixed specific capacity of 4000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle as a guidance for designing advanced heterogeneous catalysts assembled in LOBs.

         <title>Modular and Practical 1,2&#8208;Aryl(Alkenyl) Heteroatom Functionalization of Alkenes through Iron/Photoredox Dual Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system has been developed for efficient synthesis of 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores with high site selectivity. The excellent functional group compatibility, scalability, use of readily available starting materials, and application to late&#8208;stage functionalization underscore the potential protocol's utility in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research.







Abstract
Efficient methods for synthesizing 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores, encompassing heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and halogens, are of significant importance in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research. In this study, we present a mild, versatile and practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system that enables access to highly privileged 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic pharmacophores with exceptional efficiency and site selectivity. Our approach exhibits an extensive scope, allowing for the direct utilization of a wide range of commodity or commercially available (hetero)arenes as well as activated and unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups, drug scaffolds, and natural product motifs as substrates. By merging iron catalysis with the photoredox cycle, a vast array of alkene 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) functionalization products that incorporate a neighboring azido, amino, halo, thiocyano and nitrooxy group were secured. The scalability and ability to rapid synthesize numerous bioactive small molecules from readily available starting materials highlight the utility of this protocol.

         <title>Schiff Base Reaction in a Living Cell: In Situ Synthesis of a Hollow Covalent Organic Polymer To Regulate Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Schiff base reaction has been artificially conducted in living cells and enabled the in situ synthesis of a hollow covalent organic polymer (HCOP) that inhibited the polymerization of actin filaments and consequently induced mitochondrial deactivation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The proposed intracellular synthesis approach may provide an efficient strategy to regulate cellular behavior and biological functions.







Abstract
Artificially performing chemical reactions in living biosystems to attain various physiological aims remains an intriguing but very challenging task. In this study, the Schiff base reaction was conducted in cells using Sc(OTf)3 as a catalyst, enabling the in situ synthesis of a hollow covalent organic polymer (HCOP) without external stimuli. The reversible Schiff base reaction mediated intracellular Oswald ripening endows the HCOP with a spherical, hollow porous structure and a large specific surface area. The intracellularly generated HCOP reduced cellular motility by restraining actin polymerization, which consequently induced mitochondrial deactivation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The presented intracellular synthesis system inspired by the Schiff base reaction has strong potential to regulate cell fate and biological functions, opening up a new strategic possibility for intervening in cellular behavior.

         <title>Lithium Bis(oxalate)borate Additive for Self&#8208;repairing Zincophilic Solid Electrolyte Interphases towards Ultrahigh&#8208;rate and Ultra&#8208;stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the environment&#8208;patrolling behavior of biological dendrite cells for pathogen inactivation, a dynamic patrolling system targeted to cycling&#8208;induced defects of solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) is proposed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable, high&#8208;rate Zn anodes. Owing to the self&#8208;repairing feature of zincophilic SEI empowered by lithium bis(oxalate)borate additive, Zn anode presents an impressive lifespan up to 1800&#8197;h at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, attaining a fabulous cumulative capacity of 45&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a pivotal role in Zn anode stabilization but its long&#8208;term effectiveness at high rates is still challenged. Herein, to achieve superior long&#8208;life and high&#8208;rate Zn anode, an exquisite electrolyte additive, lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB), is proposed to in situ derive a highly Zn2+&#8208;conductive SEI and to dynamically patrol its cycling&#8208;initiated defects. Profiting from the as&#8208;constructed real&#8208;time, automatic SEI repairing mechanism, the Zn anode can be cycled with distinct reversibility over 1800&#8197;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, presenting a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity up to 45&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The superiority of the formulated electrolyte is further demonstrated in the Zn||MnO2 and Zn||NaV3O8 full batteries, even when tested under harsh conditions (limited Zn supply (N/P&#8776;3), 2500&#8197;cycles). This work brings inspiration for developing fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries toward grid&#8208;scale storage of renewable energy sources.

The superiority of the formulated electrolyte is further demonstrated in the Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn||NaV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; full batteries, even when tested under harsh conditions (limited Zn supply (N/P&#8776;3), 2500&#8197;cycles). This work brings inspiration for developing fast-charging Zn batteries toward grid-scale storage of renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobaloxime&#8208;Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Coupled with Alcohol Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
An azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks is developed for achieving the enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in alcohol&#8208;containing solutions without any sacrificial agent.







Abstract
We report an azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF photocatalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alcohol&#8208;containing solution with no presence of a typical sacrificial agent. The best performing cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF hybrid catalyzes hydrogen production with an average HER rate up to 38&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 in ethanol/phosphate buffer solution under 4&#8197;h illumination. Ultrafast transient optical spectroscopy characterizations and charge carrier analysis reveal that the alcohol contents functioning as hole scavengers could be oxidized by the photogenerated holes of COFs to form aldehydes and protons. The consumption of the photogenerated holes thus suppresses exciton recombination of COFs and improves the ratio of free electrons that were effectively utilized to drive catalytic reaction for HER. This work demonstrates a great potential of COF&#8208;catalyzed HER using alcohol solvents as hole scavengers and provides an example toward realizing the accessibility to the scope of reaction conditions and a greener route for energy conversion.

         <title>Boosting the Proton&#8208;coupled Electron Transfer via Fe&#8722;P Atomic Pair for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS, operando XAFS measurements, and DFT calculations revealed that Fe1&#8208;P/NG accelerated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process of CO2 electroreduction by promoting the dissociation of water over the P sites.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO catalytic activity, but poor kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps still limit the overall performance toward the industrial scale. Here, we constructed a Fe&#8722;P atom paired catalyst onto nitrogen doped graphitic layer (Fe1/PNG) to accelerate PCET step. Fe1/PNG delivers an industrial CO current of 1&#8197;A with FECO over 90&#8201;% at 2.5&#8197;V in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly, overperforming the CO current of Fe1/NG by more than 300&#8201;%. We also decrypted the synergistic effects of the P atom in the Fe&#8722;P atom pair using operando techniques and density functional theory, revealing that the P atom provides additional adsorption sites for accelerating water dissociation, boosting the hydrogenation of CO2, and enhancing the activity of CO2 reduction. This atom&#8208;pair catalytic strategy can modulate multiple reactants and intermediates to break through the inherent limitations of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Bromine&#8208;Enhanced Generation and Epoxidation of Ethylene in Tandem CO2 Electrolysis Towards Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy was developed to facilitate both C2H4 epoxidation to ethylene oxide (EO) and CO2 reduction to C2H4 for improved tandem electrosynthesis of EO from CO2 and water. Single&#8208;atom Pt anchored on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) with a high atomic utilization and Br&#8722;&#8208;bearing porous Cu2O with stable Cu+ species served as highly efficient anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively.







Abstract
The indirect electro&#8208;epoxidation of ethylene (C2H4), produced from CO2 electroreduction (CO2R), holds immense promise for CO2 upcycling to valuable ethylene oxide (EO). However, this process currently has a mediocre Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to sluggish formation and rapid dissociation of active species, as well as reductive deactivation of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts during the conversion of C2H4 to EO and CO2 to C2H4, respectively. Herein, we report a bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy designed to concurrently promote both C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversions, thereby improving EO generation, using single&#8208;atom Pt on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) and Br&#8722;&#8208;bearing porous Cu2O as anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively. Physicochemical characterizations including synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption, operando infrared spectroscopy, and quasi in situ Raman spectroscopy/electron paramagnetic resonance with theoretical calculations reveal that the favorable Br2/HBrO generation over Pt1/NCNT with optimal intermediate binding facilitates C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion with a high FE of 92.2&#8201;%, and concomitantly, the Br&#8722; with strong nucleophilicity protects active Cu+ species in Cu2O effectively for improved CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with a FE of 66.9&#8201;% at 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to those in the traditional chloride&#8208;mediated case. Consequently, a single&#8208;pass FE as high as 41.1&#8201;% for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion can be achieved in a tandem system.

         <title>BiBr3&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Prins Cyclization of Aza&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement Products: Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Suaveoline and Sarpagine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed to construct the versatile 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;ABN) ring system with a variety of substitution patterns and then applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of six suaveoline and sarpagine alkaloids: macrophylline, suaveoline, norsuaveoline, affinisine, normacusine B and Na&#8208;Me&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine.







Abstract
An intramolecular aza&#8208;Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed in which bismuth tribromide (BiBr3) plays a dual role as an efficient Lewis acid and source of the bromide nucleophile. This approach enables the facile construction of highly functionalized 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes (9&#8208;ABNs), which are valuable synthetic building blocks and a powerful platform for the synthesis of a variety of alkaloid natural products and drug molecules. Suitable substrates for the aza&#8208;Prins cyclization include 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, alkynes, and allenes, with good to excellent yields observed. Finally, we showcase the application of this new approach to the enantioselective total synthesis of six indole alkaloids: (&#8722;)&#8208;suaveoline (1), (&#8722;)&#8208;norsuaveoline (2), (&#8722;)&#8208;macrophylline (3), (+)&#8208;normacusine B (4), (+)&#8208;Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine (5) and (+)&#8208;affinisine (6) in a total of 9&#8211;14&#8197;steps. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of the aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement, and the strategy (aza&#8208;Achmatowicz/aza&#8208;Prins) is expected to be applicable to the total synthesis of other members of the big family of macroline and sarpagine indole alkaloids.

     alt="BiBr3-Mediated Intramolecular Aza-Prins Cyclization of Aza-Achmatowicz Rearrangement Products: Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Suaveoline and Sarpagine Alkaloids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intramolecular Prins cyclization of aza-Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed to construct the versatile 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-ABN) ring system with a variety of substitution patterns and then applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of six suaveoline and sarpagine alkaloids: macrophylline, suaveoline, norsuaveoline, affinisine, normacusine B and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-Me-16-epipericyclivine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intramolecular aza-Prins cyclization of aza-Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed in which bismuth tribromide (BiBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) plays a dual role as an efficient Lewis acid and source of the bromide nucleophile. This approach enables the facile construction of highly functionalized 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes (9-ABNs), which are valuable synthetic building blocks and a powerful platform for the synthesis of a variety of alkaloid natural products and drug molecules. Suitable substrates for the aza-Prins cyclization include 1,1-disubstituted alkenes, 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, alkynes, and allenes, with good to excellent yields observed. Finally, we showcase the application of this new approach to the enantioselective total synthesis of six indole alkaloids: (&#8722;)-suaveoline (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), (&#8722;)-norsuaveoline (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), (&#8722;)-macrophylline (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), (+)-normacusine B (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), (+)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-methyl-16-epipericyclivine (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) and (+)-affinisine (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) in a total of 9&#8211;14&#8197;steps. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of the aza-Achmatowicz rearrangement, and the strategy (aza-Achmatowicz/aza-Prins) is expected to be applicable to the total synthesis of other members of the big family of macroline and sarpagine indole alkaloids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pb&#8208;Modified Ultrathin RuCu Nanoflowers for Active, Stable, and CO&#8208;resistant Alkaline Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of ultrathin RuCu nanoflowers with Pb can modulate the adsorption abilities to *H, *OH, and *CO, thereby significantly promoting alkaline hydrogen oxidation catalysis. Consequently, the mass activity and specific activity of Pb1.04&#8208;RuCu NFs/C are &#8776;10 and &#8776;31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively.







Abstract
CO poisoning of Pt group metal (PGM) catalysts is a chronic problem for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), the anodic reaction of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) for converting H2 to electric energy in sustainable manner. We demonstrate here an ultrathin Ru&#8208;based nanoflower modified with Pb (PbRuCu NF) as an active, stable, and CO&#8208;resistant catalyst for alkaline HOR. Mechanism studies show that the presence of Pb can weaken the adsorption of *H, strengthen *OH adsorption to facilitate CO oxidation, as a result of significantly enhanced HOR activity and improved CO tolerance. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) suggests that Pb acts as oxygen&#8208;rich site to regulate the behavior of the linear CO adsorption. The optimized Pb1.04&#8208;Ru92Cu8/C displays a mass activity and specific activity of 1.10&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 and 5.55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which are &#8776;10 and &#8776;31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. This work provides a facile strategy for the design of Ru&#8208;based catalyst with high activity and strong CO&#8208;resistance for alkaline HOR, which may promote the fundamental researches on the rational design of functional catalysts.

         <title>Intrinsic Stress&#8208;strain in Barium Titanate Piezocatalysts Enabling Lithium&#8722;Oxygen Batteries with Low Overpotential and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic stress&#8208;assisted catalysis concept established provides an effective, practical strategy for accelerating the commercial application of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Benefiting from the piezopotential as the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers and the redox reaction kinetics, the intrinsic stress&#8208;strain assisted Li&#8722;O2 batteries can cycle steadily for 2200&#8197;h with a low overpotential.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries with high theoretical energy density are considered as promising candidates for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, whereas their commercial application is hindered due to poor cyclic stability caused by the sluggish kinetics and cathode passivation. Herein, the intrinsic stress originated from the growth and decomposition of the discharge product (lithium peroxide, Li2O2) is employed as a microscopic pressure resource to induce the built&#8208;in electric field, further improving the reaction kinetics and interfacial Lithium ion (Li+) transport during cycling. Piezopotential caused by the intrinsic stress&#8208;strain of solid Li2O2 is capable of providing the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers, enhancing the Li+ transfer, and thus improving the redox reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Combined with a variety of in situ characterizations, the catalytic mechanism of barium titanate (BTO), a typical piezoelectric material, was systematically investigated, and the effect of stress&#8208;strain transformation on the electrochemical reaction kinetics and Li+ interface transport for the Li&#8722;O2 batteries is clearly established. The findings provide deep insight into the surface coupling strategy between intrinsic stress and electric fields to regulate the electrochemical reaction kinetics behavior and enhance the interfacial Li+ transport for battery system.

         <title>Electrochemical NiH&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling of Alkyl Halides and Alkyl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general protocol for electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed Csp3&#8722;Csp3 coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes has been established, providing tunable linear and branched products. Alkyl halides perform dual function as both coupling substrates and hydrogen sources in this reaction. Excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope can be extended to late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecular structures.







Abstract
Herein, an electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes for the construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds is firstly reported. Notably, alkyl halides serve dual function as coupling substrates and as hydrogen sources to generate NiH species under electrochemical conditions. The tunable nature of this reaction is realized by introducing an intramolecular coordinating group to the substrate, where the product can be easily adjusted to give the desired branched products. The method proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits a broad substrate scope, and affords moderate to excellent yields with over 70 examples, including late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug derivatives. Mechanistic insights offer evidence for an electrochemically driven coupling process. The sp3&#8208;carbon&#8208;halogen bonds can be activated through single electron transfer (SET) by the nickel catalyst in its low valence state, generated by cathodic reduction, and the generation of NiH species from alkyl halides is pivotal to this transformation.

         <title>Relative Local Electron Density Tuning in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy for the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron density of monomers based on three covalent organic frameworks. And, the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1 exhibited excellent activities for CO2 photoreduction, higher than VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the electron&#8208;deficient unit, electron&#8208;rich unit, and efficient charge transfer channel.







Abstract
The high local electron density and efficient charge carrier separation are two important factors to affect photocatalytic activity, especially for the CO2 photoreduction reaction. However, the systematic studies on the structure&#8208;functional relationship regarding the above two factors based on precisely structure model are rarely reported. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a new strategy on the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron&#8208;deficient (ED) and electron&#8208;rich (ER) intensity of monomer at a molecular level based on three rational&#8208;designed vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As expected, the as&#8208;prepared vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOFs) (VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1) with molecular junction exhibited excellent activities for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion (283.41&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high selectivity of 97.1&#8201;%, much higher than the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the multi&#8208;electronic metal clusters (Cu3(PyCA)3) (PyCA=pyrazolate&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde) as strong ER roles and cyanopyridine units as ED roles and active sites, as well as the boosted photo&#8208;induced charge separation efficiency of vinyl connection and increased light utilization ability. These results not only provide a strategy for regulating the electron&#8208;density distribution of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also offers profound insights for metal clusters&#8208;based COFs to effective CO2 conversion.

     alt="Relative Local Electron Density Tuning in Metal-Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a strategy for the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron density of monomers based on three covalent organic frameworks. And, the VL-MCOF-1 exhibited excellent activities for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction, higher than VL-MCOF-2 and g-C&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the electron-deficient unit, electron-rich unit, and efficient charge transfer channel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high local electron density and efficient charge carrier separation are two important factors to affect photocatalytic activity, especially for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction reaction. However, the systematic studies on the structure-functional relationship regarding the above two factors based on precisely structure model are rarely reported. Herein, as a proof-of-concept, we developed a new strategy on the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron-deficient (ED) and electron-rich (ER) intensity of monomer at a molecular level based on three rational-designed vinylene-linked sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon-covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As expected, the as-prepared vinylene-linked sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon-conjugated metal-covalent organic framework (MCOFs) (VL-MCOF-1) with molecular junction exhibited excellent activities for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-HCOOH conversion (283.41&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high selectivity of 97.1&#8201;%, much higher than the VL-MCOF-2 and g-C&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the multi-electronic metal clusters (Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PyCA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (PyCA=pyrazolate-4-carboxaldehyde) as strong ER roles and cyanopyridine units as ED roles and active sites, as well as the boosted photo-induced charge separation efficiency of vinyl connection and increased light utilization ability. These results not only provide a strategy for regulating the electron-density distribution of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also offers profound insights for metal clusters-based COFs to effective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A thin&#8208;layer approach is presented to bypass the area&#8208;volume restrictions of traditional electrolysis cells and perform minute&#8208;scale electrolysis reactions. Parallel electrolysis reactions, using multiple thin&#8208;layer electrodes (TLE), facilitate the design and study of electrosynthesis reactions. Hosting a microelectrode in the TLE provides an advanced tool for combining electroanalytical and electrosynthetic reactions.







Abstract
Electrochemistry represents unique approaches for the promotion and mechanistic study of chemical reactions and has garnered increasing attention in different areas of chemistry. This expansion necessitates the enhancement of the traditional electrochemical cells that are intrinsically constrained by mass transport limitations. Herein, we present an approach for designing an electrochemical cell by limiting the reaction chamber to a thin layer of solution, comparable to the thickness of the diffusion layer. This thin layer electrode (TLE) provides a modular platform to bypass the constraints of traditional electrolysis cells and perform electrolysis reactions in the timescale of electroanalytical techniques. The utility of the TLE for electrosynthetic applications benchmarked using NHPI&#8208;mediated electrochemical C&#8722;H functionalization. The application of microscale electrolysis for the study of drug metabolites was showcased by elucidating the oxidation pathways of the paracetamol drug. Moreover, hosting a microelectrode in the TLE, was shown to enable real&#8208;time probing of the profiles of redox&#8208;active components of these rapid electrosynthesis reactions.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced Assembly of Copper Nanoclusters with Enhanced Electrochemical Excitation and Radiative Transition for Electrochemiluminescence
</title>

         <dc:description>
Transforming disordered aggregates to ordered assemblies lights up electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of CuNCs. A self&#8208;assembly strategy was adopted to promote the electrochemcial excitation and radiative transition, allowing efficient enhancement of the electrochemiluminescence (ECL). This work proposes a simple and effective way to improve the inherent ECL performance of metal NCs for bioassays and clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are emerging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters with unique molecule&#8208;like electronic structures, high abundance, and low cost. However, the synthesis of CuNCs with high ECL efficiency and stability in a scalable manner remains challenging. Here, we report a facile gram&#8208;scale approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled CuNCs (CuNCsAssy) induced by ligands with exceptionally boosted anodic ECL and stability. Compared to the disordered aggregates that are inactive in ECL, the CuNCsAssy shows a record anodic ECL efficiency for CuNCs (10&#8201;%, wavelength&#8208;corrected, relative to Ru(bpy)3Cl2/tripropylamine). Mechanism studies revealed the unusual dual functions of ligands in simultaneously facilitating electrochemical excitation and radiative transition. Moreover, the assembly addressed the limitation of poor stability of conventional CuNCs. As a proof of concept, an ECL biosensor for alkaline phosphatase detection was successfully constructed with an ultralow limit of detection of 8.1&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;U/L.

         <title>Photo&#8208;thermal Cooperative Carbonylation of Ethanol with CO2 on Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbonylation of ethanol with CO2 as carbonyl source has been achieved via photo&#8208;thermal cooperation on an interfacial site and oxygen vacancy, which are both abundant in SrTiCuO3&#8208;x supported Cu2O. The oxygen vacancies facilitate the thermal dissociation of alcoholic O&#8722;H bond, providing not only the carbonyl counterpart but also the active *H for photo&#8208;catalysis of CO2 to reactive CO on Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x interfacial sites. A production of up to 320&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethyl formate with a selectivity of 86&#8201;% has been afforded.







Abstract
Carbonylation of ethanol with CO2 as carbonyl source into value&#8208;added esters is of considerable significance and interest, while remains of great challenge due to the harsh conditions for activation of inert CO2 in that the harsh conditions result in undesired activation of &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H and even cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in ethanol to deteriorate the specific activation of O&#8722;H bond. Herein, we propose a photo&#8208;thermal cooperative strategy for carbonylation of ethanol with CO2, in which CO2 is activated to reactive CO via photo&#8208;catalysis with the assistance of *H from thermally&#8208;catalyzed dissociation of alcoholic O&#8722;H bond. To achieve this proposal, an interfacial site and oxygen vacancy both abundant SrTiCuO3&#8208;x supported Cu2O (Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x) has been designed. A production of up to 320&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethyl formate with a selectivity of 85.6&#8201;% to targeted alcoholic O&#8722;H activation has been afforded in photo&#8208;thermal assisted gas&#8208;solid process under 3.29&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1 of UV/Vis light irradiation (144&#8201;&#176;C) and 0.2&#8197;MPa CO2. In the photo&#8208;driven activation of CO2 and following carbonylation, CO2 activation energy decreases to 12.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and the cleavage of alcoholic &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond has been suppressed.

         <title>Proton Shuttling by Polyaniline of High Br&#248;nsted Basicity for Improved Electrocatalytic Ethylene Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand how the Br&#248;nsted basicity of amines at the Cu/polymer interface enables to modulate the reaction pathway, PPy/Cu and PANI/Cu interfaces were successfully synthesized through an in situ electrochemical reconstruction approach. It was found that the neutral &#8208;NH&#8208; moieties in PPy enabled to afford a high CH4 selectivity, while the more basic benzenoid &#8208;NH&#8208; in PANI significantly promoted C2H4 production.







Abstract
Hybrid organic/inorganic composites with the organic phase tailored to modulate local chemical environment at the Cu surface arise as an enchanting category of catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A fundamental understanding on how the organics of different functionality, polarity, and hydrophobicity affect the reaction path is, however, still lacking to guide rational catalyst design.

     alt="Proton Shuttling by Polyaniline of High Br&#248;nsted Basicity for Improved Electrocatalytic Ethylene Production from CO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how the Br&#248;nsted basicity of amines at the Cu/polymer interface enables to modulate the reaction pathway, PPy/Cu and PANI/Cu interfaces were successfully synthesized through an &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; electrochemical reconstruction approach. It was found that the neutral -NH- moieties in PPy enabled to afford a high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity, while the more basic benzenoid -NH- in PANI significantly promoted C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid organic/inorganic composites with the organic phase tailored to modulate local chemical environment at the Cu surface arise as an enchanting category of catalysts for electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). A fundamental understanding on how the organics of different functionality, polarity, and hydrophobicity affect the reaction path is, however, still lacking to guide rational catalyst design. Herein, polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) manifesting different Br&#248;nsted basicity are compared for their regulatory roles on the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR pathways regarding *CO coverage, proton source and interfacial polarity. Concerted efforts from &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; IR, Raman and &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; modelling unveil that at the PPy/Cu interface with limited *CO coverage, hydridic *H produced by the Volmer step favors the carbon hydrogenation of *CO to form *CHO through a Tafel process; Whereas at the PANI/Cu interface with concentrated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and high *CO coverage, protonic H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; shuttled through the benzenoid -NH- protonates the oxygen of *CO, yielding *COH for asymmetric coupling with nearby *CO to form *OCCOH under favored energetics. As a result of the tailored chemical environment, the restructured PANI/Cu composite demonstrates a high partial current density of 0.41&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a maximal Faraday efficiency of 67.5&#8201;% for ethylene production, ranking among states of the art.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Golgi&#8208;Targeted Platinum Complex Plays a Dual Role in Autophagy Regulation for Highly Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum(II) complex can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk, resulting in complete elimination of tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo.







Abstract
Regulating autophagy to control the homeostatic recycling process of cancer cells is a promising anticancer strategy. Golgi apparatus is a substrate of autophagy but the Golgi&#8208;autophagy (Golgiphagy) mediated antitumor pathway is rarely reported. Herein, we have developed a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum (II) complex Pt3, which is ca. 20 times more cytotoxic to lung carcinoma than cisplatin and can completely eliminate tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo. Its nano&#8208;encapsulated system for tail vein administration also features a good anti&#8208;tumor effect. Mechanism studies indicate that Pt3 induces substantial Golgi stress, indicated by the fragmentation of Golgi structure, down&#8208;regulation of Golgi proteins (GM130, GRASP65/55), loss of Golgi&#8208;dependent transport and glycosylation. This triggers Golgiphagy but blocks the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, that is a dual role in autophagy regulation, resulting in loss of proteostasis and apoptotic cell death. As far as we know, Pt3 is the first Golgi&#8208;targeted Pt complex that can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk for highly efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions between Polyvinyl Chloride and Conjugated Polymers Enable Excellent Mechanical Properties and High Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between polyvinyl chloride and the conjugated polymer PM6 were discovered, resulting in excellent mechanical properties in PM6/polyvinyl chloride thin films and high thermal/bending stability in organic solar cells.







Abstract
The incorporation of insulating polymers into conjugated polymers has been widely explored as a strategy to improve mechanical properties of flexible organic electronics. However, phase separation due to the immiscibility of these polymers has limited their effectiveness. In this study, we report the discovery of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions that enhances the miscibility between insulating and conjugated polymers, resulting in improved mechanical properties. Specifically, we have added polyvinyl chloride (PVC) into the conjugated polymer PM6 and observed a significant increase in solution viscosity, indicative of favorable miscibility between these two polymers. This phenomenon has been rarely observed in other insulating/conjugated polymer composites. Thin films of PM6/PVC exhibit a much&#8208;improved crack&#8208;onset strain of 19.35&#8201;%, compared to 10.12&#8201;% for pristine PM6 films. Analysis reveal that a &#8220;cyclohexyl&#8208;like&#8221; structure formed through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding between PVC and PM6 acted as a cross&#8208;linking site in the thin films, leading to improved mechanical properties. Moreover, PM6/PVC blend films have demonstrated excellent thermal and bending stability when applied as an electron donor in organic solar cells. These findings provide new insights into non&#8208;covalent interactions that can be utilized to enhance the properties of conjugated polymers and may have potential applications in flexible organic electronics.

         <title>Complete Peripheral Fluorination of the Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptor in Organic Solar Cells Yields Efficiency over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complete peripheral fluorination was performed on a two&#8208;dimensional conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series small molecular acceptors (SMAs), rendering the acceptor CH8F with eight fluorine atoms on the molecular backbone. More importantly, the highest efficiency of 19.28&#8201;% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based organic solar cells has been achieved so far.







Abstract
Due to the intrinsically flexible molecular skeletons and loose aggregations, organic semiconductors, like small molecular acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), greatly suffer from larger structural/packing disorders and weaker intermolecular interactions comparing to their inorganic counterparts, further leading to hindered exciton diffusion/dissociation and charge carrier migration in resulting OSCs. To overcome this challenge, complete peripheral fluorination was performed on basis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series SMAs, rendering an acceptor of CH8F with eight fluorine atoms surrounding the molecular backbone. Benefitting from the broad 2D backbone, more importantly, strengthened fluorine&#8208;induced secondary interactions, CH8F and its D18 blends afford much enhanced and more ordered molecular packings accompanying with enlarged dielectric constants, reduced exciton binding energies and more obvious fibrillary networks comparing to CH6F controls. Consequently, D18:CH8F&#8208;based OSCs reached an excellent efficiency of 18.80&#8201;%, much better than that of 17.91&#8201;% for CH6F&#8208;based ones. More excitingly, by employing D18&#8208;Cl that possesses a highly similar structure to D18 as a third component, the highest efficiency of 19.28&#8201;% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based OSCs has been achieved so far. Our work demonstrates the dramatical structural multiformity of CH&#8208;series SMAs, meanwhile, their high potential for constructing record&#8208;breaking OSCs through peripheral fine&#8208;tuning.

         <title>Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Geminal Cross Couplings of Dihaloalkanes with Cr Catalysis: Rapid Access to Tertiary and Quaternary Alkanes via a Metal&#8211;Carbene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;component geminal couplings have been achieved by design of a chromium catalytic system using dihaloalkanes to selective react with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes/alkyl tosylates. These newly developed reactions are effective for rapidly forming tertiary and quaternary alkanes via a Cr carbene intermediate with a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism, showing great potential in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Geminal cross couplings using multiple components enable the formation of several different bonds at one site in the building of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. Nevertheless, there are remaining issues of concern&#8212;cleavage of two geminal bonds and control of selectivity present challenges. We report here the geminal cross couplings of three components by reactions of dihaloalkanes with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes or alkyl tosylates by Cr catalysis, affording the formation of geminal C&#8722;C/C&#8722;Si or C&#8722;C/C&#8722;C bonds in the creation of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. The geminal couplings are catalyzed by low&#8208;cost CrCl2, enabling the sluggishness of competitive Kumada&#8208;type side couplings and homocouplings of Grignard reagents, in achieving high chemoselectivity. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that two geminal C&#8208;halide bonds are continuously cleaved by Cr to afford a metal carbene intermediate, which couples with a Grignard reagent, followed by silylation, in the formation of geminal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Si bonds via a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism. These three&#8208;component geminal cross couplings are value&#8208;addition to the synthesis of commercial drugs and bioactive molecules in medicinal chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Geminal cross couplings using multiple components enable the formation of several different bonds at one site in the building of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. Nevertheless, there are remaining issues of concern&#8212;cleavage of two geminal bonds and control of selectivity present challenges. We report here the geminal cross couplings of three components by reactions of dihaloalkanes with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes or alkyl tosylates by Cr catalysis, affording the formation of geminal C&#8722;C/C&#8722;Si or C&#8722;C/C&#8722;C bonds in the creation of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. The geminal couplings are catalyzed by low-cost CrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, enabling the sluggishness of competitive Kumada-type side couplings and homocouplings of Grignard reagents, in achieving high chemoselectivity. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that two geminal C-halide bonds are continuously cleaved by Cr to afford a metal carbene intermediate, which couples with a Grignard reagent, followed by silylation, in the formation of geminal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Si bonds via a novel inner-sphere radical coupling mechanism. These three-component geminal cross couplings are value-addition to the synthesis of commercial drugs and bioactive molecules in medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Arylation of Undirected Arenes by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of various monofluoroaromatics is disclosed with readily available aromatic silanes and germanes as coupling partners at room temperature. The flexibility of the binuclear gold catalyst skeleton and the noncovalent interactions between hexafluorobenzene and fluorobenzene can furnish a high para selectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2).







Abstract
The regioselectivity of C&#8722;H functionalization is commonly achieved by directing groups, electronic factors, or steric hindrance, which facilitate the identification of reaction sites. However, such strategies are less effective for reactants such as simple monofluoroarenes due to their relatively low reactivity and the modest steric demands of the fluorine atom. Herein, we present an undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of a wide array of monofluoroarenes using air&#8208;stable aryl silanes and germanes at room temperature. A high para&#8208;regioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2) can be realized by utilizing a dinuclear dppm(AuOTs)2 (dppm=bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) as the catalyst and hexafluorobenzene as the solvent. This provides a general and practical protocol for the concise construction of structurally diverse para&#8208;arylated monofluoroarenes through C&#8722;H activation manner. It features excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope (&gt;80 examples). Besides, this strategy is also robust for other simple monosubstituted arenes and heteroarenes. Our mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations suggest that para&#8208;C&#8722;H selectivity arises from highly electrophilic and structurally flexible dinuclear Ar&#8722;Au(III)&#8722;Au(I) species, coupled with noncovalent interaction induced by hexafluorobenzene.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Stereoconvergent C&#8722;H Borylation of Enamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is presented for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides through C&#8722;H borylation, providing a versatile means of creating stereodefined enamides. The remarkable feature of this methodology is its stereoconvergent nature, which enables the utilization of starting materials with both E and Z configurations.







Abstract
Enamides, functional derivatives of enamines, play a significant role as synthetic targets. However, the stereoselective synthesis of these molecules has posed a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry, particularly for acyclic enamides that are less thermodynamically stable. In this study, we present a general strategy for constructing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides by C&#8722;H borylation, which provides a versatile platform for generating the stereodefined enamides. Our approach involves the utilization of metalloid borenium cation, generated through the reaction of BBr3 and enamides in the presence of two different additives, avoiding any exogenous catalyst. Importantly, the stereoconvergent nature of this methodology allows for the use of starting materials with mixed E/Z configurations, thus highlighting the unique advantage of this chemistry. Mechanistic investigations have shed light on the pivotal roles played by the two additives, the reactive boron species, and the phenomenon of stereoconvergence.

Applying external stimuli is critical to circumvent the limitations imposed by linear scaling relationships in electrocatalytic applications. Franziska Simone Hegner, Ferdi Karadas et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Research Article (e202308647) that the water oxidation electrocatalytic activity of Co&#8211;Fe Prussian blue could be enhanced under magnetic field and light irradiation, which originates from an external&#8208;stimulus sensitive spin&#8208;crossover process.

In situ active repair and detection of hydrogen via ammonium persulfate (APS) and rotational Raman spectroscopy facilitates the responsible use of non&#8208;abundant transition metal complexes. The bridged heterodinuclear photocatalyst RuPtI2 used in photocatalytic hydrogen production can now be repaired via the simple addition of ammonium persulfate, as reported by Sven Rau, Boris Mizaikoff et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202306287). Along with the innovative in situ detection of hydrogen via rotational Raman spectroscopy the applicability of active repair mechanisms for a wide range of reductive catalysts is demonstrated.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Cation&#8208;Radius&#8208;Controlled Sn&#8722;O Bond Length Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite Oxides (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 44/2023)</title>

Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides have shown intriguing potential in CO2 electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202305530), Jiawei Zhu and co&#8208;workers report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. With the Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3 (x from 0 to 1) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it is demonstrated that their activity/selectivity for HCOOH featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, with a maximum point corresponding to Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3.

A pH&#8208;responsive interlocked figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight molecular shuttle is reported by Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Coutrot et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202310643). The rotaxane molecular shuttle operates through the invertible pH&#8208;responsive translation of the macrocycle between two sites of interactions of the encircled axle. As illustrated by the picture, the two loops of the eight&#8208;shaped rotaxane may be interdependently loosened and tightened. Increasing conformational degree of freedom of a loop results in the decreasing conformational degree of freedom of the other one.

         <title>Protein&#8208;based Nanoparticles: From Drug Delivery to Imaging, Nanocatalysis and Protein Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, significant progress was made in the development of protein nanoparticles, transitioning from artificial assemblies for drug delivery, to multifunctional systems for nanocatalysis and protein therapy. Advanced biohybrid materials, combined with dynamic chemistries and mild methods of particle formation produce nanoparticles that take advantage of the catalytic activity or targeting capabilities of the underlying proteins and enzymes.







Abstract
Proteins and enzymes are versatile biomaterials for a wide range of medical applications due to their high specificity for receptors and substrates, high degradability, low toxicity, and overall good biocompatibility. Protein nanoparticles are formed by the arrangement of several native or modified proteins into nanometer&#8208;sized assemblies. In this review, we will focus on artificial nanoparticle systems, where proteins are the main structural element and not just an encapsulated payload. While under natural conditions, only certain proteins form defined aggregates and nanoparticles, chemical modifications or a change in the physical environment can further extend the pool of available building blocks. This allows the assembly of many globular proteins and even enzymes. These advances in preparation methods led to the emergence of new generations of nanosystems that extend beyond transport vehicles to diverse applications, from multifunctional drug delivery to imaging, nanocatalysis and protein therapy.

         <title>Tinkering with Mechanochemical Tools for Scale Up</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry is an environmentally benign approach to chemical processes, which has steadily gained momentum at both laboratory and preparative scales. However, mechanochemical methods are still in their infancy compared to conventional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Our Minireview highlights a series of scaled&#8208;up mechanochemical processes that aim to encourage further developments in implementing mechanochemistry for commercial and industrial use.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry provides an environmentally benign platform to develop more sustainable chemical processes by limiting raw materials, energy use, and waste generation while using physically smaller equipment. A continuously growing research community has steadily showcased examples of beneficial mechanochemistry applications at both the laboratory and the preparative scale. In contrast to solution&#8208;based chemistry, mechanochemical processes have not yet been standardized, and thus scaling up is still a nascent discipline. The purpose of this Minireview is to highlight similarities, differences and challenges of the various approaches that have been successfully applied for a range of chemical applications at various scales. We hope to provide a discussion starting point for those interested in further developing mechanochemical processes for commercial use and/or industrialisation.

         <title>Multicomponent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be designed and built up using multiple building blocks. Multicomponent MOFs employ building blocks that are distinct from one another and therefore occupy specific lattice positions. By maintaining periodicity while circumventing randomness and disorder, these materials enable exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions or clusters and organic linkers. Typical MOFs are rather simple, comprising just one type of joint and linker. An additional degree of structural complexity can be introduced by using multiple different components that are assembled into the same framework In the early days of MOF chemistry, conventional wisdom held that attempting to prepare frameworks starting from such a broad set of components would lead to multiple different phases. However, this review highlights how this view was mistaken and frameworks comprising multiple different components can be deliberately designed and synthesized. When coupled to structural order and periodicity, the presence of multiple components leads to exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.

         <title>Polymerization Induced Microphase Separation for the Fabrication of Nanostructured Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) uses the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers during bulk polymerization to create nanostructured materials with highly tunable domain sizes and morphologies, including highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphologies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PIMS chemistry, and explores the wide variety of materials and applications accessible by the PIMS technique.







Abstract
Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) is a strategy used to develop unique nanostructures with highly useful morphologies through the microphase separation of emergent block copolymers during polymerization. In this process, nanostructures are formed with at least two chemically independent domains, where at least one domain is composed of a robust crosslinked polymer. Crucially, this synthetically simple method is readily used to develop nanostructured materials with the highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphology, which can also be converted into mesoporous materials by selective etching of one domain. As PIMS exploits a block copolymer microphase separation mechanism, the size of each domain can be tightly controlled by modifying the size of block copolymer precursors, thus providing unparalleled control over nanostructure and resultant mesopore sizes. Since its inception 11&#8197;years ago, PIMS has been used to develop a vast inventory of advanced materials for an extensive range of applications including biomedical devices, ion exchange membranes, lithium&#8208;ion batteries, catalysis, 3D printing, and fluorescence&#8208;based sensors, among many others. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the PIMS process, summarize latest developments in PIMS chemistry, and discuss its utility in a wide variety of relevant applications.

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Melleolides from Basidiomycota Fungi: Mechanistic Analysis of the Multifunctional GMC Oxidase Mld7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the total biosynthesis of the melleolide sesquiterpenoids produced by Basidiomycota fungi revealed that the glucose&#8208;methanol&#8208;choline oxidase enzyme Mld7 is a key enzyme that catalyzes multistep reactions leading to two different types of melleolides. Notably, these two reactions are highly regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.







Abstract
Mushroom terpenoids are biologically and chemically diverse fungal metabolites. Among them, melleolides are representative sesquiterpenoids with a characteristic protoilludane skeleton. In this study, we applied a recently established hot spot knock&#8208;in method to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway leading to 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxymelleolide. The biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene core involves the cytochrome P450 catalyzing stepwise hydroxylation of the &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene framework and a stereochemical inversion process at the C5 position catalyzed by short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins. The highlight of the biosynthesis is that the flavoprotein Mld7 catalyzes an oxidation&#8208;triggered double&#8208;bond shift accompanying dehydration and acyl&#8208;group&#8208;assisted substitution with two different nucleophiles at the C6 position to afford the &#916;7&#8208;protoilludene derivatives, such as melleolide and armillarivin. The complex reaction mechanism was proposed by DFT calculations. Of particular importance is that product distribution is regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.

         <title>Noncovalent Modification of Cycloparaphenylene by Catenane Formation Using an Active Metal Template Strategy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane, which consists of [9]CPP and a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle, has been synthesized by an active metal template strategy. Catalytic C&#8722;H borylation/cross&#8208;coupling and metal complexation at the bipyridine macrocycle moiety illustrated the efficient post&#8208;functionalization of the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane. The structural and photophysical properties of the Ag complex of [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane were also studied.







Abstract
The active metal template (AMT) strategy is a powerful tool for the formation of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) such as rotaxanes and catenanes, allowing the synthesis of a variety of MIMs, including &#960;&#8208;conjugated and multicomponent macrocycles. Cycloparaphenylene (CPP) is an emerging molecule characterized by its cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and unique properties. Therefore, diverse modifications of CPPs are necessary for its wide application. However, most CPP modifications require early stage functionalization and the direct modification of CPPs is very limited. Herein, we report the synthesis of a catenane consisting of [9]CPP and a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle as a new CPP analogue that contains a reliable synthetic scaffold enabling diverse and concise post&#8208;modification. Following the AMT strategy, the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane was successfully synthesized through Ni&#8208;mediated aryl&#8208;aryl coupling. Catalytic C&#8722;H borylation/cross&#8208;coupling and metal complexation of the bipyridine macrocycle moiety, an effective post&#8208;functionalization method, were also demonstrated with the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed that the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane forms a tridentated complex with an Ag ion inside the CPP ring. This interaction significantly enhances the phosphorescence lifetime through improved intermolecular interactions.

         <title>N,O&#8208;Benzylidene Acetal Dipeptides (NBDs) Enable the Synthesis of Difficult Peptides via a Kinked Backbone Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) can serve as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and highly effective building blocks to enable syntheses of difficult peptides and proteins via a kinked peptide backbone strategy. The scalable and cost&#8208;effective synthesis and the proven effectiveness for the synthesis of difficult peptides render NBDs valuable tools for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in both academic research and industrial applications.







Abstract
Proteins with highly hydrophobic regions or aggregation&#8208;prone sequences are typically difficult targets for chemical synthesis at the current stage, as obtaining such type of peptides via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis requires sophisticated operations. Herein, we report N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) as robust and effective building blocks to allow the direct synthesis of difficult peptides and proteins via a kinked backbone strategy. The effectiveness and easy accessibility of NBDs have been well demonstrated in our chemical syntheses of various challenging peptides and proteins, including chemokine, therapeutic hormones, histone, and glycosylated erythropoietin.

         <title>An Interlocked Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Eight Molecular Shuttle</title>

         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;station figure of eight rotaxane molecular shuttle has been synthesized by making use of a template&#8208;driven intramolecular self&#8208;entanglement of a hermaphrodite disubstituted dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 derivative and the mechanical locking of the architecture. The shuttling of the macrocycle from the ammonium to the triazolium station results in an interdependent tightening/loosening of the two loops of the interlocked molecular architecture.







Abstract
Here is reported the synthesis and characterization of an interlocked figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight rotaxane molecular shuttle from a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) derivative. This latter bears two molecular chains, whose extremities are able to react together by click chemistry. One of the two substituting chain holds an ammonium function aimed at driving the self&#8208;entanglement through the complexation of the DB24C8 moiety. In the targeted figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight rotaxane, shuttling of the DB24C8 along the threaded axle from the best ammonium station to the weaker binding site triazolium was performed through deprotonation or deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium. This way, two discrete co&#8208;conformational states were obtained, in which the folding and size of the two loops could be changed.

         <title>Stereoselective Photoredox Catalyzed (3+3) Dipolar Cycloaddition of Nitrone with Aryl Cyclopropane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical type (3+3) cycloaddition of cyclopropane is realized with aryl cyclopropane and nitrone under photoredox catalysis in a highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. The reaction includes a stereospecific three&#8208;electron&#8208;type nucleophilic ring opening and a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization.







Abstract
By resorting to the principle of remote activation, we herein demonstrate the first photoredox catalyzed (3+3) dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones with aryl cyclopropanes. Key to the fidelity of the reaction resides in a facile manner of substrate activation by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation with photoredox catalysis, and the reaction takes place through a stepwise cascade encompassing a three&#8208;electron&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution triggered cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening and a diastereoselective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization manifold. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, nicely complementing the well&#8208;developed Lewis acid catalyzed cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Other merits of the protocol include wide scope of aryl cyclopropanes with diversified substitution patterns and good functional&#8208;group compatibility. A mechanism involving an aryl radical cation promoted remote activation mode was also proposed and supported by mechanistic experiments.

         <title>An Unlocked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Zn&#8208;MOF on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst based on a tubular photosensitive carbon nitride (CN) and a conductive zinc&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)) catalytic unit is fabricated for H2O2 photosynthesis. The annealing&#8208;induced shrinkage of the Zn&#8208;O4 moiety in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) unlocks its capability for O2 reduction to H2O2, and meanwhile, the strong interaction between these two components facilitates the photoelectron injection from CN to the activated Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient catalytic sites for O2 reduction to H2O2, while ensuring the fast injection of energetic electrons into these sites, is crucial for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis but remains challenging. Herein, we report a strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst comprising polymeric carbon nitride (CN) and a two&#8208;dimensional conductive Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) (denoted as CN/Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)/400; lc, low crystallinity; 400, annealing temperature in &#176;C), in which the catalytic capability of Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for H2O2 production is unlocked by the annealing&#8208;induced effects. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the Zn sites coordinated to four O (Zn&#8208;O4) in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) are thermally activated to a relatively electron&#8208;rich state due to the annealing&#8208;induced local structure shrinkage, which favors the formation of a key *OOH intermediate of 2e&#8722; O2 reduction on these sites. Moreover, the annealing treatment facilitates the photoelectron migration from the CN photocatalyst to the Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) catalytic unit. As a result, the optimized catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 production activity and excellent stability under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Shape Control of Carbon Nanoparticles via a Simple Anion&#8208;Directed Strategy for Precise Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;directed strategy was developed to control the shapes of carbon nanoparticles (CNs) from spheres to rods with various aspect ratios (ARs). This shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions induced self&#8208;assembly followed by carbonization. The endoplasmic reticulum targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods.







Abstract
Herein, small&#8208;sized fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CNs) with tunable shapes ranging from spheres to various rods with aspect ratios (ARs) of 1.00, 1.51, 1.89, and 2.85 are prepared using a simple anion&#8208;directed strategy for the first time. Based on comprehensive morphological and structural characteristics of CNs, along with theoretical calculations of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, their shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, followed by carbonization. The endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods, accompanied by a Pearson's correlation coefficient up to 0.90. This work presents a facile approach to control the shape of CNs and reveals the relationship between the shape and organelle&#8208;targeting abilities of CNs, thereby providing a novel idea to synthesize CNs that serve as precise organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescent probes.

The endoplasmic reticulum-targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher-AR rods, accompanied by a Pearson's correlation coefficient up to 0.90. This work presents a facile approach to control the shape of CNs and reveals the relationship between the shape and organelle-targeting abilities of CNs, thereby providing a novel idea to synthesize CNs that serve as precise organelle-targeted fluorescent probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Delocalization Enables Sulfone&#8208;based Single&#8208;solvent Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron delocalization through resonance and electron withdrawing effect by F substitution solves the wettability issue and addresses the Li metal anode instability of sulfone solvents to enable the use of sulfone&#8208;based single&#8208;solvent single&#8208;salt electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMB), although providing high energy density, face the grand challenge of identifying good electrolyte solvents for cycling. Common solvents are either only stable against lithium metal anode or only stable against LiNixMnyCo1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NMC) cathode. There is significant effort trying to increase the cathode stability for ether electrolytes, which are in general stable against lithium metal anode. In comparison, there is much less effort trying to increase the anode stability of electrolytes that are stable against NMC cathode. One example is the sulfone&#8208;based electrolyte. It has good cathode stability but is hindered from practical application because of (1) high viscosity and poor wetting capability and (2) poor anode stability. Here, we solve these issues by modifying the sulfone molecules using resonance and electron withdrawing effect. The viscosity is significantly reduced by delocalizing the electrons through introducing additional oxygen on the molecular backbone and applying appropriate fluorination. The resulting molecule 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl mesylate (TFEM) has decreased Lewis basicity and less reactivity toward Li+. The electrolyte based on TFEM as single solvent enables cycling of LMB under harsh conditions of low N/P ratio (21&#8197;mg/cm2 NMC811 and 50&#8197;&#956;m Li) with 90&#8201;% capacity retention after 160 cycles at C/3 discharge rate.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of Enamides or Enecarbamates with Racemic &#945;&#8208;Bromoamides

         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of enamides or enecarbamates with racemic &#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts with full control of the newly formed vicinal stereocenters is reported. A wide variety of enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically enriched chiral &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives were directly obtained through a key sequential process of enantioselective hydronickelation&#8211;enantioconvergent alkylation.







Abstract
Catalytic methods which control multiple stereogenic centers simultaneously are highly desirable in modern organic synthesis and chemical manufacturing. Herein, we report a regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation process which proceeds with simultaneous control of vicinal stereocenters originating from two readily accessible partners, prochiral internal alkenes (enamides or enecarbamates) and racemic alkyl electrophiles (&#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts). This reaction produces high&#8208;value &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives under mild conditions and with precise selectivity. Preliminary studies of the mechanism indicate that the reaction involves an enantioselective syn&#8208;hydronickelation to generate an enantiomerically enriched alkylnickel(II) species. Subsequent enantioconvergent alkylation with a racemic alkyl electrophile generates the desired product as a single stereoisomer.

         <title>Merging the Isonitrile&#8208;Tetrazine (4+1) Cycloaddition and the Ugi Four&#8208;Component Reaction into a Single Multicomponent Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single multicomponent process combining the features of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4 +1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction was developed. The multicomponent reaction takes advantage of the click reactivities of the first step and provides access to so&#8208;far inaccessible chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions are of utmost importance at generating a unique, wide, and complex chemical space. Herein we describe a novel multicomponent approach based on the combination of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4+1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction to generate pyrazole amide derivatives. The scope of the reaction as well as mechanistic insights governing the 4H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;imine tautomerization are provided. This multicomponent process provides access to a new chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives and offers a tool for peptide modification and stapling.

         <title>Supramolecular Subphthalocyanine Cage as Catalytic Container for the Functionalization of Fullerenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallo&#8211;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine cage has been shown to catalyze the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between C60 and anthracene in water to yield mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;adducts with high regioselectivity. Catalytic amounts of the cage led to better conversions because it favours co&#8208;encapsulation of the substrates in the hydrophobic cavity. Moreover, the larger binding affinity of the cage for C60 compared to the resulting adducts enables catalytic turnover.







Abstract
Herein we report the first example of a supramolecular cage that works as a catalytic molecular reactor to perform transformations over fullerenes in aqueous medium. Taking advantage of the ability of metallo&#8211;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine (SubPc) capsules to form stable host:guest complexes with C60, we have prepared a water&#8208;soluble cage that provides a hydrophobic environment for conducting cycloadditions over encapsulated C60, namely, Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with anthracene. Indeed, the presence of catalytic amounts of SubPc cage dissolved in water promotes co&#8208;encapsulation of insoluble C60 and anthracene substrates, allowing the reaction to occur inside the cavity under mild conditions. The lower stability of the host:guest complex with the resulting C60 cycloadduct facilitates its displacement by pristine C60, which grants catalytic turnover. Moreover, bis&#8208;addition compounds are regioselectively formed inside the cage when using excess anthracene.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Allylation of Ketones with Allenylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuH&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and regiodivergent allyl addition to ketones with allenylsilanes has been developed. Various tertiary homoallylic alcohols bearing an alkenyl silane or an allyl silane group were synthesized with high regioselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
We report herein a regiodivergent and enantioselective allyl addition to ketones with allenylsilanes through copper catalysis. With the combination of CuOAc, a Josiphos&#8208;type bidentate phosphine ligand and PhSiH3, allyl addition to a variety of ketones furnishes branched products in excellent enantioselectivities. The regioselectivity is completely reversed by employing the P&#8208;stereogenic ligand BenzP*, affording the linear products with excellent enantioselectivities and good Z&#8208;selectivities. The linear Z&#8208;product could be converted to E&#8208;product via a catalytic geometric isomerization of the Z&#8208;alkene group. The silyl group in the products could provide a handle for downstream elaboration.

         <title>Cu2+&#8208;Anchored Carbon Nano&#8208;Photocatalysts for Visible Water Splitting to Boost Hydrogen Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)&#8208;anchored CD&#8208;doped C3N4 nanosheet (Cu@CDCN) enhances electron transfer and photocatalytic generation of H2. Cu2+ efficiently catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 and reduces photocatalyst poisoning by H2O2, which promotes the conversion to Cu+ and boosts cuproptosis. Cu@CDCN with efficient photocatalytic H2 production and anchored Cu2+ enables a combination of hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis that can cause mitochondrial damage and inhibit tumor growth.







Abstract
Both hydrogen (H2) and copper ions (Cu+) can be used as anti&#8208;cancer treatments. However, the continuous generation of H2 molecules and Cu+ in specific sites of tumors is challenging. Here we anchored Cu2+ on carbon photocatalyst (Cu@CDCN) to allow the continuous generation of H2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumors using the two&#8208;electron process of visible water splitting. The photocatalytic process also generated redox&#8208;active Cu&#8208;carbon centers. Meanwhile, the Cu2+ residues reacted with H2O2 (the obstacle to the photocatalytic process) to accelerate the two&#8208;electron process of water splitting and cuprous ion (Cu+) generation, in which the Cu2+ residue promoted a pro&#8208;oxidant effect with glutathione through metal&#8208;reducing actions. Both H2 and Cu+ induced mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular redox homeostasis destruction, which enabled hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis to inhibit cancer cell growth and suppress tumor growth. Our research is the first attempt to integrate hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis using metal&#8208;enhanced visible solar water splitting in nanomedicine, which may provide a safe and effective cancer treatment.

         <title>Taming of Furfurylidenes by Chiral Bismuth&#8208;Rhodium Paddlewheel Catalysts. Preparation and Functionalization of Optically Active 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (Trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes represent bioisosteres of tert&#8208;butyl groups of improved metabolic stability; they are on high demand in medicinal chemistry but difficult to make in optically active form. A new approach, which engages a bench&#8208;stable carbene source in asymmetric cyclopropanation catalyzed by a [BiRh] paddlewheel complex, opens ready access to compounds of this type.







Abstract
Although 2&#8208;furyl&#8208;carbenes (furfurylidenes) are prone to instantaneous electrocyclic ring opening, chiral [BiRh]&#8208;paddlewheel complexes empowered by London dispersion allow (trifluoromethyl)furfurylidene metal complexes to be generated from a bench&#8208;stable triftosylhydrazone precursor. These reactive intermediates engage in asymmetric [2+1] cycloadditions and hence open entry into valuable trifluoromethylated cyclopropane or &#8208;cyclopropene derivatives in optically active form, which are important building blocks for medicinal chemistry but difficult to make otherwise.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in Mononuclear Yb/Sm Co&#8208;crystal Assemblies at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

Co&#8208;crystal assemblies of mononuclear Yb3+ and Sm3+ complexes enable cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion from Sm3+ at room temperature. This promising system opens powerful horizons for new upconverting material using co&#8208;crystal assemblies.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based upconversion luminescence transforming high&#8208;energy photons into low&#8208;energy photons is an attractive anti&#8208;Stokes shift process for fundamental research and promising applications. In this work, we developed the upconversion luminescence in co&#8208;crystal assemblies consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes. The characteristic visible emissions of Sm3+ were observed under the excitation of absorption band of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm. A series of co&#8208;crystal assemblies were investigated based on mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes, and the strongest luminescence was obtained when the molar concentration between Yb3+ and Sm3+ is equivalent. The crystal structure was fully characterized by the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and upconverting energy transfer mechanisms were verified as cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion. This is the first example of Sm3+&#8208;based upconverting luminescence in discrete lanthanide complexes which present as co&#8208;crystal assemblies at room temperature.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence in Multi&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Type Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>

Anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules has been observed. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1&#8197;eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state.







Abstract
Photon&#8208;upconversion in organic molecular systems is one of the promising technologies for future energy harvesting systems because these systems can generate excitons that possess higher energy than excitation energy. The photon&#8208;upconversion caused by absorbing ambient heat as additional energy is particularly interesting because it could ideally provide a light&#8208;driving cooling system. However, only a few organic molecular systems have been reported. Here, we report the anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence (ASPL) derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1&#8197;eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state. The anti&#8208;Stokes shift corresponded well to the 1&#8211;0 vibration transition from the ground state to the excited singlet state, and we further evaluated a correlation between the activation energy for the ASPL intensity and the TADF process. Our demonstration underlines that MR&#8208;TADF molecules have become a novel class of ASPL materials for various future applications, such as light&#8208;driving cooling systems.

         <title>Photochemical Oximesulfonylation of Alkenes Using Sulfonyl&#8208;Oxime&#8208;Ethers as Bifunctional Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient metal free photochemical method for regioselective incorporation of oxime ether and sulfonyl functionality to olefin using sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as bifunctional reagents is demonstrated. The process exhibits a wide substrate scope providing rapid access to 1,2&#8208;oximesulfonylated products in good to excellent yields and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Utilization of oxime ethers as bifunctional reagents remains unknown. Herein, we present a mechanistically distinct strategy that enables oximesulfonylation of olefins using sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as bifunctional reagents under metal&#8208;free photochemical conditions. Via concomitant C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bond formation, the process permits incorporation of oxime and sulfonyl groups into olefins in a complete atom&#8208;economic fashion, providing rapid access to multi&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl oxime ethers with good yields and stereoselectivity. The method is amenable to functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and is shown to be scalable. A radical chain mechanism initiated via photochemical Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) mediated N&#8722;O bond cleavage is suggested for the process, based on our results on mechanistic investigations.

         <title>Efficient Intersystem Crossing and Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated State Induced by Through&#8208;Space Intramolecular Charge Transfer in a Parallel Geometry Carbazole&#8208;Bodipy Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to through&#8208;space intramolecular charge transfer, a compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor (carbazole&#8208;bodipy) dyad with face&#8208;to&#8208;face geometry exhibits long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns) and efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%). This discovery opens a new avenue for designing efficient photosensitizers and photonic applications that depend on long&#8208;lived excited states generation.







Abstract
The design of efficient heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) based on through bond charge transfer (TBCT) features is a formidable challenge due to the criteria of orthogonal donor&#8208;acceptor geometry. Herein, we propose using parallel (face&#8208;to&#8208;face) conformation carbazole&#8208;bodipy donor&#8208;acceptor dyads (BCZ&#8208;1 and BCZ&#8208;2) featuring through space intramolecular charge transfer (TSCT) process as efficient triplet PS. Efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%) and long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (&#964;T=186&#8197;&#956;s) were observed in the TSCT dyad BCZ&#8208;1 compared to BCZ&#8208;3 (&#934;&#916;=0.4&#8201;%), the dyad involving TBCT, demonstrating the superiority of the TSCT approach over conventional donor&#8208;acceptor system. Moreover, the transient absorption study revealed that TSCT dyads have a faster charge separation and slower intersystem crossing process induced by charge recombination compared to TBCT dyad. A long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (CSS) was observed in the BCZ&#8208;1 (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns). For the first time, the TSCT dyad was explored for the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion, and a high upconversion quantum yield of 11&#8201;% was observed. Our results demonstrate a new avenue for designing efficient PSs and open up exciting opportunities for future research in this field.

         <title>Selective CO2 &#8208;to&#8208; Syngas Conversion Enabled by Bimetallic Gold/Zinc Sites in Partially Reductived Au/ZnO Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (gaseous mixture of CO and H2) is a promising way to curb excessive CO2 emission and the greenhouse gas effect. Herein, we present a bimetallic AuZn@ZnO (AuZn/ZnO) catalyst with high efficiency and durability for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 66.4% for CO (corrected current density of 0.38&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8208;2) and 26.5% for H2 and a 3&#8201;h CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas at &#8208;0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). And the CO/H2 ratio shows a wide range from 0.25 to 2.50 over a narrow potential window (&#8208;0.7 V to &#8208;1.1 V vs. RHE). In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the bimetallic synergistic effect between Au and Zn lower the activation energy barrier of CO2 molecules and facilitate electronic transfer, further highlight the potential to control the CO/H2 ratios for efficient syngas production using the coexisting Au sites and Zn sites.</dc:description>

In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the bimetallic synergistic effect between Au and Zn lower the activation energy barrier of CO2 molecules and facilitate electronic transfer, further highlight the potential to control the CO/H2 ratios for efficient syngas production using the coexisting Au sites and Zn sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous/Organic Hybrid Batteries Enabled by Cu2+ Redox Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium||sulfur (Li||S) batteries are considered as one of the promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and low cost of S cathodes, as well as the low redox potential of Li metal anodes (&#8208;3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the S reduction reaction from S to Li2S leads to limited discharge voltage and capacity, largely hindering the energy density of Li||S batteries. Herein, high&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via an electrolyte decoupling strategy. In cathodes, S electrodes undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction from S to Cu2S with four&#8208;electron transfer in a Cu2+&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte. Such an energy storage mechanism contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance of S electrodes, including high discharge potential and capacity, superior rate performance and stable cycling behavior. As a result, the assembled Li||S hybrid batteries exhibit a high discharge voltage of 3.4 V and satisfactory capacity of 2.3 Ah g&#8208;1, contributing to incredible energy density. This work provides an opportunity for the construction of high&#8208;energy Li||S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Fluid Interface Enables Spatiotemporal Regulation of Ligand Distribution to Increase Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Interfacial Binding Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, receptor&#8208;ligand binding reactions within interfaces often achieve optimum binding kinetics and thermodynamics by regulating the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial receptors/ligands. Inspired by this, we report a hierarchical fluid interface (HieFluidFace) to regulate spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial ligands to increase the rates and thermodynamic favorability of interfacial binding reactions. Each spherical aptamer (SAPT) is anchored on supported lipid bilayers without fluidity as an &#8220;island&#8221;, and surrounded by many fluorescent aptamers (FAPTs) with free fluidity as &#8220;rafts&#8221;. Such ligand &#8220;island&#8208;raft&#8221; models provide large reactive cross&#8208;sections for rapid binding. The synergistic multivalency of SAPTs and FAPTs improves interfacial affinity for tight capture. Moreover, FAPTs accumulate at binding sites to bind to cellular receptors with clustered fluorescence to &#8220;lighten&#8221; cells for direct identification. Thus, HieFluidFace in a microfluidic chip achieves high&#8208;performance capture and identification of circulating tumor cells from clinical samples, providing a new paradigm to optimize the kinetics and thermodynamics of interfacial binding reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4 and H2O2 under Non&#8208;sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 requires photosensitizers and sacrificial agents to provide sufficient electrons and protons through metal&#8208;based photocatalysts, and the separation of CH4 from by&#8208;product O2 has poor applications. Herein, we successfully synthesize a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst of a novel electron&#8208;acceptor 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrenetetrone (PT), to our best knowledge, this is the first time that metal&#8208;free catalyst achieves non&#8208;sacrificial photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 and easily separable H2O2. This photocatalyst offers CH4 product of 10.6 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions (room temperature, and only water), which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the reported metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. Comprehensive in situ characterizations and calculations reveal a multi&#8208;step reaction mechanism, in which the long&#8208;lived oxygen&#8208;centered radical in the excited PT provides as a site for CO2 activation, resulting in a stabilized cyclic carbonate intermediate with a lower formation energy. This key intermediate is thermodynamically crucial for the subsequent reduction to CH4 product with the electronic selectivity of up to 90%. The work provides fresh insights on the economic viability of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to easily separable CH4 in non&#8208;sacrificial and metal&#8208;free conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating a Defined Chirality in Amino Acids and Cyclic Dipeptides by Photochemical Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines underwent stereochemical editing at position C6 leading to the formation of products with a defined configuration which was retained in consecutive reactions. Spectroscopic evidence was collected corroborating a hydrogen atom transfer to the photocatalyst as the pivotal step of the process.







Abstract
2,5&#8208;Diketopiperazines are cyclic dipeptides displaying a wide range of applications. Their enantioselective preparation has now been found possible from the respective racemates by a photochemical deracemization (53 examples, 74&#8201;% to quantitative yield, 71&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A chiral benzophenone catalyst in concert with irradiation at &#955;=366&#8197;nm enables to establish the configuration at the stereogenic carbon atom C6 at will. If other stereogenic centers are present in the diketopiperazines they remain unaffected and a stereochemical editing is possible at a single position. Consecutive reactions, including the conversion into N&#8208;aryl or N&#8208;alkyl amino acids or the reduction to piperazines, occur without compromising the newly created stereogenic center. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the benzophenone catalyst processes one enantiomer of the 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines preferentially and enables a reversible hydrogen atom transfer that is responsible for the deracemization process. The remarkably long lifetime of the protonated ketyl radical implies a yet unprecedented mode of action.

         <title>Superstructure&#8208;Induced Hierarchical Assemblies for Nanoconfined Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8208;inorganic assemblies based on pillararene&#8208;strutted covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been developed as highly efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles). The pillararenes in the assemblies play an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, thus providing valuable insights into the construction of multifunctional porous materials with innovative and designable functions.







Abstract
Most attempts to synthesize supramolecular nanosystems are limited to a single mechanism, often resulting in the formation of nanomaterials that lack diversity in properties. Herein, hierarchical assemblies with appropriate variety are fabricated in bulk via a superstructure&#8208;induced organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid strategy. The dynamic balance between substructures and superstructures is managed using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as dual building blocks to regulate the performances of hierarchical assemblies. Significantly, the superstructures resulting from the controlled cascade between COFs and MOFs create highly active photocatalytic systems through multiple topologies. Our designed tandem photocatalysis can precisely and efficiently regulate the conversion rates of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles) through competing redox pathways. Furthermore, benzo[d]imidazoles catalyzed by such supramolecular nanosystems can be isolated in yields ranging from 70&#8201;% to 93&#8201;% within tens of minutes. The multilayered structural states within the supramolecular systems demonstrate the importance of hierarchical assemblies in facilitating photocatalytic propagation and expanding the structural repertoire of supramolecular hybrids.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Decorated Organoboron Emitters with Low&#8208;Lying HOMO Levels for Solution&#8208;Processed Narrowband Blue Hyperfluorescence OLED Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrowband blue emitter with low&#8208;lying the highest occupied molecular orbital level was developed by decorating the multiple resonance core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which suppresses hole trapping effect for facilitating hole transport and avoiding exciton quenching. The optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence device simultaneously obtains record high external quantum efficiency of 29.2&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 16.6&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The hyperfluorescence has drawn great attention in achieving efficient narrowband emitting devices based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. However, achieving efficient solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices is still a challenge, due to the unbalanced charge transport and serious exciton quenching caused by that the holes are easily trapped on the high&#8208;lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level of traditional diphenylamine&#8208;decorated emitters. Here, we developed two narrowband blue organoboron emitters with low&#8208;lying HOMO levels by decorating the MR&#8208;TADF core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which could suppress the hole trapping effect by reducing the hole traps between host and MR&#8208;TADF emitter from deep (0.40&#8197;eV) to shallow (0.14/0.20&#8197;eV) ones for facilitating hole transport and exciton formation, as well as avoiding exciton quenching. And the large dihedral angle between the carbazole and MR&#8208;TADF core makes the carbazole act as a steric hindrance to inhibit molecular aggregation. Accordingly, the optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices simultaneously realize record external quantum efficiency of 29.2&#8201;%, narrowband emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 16.6&#8197;nm, and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.139, 0.189), which is the best result for the solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Artificial Organelle Corrects Microenvironment Interference for Accurate Intratumoral Glucose Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle is reported by immobilizing enzymes within porous coordination polymers. The acid&#8208;digested bi&#8208;enzymes cascade core shows boosted catalytic efficiency for sensitive signal transduction, while the stable shell integrating catalase not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic state to maximize glucose oxidation, enabling accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.







Abstract
Enzymatic catalysis with high efficiency allows them a great prospect in metabolite monitoring in living cells. However, complex tumor microenvironments, such as acidity, H2O2, and hypoxia, are bound to disturb catalytic reactions for misleading results. Here, we report a spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle to correct intratumoral glucose analysis, where the zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 immobilized glucose oxidase&#8208;horseradish peroxidase cascade core and catalase&#8208;directed shell act as signal transduction and guarding rooms respectively. The acid&#8208;digested core and stable shell provide appropriate spaces to boost biocatalytic efficiency with good tolerability. Notably, the endogenous H2O2 is in situ decomposed to O2 by catalase, which not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic states to maximize glucose oxidation. The marked protective effect and biocompatibility render artificial organelles to correct the signal transduction for dynamic monitoring glucose in vitro and in vivo, achieving our goal of accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Na/Cl2 Batteries Through Improved Electron and Ion Transport by Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Bicontinuous&#8208;Structured Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable Na/Cl2 battery with an ultrahigh rate capability (16,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) has been realized using a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which enables efficient Na+ and electron transport and promoted Cl2 adsorption and conversion. It provides a new paradigm to solve the dilemma between energy density and power density in energy storage devices.







Abstract
Rechargeable sodium/chlorine (Na/Cl2) batteries are emerging candidates for sustainable energy storage owing to their superior energy densities and the high abundance of Na and Cl elements. However, their practical applications have been plagued by the poor rate performance (e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), as the widely used carbon nanosphere cathodes show both sluggish electron&#8208;ion transport and reaction kinetics. Here, by mimicking the sufficient mass and energy transport in a sponge, we report a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which allows efficient Na+ and electron transport and promotes Cl2 adsorption and conversion, thus unlocking ultrahigh&#8208;rate Na/Cl2 batteries, e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 16,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 that is more than two orders of magnitude higher than previous reports. The optimized solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas (carbon&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;Cl2) triple interfaces further contribute to a maximum reversible capacity and cycle life of 2,000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 250&#8197;cycles, respectively. This study establishes a universal approach for improving the sluggish kinetics of conversion&#8208;type battery reactions, and provides a new paradigm to resolve the long&#8208;standing dilemma between high energy and power densities in energy storage devices.

         <title>A Mushroom P450&#8208;Monooxygenase Enables Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Biocatalytic Synthesis of Epoxycyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An epoxycyclohexenone (ECH) moiety occurs in natural products of both bacteria and ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi. While the enzymes for ECH formation in bacteria and ascomycetes have been identified and characterized, it remained obscure how this structure is biosynthesized in basidiomycetes. In this study, we i) identified a genetic locus responsible for panepoxydone biosynthesis in the basidiomycete mushroom Panus rudis and ii) biochemically characterized PanH, the cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing epoxide formation in this pathway. Using a PanH&#8208;producing yeast as a biocatalyst, we synthesized a small library of bioactive ECH compounds as a proof of concept. Furthermore, homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and site directed mutation revealed the substrate specificity of PanH. Remarkably, PanH is unrelated to ECH&#8208;forming enzymes in bacteria and ascomycetes, suggesting that mushrooms evolved this biosynthetic capacity convergently and independently of other organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Flexible Dielectric Films from Solution Processable Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are known to be a promising class of materials for a wide range of applications, yet their poor solution processability limits their utility in many areas. Here we report a pore engineering method using hydrophilic side chains to improve the processability of hydrazone and &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs and the production of flexible, crystalline films. Mechanical measurements of the free&#8208;standing COF films of COF&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (hydrazone&#8208;linked) and TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked), revealed a Young&#8217;s modulus of 391.7 MPa and 1034.7 MPa, respectively. The solubility and excellent mechanical properties enabled the use of these COFs in dielectric devices. Specifically, the TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 film&#8208;based dielectric capacitors display simultaneously high dielectric constant and breakdown strength, resulting in a discharged energy density of 11.22 J cm&#8211;3. This work offers a general approach for producing solution processable COFs and mechanically flexible COF&#8208;based films, which hold great potential for use in energy storage and flexible electronics applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition Regulates Coordination Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination engineering for single&#8208;atom sites has drawn increasing attention, yet its chemical synthesis remains a tough issue, especially for tailorable coordination structures. Herein, a molecular recognition strategy is proposed to fabricate single&#8208;atom sites with regulable local coordination structures. Specifically, a heteroatom&#8208;containing ligand serves as the guest molecule to induce coordination interaction with the metal&#8208;containing host, precisely settling the heteroatoms into the local structure of single&#8208;atom sites. As a proof of concept, thiophene is selected as the guest molecule, and sulfur atoms are successfully introduced into the local coordination structure of iron single&#8208;atom sites. Ultrahigh oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity is achieved with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the strategy possesses excellent universality towards diversified types of single&#8208;atom sites. This work makes breakthroughs in the fabrication of single&#8208;atom sites and affords new opportunities in structural regulation at the atomic level.</dc:description>

Herein, a molecular recognition strategy is proposed to fabricate single-atom sites with regulable local coordination structures. Specifically, a heteroatom-containing ligand serves as the guest molecule to induce coordination interaction with the metal-containing host, precisely settling the heteroatoms into the local structure of single-atom sites. As a proof of concept, thiophene is selected as the guest molecule, and sulfur atoms are successfully introduced into the local coordination structure of iron single-atom sites. Ultrahigh oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity is achieved with a half-wave potential of 0.93 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the strategy possesses excellent universality towards diversified types of single-atom sites. This work makes breakthroughs in the fabrication of single-atom sites and affords new opportunities in structural regulation at the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of an Air&#8208;Stable, High&#8208;Spin Diradical with Diazapyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable carbon&#8208;based polyradicals exhibiting strong spin&#8208;spin coupling and slow depolarization processes are particularly attractive functional materials. A new molecular motif with convenient synthesis method allowing for adaptable integration of stable, high&#8208;spin radicals to (hetero)aromatic polycycles is developed, as illustrated by a non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradical showing triplet ground state with long persistency (&#964;1/2~31 h) in the air. Compared to the widely used 1,3&#8208;phenylene, the newly designed (diaza)pyrene&#8208;4,10&#8208;diyl is for the first time demonstrated to confer ferromagnetic (FM) spin coupling, for possessing delocalized non&#8208;disjoint SOMOs. With the X&#8208;ray crystallography unambiguously proving the diradical structure, the triplet ground state is thoroughly characterized. A large &#916;ES&#8208;T of 1.1 kcal/mol, proving the strong FM coupling effect, is revealed consistently by&#160;superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, while the zero&#8208;field splitting and triplet nutation characters are examined by the continuous&#8208;wave and pulsed EPR. A millisecond spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time is also detected. The current study not only offers a new molecular motif enabling FM coupling between carbon&#8208;based spins, but more importantly presents a general method for installing stable polyradicals to functional &#960;&#8208;systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Responsive Selenide&#8208;containing Materials Based on Transalkylation of Selenonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) possess unique properties as a result of their internal dynamic bonds, such as self&#8208;healing and reprocessing abilities. In this study, we report a thermally responsive C&#8208;Se dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) that relies on the transalkylation exchange between selenonium salts and selenides, which undergo a fast transalkylation reaction in the absence of any catalyst. Additionally, we demonstrate the presence of a dissociative mechanism in the absence of selenide groups. After incorporation of this DCC into selenide&#8208;containing polymer materials, it was observed that the cross&#8208;linked networks display varying dynamic exchange rates when using different alkylation reagents, suggesting that the reprocessing capacity of selenide&#8208;containing materials can be regulated. Also, by incorporating selenonium salts into polymer materials, we observed that the materials exhibited good healing ability at elevated temperatures as well as excellent solvent resistance at ambient temperature. This novel dynamic covalent chemistry thus provides a straightforward method for the healing and reprocessing of selenide&#8208;containing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Coding intrinsic disorder into DNA hybridization probes enables discrimination of single nucleotide variants over wide and tunable temperature ranges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA hybridization probes are commonly used tools to discriminate clinically important single nucleotide variants (SNVs) but often work at elevated temperatures with very narrow temperature intervals (&#8710;T). Herein, we investigated the thermodynamic basis of the narrow &#8710;T both in silico and experimentally. Our study revealed that the high entropy penalty of classic hybridization probe designs was the key attributor for the narrow &#8710;T. Guided by this finding, we further introduced an entropy&#8208;compensate probe (Sprobe) design by coding intrinsic disorder into a stem&#8208;loop hybridization probe. Sprobe expanded &#8710;T from less than 10 &#176;C to over 30 &#176;C. Moreover, both &#8710;T and the optimal reaction temperature can be fine&#8208;tuned by simply altering the length of the loop domain. Sprobe was clinically validated by analyzing EGFR L858R mutation in 36 pairs of clinical tumor tissue samples collected from lung cancer patients, which revealed 100% clinical sensitivity and specificity. We anticipate that our study will serve as a general guide for designing thermal robust hybridization probes for clinical diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulate Multiple Resonance Delayed Fluorescence via Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Excited State towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters usually suffer from slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching. Here, we report the design of a sandwich structure by placing the B&#8208;N MR core between two electron&#8208;donating moieties, inducing through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) states. The proper adjusting of the energy levels brings about a 10&#8208;fold higher RISC rate in comparison with the parent B&#8208;N molecule. In the meantime, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 91% and a good color purity were maintained. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the new MR emitter achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.7% and small roll&#8208;offs at high brightness. High device efficiencies were also obtained for a wide range of doping concentrations of up to 20 wt% thanks to the steric shielding of the B&#8208;N core. A good operational stability with LT95 of 85.2 h has also been revealed. The dual steric and electronic effects resulting from the introduction of a TSCT state offer an effective molecular design to address the critical challenges of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Multi&#8208;Block and Multi&#8208;Block+ Strategies for the Upcycling of Mixed Polyolefins and Other Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to a continued rise in the production and use of plastic products, their end&#8208;of&#8208;life pollution has become a pressing global issue. One of the biggest challenges in plastics recycling is the separation of different polymers. Multi&#8208;block copolymers (MBCPs) represent an efficient strategy for the upcycling of mixed plastics via induced compatibilization, but this approach is limited by difficulties associated with synthesis and structural modification. In this contribution, several synthetic strategies are explored to prepare MBCPs with tunable microstructures, which were then used as com&#8208;patibilizer additives to upcycle mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. A multi&#8208;block+ strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was introduced, which enabled block extension during the in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties as well as better 3D printing capability. This strategy was also applicable to more complex ternary plastic blends. The polymer multi&#8208;block strategy enabled by versatile MBCPs synthesis and the multi&#8208;block+ strategy enabled by in situ block extension show exciting opportunities for the upcycling of mixed plastics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Over the last six decades folded polymer chains &#8211; so&#8208;called Single Chain Nanoparticles (SCNPs) &#8211; have evolved from the mere concept of intramolecularly crosslinked polymer chains to tailored nanoreactors, underpinned by a plethora of techniques and chemistries to tailor and analyze their morphology and function. These monomolecular polymer entities hold critical promise in a wide range of applications. Herein, we highlight the exciting progress that has been made in the field of catalytically active SCNPs within recent years.</dc:description>

A wide range of &#947;&#8208;arylated &#947;&#8208;lactones are synthesized in a single step from aliphatic acids in moderate to good yield.

The latter constitutes a potential clickable CycloSiFA prosthetic group which might be used in PET tracer development using Cu&#8208;catalysed triazole formation.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutenes from a Common Scaffold: Enantioselective Desymmetrization via Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four&#8208;membered carbocycles are important structural motifs found in several natural products and drugs. Amongst those, cyclobutenes are attractive intermediates because the residual olefin can be manipulated selectively into numerous saturated and unsaturated analogs. Few methods exist to access chiral tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutenes and they are generally limited in terms of diversification. Herein, a divergent synthetic strategy was developed where a single optically enriched scaffold is diversified into a variety of derivatives with different substitution patterns. To this end, the enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral 1,2&#8208;dibromocyclobutene imides was enabled by a dual Ir/Ni&#8208;catalyzed photoredox C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling with an alkyltrifluoroborate salt to install a convertible carbon fragment in good yields and &gt;90% enantiomeric excess. Exceptional mono&#8208;coupling selectivity is observed and the resulting chiral bromocyclobutene serves as a common scaffold that can be transformed in a divergent manner into several valuable 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutane products while maintaining optical purity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anilines are potentially high&#8208;value arylating agents, but are limited by the low reactivity of the strong C&#8208;N bond. We show that the reactive intermediate benzyne can be used to both activate anilines, and set&#8208;up an aryl transfer reaction in a single step. The reaction does not require any transition metal catalysis or stoichiometric organometallics, and establishes a metal&#8208;free route to valuable biaryl products by functionalizing the aniline C&#8208;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Regiodivergent Alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Activated by Distinct Organometallic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Bis(boronic) esters can be readily synthesized from alkylBpin precursors. Selective transformations of these compounds hold the potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization of the remaining C&#8211;B bond, leading to a diverse array of molecules. Currently, there are no strategies available to address the reactivity and, more importantly, the controllable regiodivergent functionalization of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters. In this study, we have achieved controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of these molecules. The regioselectivity has been clarified based on the unique chelation patterns observed with different organometallic reagents. Remarkably, this methodology effectively addresses the low reactivity of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters and bridges the gap in radical chemistry, which typically yields only the classical products formed via stable radical intermediates. Furthermore, the compounds synthesized through this approach serve as potent building blocks for creating molecular diversity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Class of Activatable NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is emerging as one of the important non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques in biomedical research. Small molecule&#8208; second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) PA dyes combined with imaging data can provide comprehensive and in&#8208;depth in vivo physiological and pathological information. However, the NIR&#8208;II PA dyes usually exhibit &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; properties due to the lack of a readily optically tunable group, which hinders the further applications in vivo. Herein, a novel class of dyes GX have been designed and synthesized as the activatable NIR&#8208;II PA platform, in which the absorption/emission wavelength of GX&#8208;5 extends up to 1082/1360 nm. Importantly, dyes GX have a strong tissue penetration depth and high&#8208;resolution for the mouse vasculature structures in NIR&#8208;II PA 3D imaging and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) imaging. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of GX dyes, the first NIR&#8208;II PA probe GX&#8208;5&#8208;CO activated by carbon monoxide (CO) was engineered and employed to reveal the enhancement of the CO levels in the hypertensive mice by high&#8208;contrast NIR&#8208;II PA and FL imaging. We expect that many derivatives of dyes GX will be developed to afford versatile NIR&#8208;II PA platforms for designing a wide variety activatable NIR&#8208;II PA probes as biomedical tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Encapsulated by an Oxygen&#8208;Saturated TiO2 Overlayer for Low&#8208;Temperature SO2&#8208;Tolerant Catalysis during CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of oxidation catalysts that are resistant to sulfur poisoning is crucial for extending the lifespan of catalysts in real&#8208;working conditions. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of oxide&#8208;metal interaction (OMI) catalyst under oxidative atmospheres. By using organic coated TiO2, an oxide/metal inverse catalyst with non&#8208;classical oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayers were obtained at relatively low temperature. These catalysts were found to incorporate ultra&#8208;small Pd metal and support particles with exceptional reactivity and stability for CO oxidation (under 21 vol% O2 and 10 vol% H2O). In particular, the core (Pd)&#8211;shell (TiO2) structured OMI catalyst exhibited excellent resistance to SO2 poisoning, yielding robust CO oxidation performance at 120 &#176;C for 240 h (at 100 ppm SO2 and 10 vol% H2O). The stability of this new OMI catalyst was explained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that interfacial oxygen atoms at Pd&#8211;O&#8211;Ti sites (of oxygen&#8208;saturated overlayers) serve as non&#8208;metal active sites for low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation, and change the SO2 adsorption from metal(d)&#8208;to&#8208;SO2(&#960;*) back&#8208;bonding to much weaker &#963;(Ti&#8211;S) bonding.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A synthesis strategy based on biogenetic building blocks for the collective and divergent biomimetic syntheses of cleistoperlones A&#8211;F (1&#8211;6), a cinnamoylphloroglucinol collection discovered from Cleistocalyx operculatus, has been developed. These syntheses were proceeded successfully in only six to seven steps starting from the commercially available 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetriol involving oxidative activation of stable biogenetic building blocks into activated forms as a crucial step. Key features of the syntheses include a unique Michael addition/ketalization/1,6&#8208;addition/enol&#8208;keto tautomerism cascade reaction for the construction of dihydropyrano[3,2&#8208;d]xanthene tetracyclic core of 1 and 2, and a rare inverse electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition for the establishment of benzopyran ring in 4&#8211;6.

         <title>Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Tuning the Electronic State of Copper Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking were synthesized as heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Without changing the coordination environments or the supramolecular structures, the spin and charge density of the Cu sites were tuned by modulating terminal ligands, resulting in an increased rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
The electronic state in terms of charge and spin of metal sites is fundamental to govern the catalytic activity of a photocatalyst. Herein, we show that modulation of the electronic states of Cu sites, without changing the coordination environments, of two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking can significantly improve photocatalytic activity. The use of these heterogeneous photocatalysts, without using noble metal cocatalysts, resulted in an increase of the hydrogen production rate from 522 to 3620&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. A systematical analysis revealed that the charge density and spin density of the metal centers are efficiently modulated via the modulation of the coordination fields around active copper (II) centers by the variation of the non&#8208;coordination groups of terminal ligands, leading to the significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity. This work provides an insight into the electronic state of active metal centers for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Effect Enabled by Ligand Substitution and CO2 Affinity in a Flexible SIFSIX Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linker engineering of a flexible SiF62&#8722; (SIFSIX) pillared network via single atom substitution profoundly changes the sorption behavior and affords a kinetically stable shape&#8208;memory material. The &#8216;memorized&#8217; open phase efficiently purifies a CO2/N2 (15/85) mixture in a manner which would be infeasible for the nonporous variant.







Abstract
We report that linker ligand substitution involving just one atom induces a shape&#8208;memory effect in a flexible coordination network. Specifically, whereas SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;Cu, [Cu(SiF6)(L)2]n, (L=1,4&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene, SiF62&#8722;=SIFSIX) has been previously reported to exhibit reversible switching between closed and open phases, the activated phase of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, [Cu(SiF6)(LN)2]n (LN=2,5&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)pyridine), transformed to a kinetically stable porous phase with strong affinity for CO2. As&#8208;synthesized SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, &#945;, transformed to less open, &#947;, and closed, &#946;, phases during activation. &#946; did not adsorb N2 (77&#8197;K), rather it reverted to &#945; induced by CO2 at 195, 273 and 298&#8197;K. CO2 desorption resulted in &#945;&#8242;, a shape&#8208;memory phase which subsequently exhibited type&#8208;I isotherms for N2 (77&#8197;K) and CO2 as well as strong performance for separation of CO2/N2 (15/85) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar driven by strong binding (Qst=45&#8211;51&#8197;kJ/mol) and excellent CO2/N2 selectivity (up to 700). Interestingly, &#945;&#8242; reverted to &#946; after re&#8208;solvation/desolvation. Molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into the properties of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN.

         <title>Living Alternating Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Copolymerization of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran to Provide Completely Degradable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the DHF copolymers with enhanced alternating ratios and degradability. By carefully tuning the ROMP reactivities of comonomers and Ru initiators, we achieved an outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%), while preserving the benefits of living polymerization. The superior degradability of our copolymers was also demonstrated by the notable NMR yield of the unimeric degradation products (up to 80&#8201;%) and recovery ratio (66&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran (DHF) has recently been gaining significant attention as a comonomer in metathesis polymerization, thanks to its ability to provide the resultant polymer backbones with stimuli&#8208;responsive degradability. In this report, we present living alternating copolymerization of DHF with less reactive endo&#8208;tricyclo[4.2.2.02,5]deca&#8208;3,9&#8208;dienes (TDs) and endo&#8208;oxonorbornenes (oxoNBs). By carefully controlling the reactivity of both the Ru initiators and the monomers, we have achieved outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%) under near stoichiometric DHF loading conditions. Notably, we have also found that the use of a more sterically hindered Ru initiator helps to attain polymer backbones with higher DHF incorporation and superior&#8197;A, B&#8208;alternation. While preserving the living characteristics of DHF copolymerization, as evidenced by controlled molecular weights (up to 73.9&#8197;kDa), narrow dispersities (down to 1.05), and block copolymer formation, our DHF copolymers could be broken down to a single repeat unit level under acidic conditions. 1H&#8197;NMR analysis of the model copolymer revealed that after 24&#8197;hours of degradation, up to 80&#8201;% of the initial polymer was transformed into a single small molecule product, and after purification, up to 66&#8201;% of the degradation product was retrieved. This study provides a versatile approach to improve the alternation and degradability of DHF copolymers.

&lt;p&gt;2,3-Dihydrofuran (DHF) has recently been gaining significant attention as a comonomer in metathesis polymerization, thanks to its ability to provide the resultant polymer backbones with stimuli-responsive degradability. In this report, we present living alternating copolymerization of DHF with less reactive &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-tricyclo[4.2.2.0&lt;sup&gt;2,5&lt;/sup&gt;]deca-3,9-dienes (TDs) and &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-oxonorbornenes (oxoNBs). By carefully controlling the reactivity of both the Ru initiators and the monomers, we have achieved outstanding A, B-alternation (up to 98&#8201;%) under near stoichiometric DHF loading conditions. Notably, we have also found that the use of a more sterically hindered Ru initiator helps to attain polymer backbones with higher DHF incorporation and superior&#8197;A, B-alternation. While preserving the living characteristics of DHF copolymerization, as evidenced by controlled molecular weights (up to 73.9&#8197;kDa), narrow dispersities (down to 1.05), and block copolymer formation, our DHF copolymers could be broken down to a single repeat unit level under acidic conditions. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR analysis of the model copolymer revealed that after 24&#8197;hours of degradation, up to 80&#8201;% of the initial polymer was transformed into a single small molecule product, and after purification, up to 66&#8201;% of the degradation product was retrieved. This study provides a versatile approach to improve the alternation and degradability of DHF copolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Deubiquitinase (DUB) Small&#8208;Molecule Activity&#8208;Based Probe Enables Broad Spectrum DUB Activity Profiling in Living Cells

IMP&#8208;2373 is the first activity&#8208;based probe (ABP) that captures the activity of a large portion of the &#8220;DUBome&#8221; across multiple deubiquitinase (DUB) sub&#8208;classes with limited off&#8208;target effects in living cells, providing a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs, which function only in lysates. IMP&#8208;2373 enables researchers to profile DUB inhibitors target engagement and selectivity in cells, and to understand DUB activity in disease&#8208;relevant systems.







Abstract
Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a family of &gt;100 proteases that hydrolyze isopeptide bonds linking ubiquitin to protein substrates, often leading to reduced substrate degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Deregulation of DUB activity has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and auto&#8208;inflammation, and several have been recognized as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Ubiquitin&#8208;derived covalent activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) provide a powerful tool for DUB activity profiling, but their large recognition element impedes cellular permeability and presents an unmet need for small molecule ABPs which can account for regulation of DUB activity in intact cells or organisms. Here, through comprehensive chemoproteomic warhead profiling, we identify cyanopyrrolidine (CNPy) probe IMP&#8208;2373 (12) as a small molecule pan&#8208;DUB ABP to monitor DUB activity in physiologically relevant live cells. Through proteomics and targeted assays, we demonstrate that IMP&#8208;2373 quantitatively engages more than 35&#8197;DUBs across a range of non&#8208;toxic concentrations in diverse cell lines. We further demonstrate its application to quantification of changes in intracellular DUB activity during pharmacological inhibition and during MYC deregulation in a model of B cell lymphoma. IMP&#8208;2373 thus offers a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs to monitor dynamic DUB activity in the context of disease&#8208;relevant phenotypes.

         <title>Highly Recyclable and Tough Elastic Vitrimers from a Defined Polydimethylsiloxane Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel network design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers, and a series of physical analysis is performed to provide a deep structure&#8208;property understanding for the excellent performance of the defined&#8208;network vitrimers.







Abstract
Despite intensive research on sustainable elastomers, achieving elastic vitrimers with significantly improved mechanical properties and recyclability remains a scientific challenge. Herein, inspired by the classical elasticity theory, we present a design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers with a defined network constructed by chemically crosslinking the pre&#8208;synthesized disulfide&#8208;containing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chains with tetra&#8208;arm polyethylene glycol (PEG). The defined network is achieved by the reduced dangling short chains and the relatively uniform molecular weight of network strands. Such elastic vitrimers with the defined network, i.e., PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D, exhibit significantly improved mechanical performance than random analogous, previously reported PDMS vitrimers, and even commercial silicone&#8208;based thermosets. Moreover, unlike the vitrimers with random network that show obvious loss in mechanical properties after recycling, those with the defined network enable excellent thermal recyclability. The PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D also deliver comparable electrochemical signals if utilized as substrates for electromyography sensors after the recycling. The multiple relaxation processes are revealed via a unique physical approach. Multiple techniques are also applied to unravel the microscopic mechanism of the excellent mechanical performance and recyclability of such defined network.

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;linked Iron&#8208;coordinated Tetrapyrrole Conjugated Organic Polymer Catalyst with Spatially Proximate Donor&#8208;Acceptor Pairs for Oxygen Reduction in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially proximate electron donor&#8208;acceptor pairs are integrated into conjugated organic polymers, which enables fine tailoring of iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (FePr) active sites at the molecular level. The innovative catalyst endows FePr sites with a covalently bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and a highly dense distribution, leading to unprecedented performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated iron (Fe&#8722;N4) materials represent the most promising non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells. However, molecular&#8208;level structure design of Fe&#8722;N4 electrocatalyst remains a great challenge. In this study, we develop a novel Fe&#8722;N4 conjugated organic polymer (COP) electrocatalyst, which allows for precise design of the Fe&#8722;N4 structure, leading to unprecedented ORR performance. At the molecular level, we have successfully organized spatially proximate iron&#8208;pyrrole/pyrazine (FePr/Pz) pairs into fully conjugated polymer networks, which in turn endows FePr sites with firmly covalent&#8208;bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and highly dense distribution. The resulting pyrazine&#8208;linked iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (Pz&#8722;FeTPr) COP electrocatalyst exhibits superior performance compared to most ORR electrocatalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.933 V and negligible activity decay after 40,000&#8197;cycles. When used as the cathode electrocatalyst in a hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell, the Pz&#8722;FeTPr COP achieves a peak power density of &#8776;210&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. We anticipate the COP based Fe&#8722;N4 catalyst design could be an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance catalyst for facilitating the progress of fuel cells.

         <title>Synthesizing Interpenetrated Triazine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an environmentally&#8208;friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from CO2 molecules as a precursor. Two&#8208;step reactions using NaBH4, piperazine and melamine with CO2 provided high crystalline structure. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure showing 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 of BET surface area and structural integrity. This structure transforms to high proton conductor upon post&#8208;modification reaction with Oxone.







Abstract
Crystalline triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are aromatic nitrogen&#8208;rich porous materials. COFs typically show high thermal/chemical stability, and are promising for energy applications, but often require harsh synthesis conditions and suffer from low crystallinity. In this work, we propose an environmentally friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline COFs from CO2 molecules as a precursor. The mass ratio of CO2 conversion into COFs formula unit reaches 46.3&#8201;%. The synthesis consists of two steps; preparation of 1,4&#8208;piperazinedicarboxaldehyde from CO2 and piperazine, and condensation of the dicarboxaldehyde and melamine to construct the framework. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of 2D layers determined by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and select&#8208;area electron diffraction. The structure shows a high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface area of 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high stability against strong acid (6&#8197;M HCl), base (6&#8197;M NaOH), and boiling water over 24&#8197;hours. Post&#8208;modification of the framework with oxone has been demonstrated to modulate hydrophilicity, and it exhibits proton conductivity of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 85&#8201;&#176;C, 95&#8201;% of relative humidity.

         <title>Structures, Bonding Analyses and Reactivity of a Dicationic Digallene and Diindene Mimicking trans&#8208;bent Ditetrylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of group 13 compounds featuring the first cationic, trans&#8208;bent double bonded digallene and diindene with the bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane ligand is reported. Their bonding situations are extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations and compared to that in isoelectronic, neutral digermenes and distannenes. Several oxidative addition reactions to the digallene were studied.







Abstract
The reaction of bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane (dcpe) and the subvalent MI sources [MI(PhF)2][pf] (M=Ga+, In+; [pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3) yielded the salts [{M(dcpe)}2][pf]2, containing the first dicationic, trans&#8208;bent digallene and diindene structures reported so far. The non&#8208;classical MI&#8646;MI double bonds are surprisingly short and display a ditetrylene&#8208;like structure. The bonding situation was extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations, QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with the combination of Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence) analyses and is compared to that in the isoelectronic and isostructural, but neutral digermenes and distannenes. The dissolved [{Ga(dcpe)}2]2+([pf]&#8722;)2 readily reacts with 1&#8208;hexene, cyclooctyne, diphenyldisulfide, diphenylphosphine and under mild conditions at room temperature. This reactivity is analyzed and rationalized.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Zinc Sites with Synergetic Multiple Coordination Shells for Electrochemical H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety modulated with S species in higher coordination shells is obtained by a general two&#8208;step strategy. The synergy between the nearest N2O2 coordination and S atoms in the second coordination shell leads to robust Zn sites with optimized electronic structure and nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate. The Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance.







Abstract
Precise manipulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), particularly the simultaneous engineering of multiple coordination shells, is crucial to maximize their catalytic performance but remains challenging. Herein, we present a general two&#8208;step strategy to fabricate a series of hollow carbon&#8208;based SACs featuring asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moieties simultaneously modulated with S atoms in higher coordination shells of Zn centers (n&#8805;2; designated as Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S). Systematic analyses demonstrate that the synergetic effects between the N2O2 species in the first coordination shell and the S atoms in higher coordination shells lead to robust discrete Zn sites with the optimal electronic structure for selective O2 reduction to H2O2. Remarkably, the Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety with S atoms in the second coordination shell possesses a nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate, which favors the formation and desorption of OOH* on Zn sites for H2O2 generation. Consequently, the Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S SAC exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance with high selectivity of 96&#8201;%. Even at a high current density of 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow cell, it shows a high H2O2 production rate of 6.924&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an average Faradaic efficiency of 93.1&#8201;%, and excellent durability over 65&#8197;h.

         <title>Is &#8220;Water in Salt&#8221; Electrolytes the Ultimate Solution? Achieving High Stability of Organic Anodes in Diluted Electrolyte Solutions Via a Wise Anions Selection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the use of highly concentrated electrolytes has become a popular approach to stabilize electrodes in aqueous environments, we demonstrated in this paper that diluted electrolytes can also be effectively used. By appropriate selection of chaotropic anions, we show that the performance of PTCDA electrodes can be substantially improved and maintain excellent stability even at extremely diluted solutions.







Abstract
The introduction of the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) electrolytes concept to prevent water splitting and widen the electrochemical stability window, has spurred extensive research efforts toward development of improved aqueous batteries. The successful implementation of these electrolyte solutions in many electrochemical systems shifts the focus from diluted to WIS electrolyte solutions. Considering the high costs and the tendency of these nearly saturated solutions to crystallize, this trend can be carefully re&#8208;evaluated. Herein we show that the stability of organic electrodes comprising the active material perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is strongly influenced by the solvation character of the anions rather than the concentration of the electrolyte solution. Even though the charging process of PTCDA involves solely insertion of cations (i.e., principal counter&#8208;ions), surprisingly, the dominant factor influencing its electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;term electrode stability, is the type of the co&#8208;ions (i.e., electrolytic anions). Using systematic electrochemical analysis combined with theoretical simulations, we show that the selection of kosmotropic anions results in fast fading of the PTCDA anodes, while a selection of chaotropic anions leads to excellent stability, even at electrolytes concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;M. These findings provide a new conceptual approach for designing advanced electrolyte solutions for aqueous batteries.

         <title>In Situ Spectroscopic Detection of Large&#8208;Scale Reorientations of Transmembrane Helices During Influenza A M2 Channel Opening
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viroporins are small viral ion channels that play essential roles during viral infections. Using surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy we track and quantify the large&#8208;scale structural changes during opening of the Influenza A viroporin, the M2 proton channel, in a model membrane. This motion is blocked by inhibition providing a clear spectroscopic strategy to explore mechanisms of viroporin function and test new antiviral drugs.







Abstract
Viroporins are small ion channels in membranes of enveloped viruses that play key roles during viral life cycles. To use viroporins as drug targets against viral infection requires in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding and, with that, methods that enable investigations under in situ conditions. Here, we apply surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to Influenza A M2 reconstituted within a solid&#8208;supported membrane, to shed light on the mechanics of its viroporin function. M2 is a paradigm of pH&#8208;activated proton channels and controls the proton flux into the viral interior during viral infection. We use SEIRA to track the large&#8208;scale reorientation of M2&#8217;s transmembrane &#945;&#8208;helices in situ during pH&#8208;activated channel opening. We quantify this event as a helical tilt from 26&#176; to 40&#176; by correlating the experimental results with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#8208;informed computational spectroscopy. This mechanical motion is impeded upon addition of the inhibitor rimantadine, giving a direct spectroscopic marker to test antiviral activity. The presented approach provides a spectroscopic tool to quantify large&#8208;scale structural changes and to track the function and inhibition of the growing number of viroporins from pathogenic viruses in future studies.

&lt;p&gt;Viroporins are small viral ion channels that play essential roles during viral infections. Using surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy we track and quantify the large-scale structural changes during opening of the Influenza A viroporin, the M2 proton channel, in a model membrane. This motion is blocked by inhibition providing a clear spectroscopic strategy to explore mechanisms of viroporin function and test new antiviral drugs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viroporins are small ion channels in membranes of enveloped viruses that play key roles during viral life cycles. To use viroporins as drug targets against viral infection requires in-depth mechanistic understanding and, with that, methods that enable investigations under in situ conditions. Here, we apply surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to Influenza A M2 reconstituted within a solid-supported membrane, to shed light on the mechanics of its viroporin function. M2 is a paradigm of pH-activated proton channels and controls the proton flux into the viral interior during viral infection. We use SEIRA to track the large-scale reorientation of M2&#8217;s transmembrane &#945;-helices in situ during pH-activated channel opening. We quantify this event as a helical tilt from 26&#176; to 40&#176; by correlating the experimental results with solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance-informed computational spectroscopy. This mechanical motion is impeded upon addition of the inhibitor rimantadine, giving a direct spectroscopic marker to test antiviral activity. The presented approach provides a spectroscopic tool to quantify large-scale structural changes and to track the function and inhibition of the growing number of viroporins from pathogenic viruses in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mixed Valence BN&#8208;Doped Corannulene Trimer Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;valence (MV) dimers have been extensively investigated, however, the structures and properties of purely organic MV trimers based on open&#8208;shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons remain elusive. Herein, unprecedented MV BN&#8208;doped corannulene radical cations [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8226;&#8226;2+&#8226;2[BArylF4]&#8208; and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8226;&#8226;2+&#8226;2[BArylF4]&#8208; were synthesized via chemical oxidation, and their structures were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These uncommon radical cations consist of three corannulene cores and two [BArylF4]&#8208; anions, and three corannulene motifs [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8226;&#8226;2+ and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8226;&#8226;2+ in the unit cell exhibit a trimer structure with a slipped &#960;&#8208;stacking configuration. Detailed structural analyses further revealed that the corannulene cores exhibit an infinite layered self&#8208;assembly configuration, allowing their potential applications as building blocks for molecular conductors. The detection of forbidden transition (&#916;ms = &#177; 2) by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy further confirmed the existence of two unpaired electrons in the &#960;&#8208;trimers and the MV characteristic of these two species. Variable&#8208;temperature EPR and conductivity measurements suggested that the BN&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;trimers exhibited antiferromagnetic coupling and conductivity properties</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we introduce phosphorus, a pnictogen, as an exchange center for dynamic covalent chemistry.&#160; Cascade exchange of neutral phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates with thiolates is demonstrated in organic solvents, aqueous micellar systems, and in living cells.&#160; Exchange rates increase with pH, electrophilicity of the exchange center and nucleophilicity of the exchangers.&#160; Molecular walking of the dynamic phosphorus along Hammett gradients is simulated by the sequential addition of thiolate exchangers.&#160; Compared to phosphorotrithioates, tetrathioates are better electrophiles with higher exchange rates.&#160; Dynamic phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates are non&#8208;toxic to HeLa Kyoto cells and participate in the dynamic networks that account for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake into living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Density Lipoprotein&#8208;Based Nanomedicine to Silence SOCS1 in Tumor Microenvironment and Trigger Antitumor Immunity against Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunotherapies have shed light on the treatment of many cancers, but have not improved outcomes of glioma (GBM). Here, we demonstrate that suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is associated with the GBM&#8208;associated immunosuppression and develop a multifunctional nanomedicine, which silences SOCS1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM and triggers strong antitumor immunity against GBM. Synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) was selected as the nanocarrier and a peptide was used to facilitate the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration. The nanocarrier was functioned with a siRNA, a peptide vaccine, and an adjuvant to trigger antitumor immunity. In vivo, the nanomedicine concentrated on the TME, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. Our work provides an alternative strategy to simultaneously target and modulate TME in GBM patients and points to an avenue for improving the efficacy of immunotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Binary Silicon&#8208;Centered Organoboron Catalyst with Superior Performance to That of Its Bifunctional Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reported a silicon&#8208;centered alkyl borane /ammonium salt binary (two&#8208;component) catalyst exhibits much higher activity than its bifunctional analogue (one&#8208;component) for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide, showing 7.3 times the activity of its bifunctional analogue at a low catalyst loading of 0.01 mol%, and even 15.3 times at an extremely low loading of 0.002 mol%. Via 19F NMR, control experiments, and theoretical calculation, we discovered that the central silicon atom displays appropriate electron density and a larger intramolecular cavity, which is useful to co&#8208;activate the monomer and to deliver propagating chains, thus leading to a better intramolecular synergic effect than its bifunctional analogue. A unique two&#8208;pathway initiation mode was proposed to explain the unusual high activity for the binary catalytic system. This study breaks the traditional impression of the binary Lewis acid/nucleophilic catalyst with poor activity due to the increase in entropy.</dc:description>

         <title>Green ether electrolytes for sustainable high&#8208;voltage potassium ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are promising for secondary batteries due to their good compatibility with alkali metal anodes and high ionic conductivity. However, they suffer from poor oxidative stability and high toxicity, leading to severe electrolyte decomposition at high voltage and biosafety/environmental concerns when electrolyte leakage occurs. Here, we report a green ether solvent through a rational design of carbon&#8208;chain regulation to elicit steric hindrance, such a structure significantly reducing the solvent's biotoxicity and tuning the solvation structure of electrolytes. Notably, our solvent design is versatile, and an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is favored, facilitating a stable interphase formation on both the anode and cathode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, the green ether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates excellent compatibility with K metal and graphite anode and a 4.2 V high&#8208;voltage cathode (200 cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 99.64%). This work points to a promising path toward the molecular design of green ether&#8208;based electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage potassium&#8208;ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Intermolecular carbophosphination reaction of alkynes or alkenes with unreactive C&#8211;P bonds remains an elusive challenge. Herein, we used Ni&#8211;Al bimetallic catalyst to realize an intermolecular carbophosphination reaction of alkynes with 5&#8208;membered phosphole oxides, providing a series of 7&#8208;membered phosphepines in up to 94% yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Chelating Aziridines and Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes (CAACs) from Pyridyl&#8208;Tethered Robust Azomethine Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridyl&#8208;tethered robust azomethine ylide thermally rearranges to a chelating cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) by the mediacy of CuCl in an intriguing fashion. However, without the CuCl, it cyclizes to a chelating aziridine. Both are bidentate ligands giving cationic Rh(I) complexes that are highly active catalysts for olefin hydrosilylation. The aziridine&#8208;based catalyst was surprisingly found to show superior reactivity.







Abstract
Azomethine ylides are typically in situ generated synthons for making N&#8208;heterocycles through cycloaddition reactions. But an offbeat aspect about them is the isomeric nature of aldiminium&#8208;based azomethine ylides and (alkyl/aryl)(amino)carbenes, interconvertible by a formal 1,3&#8208;H+ transfer. Herein, two thermally robust azomethine ylides with a N&#8208;appended picolyl sidearm are isolated, which cyclize to pyaziridines at 80&#8201;&#176;C but unprecedentedly result N&#8722;picoCAAC&#8208;CuCl (CAAC=cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes when heated with CuCl at merely 60&#8201;&#176;C. The pendant Npy, as revealed by computational analysis, plays a crucial role in this unusual 1,3&#8208;H+ shift using a deprotonation&#8208;protonation sequence, as well as in placing the CuCl at the carbenic site in tandem. The softer nature of Cu(I) is also critical. Chelating CAACs are rare and one with a N&#8208;tethered additional donor is priorly unknown. Both N&#8208;picoCAAC and pyaziridine are bidentate chelators giving highly active cationic Rh(I) catalysts for hydrosilylating unactivated olefins by Et3SiH. Notably, the pyaziridine&#8208;Rh(I) is superior than the N&#8208;picoCAAC&#8208;Rh(I) catalyst.

         <title>Structure and Function of the &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation Bimodule of the Mupirocin Polyketide Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important polyketide antibiotic bearing a 6&#8208;hydroxy group that is essential for biological activity. NMR spectroscopy, authentic synthetic substrates and mass spectrometry were used to establish the mechanistic steps governing incorporation of this key 6&#8208;hydroxy group by an &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule that recruits a trans acting monooxygenase, MupA.







Abstract
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by a trans&#8208;AT Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in Pseudomonas fluorescens. The major bioactive metabolite, pseudomonic acid A (PA&#8722;A), is assembled on a tetrasubstituted tetrahydropyran (THP) core incorporating a 6&#8208;hydroxy group proposed to be introduced by &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the thioester of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) bound polyketide chain. Herein, we describe an in vitro approach combining purified enzyme components, chemical synthesis, isotopic labelling, mass spectrometry and NMR in conjunction with in vivo studies leading to the first characterisation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule of the mupirocin biosynthetic pathway. These studies reveal the precise timing of hydroxylation by MupA, substrate specificity and the ACP dependency of the enzyme components that comprise this &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule. Furthermore, using purified enzyme, it is shown that the MmpA KS0 shows relaxed substrate specificity, suggesting precise spatiotemporal control of in trans MupA recruitment in the context of the PKS. Finally, the detection of multiple intermodular MupA/ACP interactions suggests these bimodules may integrate MupA into their assembly.

         <title>Stereospecific Aminative Cyclizations Triggered by Intermolecular Aza&#8208;Prilezhaev Alkene Aziridination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under acidic reaction conditions (TFA), deprotection of BocNR(OSO2R) reagents triggers intermolecular aminative cyclizations of alkenes equipped with pendant nucleophiles. The processes are predicated on a sequence of stereospecific intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by the pendant nucleophile. The method offers broad scope with respect to the nucleophile (N&#8208;, O&#8208; or C&#8208;based), alkene and cyclization mode, allowing the installation of two contiguous stereocenters under operationally simple conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahedraphene: A Csp3&#8208;centered 3D Molecular Nanographene Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of 3D tetrakis(hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenyl)methane, &#8220;tetrahedraphene&#8221;, is reported. This molecular nanographene constituted by four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) units attached to a central sp3 carbon atom, shows a highly symmetric arrangement of the HBC units disposed in the apex of a tetrahedron. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals a tetrahedral symmetry of the molecule and the packing in the crystal is achieved mostly by CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions since the interstitial solvent molecules prevent the &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. In solution, tetrahedraphene shows the same electrochemical and photophysical properties as the hexa&#8208;tBu&#8208;substituted HBC (tBu&#8208;HBC) molecule. However, upon water addition, it undergoes a fluorescence change in solution and in the precipitated solid, showing an aggregation induced emission (AIE) process, probably derived from the restriction in the rotation and/or vibration of the HBCs. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations reveal that upon aggregation, the high energy region of the emission band decreases in intensity, whereas the intensity of the red edge emission signal increases and presents a smoother decay, compared to the non&#8208;aggregated molecule. All in all, the excellent correlation between our simulations and the experimental findings allows explaining the colour change observed in the different solutions upon increasing the water fraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Subrutilane &#8211; A Hexacyclic Sesterterpene from Streptomyces subrutilus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mining of a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus resulted in the identification of the hexacyclic sesterterpene subrutilane, besides eight pentacyclic side products. Subrutilane represents the first case of a saturated sesterterpene hydrocarbon. Its structure including the absolute configuration was unambiguously determined through X&#8208;ray analysis and stereoselective deuteration. The cyclisation mechanism to subrutilane and its side products was investigated in all detail by isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The subrutilane synthase (SrS) also converted (2Z)&#8208;GFPP into one major product. Additional compounds were obtained from the substrate analogs (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP and (2Z,7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP with a blocked reactivity in the C6&#8208;C7 bond. Interestingly, the early steps of the cyclisation cascade with (2Z)&#8208;GFPP and the saturated substrate analogs were analogous to those of GFPP, but then deviations from the natural cyclisation mode occur.</dc:description>

The cyclisation mechanism to subrutilane and its side products was investigated in all detail by isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The subrutilane synthase (SrS) also converted (2Z)-GFPP into one major product. Additional compounds were obtained from the substrate analogs (7R)-6,7-dihydro-GFPP and (2Z,7R)-6,7-dihydro-GFPP with a blocked reactivity in the C6-C7 bond. Interestingly, the early steps of the cyclisation cascade with (2Z)-GFPP and the saturated substrate analogs were analogous to those of GFPP, but then deviations from the natural cyclisation mode occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Complex Diarylamines through a Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diarylation and skeletal diversification of unstrained cyclic amines was exploited to expand and modify the favorable properties of this important substrate class with pivotal roles in drug discovery. Cyclic amines were employed in the synthesis of a novel class of amino&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts, which were converted to highly functionalized diarylamines through an atom&#8208;efficient one&#8208;pot N&#8208;arylation/ ring opening reaction with external nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds through in situ formation of a diarylammonium intermediate that undergoes a nucleophilic ring opening by cleavage of the strong C&#8208;N bond. A wide variety of diarylamines was obtained through introduction of two different aryl groups of varied electronics, and the retained iodo&#8208;substituent enables downfield diversifications of the products. More than 20 nucleophiles, including amines, phenols, carboxylic acids, thiols and halides, were alkylated with high functional group tolerance, and the strategy proved efficient also in in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Glycan&#8208;Binding Protein Recognition Using a Fluorinated Azido&#8208;Coumarin Fucoside</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycan recognition by glycan&#8208;binding proteins is central to the biology of all living organisms. The efficient capture and characterization of relatively weak non&#8208;covalent interactions remains an important challenge in various fields of research. Photoaffinity labeling strategies can create covalent bonds between interacting partners, and photoactive scaffolds such as benzophenone, diazirines and aryl azides have proved widely useful. Since their first introduction, relatively few improvements have been advanced and products of photoaffinity labeling remain difficult to detect. We report a fluorinated azido&#8208;coumarin scaffold which enables photolabeling under fast and mild activation, and which can leave a fluorescent tag on crosslinked species. Coupling this scaffold to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photolabeling of glycan&#8208;protein interactions over a wide range of affinities. We expect this strategy to be broadly applicable to other chromophores and we envision that such &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; could become important tools for the traceable capture of non&#8208;covalent binding events.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability Investigations on a Pt@HGS Catalyst as a Model Material for Fuel Cell Applications: The Role of the Local pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the resistance of catalysts against electroche&#173;mical degradation is one of the key requirements for the wider use of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). Here, we study the degradation of one entity of a highly stable catalyst, Pt@HGS, on a nanoelectrode under accelerated mass transport conditions. We find that the catalyst degrades more rapidly than expected based on previous ensemble measurements. Corroborated by identical location transmission electron microscopy and catalyst layer experiments, we deduce that locally different pH values are likely the reason for this difference in stability. Ultimately, this work provides insights into the actual conditions present in a PEMFC and raises questions about the applicability of accelerated stress tests usually performed to evaluate catalyst stability, particularly when they are performed in half&#8208;cell setups under inert gas.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins on a Silicon Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adsorption of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) on silicon is investigated in a combined scanning tunneling microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory study. We find that both of the studied NHOs bind covalently, with ylidic character, to the silicon adatoms of the substrate and exhibit good thermal stability. The adsorption geometry strongly depends on the N&#8208;substituents: for large N&#8208;substituents, an upright adsorption geometry is favored, while a flat&#8208;lying geometry is found for the NHO with smaller wingtips. These different geometries strongly influence the quality and properties of the obtained monolayers. The upright geometry leads to the formation of ordered monolayers, whereas the flat&#8208;lying NHOs yield a mostly disordered, but denser, monolayer. The obtained monolayers both show large work function reductions, as the higher density of the flat&#8208;lying monolayer is found to compensate for the smaller vertical dipole moments. Our findings offer new prospects in the design of tailor&#8208;made ligand structures in organic electronics and optoelectronics, catalysis, and material science.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes remains a formidable challenge, presumably due to the lack of rational design of substrates, right choice of reactions together with highly effective catalysis systems. Herein, we disclosed an efficient and practical DKR&#8208;involving (dynamic kinetic resolution) cascade strategy toward synthesizing a novel family of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis. The sequential process of PPS&#8208;catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael attack and copper salt&#8208;facilitated aromatization led to the formation of unprecedented phosphorus&#8208;containing oxa[5]helicene scaffolds. A wide variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups were compatible with this protocol, furnishing the expected helical compounds in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. Additionally, the helical products could be conveniently elaborated to promising phosphine ligands with perfectly retained helical chirality, which turned out to be highly efficient chiral ligands in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. These findings not only expand the current library of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes but also offer insights to explore other challenging scaffolds with molecular chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Sialyl Lewisa Antigen and the Effective Anticancer Activity of Its Bacteriophage Q&#946; Conjugate as an Anticancer Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyl Lewisa is an attractive carbohydrate&#8208;associated cancer antigen. To develop an effective sialyl Lewisa based vaccine, the stereoselective synthesis of sialyl Lewisa tetrasaccharide was accomplished. The glycan was covalently conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946;, which induced higher levels of and persistent anti&#8208;sialyl Lewisa IgG antibody responses, thus providing significant tumor protection in a metastatic cancer model in mice.







Abstract
Sialyl Lewisa (sLea), also known as cancer antigen 19&#8208;9 (CA19&#8208;9), is a tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigen. The overexpression of sLea on the surface of a variety of cancer cells makes it an attractive target for anticancer immunotherapy. However, sLea&#8208;based anticancer vaccines have been under&#8208;explored. To develop a new vaccine, efficient stereoselective synthesis of sLea with an amine&#8208;bearing linker was achieved, which was subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage, Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;&#8208;sLea conjugate generated strong and long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;sLea IgG antibody responses, which were superior to those induced by the corresponding conjugate of sLea with the benchmark carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies elicited by Q&#946;&#8208;sLea were highly selective toward the sLea structure, could bind strongly with sLea&#8208;expressing cancer cells and human pancreatic cancer tissues, and kill tumor cells through complement&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, vaccination with Q&#946;&#8208;sLea significantly reduced tumor development in a metastatic cancer model in mice, demonstrating tumor protection for the first time by a sLea&#8208;based vaccine, thus highlighting the significant potential of sLea as a promising cancer antigen.

&lt;p&gt;Sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; is an attractive carbohydrate-associated cancer antigen. To develop an effective sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; based vaccine, the stereoselective synthesis of sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; tetrasaccharide was accomplished. The glycan was covalently conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946;, which induced higher levels of and persistent anti-sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; IgG antibody responses, thus providing significant tumor protection in a metastatic cancer model in mice.
&lt;/p&gt;
