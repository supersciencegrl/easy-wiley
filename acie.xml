         <title>Low&#8208;silica Cu&#8208;CHA Zeolite Enriched with Al Pairs Transcribed from Silicoaluminophosphate Seed: Synthesis and Ammonia Selective Catalytic Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;exchanged low&#8208;silica CHA zeolites (Si/Al &#8804; 4) synthesized without organic templates are promising candidate catalysts for ammonia selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NH3&#8208;SCR), but their practical application is restricted due to the low hydrothermal stability. Here, inspired by the transcription from duplex DNA to RNA, we synthesized Al pairs enriched low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite (CHA&#8208;SPAEI, Si/Al = 3.7) by using silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) featured by strict alternation of &#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8211;P(Si)&#8211;O&#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8211; tetrahedra as seed. The proportion of Al pairs in CHA&#8208;SPAEI is 78%, which is much higher than that in the conventional low&#8208;silica CHA (CHA&#8208;LS, 52%). After hydrothermal ageing at 800 &#176;C for 6 h, Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;SPAEI shows NO conversion above 90% within 225&#8208;500 &#176;C under a gas hourly space velocity of 200,000 h&#8208;1, which is much better than that of Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;LS. The spatial close proximity of Al pairs in CHA&#8208;SPAEI is confirmed by the 27Al double&#8208;quantum single&#8208;quantum two&#8208;dimensional NMR analyses. The strict &#8208;P(Si)&#8208;O&#8208;Al&#8208;O&#8208;P(Si)&#8208;O&#8208; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promotes the Al pairs with the &#8208;Al&#8208;O&#8208;Si&#8208;O&#8208;Al&#8208;O&#8208; sequence via a transcription process. The utilization of aluminophosphate&#8208;based zeolites as seeds opens up a new avenue for the regulation of the Al distribution in zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic insight into anion&#8208;binding catalytic living cationic polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution reports in&#8208;depth mechanistic insight into anion&#8208;binding catalytic living cationic polymerization in which the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalyst and the roles of anion&#8208;binding interactions in the whole catalytic cycle are elucidated through a combination of theoretical DFT study and experimental study.







Abstract
Exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions to catalyze challenging ionic polymerizations is an ambitious goal but is in its infancy. We recently demonstrated non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding catalysis as an effective methodology to enable living cationic polymerization (LCP) of vinyl ethers in an environmentally benign manner. Here, we further elucidate the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalysts and the roles of anion&#8208;binding interactions by a combined theoretical DFT study and experimental study. The investigation suggests that the distinct cis&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azane framework combined with &#8220;selenium effect&#8221; and electron&#8208;withdrawing 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2&#8208;Phenyl substitution pattern in catalyst enables a critical contribution to accessing excellent stability, anion affinity and solubility under polymerization conditions. Thus, the catalyst could leverage anion&#8208;binding interactions to precisely control reversible and transient dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium, allowing it to dynamically bind, recognize and pre&#8208;organize propagating ionic species and monomer, thereby facilitating efficient chain propagation and minimizing irreversible chain transfer events under mild conditions. The more in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism for anion&#8208;binding catalytic LCP reported herein should help to guide future catalyst design and to extend this concept to broader polymerization systems where ionic species serve as crucial intermediates.

         <title>Enantioselective Strategies for The Synthesis of N&#8722;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers are highlighted and discussed within this Review. In particular, the strategies and breakthroughs to obtain this novel and stimulating atropisomeric architecture are presented while a particular attention is given to mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
Axially chiral compounds have been always considered a laboratory curiosity with rare prospects of being applied in asymmetric synthesis. Things have changed very quickly in the last twenty years when it was understood the important role and the enormous impact that these compounds have in medicinal, biological and material chemistry. The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers became a rapidly expanding field and recent reports on the development of N&#8722;N atropisomers strongly prove how this research field is a hot topic open to new challenges and frontiers of asymmetric synthesis. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers highlighting the strategies and breakthroughs to obtain this novel and stimulating atropisomeric framework.

         <title>A Tandem&#8208;Locked Fluorescent NETosis Reporter for the Prognosis Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem&#8208;locked NETosis Reporter&#8197;1 (TNR1) is developed for sensitive and specific NETosis detection. TNR1 activates fluorescence signals only in the presence of both neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, which are neutrophil granular proteases involved in NETs formation. TNR1 represents the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing living mice.







Abstract
NETosis, the peculiar type of neutrophil death, plays important roles in pro&#8208;tumorigenic functions and inhibits cancer immunotherapy. Non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time imaging is thus imperative for prognosis of cancer immunotherapy yet remains challenging. Herein, we report a Tandem&#8208;locked NETosis Reporter&#8197;1 (TNR1) that activates fluorescence signals only in the presence of both neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CTSG) for the specific imaging of NETosis. In the aspect of molecular design, the sequence of biomarker&#8208;specific tandem peptide blocks can largely affect the detection specificity towards NETosis. In live cell imaging, the tandem&#8208;locked design allows TNR1 to differentiate NETosis from neutrophil activation, while single&#8208;locked reporters fail to do so. The near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 in tumor from living mice were consistent with the intratumoral NETosis levels from histological results. Moreover, the near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 negatively correlated with tumor inhibition effect after immunotherapy, thereby providing prognosis for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, our study not only demonstrates the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing living mice, but also proposes a generic approach for tandem&#8208;locked probe design.

         <title>Construction of Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers via Asymmetric Metal Carbene gem&#8208;Dialkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazines is reported, which leads to poly&#8208;functionalized chiral ketones with excellent enantioselectivity. This unprecedented metal carbene gem&#8208;dialkylation reaction features a cascade formal asymmetric allylation and aminomethylation process with concomitant construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters using readily available materials.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters has received tremendous interest over the past decades, and numerous efficient protocols have been disclosed based on the formation of one C&#8722;C bond between two assembling reactants. However, the use of asymmetric multi&#8208;component reactions that build two C&#8722;C bonds on the same carbonic center with concomitant assembly of quaternary stereocenters is rare and remains challenging. Herein, we disclose an enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazines under dirhodium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalysis, which leads to a practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of poly&#8208;functionalized chiral ketones that bear a &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter in generally good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In comparison to the previous method for the construction of tertiary and quaternary stereocenters via carbene gem&#8208;difunctionalization reactions, this reaction features an unprecedented gem&#8208;dialkylation process via sequential installation of two C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene center in one reaction, providing an essential complement to the asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters using common and readily available starting materials.

&lt;p&gt;An enantioselective three-component reaction of &#945;-diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5-triazines is reported, which leads to poly-functionalized chiral ketones with excellent enantioselectivity. This unprecedented metal carbene &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dialkylation reaction features a cascade formal asymmetric allylation and aminomethylation process with concomitant construction of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters using readily available materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalytic asymmetric construction of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters has received tremendous interest over the past decades, and numerous efficient protocols have been disclosed based on the formation of one C&#8722;C bond between two assembling reactants. However, the use of asymmetric multi-component reactions that build two C&#8722;C bonds on the same carbonic center with concomitant assembly of quaternary stereocenters is rare and remains challenging. Herein, we disclose an enantioselective three-component reaction of &#945;-diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5-triazines under dirhodium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalysis, which leads to a practical and atom-economic synthesis of poly-functionalized chiral ketones that bear a &#945;-quaternary stereocenter in generally good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In comparison to the previous method for the construction of tertiary and quaternary stereocenters via carbene &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difunctionalization reactions, this reaction features an unprecedented &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dialkylation process via sequential installation of two C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene center in one reaction, providing an essential complement to the asymmetric construction of all-carbon quaternary stereocenters using common and readily available starting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Energy Conversion in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents fundamental strategies to prepare photoactive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and composite materials for diverse applications in photocatalytic water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, and hydrogen peroxide evolution.







Abstract
Intensifying energy crises and severe environmental issues have led to the discovery of renewable energy sources, sustainable energy conversion, and storage technologies. Photocatalysis is a green technology that converts eco&#8208;friendly solar energy into high&#8208;energy chemicals. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous materials constructed by covalent bonds that show promising potential for converting solar energy into chemicals owing to their pre&#8208;designable structures, high crystallinity, and porosity. Herein, we highlight recent progress in the synthesis of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and their applications in water splitting, CO2 reduction, and H2O2 production. The challenges and future opportunities for the rational design of COFs for advanced photocatalysts are discussed. This Review is expected to promote further development of COFs toward photocatalysis.

         <title>When High&#8208;Temperature Cesium Chemistry Meets Self&#8208;Templating: Metal Acetates as Building Blocks of Unusual Highly Porous Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbon with a large specific surface area of the order of 3000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and pore volume approaching 2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 is obtained by highly facile and straightforward pyrolysis of cesium acetate. The unique role of CsAc is revealed as a precursor, catalyst, physical template, and activating agent during the whole process.







Abstract
Self&#8208;templating is a facile strategy for synthesizing porous carbons by direct pyrolysis of organic metal salts. However, the method typically suffers from low yields (&lt;4%) and limited specific surface areas (SSA&lt;2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) originating from low activity of metal cations (e.g., K+ or Na+) in promoting construction and activation of carbon frameworks. Here we use cesium acetate as the only precursor of oxo&#8208;carbons with large SSA of the order of 3000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, pore volume approaching 2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, tunable oxygen contents, and yields of up to 15&#8201;%. We unravel the role of Cs+ as an efficient promoter of framework formation, templating and etching agent, while acetates act as carbon/oxygen sources of carbonaceous frameworks. The oxo&#8208;carbons show record&#8208;high CO2 uptake of 8.71&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an ultimate specific capacitance of 313&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the supercapacitor. This study helps to understand and rationally tailor the materials design by a still rare organic solid&#8208;state chemistry.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Domain versus Single&#8208;Domain: A Magnetic Field is Not a Must for Promoting Spin&#8208;Polarized Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic catalyst in single&#8208;domain exhibits similar water oxidation performance in the absence of an external magnetic field as does a multi&#8208;domain counterpart under magnetization. The findings tell that an external magnetic field is not the only way to take the benefits of spin&#8208;polarized water oxidation. Reducing the particle size into the single&#8208;domain region can also achieve the same.







Abstract
The reaction kinetics of spin&#8208;polarized oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be enhanced by ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts under an external magnetic field. However, applying a magnetic field necessitates additional energy consumption and creates design difficulties for OER. Herein, we demonstrate that a single&#8208;domain FM catalyst without external magnetic fields exhibits a similar OER increment to its magnetized multi&#8208;domain one. The evidence is given by comparing the pH&#8208;dependent increment of OER on multi&#8208; and single&#8208;domain FM catalysts with or without a magnetic field. The intrinsic activity of a single&#8208;domain catalyst is higher than that of a multi&#8208;domain counterpart. The latter can be promoted to approach the former by the magnetization effect. Reducing the FM catalyst size into the single&#8208;domain region, the spin&#8208;polarized OER performance can be achieved without a magnetic field, illustrating an external magnetic field is not a requirement to reap the benefits of magnetic catalysts.

         <title>A General Preparation of Solid Solution&#8208;Oxide Heterojunction Photocatalysts through Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Transformation Induced Pre&#8208;nucleation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we develop a generally applicable strategy to prepare the solid solution&#8208;oxide heterojunction through Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) transformation induced pre&#8208;nucleation. Our approach involved the transformation of MOFs possessing distinct topologies, leading to the pre&#8208;nucleation of the parent MOF in the form of an oxide within the pores of the daughter MOF. This transformative process was a pivotal step in synthesizing novel heterojunctions comprising solid solutions with significant variations of metal ions (Ce1&#8722;xTixO2) and rare earth oxide (CeO2).







Abstract
Solid solution&#8208;oxide heterostructures combine the advantages of solid solution and heterojunction materials to improve electronic structure and optical properties by metal doping, and enhance charge separation and transfer in semiconductor photocatalysts by creating a built&#8208;in electric field. Nevertheless, the effective design and synthesis of these materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we develop a generally applicable strategy that leverages the transformable properties of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to prepare solid solution&#8208;oxide heterojunctions with controllable structural and chemical compositions. The process consists of three main steps. First, MOFs with different topological structures and metal centers are transformed, accompanied by pre&#8208;nucleation of a metal oxide. Second, solid solution is prepared through calcination of the transformed MOFs. Finally, a heterojunction is formed by combining solid solution with another metal oxide group through endogenous overflow. DFT calculations and study on carrier dynamics show that the structure of the material effectively prevents electrons from returning to the bulk phase, exhibiting superior photocatalytic reduction performance of CO2. This study is expected to promote the controllable synthesis and research of MOF&#8208;derived heterojunctions.

         <title>Quantitative Point of Care Tests for Timely Diagnosis of Early&#8208;Onset Preeclampsia with High Sensitivity and Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preeclampsia is a cardiovascular complication that can occur during the second half of pregnancy. Here, we developed a point&#8208;of&#8208;care test incorporating upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based lateral flow strips conjugated to novel vascular biomarkers including FKBPL and CD44 proteins, for timely and reliable diagnosis of preeclampsia during pregnancy that can improve the odds of preventing major maternal complications and possibly death.







Abstract
Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous and multiorgan cardiovascular disorder of pregnancy. Here, we report the development of a novel strip&#8208;based lateral flow assay (LFA) using lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies targeting two different biomarkers for detection of preeclampsia. We first measured circulating plasma FKBPL and CD44 protein concentrations from individuals with early&#8208;onset preeclampsia (EOPE), using ELISA. We confirmed that the CD44/FKBPL ratio is reduced in EOPE with a good diagnostic potential. Using our rapid LFA prototypes, we achieved an improved lower limit of detection: 10&#8197;pg&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for FKBPL and 15&#8197;pg&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for CD44, which is more than one order lower than the standard ELISA method. Using clinical samples, a cut&#8208;off value of 1.24 for CD44/FKBPL ratio provided positive predictive value of 100&#8201;% and the negative predictive value of 91&#8201;%. Our LFA shows promise as a rapid and highly sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care test for preeclampsia.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Preeclampsia&lt;/i&gt; is a cardiovascular complication that can occur during the second half of pregnancy. Here, we developed a point-of-care test incorporating upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)-based lateral flow strips conjugated to novel vascular biomarkers including FKBPL and CD44 proteins, for timely and reliable diagnosis of preeclampsia during pregnancy that can improve the odds of preventing major maternal complications and possibly death.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous and multiorgan cardiovascular disorder of pregnancy. Here, we report the development of a novel strip-based lateral flow assay (LFA) using lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies targeting two different biomarkers for detection of preeclampsia. We first measured circulating plasma FKBPL and CD44 protein concentrations from individuals with early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE), using ELISA. We confirmed that the CD44/FKBPL ratio is reduced in EOPE with a good diagnostic potential. Using our rapid LFA prototypes, we achieved an improved lower limit of detection: 10&#8197;pg&#8201;ml&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for FKBPL and 15&#8197;pg&#8201;ml&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for CD44, which is more than one order lower than the standard ELISA method. Using clinical samples, a cut-off value of 1.24 for CD44/FKBPL ratio provided positive predictive value of 100&#8201;% and the negative predictive value of 91&#8201;%.

         <title>DNA Nanotechnology for Investigating Mechanical Signaling in the Immune System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we summarized the recent development of DNA nanotechnology for investigating mechanical forces in the immune system. We discussed the force sensing mechanisms of different DNA structures (DNA hairpin and DNA duplex), followed by a survey of DNA tension sensors and gates used to detect the immunoreceptor forces and manipulate mechanical signaling, respectively.







Abstract
Immune recognition occurs at specialized cell&#8208;cell junctions when immune cells and target cells physically touch. In this junction, groups of receptor&#8208;ligand complexes assemble and experience molecular forces that are ultimately generated by the cellular cytoskeleton. These forces are in the range of piconewton (pN) but play crucial roles in immune cell activation and subsequent effector responses. In this minireview, we will review the development of DNA based molecular tension sensors and their applications in mapping and quantifying mechanical forces experienced by immunoreceptors including T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR), Lymphocyte function&#8208;associated antigen (LFA&#8208;1), and the B&#8208;cell receptor (BCR) among others. In addition, we will highlight the use of DNA as a mechanical gate to manipulate mechanotransduction and decipher how mechanical forces regulate antigen discrimination and receptor signaling.

         <title>The Chemistry of the Cyaphide Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
128&#8197;years after the erroneously assumed synthesis of sodium cyaphide, Na(CP), and 51&#8197;years after the definitive proof of the existence of HCP, the chemistry of the cyaphide anion has finally gained momentum. This review summarizes the chemistry of the cyaphide anion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;, from its beginnings to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art.







Abstract
We review the known chemistry of the cyaphide ion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;. This remarkable diatomic anion has been the subject of study since the late nineteenth century, however its isolation and characterization eluded chemists for almost a hundred years. In this mini&#8208;review, we explore the pioneering synthetic experiments that first allowed for its isolation, as well as more recent developments demonstrating that cyaphide transfer is viable in well&#8208;established salt&#8208;metathesis protocols. The physical properties of the cyaphide ion are also explored in depth, allowing us to compare and contrast the chemistry of this ion with that of its lighter congener cyanide (an archetypal strong field ligand and important organic functional group). Recent studies show that the cyaphide ion has the potential to be used as a versatile chemical regent for the synthesis of novel molecules and materials, hinting at many interesting future avenues of investigation.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Difunctionalization of Nonactivated Alkenes for Double meta&#8208;C(sp2) &#8208;&gt;H/C&#8208;6(sp3) &#8208;&gt;H Functionalization</title>

         <dc:description>
The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote&#8208;difunctionalization of nonactivated alkenes for double meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H/C&#8208;6(sp3)&#8722;H transformations was achieved by metalla&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and &#963;&#8208;activation, featuring excellent site&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity, along with ample scope.







Abstract
Twofold distal C&#8722;H functionalization was accomplished by difunctionalization of nonactivated alkenes to provide rapid access to multifunctionalized molecules. The multicomponent ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote 1,n&#8208;difunctionalization (n=6,7) of nonactivated alkenes with fluoroalkyl halides and heteroarenes in a modular manner is reported. The meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H/C&#8208;6(sp3)&#8722;H distal functionalization featured mild conditions, unique selectivity, and broad substrate scope with a domino process for twofold remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of the sequential formation of three different carbon&#8208;centered radicals. A plausible mechanism was proposed based on detailed experimental and computational studies.

         <title>Mixed Conductive, Injectable, and Fluorescent Supramolecular Eutectogel Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first example of mixed ionic/electronic conductive eutectogel composites formed from low molecular weight gelators (LMWG) combined with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): chondroitin sulfate (ChS) and glycine/choline chloride (Gly/ChCl) deep eutectic solvent (DES). Eutectogels exhibit fluorescence, high combined conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and biocompatible properties to be used as injectable materials for bioimaging.







Abstract
Eutectogels are an emerging family of soft ionic materials alternative to ionic liquid gels and organogels, offering fresh perspectives for designing functional dynamic platforms in water&#8208;free environments. Herein, the first example of mixed ionic and electronic conducting supramolecular eutectogel composites is reported. A fluorescent glutamic acid&#8208;derived low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) was found to self&#8208;assemble into nanofibrillar networks in deep eutectic solvents (DES)/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): chondroitin sulfate dispersions. These dynamic materials displayed excellent injectability and self&#8208;healing properties, high ionic conductivity (up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), good biocompatibility, and fluorescence imaging ability. This set of features turns the mixed conducting supramolecular eutectogels into promising adaptive materials for bioimaging and electrostimulation applications.

         <title>Sodium Carbazolide and Derivatives as Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium carbazolide tetrahydrofuran derivatives, a new type of metalorganic&#8208;based materials intended for hydrogen storage, are fabricated and exhibit fast ionic conductivity as high as 1.20&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 1.95&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, with excellent interfacial stability against Na electrodes. A &#8220;neutral ligand&#8208;assisted&#8221; cation migration mechanism is proposed, providing a new strategy for design of superionic conductor.







Abstract
Replacing widely used organic liquid electrolytes with solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) could effectively solve the safety issues in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Efforts on seeking novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes have been continued for decades. However, issues about SSEs still exist, such as low ionic conductivity at ambient temperature, difficulty in manufacturing, low electrochemical stability, poor compatibility with electrodes, etc. Here, sodium carbazolide (Na&#8208;CZ) and its THF&#8208;coordinated derivatives are rationally fabricated as Na+ conductors, and two of their crystal structures are successfully solved. Among these materials, THF&#8208;coordinated complexes exhibit fast Na+ conductivities, i.e., 1.20&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 1.95&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C for Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;1THF and Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;2THF, respectively, which are among the top Na+ conductors under the same condition. Furthermore, stable Na plating/stripping is observed even over 400&#8197;h cycling, showing outstanding interfacial stability and compatibility against Na electrode. More advantages such as ease of synthesis, low&#8208;cost, and cold pressing for molding can be obtained. In situ NMR results revealed that the evaporation of THF may play an essential role in the Na+ migration, where the movement of THF creates defects/vacancies and facilitates the migration of Na+.

&lt;p&gt;Sodium carbazolide tetrahydrofuran derivatives, a new type of metalorganic-based materials intended for hydrogen storage, are fabricated and exhibit fast ionic conductivity as high as 1.20&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.95&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 90&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, with excellent interfacial stability against Na electrodes.

&lt;p&gt;Replacing widely used organic liquid electrolytes with solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) could effectively solve the safety issues in sodium-ion batteries. Efforts on seeking novel solid-state electrolytes have been continued for decades. However, issues about SSEs still exist, such as low ionic conductivity at ambient temperature, difficulty in manufacturing, low electrochemical stability, poor compatibility with electrodes, etc. Here, sodium carbazolide (Na-CZ) and its THF-coordinated derivatives are rationally fabricated as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductors, and two of their crystal structures are successfully solved. Among these materials, THF-coordinated complexes exhibit fast Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivities, i.e., 1.20&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.95&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 90&#8201;&#176;C for Na-CZ-1THF and Na-CZ-2THF, respectively, which are among the top Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductors under the same condition.

         <title>An Integrated Dual&#8208;Functional Nanotool Capable of Studying Single&#8208;Cell Epigenetics and Programmable Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;cell epigenetics is envisioned to decipher manifold epigenetic phenomena and to contribute to our accurate knowledge about basic epigenetic mechanisms. Engineered nanopipette technology has gained momentum in single&#8208;cell study, whereas solutions to epigenetic study remain unachieved. This study addresses the challenge by exploring N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;bearing deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) confined within nanopipette for profiling representative m6A modifying enzyme of fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). Electroosmotic intracellular extraction of FTO could remove the m6A and cause DNAzyme cleavage, leading to the altered ionic current signal. Because the cleavage can release a DNA sequence, we simultaneously program it as an antisense strand against FTO&#8208;mRNA, intracellular injection of which has been shown to induce early stage apoptosis. This nanotool thus features the dual functions of studying single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving White&#8208;Light Emission Using Organic Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission can be realized by purely organic phosphorescent emitters using either single&#8208;component or host&#8208;guest systems by mixing two fundamental colors (blue and yellow) or three primary colors (blue, green and red). Here we describe current strategies for achieving white phosphorescence at room&#8208;temperature using organic emitters.







Abstract
Artificial lighting currently consumes approximately one&#8208;fifth of global electricity production. Organic emitters with white persistent RTP have potential for applications in energy&#8208;efficient lighting technologies, due to their ability to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons. Compared to heavy metal phosphorescent materials, they have significant advantages in cost, processability, and reduced toxicity. Phosphorescence efficiency can be improved by introducing heteroatoms, heavy atoms, or by incorporating luminophores within a rigid matrix. White&#8208;light emission can be achieved by tuning the ratio of fluorescence to phosphorescence intensity or by pure phosphorescence with a broad emission spectrum. This review summarizes recent advances in the design of purely organic RTP materials with white&#8208;light emission, describing single&#8208;component and host&#8208;guest systems. White phosphorescent carbon dots and representative applications of white&#8208;light RTP materials are also introduced.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne Hydrocyanation toward Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereodivergent Synthesis of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;Trisubstituted Acrylonitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various trisubstituted E&#8208; and Z&#8208;acrylonitriles have been successfully synthesized from the same starting material via a ligand&#8208;controlled palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent hydrocyanation reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that Z&#8208;acrylonitriles were obtained by a sequential hydrocyanation/geometric isomerization (E to Z) pathway.







Abstract
We herein describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of propiolamides for the stereodivergent synthesis of trisubstituted acrylonitriles. This synthetic method tolerated various primary, secondary and tertiary propiolamides. The cautious selection of a suitable ligand is essential to the success of this stereodivergent process. Control experiments indicate the intermediacy of E&#8208;acrylonitriles, which lead to Z&#8208;acrylonitriles via isomerization. The density functional theory calculations suggests that the bidentate ligand L2 enables a feasible cyclometallation/isomerization pathway for the E to Z isomerization, while the monodentate ligand L1 inhibits the isomerization, leading to divergent stereoselectivity. The usefulness of this method can be demonstrated by the readily derivatization of products to give various E&#8208; and Z&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. In addition, the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;acrylonitrile products have also been successfully employed in cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Enhancing Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia over Cu Nanosheets via Facet Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance Cu nanosheet catalyst was developed for electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction. Benefiting from the tandem catalysis of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets, a NH3 partial current density of 665&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with NH3 yield rate of 1.41&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.59&#8197;V vs. RHE as well as high stability of 700&#8197;h in a flow cell were achieved.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into ammonia (NH3) represents a potential way for achieving carbon&#8208;free NH3 production while balancing the nitrogen cycle. Herein we report a high&#8208;performance Cu nanosheets catalyst which delivers a NH3 partial current density of 665&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and NH3 yield rate of 1.41&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell at &#8722;0.59&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The catalyst showed a high stability for 700&#8197;h with NH3 Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;88&#8201;% at 365&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy results verify that Cu nanosheets are in situ derived from the as&#8208;prepared CuO nanosheets under electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction conditions. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations indicate that the high performance is attributed to the tandem interaction of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets. The NO2&#8722; generated on the Cu(100) facets is subsequently hydrogenated on the Cu(111) facets, thus the tandem catalysis promotes the crucial hydrogenation of *NO to *NOH for NH3 production.

         <title>Construction of Thioamide Peptides from Chiral Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward linking of natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane was established to construct various thioamide&#8208;containing peptides. The carbonyl group is replaced with a thiono group by sequential activation, and the chirality of the amino acid component is maintained in the products.







Abstract
Thioamide peptides were synthesized in a straightforward one&#8208;pot process via the linkage of diverse natural amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane, wherein carbonyl groups were replaced with thiono compounds with minimal racemization. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies demonstrated that the trichlorosilane enables the activation of carboxylic acids via intense interactions with the Si&#8722;O bond, followed by coupling of the carboxylic acids with thiolphosphonate to obtain the key intermediate S&#8208;acyl dithiophosphate. Silyl&#8208;activated quadrangular metathesis transition states afforded the thioamide peptides. The potential applications of these thioamide peptides were further highlighted via late&#8208;stage linkages of diverse natural products and pharmaceutical drugs and the thioamide moiety.

         <title>Ultrathin Niobium Carbide MXenzyme for Remedying Hypertension by Antioxidative and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXenzyme shows benign biocompatibility and multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, combatting neurogenic hypertension by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibiting inflammatory response.







Abstract
Hypertension, as a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, is associated with oxidative stress and impairment of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, but there is still a tremendous knowledge gap between hypertension treatment and nanomedicines. Herein, we report a specific nanozyme based on ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXene, termed Nb2C MXenzyme, to fight against hypertension by achieving highly efficient reactive oxygen species elimination and inflammatory factors inhibition. The biocompatible Nb2C MXenzyme displays multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, involving superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, inducing cytoprotective effects by resisting oxidative stress, thereby alleviating inflammatory response and reducing blood pressure, which is systematically demonstrated in a stress&#8208;induced hypertension rat model. This strategy not only opens new opportunities for nanozymes to treat hypertension but also expands the potential biomedical applications of 2D MXene nanosystems.

         <title>Molten Salts&#8208;Driven Discovery of a Polar Mixed&#8208;Anion 3D framework at the nanoscale: Zn4Si2O7Cl2, Charge Transport and Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanowires of the new oxychloride Zn4Si2O7Cl2 crystallize from molten salts as a polar three&#8208;dimensional tetrahedral framework. They exhibit strongly anisotropic charge carrier mobility, adjustable electrical properties, and photoelectrochemical properties for H2 production from water.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;anion compounds widen the chemical space of attainable materials compared to single anionic compounds, but the exploration of their structural diversity is limited by common synthetic paths. Especially, oxychlorides rely mainly on layered structures, which suffer from low stability during photo(electro)catalytic processes. Herein we report a strategy to design a new polar 3D tetrahedral framework with composition Zn4Si2O7Cl2. We use a molten salt medium to enable low temperature crystallization of nanowires of this new compound, by relying on tetrahedral building units present in the melt to build the connectivity of the oxychloride. These units are combined with silicon&#8208;based connectors from a non&#8208;oxidic Zintl phase to enable precise tuning of the oxygen content. This structure brings high chemical and thermal stability, as well as strongly anisotropic hole mobility along the polar axis. These features, associated with the ability to adjust the transport properties by doping, enable to tune water splitting properties for photoelectrocatalytic H2 evolution and water oxidation. This work then paves the way to a new family of mixed&#8208;anion solids

         <title>Direct Arylation of Silicon Nanocrystals with Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Derived Benzynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;free arylation reagents are reported for the functionalization of silicon nanocrystals. Benzyne derivatives formed via a hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction effectively cleave Si&#8722;H bonds and yield benzenoid&#8208;passivated silicon surfaces under mild conditions.







Abstract
Colloidal silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) have garnered significant interest in optoelectronics and biomedical applications. Direct arylation provides pathways to enhance the solution processability of particles and manipulate the photophysical and electronic properties of SiNCs. Unfortunately, existing methods employed to prepare aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs are based on organometallic coupling or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed strategies, which require metal&#8208;based reagents for preactivation or the precursors and complicated post&#8208;treatment processes for product purification. Herein, we demonstrate a metal&#8208;free method that directly functionalizes SiNCs with aryl&#8208;based ligands. We design a series of benzyne derivatives formed from the thermal cyclization of predesigned alkynes, allowing efficient arylation on hydride&#8208;terminated silicon surfaces under mild conditions. These aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs exhibit strong blue emissions with nanosecond&#8208;scaled decay, suggesting the formation of a new radiative recombination channel on SiNC surfaces.

         <title>An Electrochemical Strategy to Synthesize Disilanes and Oligosilanes from Chlorosilanes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Si&#8722;Si bonds is an important transformation in organic synthesis. Herein, we present a unified electrochemical strategy for the efficient and selective synthesis of disilanes, oligosilanes, and cyclosilanes&#8212;which are important precursors for the synthesis of functional organic and polymeric compounds&#8212;from readily available chlorosilanes.







Abstract
Silanes are important compounds in industrial and synthetic chemistry. Here, we develop a general approach for the synthesis of disilanes as well as linear and cyclic oligosilanes via the reductive activation of readily available chlorosilanes. The efficient and selective generation of silyl anion intermediates, which are arduous to achieve by other means, allows for the synthesis of various novel oligosilanes by heterocoupling. In particular, this work presents a modular synthesis for a variety of functionalized cyclosilanes, which may give rise to materials with distinct properties from linear silanes but remain challenging synthetic targets. In comparison to the traditional Wurtz coupling, our method features milder conditions and improved chemoselectivity, broadening the functional groups that are compatible in oligosilane preparation. Computational studies support a mechanism whereby differential activation of sterically and electronically distinct chlorosilanes are achieved in an electrochemically driven radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism.

         <title>Exploiting Interactions between Polyoxometalates and Proteins for Applications in (Bio)chemistry and Medicine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review aims to provide molecular&#8208;level insight into the interactions between polyoxometalates and proteins that make this vast family of anionic nanoclusters interesting potential inorganic drugs, effective catalysts for selective protein modification, multifunctional crystallizing agents, and versatile protein separation materials.







Abstract
The specific interactions of anionic metal&#8208;oxo clusters, known as polyoxometalates (POMs), with proteins can be leveraged for a wide range of analytical and biomedical applications. For example, POMs have been developed as selective catalysts that can induce protein modifications and have also been shown to facilitate protein crystallization, both of which are instrumental in the structural characterization of proteins.

         <title>Defect Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Mott&#8211;Schottky Photocatalysts for Enhanced Ammonia Synthesis at Low Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;loaded defective pyrochlore K2Ta2O6&#8722;x was synthesized with visible light absorption and extremely low work function. High&#8208;efficient photocatalytic ammonia synthesis was achieved at low pressure with excellent catalytic activities. The pyrochlore structure exhibits amazing intrinsic activity, markedly enhances N2 dissociation on Ru, and is expected to be an ideal material for efficient ambient ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
The ambient ammonia synthesis coupled with distributed green hydrogen production technology can provide promising solutions for low&#8208;carbon NH3 production and H2 storage. Herein, we reported Ru&#8208;loaded defective pyrochlore K2Ta2O6&#8722;x with remarkable visible&#8208;light absorption and a very low work function, enabling effective visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2 at low pressure down to 0.2&#8197;atm. The photocatalytic rate was 2.8&#8197;times higher than that of the best previously reported photocatalyst and the photo&#8208;thermal rate at 425&#8197;K was similar to that of Ru&#8208;loaded black TiO2 at 633&#8197;K. Compared to perovskite&#8208;type KTaO3&#8722;x with the same composition, the pyrochlore exhibited a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in intrinsic activity due to a higher photoexcited charge separation efficiency and a higher conduction band position. The interfacial Schottky barrier and spontaneous electron transfer between K2Ta2O6&#8722;x and Ru further improve photoexcited charge separation and accumulate energetic electrons to facilitate N2 activation.

         <title>Stiba&#8208;, Arsa&#8208; and Phosphastannenes: Syntheses and Reactivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stibastannene featuring a Sn=Sb double bond together with homologous phospha&#8208; and arsastannene were synthesized by chloride abstraction from the respective pnictinidenes. The pnictastannene cations exhibit coordination at palladium phosphine fragments and can undergo cycloaddition reactions with dimethylbutadiene and phosphaalkyne.







Abstract
A facile synthesis for unprecedented stibastannene (10) featuring a Sn=Sb&#8208;double bond together with the homologous arsa&#8208; (9) and phosphastannenes (8) is presented. Chloride abstraction from respective stannyl pnictinidenes [E=P (5), As (6), Sb (7)], which were made accessible by reduction of ECl3 addition products at an intramolecular phosphine&#8208;stabilized stannylene, gave the pnictastannenes in moderate yields. The pnictastannenes coordinate Pd(PPh3)2 fragments (12&#8211;14) and the phosphastannene forms also a nickel coordination compound with the Ni(PPh3)2&#8208;fragment (11). 2,3&#8208;Dimethylbutadiene shows a [2+4]&#8208;cycloaddition (15&#8211;17) in reaction with the pnictastannenes (8&#8211;10). Products of a [2+2]&#8208;addition (18, 19) were isolated as the phosphaalkyne reaction products for 8 and 9. Addition of an O&#8722;H bond at the Sn=P&#8208;bond was found in reaction of water with phosphastannene 8. Reaction with ammonia afforded the NH3&#8208;adducts (21&#8211;23) at the tin atom for pnictastannenes 8&#8211;10. Only in the case of the arsastannene an azide reaction product featuring a three membered Sn&#8722;As&#8722;N&#8208;ring was obtained.

         <title>Observation of Asymmetric Oxidation Catalysis with B20 Chiral Crystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identification of the driving force for enantiomeric reactions is essential for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. With a pure B20 chiral crystal without any modification, enantiomeric oxidation was achieved at the surface. It is proposed that orbital angular momentum polarization will influence the adsorption of enantiomers and thus change their oxidation kinetics.







Abstract
The study of heterogeneous reactions for enantiomeric processes based on inorganic crystals has been resurgent in recent years. However, the question remains how homochirality develops in nature and chemical reactions. Here, the successful growth of B20 group PdGa single crystals with different chiral lattices enabled us to achieve enantioselective recognition of 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) based on a new mechanism, namely orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization. The orbital textures of PdGa crystals indicate large OAM polarization near the Fermi level and carrying opposite signs. A positive or negative magnetization in the [111] direction is expected depending on the chiral lattice of PdGa crystals. Due to this, the adsorption energies of PdGa crystals and DOPA molecules differ depending on how well the O&#8208;2p orbital of DOPA pairs with the Pd&#8208;4d orbital of PdGa. The results provide one possible explanation for how chirality arises in nature by providing an enantioselective route with pure inorganic crystals.

         <title>Giant Molecule Acceptor Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells Processed Using Non&#8208;halogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinyl &#960;&#8208;spacer linking&#8208;site isomerized giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) EV&#8208;i and EV&#8208;o were synthesized and applied in non&#8208;halogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed organic solar cells (OSCs). The EV&#8208;i based OSC exhibits suitable phase separation in active layer, which contributes to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.27&#8201;%. While the EV&#8208;o based OSCs show a poor PCE of 2.50&#8201;% due to its excessive aggregation.







Abstract
High efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) based on A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs) were mostly fabricated by toxic halogenated solvent processing, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the non&#8208;halogenated solvent processed OSCs is mainly restricted by the excessive aggregation of the SMAs. To address this issue, we developed two vinyl &#960;&#8208;spacer linking&#8208;site isomerized giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) with the &#960;&#8208;spacer linking on the inner carbon (EV&#8208;i) or out carbon (EV&#8208;o) of benzene end group of the SMA with longer alkyl side chains (ECOD) for the capability of non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processing. Interestingly, EV&#8208;i possesses a twisted molecular structure but enhanced conjugation, while EV&#8208;o shows a better planar molecular structure but weakened conjugation. The OSC with EV&#8208;i as acceptor processed by the non&#8208;halogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) demonstrated a higher PCE of 18.27&#8201;% than that of the devices based on the acceptor of ECOD (16.40&#8201;%) or EV&#8208;o (2.50&#8201;%). 18.27&#8201;% is one of the highest PCEs among the OSCs fabricated from non&#8208;halogenated solvents so far, benefitted from the suitable twisted structure, stronger absorbance and high charge carrier mobility of EV&#8208;i. The results indicate that the GMAs with suitable linking site would be the excellent candidates for fabricating high performance OSCs processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents.

The OSC with EV-i as acceptor processed by the non-halogenated solvent &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-XY) demonstrated a higher PCE of 18.27&#8201;% than that of the devices based on the acceptor of ECOD (16.40&#8201;%) or EV-o (2.50&#8201;%). 18.27&#8201;% is one of the highest PCEs among the OSCs fabricated from non-halogenated solvents so far, benefitted from the suitable twisted structure, stronger absorbance and high charge carrier mobility of EV-i. The results indicate that the GMAs with suitable linking site would be the excellent candidates for fabricating high performance OSCs processed by non-halogenated solvents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO Mediated by Silver Single Atoms Anchored on Tubular Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag single atoms anchored on hollow porous polygonal tubular carbon nitride (Ag1@PCN) form a catalyst with strong metal&#8211;support interactions. Ag&#8722;N3 exhibits enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity and high CO selectivity due to favorable *CO2 adsorption, *COOH generation and desorption, and the dynamic transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between PCN and the Ag single atoms.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is a promising strategy for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into fuels and value&#8208;added chemical products. However, photocatalysts usually suffered from low activity and product selectivity due to the sluggish dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers. Herein, we describe anchoring of Ag single atoms on hollow porous polygonal C3N4 nanotubes (PCN) to form the photocatalyst Ag1@PCN with Ag&#8722;N3 coordination for CO2 photoreduction using H2O as the reductant. The as&#8208;synthesized Ag1@PCN exhibits a high CO production rate of 0.32&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (mass of catalyst: 2&#8197;mg), a high selectivity (&gt;94&#8201;%), and an excellent stability in the long term. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) reveal that the strong metal&#8211;support interactions (Ag&#8722;N3) favor *CO2 adsorption, *COOH generation and desorption, and accelerate dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers between C3N4 and Ag single atoms, thereby accounting for the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity with a high CO selectivity. This work provides a deep insight into the important role of strong metal&#8211;support interactions in enhancing the photoactivity and CO selectivity of CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>I3&#8722;/I&#8722; Redox Reaction&#8208;mediated Organic Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries with Accelerated Kinetics and Long Shelf Lives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox mediators (RMs) have been introduced in organic Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) to solve the sluggish kinetics and short shelf lives issues that have been plaguing ZABs long&#8208;lastingly. Based on the chemical oxidation of I3&#8722; and catalytic effect of I&#8722;, our ZABs show accelerated kinetics and long shelf lives in open air.







Abstract
The storage time of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) for practical implementation have been neglected long&#8208;lastingly. ZABs based on organic solvents promise long shelf lives but suffer from sluggish kinetics. Here, we report a longly storable ZAB with accelerated kinetics mediated by I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox. In the charge process, the electrooxidation of Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8901;H2O is accelerated by I3&#8722; chemical oxidation. In the discharge process, I&#8722; adsorbed on the electrocatalyst changes the energy level of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Benefitting from these advantages, the prepared ZAB shows remarkably improved round&#8208;trip efficiency (56.03&#8201;% vs. 30.97&#8201;% without the mediator), and long&#8208;term cycling time (&gt;2600&#8197;h) in ambient air without replacing any components or applying any protective treatment to Zn anode and electrocatalyst. After resting for 30&#8197;days without any protection, it can still directly discharge continuously for 32.5&#8197;h and charge/discharge very stably for 2200&#8197;h (440&#8197;cycles), which is evidently superior to aqueous ZABs (only 0/0.25&#8197;h, and 50/25&#8197;h (10/5&#8197;cycles) by mild/alkaline electrolyte replenishment). This study provides a strategy to solve both storage and sluggish kinetics issues that have been plaguing ZABs for centuries, opening up a new avenue to the industrial application of ZABs.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Lactam Electrophiles for Covalent Chemical Biology
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here an &#945;&#8208;lactam electrophile that is tolerant of aqueous buffers and reacts with biologically relevant nucleophiles. Additionally, the compound efficiently targets and inhibits the serine hydrolase enzymes CES1/2 in HepG2 cells and cell lysate. The unique reactivity of &#945;&#8208;lactams suggests many potential applications of this new warhead&#8208;class within covalent chemical biology.







Abstract
Electrophilic groups are one of the key pillars of contemporary chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. For instance, 3&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds&#8212;such as aziridines, azirines, and oxaziridines&#8212;possess unique electronic and structural properties which underlie their potential and applicability as covalent tools. The &#945;&#8208;lactams are also members of this group of compounds, however, their utility within the field remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an &#945;&#8208;lactam reagent (AM2) that is tolerant to aqueous buffers while being reactive towards biologically relevant nucleophiles. Interestingly, carboxylesterases&#8197;1 and 2 (CES1/2), both serine hydrolases with key roles in endo&#8208; and xenobiotic metabolism, were found as primary covalent targets for AM2 in HepG2 liver cancer cells. All in all, this study constitutes the starting point for the further development and exploration of &#945;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based electrophilic probes in covalent chemical biology.

         <title>Who Binds Better? Let Alphafold2 Decide!</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chang and Perez suggest a simple and elegant approach for using AlphaFold2 to determine relative binding preferences of a receptor for two of its peptide substrates: when presented with both peptides, AlphaFold2 models only the stronger binder into the binding site. This easy approach will help many biologists to quickly estimate best binders and accelerate research on peptide substrate&#8208;mediated interactions.







Abstract
Deep learning is revolutionizing structural biology to an unprecedented extent. Spearheaded by DeepMind's Alphafold2, structural models of high quality can be generated, and are now available for most known proteins and many protein interactions. The next challenge will be to leverage this rich structural corpus to learn about binding: which protein can contact which partner(s), and at what affinity? In a recent study, Chang and Perez have presented an elegant approach towards this challenging goal for interactions that involve a short peptide binding to its receptor. The basic idea is straightforward: given a receptor that binds to two peptides, if the receptor sequence is presented with both peptides together at the same time, AlphaFold2 should model the tighter binding peptide into the binding site, while excluding the second. A simple idea that works!

         <title>Selective Functionalisation of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine by Organic Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Selective functionalisation of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the methyl group of 5&#8208;methylcytosine is achieved by xanthone&#8208;catalysed photoredox catalysis. The specific nature of the functionalisation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine on ribonucleic acid (RNA) was used to install a Halo&#8208;Tag reactive handle which enabled the chemical enrichment of 5&#8208;methylcytosine containing RNA.







Abstract
The epigenetic modification 5&#8208;methylcytosine plays a vital role in development, cell specific gene expression and disease states. The selective chemical modification of the 5&#8208;methylcytosine methyl group is challenging. Currently, no such chemistry exists. Direct functionalisation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine would improve the detection and study of this epigenetic feature. We report a xanthone&#8208;photosensitised process that introduces a 4&#8208;pyridine modification at a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the methyl group of 5&#8208;methylcytosine. We propose a reaction mechanism for this type of reaction based on density functional calculations and apply transition state analysis to rationalise differences in observed reaction efficiencies between cyanopyridine derivatives. The reaction is initiated by single electron oxidation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine followed by deprotonation to generate the methyl group radical. Cross coupling of the methyl radical with 4&#8208;cyanopyridine installs a 4&#8208;pyridine label at 5&#8208;methylcytosine. We demonstrate use of the pyridination reaction to enrich 5&#8208;methylcytosine&#8208;containing ribonucleic acid.

         <title>Cyanine Polymersomes Inbreathe Gas Signaling Molecule: SO2&#8208;Driven Bilayer Tubular Deformation for Transmembrane Traffic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating nanoscale assemblies that can respond to gas signaling molecules has emerged as a field of growing interest owing to their unique biomedical applications in gas&#8208;guided delivery and gas therapeutics. Yet, among a variety of endogenous gaseous biosignals, exploiting sulfur dioxide (SO2) as a cue for controllable self&#8208;assembly remains elusive, despite its crucial two&#8208;sided roles both in physiology and pathology. Here we show a SO2&#8208;responsive polymersome system assembled from a novel class of cyanine&#8208;containing block copolymers. By intake of SO2 gas, the tautomerism of cyanine drives such vesicles to continuously deform, and change into long nanotubes through axial stretching and anisotropic extrusion of the membranes. Unexpectedly, during this order&#8208;to&#8208;order phase transition, their membranes manifest well SO2&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent permselectivity, which allows the cargos of different sizes loaded therein to be selectively transferred across the bilayers. This study would inspire us to better understand and mimic the function of gas signaling molecules in shifting biomembrane shape and managing transmembrane traffic.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Indirect Evolution of Photoluminescent Semiconductor&#160;CdS Magic&#8208;Size Clusters through Their Precursor Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal semiconductor II&#8722;VI metal chalcogenide (ME) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) exhibit either an optical absorption singlet or doublet. In the latter case, a sharp photoluminescence (PL) signal is observed. Whether the PL&#8208;inactive MSCs transform to the PL&#8208;active ones is unknown. We show that PL&#8208;inactive CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL&#8208;active CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). MSC&#8208;322 displays a sharp absorption at ~322 nm, whereas MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 both have broad absorptions respectively around 328 and 373 nm. In a reaction of cadmium myristate and S powder in 1&#8208;octadecene, MSC&#8208;322 develops; with HOAc, MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 are present. We propose that the MSCs evolve from their relatively transparent precursor compounds (PCs). The PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization involves monomer substitution, while monomer addition occurs for the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation. Our findings suggest that S dominates the precursor self&#8208;assembly quantitatively, and ligand&#8208;bonded Cd mainly controls MSC optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Migratory Insertion in Gold Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of elementary reactions in organometallic catalysis is an important method with which to discover new reactions. In this article, we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in gold catalytic cycle. A wide range of structurally diverse alkynyl iodides are good coupling partners in this iodo&#8208;alkynylation transformation. Both aliphatic and aromatic alkynyl iodides can react with benzynes smoothly to afford highly functionalized 1,2&#8208;disubstituted aromatics in moderate to good yields. Its good functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage application of complex molecules demonstrate its synthetic robustness. Studies of the mechanism reveals the feasibility of oxidative addition and the DFT calculations demonstrate the possible migratory insertion of benzyne into Au(III)&#8208;carbon bonds in the Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalytic cycle, representing an important step towards an elementary reaction in gold chemistry research.</dc:description>

         <title>40 Years of Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium batteries are one of the most appropriate energy storage systems in our electrified society, as virtually all portable electronic devices and electric vehicles today rely on the chemical energy stored in them. However, sub&#8208;zero Celsius operation, especially below &#8722;20&#176;C, remains a huge challenge for lithium batteries and greatly limits their application in extreme environments. Slow Li+ diffusion and charge transfer kinetics have been identified as two main origins of the poor performance of RLBs under low&#8208;temperature conditions, both strongly associated with the liquid electrolyte that governs bulk and interfacial ion transport. In this review, we first analyze the low&#8208;temperature kinetic behavior and failure mechanism of lithium batteries from an electrolyte standpoint. We next trace the history of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes in the past 40 years (1983&#8211;2022), followed by a comprehensive summary of the research progress as well as introducing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization and computational methods for revealing their underlying mechanisms. Finally, we provide some perspectives on future research of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes with particular emphasis on mechanism analysis and practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Transition&#8208;Promoted Rapid Photomechanical Motions of Single Crystals of a Triene Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular crystals with the ability to transform light energy into macroscopic mechanical motions are a promising class of materials with potential applications in actuating and photonic devices. In regard to such materials, coordination polymers that exhibit dynamic photomechanical motion, associated with a phase transition, are unknown. Herein, we report an intriguing photoactive, one&#8208;dimensional Zn(II) coordination polymer, 1, derived from 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethenylbenzene and 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzoate. Single crystals of 1 under UV light irradiation exhibit rapid shrinking and bending, violent bursting&#8208;jumping, splitting and cracking behavior. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and 1H NMR spectroscopy reveal an unusual photoinduced phase transition involving a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction resulting in photomechanical responses. Interestingly, crystals of 1, which are triclinic with space group P&#160;1, are transformed into a higher symmetry, monoclinic cell with space group C2/c. This process represents a rare example of symmetry enhancement upon photoirradiation. The photomechanical activity is likely due to the sudden release of stress associated with strained molecular geometries and significant solid&#8208;state molecular movement arising from cleavage and formation of chemical bonds. A composite membrane fabricated from 1 and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) also displays interesting photomechanical behavior under UV light illumination, indicating the material's potential as a photoactuator.</dc:description>

The photomechanical activity is likely due to the sudden release of stress associated with strained molecular geometries and significant solid-state molecular movement arising from cleavage and formation of chemical bonds. A composite membrane fabricated from 1 and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) also displays interesting photomechanical behavior under UV light illumination, indicating the material's potential as a photoactuator.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Cobalt Catalysed Hydrogen Atom Transfer for the Hydrofunctionalisation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogen atom transfer from metal&#8208;hydrides to alkenes allows feedstock olefins to be used as alkyl radical precursors. The chemoselectivity of this process makes it an attractive synthetic tool and as such it has been regularly used in synthesis of complex molecules. However, onwards reactivity is limited by compatibility with the conditions which form the key metal&#8208;hydride species. Now, through the merger with photocatalysis or electrochemistry, milder methods are emerging which can unlock entirely new reactivity and offer perspectives on expanding these methods in unprecedented directions. This review outlines the most recent developments in electro&#8208; and photochemical cobalt catalysed methods and offers suggestions on the future outlook.</dc:description>

         <title>Extending the &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System in Spiro&#8208;Type Hole Transport Material Enhances the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole transport materials (HTMs) are a key component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The small molecular 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;amine&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, termed &#8220;Spiro&#8221;) is the most successful HTM used in PSCs, but its versatility is imperfect. To improve its performance, we developed a novel spiro&#8208;type HTM (termed &#8220;DP&#8221;) by substituting four anisole units on Spiro with 4&#8208;methoxybiphenyl moieties. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of Spiro in this way, the HOMO level of the HTM matches well with the perovskite valence band, enhancing hole mobility and increasing the glass transition temperature. DP&#8208;based PSC achieves high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.24% for small&#8208;area (0.06 cm2) devices and 21.86% for modules (designated area of 27.56 cm2), along with the certified efficiency of 21.78% on a designated area of 27.86 cm2. The encapsulated DP&#8208;based devices maintain 95.1% of the initial performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions after 2,560 hours and 87% at the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions over 600 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Connecting Ruthenium Photocatalysis to 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane&#8208;Mediated Chemiluminescence: a Versatile Combination for Optical Detection and Read&#8208;Out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical storage and photon quantification systems based on sensitive photoreactions have numerous applications. Herein, we report a highly efficient photocatalytic reaction, in which ruthenium photoredox catalysis is combined with a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane, from which chemiluminescence can be triggered. In this system, blue light irradiation as optical input enables a defined inverse correlation with base&#8208;triggered, blue light emission as optical output. Comparison of readout by 1H NMR and chemiluminescence, relative to previous optical input, underlines the reliability and usefulness of the ruthenium&#8208;dioxetane system for optical storage, sensing and ruthenium detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Multistep Excited&#8208;State Structural Transformations in N,N&#8242;&#8208;Diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that a single polycyclic &#960;&#8208;scaffold can undergo sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolution along the bent, planar, and twisted conformers, which coexist to produce intrinsic multiple fluorescence emissions in room&#8208;temperature solution. By installing a methyl or trifluoromethyl group on the ortho&#8208;site of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC), the enhanced steric effects change the fluorescence emission of DPAC from a dominant red band to well&#8208;resolved triple bands. The ultra&#8208;broadband triple emissions of ortho&#8208;substituted DPACs range from ~350 to ~850 nm, which is unprecedented for small fluorophores with molecular weight of &lt; 500. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the above dramatic changes originate from the influence of steric hindrance on the shape of excited state potential energy surface (S1 PES). Compared to the steep S1 PES of parental DPAC, introduction of ortho&#8208;substituent is shown to make the path of structural evolution in S1 wider and flatter, so the ortho&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit slower structural transformations from bent to planar and then to twisted forms, yielding intrinsic triple emission. The results provide the proof of concept that the bent, planar, and twisted emissive states can coexist in the same S1 PES, which greatly expand the fundamental understanding of the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMA) are important structural motifs widely present in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and chiral ligands. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral DAMAs via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8208;H alkoxylation strategy. The reaction features easy operation, the use of earth&#8208;abundant and cost&#8208;efficient cobalt(II) catalyst, and readily available ligand. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90% yield and up to 99% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aqueous Electrolyte Gated Artificial Synapse with Synaptic Plasticity Selectively Mediated by Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emulation of functions and behaviors of biological synapses using electronic devices has inspired the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in biomedical interfaces. Despite the achievements, artificial synapses that can be selectively responsive to non&#8208;electroactive biomolecules and directly operate in biological environments are still lacking. Herein, we report an artificial synapse based on organic electrochemical transistors and investigate the selective modulation of its synaptic plasticity by glucose. The enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase results in long&#8208;term modulation of the channel conductance, mimicking selective binding of biomolecules to their receptors and consequent long&#8208;term modulation of the synaptic weight. Moreover, the device shows enhanced synaptic behaviors in the blood serum at a higher glucose concentration, which suggests its potential application in vivo as artificial neurons. This work provides a step towards the fabrication of ANNs with synaptic plasticity selectively mediated by biomolecules for neuro&#8208;prosthetics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.</dc:description>

Herein, we present a hexanuclear compound of [(Tp*)FeIII(CN)3]4[FeII(Ppmp)]2&#183;2CH3OH (1, Tp* = hydrotris(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate and Ppmp = 2&#8208;[3&#8208;(2'&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl]pyridine), which has a rhombic core structure abbreviated as {FeIII2FeII2}. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed that 1 underwent temperature&#8208;induced spin transition with the thermal hysteresis. The FeII site in 1 behaved as a spin crossover (SCO) unit, and significant deformation of its octahedron was observed during the spin transition process. Moreover, the distortion of the FeII centers actuated anisotropic deformation of the rhombic {FeIII2FeII2} core, which was spread over the whole crystal through the subsequent molecular rearrangements, leading to the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion. Our results provide a rational strategy for realizing the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion and shape memory effects by tuning the magnetic bistability.</dc:description>

         <title>Linking Composition, Structure and Thickness of CoOOH to Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity by Correlative Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of &#946;&#8208;CoOOH crystallographic orientations in catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains elusive. We combine correlative electron backscatter diffraction/scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography to establish the structure&#8208;activity relationships of various faceted &#946;&#8208;CoOOH formed on a Co microelectrode under OER conditions. We reveal that ~6 nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01 0), grown on [ 0]&#8208;oriented Co, exhibits higher OER activity than ~3 nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(10 3) or ~6 nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(0006) formed on [02 &#8208; and [0001]&#8208;oriented Co, respectively. This arises from higher amounts of incorporated hydroxyl ions and more easily reducible CoIII&#8208;O sites present in &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01 0) than those in the latter two oxyhydroxide facets. Our correlative multimodal approach shows great promise in linking local activity with atomic&#8208;scale details of structure, thickness and composition of active species, which opens opportunities to design pre&#8208;catalysts with preferred defects that promote the formation of the most active OER species.</dc:description>

         <title>Guiding Principles for the Rational Design of Hybrid Materials:&#160; Use of DFT Methodology for Evaluating Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in a Uranyl Tetrahalide Model System.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Together with the synthesis and experimental characterization of 14 hybrid materials containing [UO2X4]2&#8208; (X=Cl&#8208;and Br&#8208;) and organic cations, we report on novel methods for determining formation enthalpy (&#916;Hf) and correlating trends to observed vibrational signatures. &#916;Hf&#160;&#160;values were analyzed through isothermal acid calorimetry and a Density Functional Theory + Thermodynamics (DFT+T) approach and results showed good agreement between theory and experiment. We then assess packing efficiency, organic ligand protonation enthalpy, and hydrogen bonding energy (EtotalH,nom) as descriptor of &#916;Hf&#160;trend. Our results demonstrated strong association between Etotal&#160;H,nom&#160;and &#916;Hf&#160;highlighting the importance of hydrogen bonding networks in solid&#8208;state hybrid materials' relative stability. Finally, we investigated how hydrogen bonding networks affect the vibrational characteristics of uranyl solid&#8208;state materials using experimental Raman and IR spectroscopy and theoretical bond orders. We found that solid&#8208;state hydrogen bonding can red&#8208;shift U&#8801;O stretching modes. The tightly integrated experimental and theoretical studies bridge the trends in macroscopic thermodynamic energies and spectroscopic features with molecular&#8208;level details of the geometry and electronic structure.

         <title>Synthesis of a Blue&#8208;Emissive Azaborathia[9]helicene by Silicon&#8208;Boron Exchange from Unusual Atropisomeric Teraryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the concise synthesis and chir(optical) properties of an azaborathia[9]helicene consisting of two thienoazaborole motifs. The key intermediate, a highly congested teraryl with nearly parallel isoquinoline moieties, was generated as a mixture of atropisomers upon fusion of the central thiophene ring of the dithienothiophene moiety. These diastereomers were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealing intriguing interactions in the solid state. Subsequent insertion of boron into the aromatic scaffold via silicon&#8208;boron exchange involving triisopropylsilyl groups fixed the helical geometry, thereby establishing a novel method for the preparation of azaboroles. The ligand exchange at boron in the final step afforded the blue emitter displaying a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.17 in CH2Cl2 and excellent configurational stability. Detailed structural and theoretical investigation of unusual atropisomers and the helicene provide insights into their isomerization processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Birefringence Regulation by Clarifying the Relationship Between Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs and Optical Anisotropy in Tin&#8208;based Ternary Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is important to establish and clarify the relationship between stereochemically active lone pairs and birefringence, since it is one of the significantly effective routes to explore birefringent crystals by introducing Sn&#8208;centered polyhedra with stereochemically active lone pairs. Herein, four tin(&#8545;)&#8208;based ternary halides A3SnCl5 and ASn2Cl5 (A = NH4 and Rb) have been synthesized successfully. The experimental birefringence of Rb3SnCl5 and RbSn2Cl5 is larger than or equal to 0.046 and 0.123@546 nm, respectively. Through investigating the alkali or alkaline&#8208;earth metal tin(&#8545;)&#8208;based ternary halides, the structure&#8208;performance relationship has been concluded between stereochemically active lone pairs and optical anisotropy. It is beneficial to the analysis and prediction of birefringence in tin&#8208;based halides and provides a guide for exploring tin(&#8545;)&#8208;based optoelectronic functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Caging of Carboxyl Groups for On&#8208;Demand Protein Activation with Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The caging of amino acid side chains can provide exquisite control of protein function. The first chemical caging of carboxyl groups (Asp and Glu) in enzymic active sites is reported. Caging of a heme propionate in a protein was also feasible by this approach based on esterification with a tuned diazo compound. Decaging is enabled by small&#8208;molecule reagents that elicit a Staudinger reaction or 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition.

Tools for on&#8208;demand protein activation enable impactful gain&#8208;of&#8208;function studies in biological settings. Thus far, however, proteins have been chemically caged at primarily Lys, Tyr, and Sec, typically through the genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids. Herein, we report that the preferential reactivity of diazo compounds with protonated acids can be used to expand this toolbox to solvent&#8208;accessible carboxyl groups with an elevated pKa value. As a model protein, we employed lysozyme (Lyz), which has an active&#8208;site Glu35 residue with a pKa value of 6.2. A diazo compound with a bioorthogonal self&#8208;immolative handle esterified Glu35 selectively, inactivating Lyz. The hydrolytic activity of the caged Lyz on bacterial cell walls was restored with two small&#8208;molecule triggers. The decaging was more efficient by small molecules than by esterases. This simple chemical strategy was also applied to a hemeprotein and an aspartyl protease, setting the stage for broad applicability.

&lt;p&gt;The caging of amino acid side chains can provide exquisite control of protein function. The first chemical caging of carboxyl groups (Asp and Glu) in enzymic active sites is reported. Caging of a heme propionate in a protein was also feasible by this approach based on esterification with a tuned diazo compound. Decaging is enabled by small-molecule reagents that elicit a Staudinger reaction or 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vacuum&#8208;stable&#8208;by&#8208;design MALDI matrix enables long MALDI MS imaging measurements of at least 72&#8197;hours. Using a photo&#8208;removable 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) group, organic synthesis transformed the widely used, but unfortunately very volatile MALDI matrix 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy acetophenone (2,5&#8208;DHAP) into a vacuum&#8208;stable matrix, which can be uncaged by the MALDI laser in the ion source and then perform as the common matrix 2,5&#8208;DHAP.







Abstract
Insufficient vacuum stability of matrix chemicals is a major limitation in matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of large tissue sample cohorts. Here, we designed and synthesized the photo&#8208;cleavable caged molecule 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxyacetophenone (DMNB&#8208;2,5&#8208;DHAP) and employed it for lipid MALDI&#8208;MSI of mouse brain tissue sections. DMNB&#8208;2,5&#8208;DHAP is vacuum&#8208;stable in a high vacuum MALDI ion source for at least 72&#8197;h. Investigation of the uncaging process suggested that the built&#8208;in laser (355&#8197;nm) in the MALDI ion source promoted the in situ generation of 2,5&#8208;DHAP. A caging group is used for the first time in designing a MALDI matrix that is vacuum&#8208;stable, uncaged upon laser irradiation during the measurement process, and that boosts lipid ion intensity with MALDI&#8208;2 laser&#8208;induced postionization.

         <title>Multimodal Analysis of Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Nanoporous Block Copolymer Membranes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous block copolymer membranes functionalized with a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst (POM&#8208;WOC) and a light&#8208;absorbing ruthenium complex were probed and characterized using operando scanning electrochemical microscopy, ex situ spatially resolved micro&#8208;X&#8208;ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Molecular scale information was obtained about the spatial distribution and catalytic performance of the membrane.







Abstract
Heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis is a cornerstone of sustainable energy conversion. Most catalytic studies focus on bulk analyses of the hydrogen and oxygen evolved, which impede the correlation of matrix heterogeneities, molecular features, and bulk reactivity. Here, we report studies of a heterogenized catalyst/photosensitizer system using a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst and a model, molecular photosensitizer that were co&#8208;immobilized within a nanoporous block copolymer membrane. Via operando scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), light&#8208;induced oxygen evolution was determined using sodium peroxodisulfate (Na2S2O8) as sacrificial electron acceptor. Ex situ element analyses provided spatially resolved information on the local concentration and distribution of the molecular components. Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR&#8208;ATR) studies of the modified membranes showed no degradation of the water oxidation catalyst under the reported light&#8208;driven conditions.

         <title>Dimensional Reduction of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cryopreservation of Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimensional reduction strategy in which 3D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin, flexible metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs), has been proposed to facilitate their cryopreservation applications. The 2D MOLs displayed superior ice crystal growth inhibition for the enhanced interfacial interaction through structural deformation/stretching and increased inner ordered structures utilization efficiency.







Abstract
To increase the red blood cell (RBC) cryopreservation efficiency by metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), a dimensional reduction approach has been proposed. Namely, 3D MOF nanoparticles are progressively reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). We found that 2D MOLs are beneficial for enhanced interactions of the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network and increased utilization of inner ordered structures, due to the higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. Specifically, a series of hafnium (Hf)&#8208;based 2D MOLs with different thicknesses (monolayer to stacked multilayers) and densities of hydrogen bonding sites have been synthesized. Both ice recrystallization inhibition activity (IRI) and RBCs cryopreservation assay confirm the pronounced better IRI activity and excellent cell recovery efficiency (up to &#8776;63&#8201;% at a very low concentration of 0.7&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1) of thin&#8208;layered Hf&#8208;MOLs compared to their 3D counterparts, thereby verifying the dimensional reduction strategy to improved cryoprotectant behaviors.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atom Support Boosts Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a novel interface chemistry manipulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) before the self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) by constructing a novel 2D/2D heterostructure composed of NiO anchored Ru&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical studies verify the thermodynamically favorable process of UOR on the Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based catalysts have been regarded as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), however, their activity is largely limited by the inevitable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) during the UOR. Here, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of UOR before the NSOR via constructing a 2D/2D heterostructure that consists of ultrathin NiO anchored Ru&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations confirm this unique triggering mechanism on the surface of Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO. Consequently, the fabricated catalyst exhibits outstanding UOR activity with a low potential of 1.288&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable long&#8208;term durability for more than 330&#8197;h operation. DFT calculations and spectroscopic characterizations demonstrate that the favorable electronic structure induced by this unique heterointerface endows the catalyst energetically more favorable for the UOR than the NSOR.

         <title>A Dissipative Reaction Network Drives Transient Solid&#8211;Liquid and Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Cycling of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent nanoparticles have been dispersed in water under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions by coupling to a dissipative reaction network that consumes a fuel at a controlled rate. The transient dispersed state enables autonomous solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid back&#8211;and&#8211;forth phase cycling of gold nanoparticles on a timescale that is easily adjusted by changing the pH value.







Abstract
Transient states maintained by energy dissipation are an essential feature of dynamic systems where structures and functions are regulated by fluxes of energy and matter through chemical reaction networks. Perfected in biology, chemically fueled dissipative networks incorporating nanoscale components allow the unique properties of nanomaterials to be bestowed with spatiotemporal adaptability and chemical responsiveness. We report the transient dispersion of gold nanoparticles in water, powered by dissipation of a chemical fuel. A dispersed state that is generated under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions permits fully reversible solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid phase transfer. The molecular basis of the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium process is reversible covalent modification of nanoparticle&#8208;bound ligands by a simple inorganic activator. Activator consumption by a coupled dissipative reaction network leads to autonomous cycling between phases. The out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium lifetime is tunable by adjusting the pH value, and reversible phase cycling is reproducible over several cycles.

         <title>A Remotely Controlled Nanosystem for Spatiotemporally Specific Gene Regulation and Combinational Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR light&#8208;controlled, mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanosystem can be used for spatiotemporally selective gene regulation and tumor treatment. The system relies on photodynamic effect&#8208;induced translocation of a DNA repair enzyme, which enables spatially&#8208;controlled gene regulation and thus enhanced antitumor effects.







Abstract
The dearth of technologies that allow gene modulation and therapy with high spatiotemporal precision remains a bottleneck in biomedical research and applications. Here we present a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanosystem that allows spatiotemporally controlled regulation of gene expression and thus combinational tumor therapy. The nanosystem is built by engineering of an enzyme&#8208;activatable antisense oligonucleotide and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;based photodynamic system and a mitochondria localization signal. The system relies on photodynamic effect&#8208;induced translocation of a DNA repair enzyme from nucleus into mitochondria, which enables spatially selective gene regulation via enzymatic reactions. We demonstrate that the NIR light&#8208;induced mitochondrial photodamage and gene regulation enable enhanced antitumor effect. Our approach may enable the specific gene regulation and tumor treatment with high precision both spatially and temporally.

         <title>Influence of Composition of Nickel&#8208;Iron Nanoparticles for Abiotic CO2 Conversion to Early Prebiotic Organics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high temperature and pressure, synthetic Ni&#8722;Fe nanoparticles catalyze H2&#8208;dependent CO2 fixation to form the main intermediates of the acetyl&#8208;CoA pathway (e.g., formate, acetate, and pyruvate). The reported chemistry is reminiscent of hydrothermal vents, which yield large amounts of H2 in the presence of transition metals and are implicated in forming the first biochemical pathways through CO2 fixation.







Abstract
Abiotic synthesis of formate and short hydrocarbons takes place in serpentinizing vents where some members of vent microbial communities live on abiotic formate as their main carbon source. To better understand the catalytic properties of Ni&#8722;Fe minerals that naturally exist in hydrothermal vents, we have investigated the ability of synthetic Ni&#8722;Fe based nanoparticular solids to catalyze the H2&#8208;dependent reduction of CO2, the first step required for the beginning of pre&#8208;biotic chemistry. Mono and bimetallic Ni&#8722;Fe nanoparticles with varied Ni&#8208;to&#8208;Fe ratios transform CO2 and H2 into intermediates and products of the acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A pathway&#8212;formate, acetate, and pyruvate&#8212;in mM range under mild hydrothermal conditions. Furthermore, Ni&#8722;Fe catalysts converted CO2 to similar products without molecular H2 by using water as a hydrogen source. Both CO2 chemisorption analysis and post&#8208;reaction characterization of materials indicate that Ni and Fe metals play complementary roles for CO2 fixation.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides by Cobalt Catalysis</title>

A ligand&#8208;controlled cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of glycals was developed to access 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides. This method exhibits broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity under very mild conditions. In addition, unprecedented stereodivergent synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;ribofuranosides was achieved using different chiral bisoxazoline ligands.







Abstract
2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides represent an important class of carbohydrates that are present in many bioactive molecules. However, owing to the lack of substituents at the C2 position, the stereoselective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is highly challenging. Herein, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled stereoselective C&#8208;alkyl glycosylation reaction to access 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides from readily available glycals and alkyl halides. This method exhibits broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity under very mild conditions. In addition, unprecedented stereodivergent synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;ribofuranosides is achieved using different chiral bisoxazoline ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that hydrometallation of the glycal with the bisoxazoline&#8208;ligated Co&#8722;H species may be the turnover&#8208;limiting and stereodetermining step of this transformation.

         <title>Supercharged CO2 Photothermal Catalytic Methanation: High Conversion, Rate, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride photothermal catalyst for enabling the Solar Sabatier process is reported that reduces the energy intensity of the thermo&#8208;catalytic version, yet maintains an amazing Sabatier conversion of 87.68&#8201;%, a reaction rate of 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity under ambient pressure conditions. Together these attributes are considered a prerequisite for scaling the process to a technologically relevant level.







Abstract
To overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic impediments of the Sabatier CO2 methanation reaction, the process must be operated under very high temperature and pressure conditions, to obtain an industrially viable conversion, rate, and selectivity. Herein, we report that these technologically relevant performance metrics have been achieved under much milder conditions using solar rather than thermal energy, where the methanation reaction is enabled by a novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride catalyst. In this regard, an in situ generated HOB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B surface frustrated Lewis's pair is considered responsible for the high Sabatier conversion 87.68&#8201;%, reaction rate 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1h&#8722;1, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity, realized under ambient pressure conditions. This discovery bodes well for an opto&#8208;chemical engineering strategy aimed at the development and implementation of a sustainable &#8216;Solar Sabatier&#8217; methanation process.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity under ambient pressure conditions. Together these attributes are considered a prerequisite for scaling the process to a technologically relevant level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic impediments of the Sabatier CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanation reaction, the process must be operated under very high temperature and pressure conditions, to obtain an industrially viable conversion, rate, and selectivity. Herein, we report that these technologically relevant performance metrics have been achieved under much milder conditions using solar rather than thermal energy, where the methanation reaction is enabled by a novel nickel-boron nitride catalyst. In this regard, an in situ generated HOB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B surface frustrated Lewis's pair is considered responsible for the high Sabatier conversion 87.68&#8201;%, reaction rate 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Ni&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity, realized under ambient pressure conditions. This discovery bodes well for an opto-chemical engineering strategy aimed at the development and implementation of a sustainable &#8216;Solar Sabatier&#8217; methanation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Drug Efficacy Guided by Free Energy Simulations of the &#946;2&#8208;Adrenoceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets and numerous approved drugs act by either stimulating or blocking receptor activation. However, the design of ligands that modulate GPCR signaling is challenging. We demonstrate that molecular simulations of GPCRs can be used to predict ligand efficacy and identify potent &#946;2&#8208;adrenoceptor agonists.







Abstract
G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) play important roles in physiological processes and are modulated by drugs that either activate or block signaling. Rational design of the pharmacological efficacy profiles of GPCR ligands could enable the development of more efficient drugs, but is challenging even if high&#8208;resolution receptor structures are available. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the &#946;2 adrenergic receptor in active and inactive conformations to assess if binding free energy calculations can predict differences in ligand efficacy for closely related compounds. Previously identified ligands were successfully classified into groups with comparable efficacy profiles based on the calculated shift in ligand affinity upon activation. A series of ligands were then predicted and synthesized, leading to the discovery of partial agonists with nanomolar potencies and novel scaffolds. Our results demonstrate that free energy simulations enable design of ligand efficacy and the same approach can be applied to other GPCR drug targets.

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral Au13 Clusters Stabilized by Enantiopure Monodentate NHC Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of new enantiopure chiral NHC&#8208;stabilized superatomic gold clusters exhibited an oxygen&#8208;insensitive circularly polarized fluorescence with a record&#8208;setting quantum yield of 61&#8201;% in the solution state.







Abstract
Chiral Au nanoclusters have promising application prospects in chiral sensing, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptics. However, enantiopure superatomic homogold clusters with crystallographic structures emitting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remain challenging. In this study, we designed chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), and for the first time enantioselectively synthesized a pair of monovalent cationic superatomic Au13 clusters. This new enantiomeric pair of clusters has a quasi&#8208;C2 symmetric core and exhibited CPL with an unprecedent solution&#8208;state quantum yield (QY) of 61&#8201;% among those of the atomically precise Au nanoclusters. DFT calculations provided insights into the circular dichroism behavior, and revealed the origin of CPL from superatomic Au clusters. This work opens a new avenue for developing novel homochiral nanoclusters using chiral NHC ligands and provides fundamental understanding of the origin of the chiroptics of metal clusters.

         <title>Functionalisation of Graphene Sensor Surfaces for the Specific Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalisation of selective biosensors: The noncovalent functionalisation of graphene with perylene bisimide via the FLaT approach allows for specific coupling with antibodies. The application of the respective antigen results in a concentration dependent change of electrical characteristics, proving selective binding of the small molecule without cross&#8208;sensitivity towards other small molecules.







Abstract
We report on a controllable and specific functionalisation route for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) for the recognition of small physiologically active molecules. Key element is the noncovalent functionalisation of the graphene surface with perylene bisimide (PBI) molecules directly on the growth substrate. This Functional Layer Transfer enables the homogeneous self&#8208;assembly of PBI molecules on graphene, onto which antibodies are subsequently immobilised. The sensor surface was characterised by atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and electrical measurements, showing superior performance over conventional functionalisation after transfer. Specific sensing of small molecules was realised by monitoring the electrical property changes of functionalised GFET devices upon the application of methamphetamine and cortisol. The concentration dependent electrical response of our sensors was determined down to a concentration of 300&#8197;ng&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for methamphetamine.

         <title>Decoupling Redox Hopping and Catalysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks &#8208;based Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic challenges associated with the multielectron activation in MOF&#8208;based CO2 electrocatalysts can be addressed by decoupling the catalysis from the charge transport. Better performance and desired selectivity can be achieved when the activation potential of the catalysts is matched with the conduction band of the charge&#8208;transporting framework.







Abstract
Traditional MOF e&#8208;CRR, constructed from catalytic linkers, manifest a kinetic bottleneck during their multi&#8208;electron activation. Decoupling catalysis and charge transport can address such issues. Here, we build two MOF/e&#8208;CRR systems, CoPc@NU&#8208;1000 and TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000, by installing cobalt metalated phthalocyanine and tetraphenylporphyrin electrocatalysts within the redox active NU&#8208;1000 MOF. For CoPc@NU&#8208;1000, the e&#8208;CRR responsive CoI/0 potential is close to that of NU&#8208;1000 reduction compared to the TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000. Efficient charge delivery, defined by a higher diffusion (Dhop=4.1&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) and low charge&#8208;transport resistance (
=59.5&#8197;&#937;) in CoPC@NU&#8208;1000 led FECO=80&#8201;%. In contrast, TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000 fared a poor FECO=24&#8201;% (Dhop=1.4&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 
=91.4&#8197;&#937;). For such a decoupling strategy, careful choice of the host framework is critical in pairing up with the underlying electrochemical properties of the catalysts to facilitate the charge delivery for its activation.

         <title>Do The Twist: Efficient Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Visible Light Polymerization Facilitated by Spin&#8208;Orbit Charge Transfer Inter&#8208;system Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic catalyst enables rapid and efficient production of polymers using low energy visible light by leveraging a unique charge transfer mechanism. This mechanism relies on communication between connected, yet electronically decoupled units, which is facilitated by twisting one unit out of plane. This discovery is anticipated to enable the rapid and energy efficient production of plastics through emergent 3D printing technology.







Abstract
The use of visible light to drive polymerizations with spatiotemporal control offers a mild alternative to contemporary UV&#8208;light&#8208;based production of soft materials. In this spectral region, photoredox catalysis represents the most efficient polymerization method, yet it relies on the use of heavy&#8208;atoms, such as precious metals or toxic halogens. Herein, spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing from boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyads bearing twisted aromatic groups is shown to enable efficient visible light polymerizations in the absence of heavy&#8208;atoms. A &#8776;5&#8211;15&#215; increase in polymerization rate and improved photostability was achieved for twisted BODIPYs relative to controls. Furthermore, monomer polarity had a distinct effect on polymerization rate, which was attributed to charge transfer stabilization based on ultrafast transient absorption and phosphorescence spectroscopies. Finally, rapid and high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with a green LED was demonstrated using the present photosystem.

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;C Cleavage of Methylenecyclobutanes for &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes by Strain Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of methylenecyclobutanols was accomplished by C&#8722;C cleavage to release ring strain, selectively affording &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The photocatalyzed reaction proceeds in good yields, and was used for the concise synthesis of the natural product alatanone A.







Abstract
Radical additions onto olefins have surfaced as an increasingly powerful strategy for the synthesis of difunctionalized scaffolds. However, despite of major advances, known approaches continue to be largely limited to two manifolds, namely 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes and remote difunctionalization via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Herein, we describe a mechanistically distinct approach by photoinduced carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) activation/ring&#8208;opening to access &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from methylenecyclobutanols and sulfonyl chlorides by strain release. Remarkably, the sulfonyl motif on the products was easily removed by another photocatalytic process, which enabled the concise assembly of the natural product alatanone A. The synthetic utility of our approach was reflected by versatile functional group tolerance, ample substrate scope, and scalability. The photocatalysis represents a conceptually distinct alternative to existing approaches for remote 1,4&#8208;diversifications, with a double bond remaining in the thus obtained products.

         <title>A Janus Separator based on Cation Exchange Resin and Fe Nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Single&#8208;wall Carbon Nanotubes with Triply Synergistic Effects for High&#8208;areal Capacity Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus separator based on cation exchange resin and Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes with triple synergistic effects is exploited to suppress Zn dendrites growth, mitigate polyiodide shuttle effect and facilitate redox kinetics of iodine species. This is reflected in the outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;I2 battery with a lifespan over 2500&#8197;h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;I2 batteries stand out in the family of aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and immanent safety. However, Zn dendrite growth, polyiodide shuttle effect and sluggish I2 redox kinetics result in dramatically capacity decay of Zn&#8722;I2 batteries. Herein, a Janus separator composed of functional layers on anode/cathode sides is designed to resolve these issues simultaneously. The cathode layer of Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes can effectively anchor polyiodide and catalyze the redox kinetics of iodine species, while the anode layer of cation exchange resin rich in &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups is beneficial to attract Zn2+ ions and repel detrimental SO42&#8722;/polyiodide, improving the stability of cathode/anode interfaces synergistically. Consequently, the Janus separator endows outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;I2 batteries with a lifespan over 2500&#8197;h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of a Labeled, Cancer&#8208;Targeting DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting aptamer AS1411 via parahydrogen. For that, we screened for suitable parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) labels, performed solid phase synthesis to incorporate the label into AS1411 and adapted the polarity of DNA via PEGylation to enable efficient, selective hydrogenation in organic solvents without affecting canonical nucleotides.







Abstract
Enhancing NMR signals of biomacromolecules by hyperpolarization offers exciting opportunities for diagnostic applications. However, their hyperpolarization via parahydrogen remains challenging as specific catalytic interactions are required, which are difficult to tune due to the large size of the biomolecule and its insolubility in organic solvents. Herein, we show the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting DNA aptamer AS1411. By screening different molecular motifs for an unsaturated label in nucleosides and in DNA oligomers, we were able to identify structural prerequisites for the hyperpolarization of AS1411. Finally, adjusting the polarity of AS1411 by complexing the DNA backbone with amino polyethylene glycol chains allowed the hydrogenation of the label with parahydrogen while the DNA structure remains stable to maintain its biological function. Our results are expected to advance hyperpolarized molecular imaging technology for disease detection in the future.

By screening different molecular motifs for an unsaturated label in nucleosides and in DNA oligomers, we were able to identify structural prerequisites for the hyperpolarization of AS1411. Finally, adjusting the polarity of AS1411 by complexing the DNA backbone with amino polyethylene glycol chains allowed the hydrogenation of the label with &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;hydrogen while the DNA structure remains stable to maintain its biological function. Our results are expected to advance hyperpolarized molecular imaging technology for disease detection in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;planar Nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] Cluster Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;planar nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] cluster sites in N&#8208;doped carbon plane with similar active center atomic composition to ferredoxin achieve efficient O2 adsorption and activation while avoiding too robust adsorption of OH* intermediate, thus realizing excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance beyond planar [FeN4] and [Fe2N6]. This work provides insights into co&#8208;regulation of atomic composition and spatial configuration for efficient ORR catalysis.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts, as promising alternative to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), are still highly expected to achieve better performance by modulating the composition and spatial structure of active site. Herein, we constructed the non&#8208;planar nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] cluster sites in N&#8208;doped carbon plane. Adjacent double Fe atoms effectively weaken the O&#8722;O bond by forming a peroxide bridge&#8208;like adsorption configuration, and the introduction of S atoms breaks the planar coordination of Fe resulting in greater structural deformation tension, lower spin state, and downward shifted Fe d&#8208;band center, which together facilitate the release of OH* intermediate. Hence, the non&#8208;planar [Fe2S2] cluster catalyst, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;V, displays superior ORR activity than that of planar [FeN4] or [Fe2N6]. This work provides insights into the co&#8208;regulation of atomic composition and spatial configuration for efficient oxygen reduction catalysis.

         <title>Aromatic Amides: A Smart Backbone toward Isolated Ultralong Bright Blue&#8208;Phosphorescence in Confined Polymeric Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulation of the triplet excited state by utilizing an aromatic amide skeleton has led to ultralong blue phosphorescence in confined films. Strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling within the aromatic amide as well as hydrogen bonding interactions with polyvinyl alcohol accelerate intersystem crossing and suppress the non&#8208;radiative relaxations, thereby overcoming the dilemma of achieving organic phosphorescence with both high energy and long lifetime.







Abstract
We describe an aromatic amide skeleton for manipulation of triplet excited states toward bright long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence. Spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the aromatic amides can promote strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling between (&#960;,&#960;*) and the bridged (n,&#960;*) states, and enable multiple channels to populate the emissive 3(&#960;,&#960;*), as well as facilitate robust hydrogen bonding with polyvinyl alcohol to suppress non&#8208;radiative relaxations. Isolated inherent deep&#8208;blue (0.155, 0.056) to sky&#8208;blue (0.175, 0.232) phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 34.7&#8201;%) in confined films are achieved. The blue afterglow of the films can last for several seconds and are showcased in information display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and white light afterglow. Owing to the high population of 3(&#960;,&#960;*) states, the smart aromatic amide skeleton provides an important molecular design prototype to manipulate triplet excited states for ultralong phosphorescence with various colors.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Diversification of Complex Bioactive Molecules by Accelerated Synthesis in Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules was achieved using an automated platform based on desorption&#8208;electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. Accelerated reactions in microdroplets enable the ultrafast synthesis of diversified drug molecules. Over 250&#8197;analogues of bioactive compounds were generated and characterized using nanogram amounts of material in less than 1&#8197;second per reaction.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage diversification of drug molecules is an important strategy in drug discovery that can be facilitated by reaction screening using high&#8208;throughput experimentation. Here we present a rapid method for functionalizing bioactive molecules based on accelerated reactions in microdroplets. Reaction mixtures are nebulized at throughputs better than 1&#8197;reaction/second and the accelerated reactions occurring in the microdroplets are followed by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI&#8208;MS). Because the accelerated reactions occur on the millisecond timescale, they allow an overall screening throughput of 1&#8197;Hz working at the low nanogram scale. Using this approach, an opioid agonist (PZM21) and an antagonist (naloxone) were diversified using three reactions important in medicinal chemistry: sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click reactions, imine formation reactions, and ene&#8208;type click reactions. Some 269&#8197;functionalized analogs of naloxone and PZM21 were generated and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) after screening over 500&#8197;reactions.

         <title>Reduction of Platinum(IV) Prodrug Hemoglobin Nanoparticles with Deeply Penetrating Ultrasound Radiation for Tumor&#8208;Targeted Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective activation of PtIV prodrugs upon irradiation is receiving much interest. The majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds to superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors.







Abstract
The development of PtIV prodrugs that are reduced into the therapeutically active PtII species within the tumor microenvironment has received much research interest. In order to provide spatial and temporal control over the treatment, there is a high demand for the development of compounds that could be selectively activated upon irradiation. Despite recent progress, the majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds to superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors. The nanoparticles were found to selectively accumulate inside a mouse colon carcinoma tumor upon intravenous injection and were able to eradicate the tumor upon exposure to ultrasound radiation.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of Monometallic C^C* Platinum(II) Formamidinate Complexes using Sterically Demanding Ligands</title>

Following a concise quantum chemical screening, sterically demanding amidinate ligands were employed in the synthesis of monometallic C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. This new class of photoluminescent platinum(II) complexes features a hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength of up to 137&#8197;nm in comparison to their bimetallic counterparts explained by the loss of metallophilic interactions.







Abstract
A novel class of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes&#8212;previously considered to be inaccessible&#8212;was synthesized by an improved synthetic route utilizing ligands predicted by density functional theory calculations. Based on a concise quantum chemical screening three model ligands with varying steric demand were chosen and a series of six photoluminescent C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) formamidinate complexes was obtained. The least sterically demanding ligand led to a bimetallic complex in two isomeric forms, which could be separated and confirmed by the corresponding solid&#8208;state structures. Sterically more hindered amidinate ligands gave the monometallic complexes supporting the theoretical predictions. The monometallic complexes show a significant hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength, explained by the loss of the metal&#8208;metal interactions. Depending on the cyclometalating ligand quantum yields up to 87&#8201;% with short decay times were found for this new class of phosphorescent green&#8208;blue to pure blue platinum(II) emitters.

         <title>Entropic Contributions to Sodium Solvation and Solvent Stabilization upon Electrochemical Sodium Deposition from Diglyme and Propylene Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropic contributions to the free enthalpy may significantly influence the equilibrium potential of an electrode in a battery system. By microcalorimetric measurements of Na deposition from a diglyme solution, we show that solvation entropy destabilizes the Na+ in solution by about 0.7&#8197;eV, thus strongly increasing the stability of the electrolyte solution upon Na deposition and affecting the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
The formation of an appropriate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode of a sodium battery is crucially dependent on the electrochemical stability of solvent and electrolyte at the redox potential of Na/Na+ in the respective system. In order to determine entropic contributions to the relative stability of the electrolyte solution, we measure the reaction entropy of Na metal deposition for diglyme (DG) and propylene carbonate (PC) based electrolyte solutions by electrochemical microcalorimetry at single electrodes. We found a large positive reaction entropy for Na+ deposition in DG of &#916;R
234&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 (c.f.: &#916;R
83&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1), which signals substantial entropic destabilization of Na+ in DG by about 0.73&#8197;eV, thus increasing the stability of solvent and electrolyte relative to Na+ reduction. We attribute this strong entropic destabilization to a highly negative solvation entropy of Na+, due to the low dielectric constant and high freezing entropy of DG.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Optophysiology Platform for Recording Intracellular and Extracellular Signals across the Brain of Free&#8208;Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform was created for simultaneously quantifying intracellular L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and extracellular dopamine (DA), and recording electrophysiological signals in the brain of free&#8208;moving mice. Using our powerful tool, we found that Cys regulated DA by facilitating the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. Molecular networks involving Cys and DA were significantly affected in the depressed mice and recovered by the treatment with N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine.







Abstract
Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of both intra/extracellular chemical signals across the large&#8208;scale brain is the key bottleneck for understanding the interactions between the molecules inside and outside neurons. Here we built up a high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform, together with developing two probes for specific recognition of L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and dopamine (DA), for simultaneously quantifying of both intracellular Cys and extracellular DA with high selectivity and accuracy across the brain of freely moving animals, as well as recording electrical signals. Using this powerful tool, it was found that intracellular Cys regulated extracellular DA through inducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the depressed mice brain. We also established the functional networks of Cys and DA across 32 brain regions in freely moving animals. More importantly, it was discovered that depression reduced the correlations between adjacent brain regions, which was recovered by the treatment of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine.

         <title>Synergy of Cu/C3N4 Interface and Cu Nanoparticles Dual Catalytic Regions in Electrolysis of CO to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalyst composed of Cu nanoparticles and g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (Cu&#8722;CN) is reported, which could efficiently covert CO into acetate with a Faradaic efficiency of 62.8&#8201;% in a flow cell and acetic acid continuously in a porous solid electrolyte reactor. In situ experiments and density functional theory studies reveal the synergy between dual catalytic regions: Cu/C3N4 interface enhances the generation and coverage of *CHO from CO, and Cu NPs facilitate the acetic acid (acetate) generation from migrated *CHO.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction reaction of carbon monoxide (CORR) offers a promising way to manufacture acetic acid directly from gaseous CO and water at mild condition. Herein, we discovered that the graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) supported Cu nanoparticles (Cu&#8722;CN) with the appropriate size showed a high acetate faradaic efficiency of 62.8&#8201;% with a partial current density of 188&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in CORR. In situ experimental and density functional theory calculation studies revealed that the Cu/C3N4 interface and metallic Cu surface synergistically promoted CORR into acetic acid. The generation of pivotal intermediate &#8722;*CHO is advantage around the Cu/C3N4 interface and migrated *CHO facilitates acetic acid generation on metallic Cu surface with promoted *CHO coverage. Moreover, continuous production of acetic acid aqueous solution was achieved in a porous solid electrolyte reactor, indicating the great potential of Cu&#8722;CN catalyst in the industrial application.

         <title>Harnessing the Structure and Dynamics of the Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclase for (&#8722;)&#8208;Ambroxide Production
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy in engineering the active site and entrance tunnel of squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase is demonstrated in the archetypal promiscuous cyclization of (E,E)&#8208;homofarnesol towards high&#8208;value (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide. Moreover, the long&#8208;term stability of the enzyme in vivo was exploited in a feeding strategy to demonstrate high cyclization performance.







Abstract
Terpene cyclases offer enormous synthetic potential, given their unique ability to forge complex hydrocarbon scaffolds from achiral precursors within a single cationic rearrangement cascade. Harnessing their synthetic power, however, has proved to be challenging owing to their generally low catalytic performance. In this study, we unveiled the catalytic potential of the squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase (SHC) by harnessing its structure and dynamics. First, we synergistically tailored the active site and entrance tunnel of the enzyme to generate a 397&#8208;fold improved (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide synthase. Our computational investigations explain how the introduced mutations work in concert to improve substrate acquisition, flow, and chaperoning. Kinetics, however, showed terpene&#8208;induced inactivation of the membrane&#8208;bound SHC to be the major turnover limitation in vivo. Merging this insight with the improved and stereoselective catalysis of the enzyme, we applied a feeding strategy to exceed 105 total turnovers. We believe that our results may bridge the gap for broader application of SHCs in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Longitudinally Grafting of Graphene with Iron Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Porous Organic Polymer to Boost Oxygen Electroreduction</title>

Exfoliated laminar iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymer (PFePc) nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) are designed as noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Comprehensive variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy measurements further reveal the rapid ORR kinetics of the prepared 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc.







Abstract
Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymers (PFePc) are attractive noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the low site&#8208;exposure degree and poor electrical conductivity of bulk PFePc restricted their practical applications. Herein, laminar PFePc nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) was prepared. Such structural engineering qualifies 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc with high site utilization and rapid mass transfer. Thence, 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc demonstrates efficient ORR performance with a high specific activity of 69.31&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 81.88&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high turnover frequency of 0.93&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1 at 0.90&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in O2&#8208;saturated 0.1&#8197;M KOH, outperforming the lamellar PFePc wrapped graphene counterpart. Systematic electrochemical analyses integrating variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy further underline the rapid kinetics of 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc towards ORR.

         <title>Triphenylamine&#8208;Derived Solid&#8208;State Emissive Carbon Dots for Multicolor High&#8208;Efficiency Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Bright multicolor electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with high device performance are prepared by adoping triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive carbon dots (CDs) as single emissive layer.







Abstract
Two kinds of triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive carbon dots (CDs) with orange and yellow color are facilely synthesized through solvothermal treatment, taking advantage of the nonplanar structure and good carrier mobility of triphenylamine unit. Theoretical calculations show that the triphenylamine structure could greatly inhibit the direct &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of aromatic skeletons and enhance the fluorescence properties of CDs in aggregation state. By adopting the CDs as single emissive layer, high&#8208;performance orange&#8208;color and green&#8208;color electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are successfully fabricated, with maximum brightness of 9450/4236&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, high current efficiency of 1.57/2.34&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.1/3.6&#8197;eV are respectively achieved. Significantly, white&#8208;color LED device is further prepared. This work provides a universal platform for the construction of novel solid&#8208;state emissive CDs with significant applications in photoelectric device.

         <title>Reducing Overpotential of Solid&#8208;State Sulfide Conversion in Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve a superior potassium&#8208;sulfur battery performance, we elucidate the solid&#8208;state K2S3&#8722;K2S conversion pathway via meta&#8208;stable intermediates on a range of transition metal single&#8208;atom catalytic sulfur hosts. It is demonstrated that the host with Cu single atom exhibits a relatively weak Cu&#8208;S bonding, resulting in low overpotential of K2S3&#8722;K2S conversion. The resultant catalytic sulfur host demonstrates high discharge capacities of 1595 and 1226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 335 and 1675&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Improving kinetics of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion in sulfur cathodes can enhance sulfur utilization of metal&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, fundamental understanding of the solid&#8208;state conversion remains to be achieved. Here, taking potassium&#8208;sulfur batteries as a model system, we for the first time report the reducing overpotential of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion via the meta&#8208;stable S32&#8722; intermediates on transition metal single&#8208;atom sulfur hosts. The catalytic sulfur host containing Cu single atoms demonstrates high capacities of 1595 and 1226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current densities of 335 and 1675&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, with stable Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;100&#8201;%. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical computations reveal that the relatively weak Cu&#8208;S bonding results in low overpotential of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion and high sulfur utilization. The elucidation of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion mechanism can direct the exploration of highly efficient metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Photoelectromagnetic Responsive Adaptive Porous Frameworks through Dynamic Covalent Chemistry of Tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned Aryldicyanomethyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic trimer&#8208;based dynamic framework with a complex 3D channel network has been constructed through reversible dynamic covalent linking of tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned aryl dicyanomethyl radical building blocks. Due to the conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;mediated reaction dynamics, the system shows macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, photoluminescence, and magnetic properties.







Abstract
Dynamic materials undergoing adaptive solid&#8208;state transitions are attractive for soft mechanics and information technology. Here, we report a novel porous framework system based on macrocyclic trimers assembled from open&#8208;shell tetraarylethylene building blocks with aryldicyanomethyl radicals as coupling linkers. Under mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli, the framework showed adaptability by activating conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;based transformations, thus displaying macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, luminescence, and magnetism. We studied the dynamic processes by variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR), variable&#8208;temperature electron spin resonance (VT&#8208;ESR), and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurement and further established a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for multi&#8208;modal information encryption. The strategy may open avenues for rational design of solid&#8208;state photoelectromagnetic dynamic materials by merging dynamic covalent coupling chemistry and functional aggregation principles.

We developed a catalytic process of nickel&#8208;promoted electrochemical graphitization in molten calcium chloride. Multi&#8208;scale approach from atomic reactions to macroscale cells is useful in understanding the mechanism of evolution in the electrolytic cell, the kinetics of electrochemical reactions and the pathways of nickel&#8208;promoted graphitization and tubularization.







Abstract
Owing to high&#8208;efficiency and scalable advantages of electrolysis in molten salts, electrochemical conversion of carbonaceous resources into graphitic products is a sustainable route for achieving high value&#8208;added carbon. To understand the complicated kinetics of converting amorphous carbon (e.g. carbonized lignin&#8208;biochar) into highly graphitic carbon, herein this study reports the key processing parameters (addition of Ni, temperature and time) and multi&#8208;scale approach of nickel&#8208;boosted electrochemical graphitization&#8208;catalysis processes in molten calcium chloride. Upon both experiments and modellings, multi&#8208;scale analysis that ranges from nanoscale atomic reaction to macroscale cell reveal the multi&#8208;field evolution in the electrolysis cell, mechanism of electrochemical reaction kinetics as well as pathway of nickel&#8208;boosted graphitization and tubulization. The results of as&#8208;achieved controllable processing regions and multi&#8208;scale approaches provide a rational strategy of manipulating electrochemical graphitization processes and utilizing the converted biomass resources for high value&#8208;added use.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence from Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We doped yitterbium ions into perovskite nanocrystal hosts for extending their electroluminescence wavelength towards 1000&#8197;nm. The synergy of halide&#8208;stoichiometry control and surface passivation enables us to achieve an efficient near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diode with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%, representing the highest efficiency among organic LEDs and perovskite LEDs with peak wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm to date.







Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) deliver size&#8208; and composition&#8208;tunable luminescence of high efficiency and color purity in the visible range. However, attaining efficient electroluminescence (EL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region from PeNCs is challenging, limiting their potential applications. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) by doping ytterbium ions into a PeNCs host (Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs), extending the EL wavelengths toward 1000&#8197;nm, which is achieved through a direct sensitization of Yb3+ ions by the PeNC host. Efficient quantum&#8208;cutting processes enable high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 126&#8201;% from the Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs. Through halide&#8208;composition engineering and surface passivation to improve both PLQY and charge&#8208;transport balance, we demonstrate an efficient NIR LED with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;% at a central wavelength of 990&#8197;nm, representing the most efficient perovskite&#8208;based LEDs with emission wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm.

         <title>Close&#8208;Shell Reductive Elimination versus Open&#8208;Shell Radical Coupling for Site&#8208;Selective Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activations by Computation and Experiments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origins of site&#8208;selectivity for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and arylation have been illuminated by means of density functional theory calculations. The competition between close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and open&#8208;shell radical attack is responsible for the ortho&#8208; versus meta&#8208;selectivity, for which a multi&#8208;linear regression model, predicting the site&#8208;selection, was devised and tested experimentally.







Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond activation&#8208;assisted meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as a useful tool to forge distal C&#8722;C bonds. However, given the limited number of mechanistic studies, a clear understanding of the origin of the site&#8208;selectivity and the complete reaction pattern is not available. Here, we present systematic computational studies on ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization with primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl bromides and aryl bromides. The C&#8722;H scission and the C&#8722;C formation were carefully examined. Monocyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes were identified as the active species, which then underwent inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer (ISET) to activate the organic bromides. The site&#8208;selectivity results from the competition between the close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and the open&#8208;shell radical coupling. Based on this mechanistic understanding, a multilinear regression model was built to predict the site&#8208;selectivity, which was further validated by experiments.

An unprecedented &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reaction that is enabled by ene reductases is reported. When the reaction is coupled with photocatalysis, various 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#8208;ones can be synthesized in a straightforward manner from readily available cyclohexenones and N&#8208;phenylglycines.

Abstract
Herein we report that ene reductases (EREDs) can facilitate an unprecedented intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reaction for the synthesis of bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles containing the 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold. To streamline the synthesis of these privileged motifs, we developed a gram&#8208;scale one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic cascade by combining iridium photocatalysis with EREDs, using readily available N&#8208;phenylglycines and cyclohexenones that can be obtained from biomass. Further derivatization using enzymatic or chemical methods can convert 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#8208;one into 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;ols, which can be potentially utilized for the synthesis of azaprophen and its analogues for drug discovery. Mechanistic studies revealed the reaction requires oxygen, presumably to produce oxidized flavin, which can selectively dehydrogenate the 3&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone derivatives to form the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which subsequently undergoes spontaneous intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition under basic conditions.

         <title>&#8220;First Come, First Served&#8221; and Threshold Effects in a Central&#8208;to&#8208;Planar&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Hierarchical Chiral Induction</title>

         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene derivatives with perylene diimide tethers have been shown to form aggregates in nonpolar organic solvents that undergo a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer on complexation with a cationic amino acid ethyl ester. The chiral transfer only occurs when the chiral inducer exceeds a threshold concentration, with significant gabs values of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8722;2 observed.







Abstract
Perylene diimide tethered pillar[5]arene derivatives form aggregates in non&#8208;polar organic solvents, and the complexation of cationic amino acid ethyl ester (cAA&#8208;OEt) with the aggregates induce a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer, leading to intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals having dissymmetric factors (gabs) of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8722;2.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perylene diimide tethered pillar[5]arene derivatives form aggregates in non-polar organic solvents, and the complexation of cationic amino acid ethyl ester (cAA-OEt) with the aggregates induce a central-to-planar-to-helical chirality transfer, leading to intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals having dissymmetric factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;

The hierarchical chiral induction exhibited an intriguing threshold dose effect, namely, the chiral induction does not occur in the low concentration range of cAA-OEt but is triggered when cAA-OEt exceeds a threshold concentration.

         <title>Iron&#8208;siRNA Nanohybrids for Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy via Ferritin Heavy Chain Downregulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reinforcing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent based on siRNA&#8208;embedded iron nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) is reported. The degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs to Fe2+ and siRNA occurs in acidic endo/lysosomes and is promoted by oxygen depletion&#8208;caused intracellular pH decrease. In addition to initiating CDT, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of ferritin heavy chain (FHC) siRNA, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.







Abstract
Ferrous iron (Fe2+) has more potent hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH)&#8208;generating ability than other Fenton&#8208;type metal ions, making Fe&#8208;based nanomaterials attractive for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). However, because Fe2+ can be converted by ferritin heavy chain (FHC) to nontoxic ferric form and then sequestered in ferritin, therapeutic outcomes of Fe&#8208;mediated CDT agents are still far from satisfactory. Here we report the synthesis of siRNA&#8208;embedded Fe0 nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) for self&#8208;reinforcing CDT via FHC downregulation. Upon internalization by cancer cells, pH&#8208;responsive Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs are degraded to release Fe2+ and FHC siRNA in acidic endo/lysosomes with the aid of oxygen (O2). The accompanied O2 depletion causes an intracellular pH decrease, which further promotes the degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs. In addition to initiating chemodynamic process, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of siRNA by disrupting the membranes, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Triggered Chemodynamic Therapy via a Peptide&#8208;H2S Donor Conjugate with Complexed Fe2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining an enzyme&#8208;triggered hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor with the Fenton reaction promoter Fe2+, we developed a peptide&#8208;H2S donor conjugate&#8208;Fe2+ complex that increased levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species in C6 cancer cells, providing an H2S&#8208;amplified, enzyme&#8208;responsive system for precise cancer treatment.







Abstract
Inducing high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside tumor cells is a cancer therapy method termed chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Relying on delivery of Fenton reaction promoters such as Fe2+, CDT takes advantage of overproduced ROS in the tumor microenvironment. We developed a peptide&#8208;H2S donor conjugate, complexed with Fe2+, termed AAN&#8208;PTC&#8211;Fe2+. The AAN tripeptide was specifically cleaved by legumain, an enzyme overexpressed in glioma cells, to release carbonyl sulfide (COS). Hydrolysis of COS by carbonic anhydrase formed H2S, an inhibitor of catalase, an enzyme that detoxifies H2O2. Fe2+ and H2S together increased intracellular ROS levels and decreased viability in C6 glioma cells compared with controls lacking either Fe2+, the AAN sequence, or the ability to generate H2S. AAN&#8208;PTC&#8211;Fe2+ performed better than temezolimide while exhibiting no cytotoxicity toward H9C2 cardiomyocytes. This study provides an H2S&#8208;amplified, enzyme&#8208;responsive platform for synergistic cancer treatment.

Abstract
Constructing highly effective biocatalysts with controllable coordination geometry for eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) to address the current bottlenecks in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics remains challenging.

Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, Mn&#8722;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, including elimination of H2O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;. Consequently, Mn&#8722;PcBC efficiently rescues the bioactivity and functionality of stem cells in high&#8208;ROS&#8208;level microenvironments by protecting the transcription of osteogenesis&#8208;related genes. This study offers essential insight into the crucial functions of axially coordinated Mn&#8722;N5 sites in ROS scavenging and suggests new strategies to create efficient artificial antioxidases for stem&#8208;cell therapies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Prenucleation&#8208;Induced Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy is proposed with formamide as a double&#8208;face solvent to accelerate the nucleation of formamidine/cesium&#8208;based perovskites. The preferentially precipitated PbI2&#8208;DMSO crystals by formamide act as nucleation seeds to accelerate the nucleation process. The crystalline quality of the prepared perovskite film is significantly improved. The efficiency of hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exceeds 19&#8201;%.







Abstract
Perovskite film with high crystal quality is fundamental to achieving high&#8208;performance solar cells. A fast nucleation process is crucial to improving the crystallization quality. Here, we propose a self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy to achieve fast nucleation. This is realized through rational solvent design. The key characteristics of different solvents are systematically evaluated. Among them, formamide, with ultra&#8208;high dielectric constant, low Gutman donor number, and a high boiling point, is selected as the co&#8208;solvent. These unique characteristics render formamide a double&#8208;face solvent that is a good solvent for formamidinium iodide (FAI) and CsI while a poor solvent for PbI2. As a result, formamide induces the self&#8208;driven prenucleation of PbI2&#8208;DMSO seeding crystals and accelerates the nucleation, improving the crystalline quality of perovskite film. The efficiency of the hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells is boosted beyond 19&#8201;% for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;A self-driven prenucleation strategy is proposed with formamide as a double-face solvent to accelerate the nucleation of formamidine/cesium-based perovskites. The preferentially precipitated PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DMSO crystals by formamide act as nucleation seeds to accelerate the nucleation process. The crystalline quality of the prepared perovskite film is significantly improved. The efficiency of hole transport layer-free carbon-based perovskite solar cells exceeds 19&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite film with high crystal quality is fundamental to achieving high-performance solar cells. A fast nucleation process is crucial to improving the crystallization quality. Here, we propose a self-driven prenucleation strategy to achieve fast nucleation. This is realized through rational solvent design. The key characteristics of different solvents are systematically evaluated. Among them, formamide, with ultra-high dielectric constant, low Gutman donor number, and a high boiling point, is selected as the co-solvent. These unique characteristics render formamide a double-face solvent that is a good solvent for formamidinium iodide (FAI) and CsI while a poor solvent for PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, formamide induces the self-driven prenucleation of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-DMSO seeding crystals and accelerates the nucleation, improving the crystalline quality of perovskite film. The efficiency of the hole transport layer-free carbon-based perovskite solar cells is boosted beyond 19&#8201;% for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Growing ZIF&#8208;8 Seeds on Charged COF Substrates toward Efficient Propylene&#8208;Propane Separation Membranes</title>

Charged COF nanosheets are used as nuclei&#8208;deposition substrate (NDS) to generate MOF@COF nanosheet seeds, which enables the fabrication of ultrathin, defect&#8208;free MOF membranes by secondary growth.







Abstract
We report a covalent organic framework (COF) induced seeding strategy to fabricate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes. Contrary to graphene oxide nuclei&#8208;depositing substrate, COF substrate has uniform pore size, high microporosity and abundant functional groups. We designed a series of charged COF nanosheets to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;8@COF nanosheet seeds with high aspect ratio over 150, which were readily processed into a compact and uniform seed layer. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8 membranes with thickness down to 100&#8197;nm exhibit an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 separation performance and superior long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is also validated by fabricating ultrathin ZIF&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;66 membranes.

         <title>Highly Stable Triangular Single&#8208;Layer 2D Assemblies: Synthesis and Their Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Elastic and Anisotropic Curling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable single&#8208;layer 2D assemblies of AuI&#8208;thiolate, with both long&#8208;range molecular order and a uniform triangular morphology, have been synthesized, and their elastic and anisotropic curling upon external stimuli has been achieved on single&#8208;assembly level.







Abstract
Synthesis of highly stable two&#8208;dimensional single&#8208;layer assemblies (SLAs) is a key challenge in supramolecular science, especially those with long&#8208;range molecular order and well&#8208;defined morphology. Here, thin (thickness &lt;2&#8197;nm) triangular AuI&#8208;thiolate SLAs with high thermo&#8208;, solvato&#8208; and mechano&#8208; stability have been synthesized via a double&#8208;ligand co&#8208;assembly strategy. Furthermore, the SLAs show assembly&#8208;level elastic and anisotropic deformation responses to external stimuli as a result of the long&#8208;range anisotropic molecular packing, which provides SLAs with new application potentials in bio&#8208;mimic nanomechanics.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Biomimetic Dimerization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant. This protocol allows the dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerance to construct natural and unnatural pyrroloindole dimers and dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold linking two turn structures.







Abstract
Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established. The discovery of the extremely active iron catalyst enables aerobic enzyme&#8208;mimetic oxidation to be performed in a flask. This method was applicable to the oxidative dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan derivatives, including various dipeptides and oligopeptides, with remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerance without the protection of the amino acid residues. Furthermore, oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives bearing dioxopiperazine units enabled the convergent total synthesis of five natural pyrroloindole compounds and unnatural congeners. The established chemical method provides facile access to a broad range of dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold to link two turn structures, which will serve as a powerful tool to create new small&#8208; and medium&#8208;sized&#8208;molecules as drug candidates.

2&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropylacetaldehydes undergo enantioselective vinylcyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene (VCP&#8208;CP) rearrangement using a Jorgensen&#8208;Hayashi&#8208;type catalyst. The reaction proceeds through enamine/iminium activation and comprises the in situ generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane intermediate that undergoes ring&#8208;opening/cyclization. Computational studies together with the experimental data support a type&#8208;II DYKAT process operating.







Abstract
We have demonstrated that the catalytic and enantioselective vinylcyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene rearrangement can be carried out on (vinylcyclopropyl)acetaldehydes through activation via enamine intermediates. The reaction makes use of racemic starting materials that, upon ring opening facilitated by the catalytic generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane, deliver an acyclic iminium ion/dienolate intermediate in which all stereochemical information has been deleted. The final cyclization step forms the rearrangement product, showing that chirality transfer from the catalyst to the final compound is highly effective and leads to the stereocontrolled formation of a variety of structurally different cyclopentenes.

         <title>Molecular Dipole Engineering of Carbonyl Additives for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach was proposed to design and synthesize efficient carbonyl additives to improve perovskite device performance. After systematic research, we find that molecular dipole plays an important role in determining the passivation effect of the additive molecule. After optimization, the companion efficiency of the perovskite device is 23.20&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2), 20.18&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2) and it can maintain long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions.







Abstract
Carbonyl functional materials as additives are extensively applied to reduce the defects density of the perovskite film. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding for the effect of carbonyl additives to improve device performance. In this work, we systematically study the effect of carbonyl additive molecules on the passivation of defects in perovskite films. After a comprehensive investigation, the results confirm the importance of molecular dipole in amplifying the passivation effect of additive molecules.

     alt="Molecular Dipole Engineering of Carbonyl Additives for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new approach was proposed to design and synthesize efficient carbonyl additives to improve perovskite device performance. After systematic research, we find that molecular dipole plays an important role in determining the passivation effect of the additive molecule. After optimization, the companion efficiency of the perovskite device is 23.20&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 20.18&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and it can maintain long-term stability under harsh conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbonyl functional materials as additives are extensively applied to reduce the defects density of the perovskite film. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding for the effect of carbonyl additives to improve device performance. In this work, we systematically study the effect of carbonyl additive molecules on the passivation of defects in perovskite films. After a comprehensive investigation, the results confirm the importance of molecular dipole in amplifying the passivation effect of additive molecules. The additive with strong molecular dipole possesses the advantages of enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). After optimization, the companion efficiency of PSCs is 23.20&#8201;%, and it can maintain long-term stability under harsh conditions. Additionally, a large-area solar cell module-modified DLBA was 20.18&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This work provides an important reference for the selection and designing of efficient carbonyl additives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Synthesis and Biological Activity of 2&#8208;Exomethylene Pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates: Discovery of Mincle&#8208;Selective Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphine&#8208;ligand&#8208;controlled Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type glycosylation enabled the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates with an exomethylene group at the C2 position. These compounds are Mincle&#8208;selective ligands that do not bind to CD1d, suggesting that the 2&#8208;OH group of natural glycoconjugates is critical for CD1d binding.







Abstract
Glycoconjugate analogues in which the sp3&#8208;hybridized C2 position of the carbohydrate structure (normally bearing a hydroxy group) is converted into a compact sp2&#8208;hybridized exomethylene group are expected to have unique biological activities. We established ligand&#8208;controlled Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type glycosylation methodology to directly prepare a variety of these 2&#8208;exomethylene pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates, including glucosylceramide analogues, in an &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;selective manner. Glucocerebrosidase GBA1 cleaves these synthetic pseudo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosylceramides similarly to native glucosylceramides. The pseudo&#8208;glucosylceramides exhibit selective ligand activity towards macrophage&#8208;inducible C&#8208;type lectin (Mincle), but unlike native glucosylceramides, are inactive towards CD1d.

         <title>Starch&#8208;Based Superabsorbent Hydrogel with High Electrolyte Retention Capability and Synergistic Interface Engineering for Long&#8208;Lifespan Flexible Zinc&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic interaction between the acrylate groups along the starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) polymeric chains and zinc contributes to the dendrite&#8208;free interfacial layer formation. However, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;host exhibits limited interaction with the zinc anode, suggesting a random zinc deposition.







Abstract
The advent of wearable electronics has strongly stimulated advanced research into the exploration of flexible zinc&#8722;air batteries (ZABs) with high theoretical energy density, high inherent safety, and low cost. However, the half&#8208;open battery structure and the high concentration of alkaline aqueous environment pose great challenges on the electrolyte retention capability and the zinc anode stability. Herein, a starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) with high ionic conductivity, electrolyte absorption and retention capabilities, strong alkaline resistance and high zinc anode stability has been designed and applied in ZABs. Experimental and calculational analyses probe into the root of the superiority of SSHPEs, confirming the significance of the carboxyl functional groups along their polymer chains. These features endow the as&#8208;fabricated ZAB a long cycle life of 300&#8197;h, much longer than that with commonly used poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based electrolyte.

         <title>Electron Redistribution Enables Redox&#8208;Resistible Li6PS5Cl towards High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an electron redistribution strategy with Mg and F co&#8208;doping to inhibit the interfacial redox reactions between Li6PS5Cl and Li. Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptation from Li metal, and F further generates the self&#8208;limiting interface between the electrolyte and Li metal. This design enhances interfacial stability, enabling the high performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery.







Abstract
Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivity hold great promise for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the parasitic redox reactions between sulfide electrolyte and Li metal result in interfacial instability and rapid decline of the battery performance. Herein, a redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) electrolyte is created by regulating the electron distribution in LPSC with Mg and F incorporation. The introduction of Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptance from Li, and F generates the self&#8208;limiting interface, which hinders the redox reactions between LPSC and Li metal. This redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl&#8208;MgF2 electrolyte therefore presents a high critical current density (2.3 times that of pristine electrolyte). The LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl&#8208;MgF2/Li cell shows an outstanding cycling stability (93.3&#8201;%@100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C). This study highlights the electronic structure modulation to address redox issues on sulfide&#8208;based lithium batteries.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Revival of Degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 to Stable Highly Luminescent Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
After ageing under ambient conditions, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of as&#8208;synthesized CsPbI3 nanocrystals drastically declined to &#8776;11&#8201;% due to the formation of surface defect states. These &#8220;optically sick&#8221; CsPbI3 nanocrystals are then revived to their cubic phase through the addition of 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH), and regain a PLQY of approximately 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 is regarded as an attractive optical luminophore, it is readily degraded to the optically inactive &#948;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions. Here, we present a simple approach to revive degraded (&#8220;optically sick&#8221;) &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 through &#8220;medication&#8221; with thiol&#8208;containing ligands. The effect of different types of thiols is systematically studied through optical spectroscopy. The structural reconstruction of degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals to cubic crystals in the presence of thiol&#8208;containing ligands is visualized through high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We found that 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH) effectively revives degraded CsPbI3 and results in high immunity towards moisture and oxygen, hitherto unreported. DSH facilitates the passivation of surface defects and etching of degraded Cs4PbI6 phase, thus reverting them back to the cubic CsPbI3 phase, leading to enhanced PL and environmental stability.

         <title>Overcoming the Trade&#8208;Off between C2H2 Sorption and Separation Performance by Regulating Metal&#8208;Alkyne Chemical Interaction in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>

The metal&#8208;alkyne chemical interaction of PdII and PtII in two isostructural NbO metal&#8211;organic frameworks was regulated to obtain different binding affinities for C2H2. As a result, C2H2 could be selectively adsorbed and C2H2/CO2 could be separated at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Designing porous materials for C2H2 purification and safe storage is essential research for industrial utilization. We emphatically regulate the metal&#8208;alkyne interaction of PdII and PtII on C2H2 sorption and C2H2/CO2 separation in two isostructural NbO metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA and Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA. The experimental investigations and systematic theoretical calculations reveal that PdII in Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA undergoes spontaneous chemical reaction with C2H2, leading to irreversible structural collapse and loss of C2H2/CO2 sorption and separation. Contrarily, PtII in Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA shows strong di&#8208;&#963; bond interaction with C2H2 to form specific &#960;&#8208;complexation, contributing to high C2H2 capture (28.7&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#8197;bar and 153&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar). The reusable Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA efficiently separates C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures with satisfying selectivity and C2H2 capacity (37&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1). This research provides valuable insight into designing high&#8208;performance MOFs for gas sorption and separation.

         <title>A Modular Tubular Flow System with Replaceable Photocatalyst Membranes for Scalable Coupling and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular tubular flow system with replaceable porous structured photocatalyst membranes provides a solution for scaling&#8208;up heterogeneous photocatalytic coupling and hydrogenation reactions with high efficiency under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is effective for the selective synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals at lab&#8208;scale, yet falls short of requirements for mass production (low cost and user friendliness). Here we report the design and fabrication of a modular tubular flow system embedded with replaceable photocatalyst membranes for scalable photocatalytic C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N homocoupling and hydrogenation reactions, which can be operated in either circular and continuous flow mode with high performance. The photocatalyst membranes almost fully occupy the volume of the reactor, thus enabling optimal absorption of the incident light. Additionally, the porous structured photocatalyst membranes facilitate the mass transfer of the reactants to efficiently use the active sites, resulting in 0th&#8208;order reaction kinetics and a high space&#8208;time yield compared to the batch reaction system at practical application levels and prolonged reaction times.

         <title>Utilizing Nitroarenes and HCHO to Directly Construct Functional N&#8208;Heterocycles by Supported Cobalt/Amino Acid Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst and L&#8208;proline, a reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations is presented, which enables direct and diverse access to 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines.







Abstract
Due to the generation of multiple intermediates during the nitroarene reduction, precise interception of single one to develop tandem reactions involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations still remains a significant challenge. Herein, the relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst with l&#8208;proline has been successfully applied to establish a bran&#8208;new reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde, which enables direct and diverse construction of both symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines. It proceeds with operational simplicity, good substrate and functionality compatibility, and excellent step and atom&#8208;efficiency. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Co&#8208;catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect on the formation of key N&#8208;hydroxy imine, and the l&#8208;proline subsequently facilitates the key C&#8722;C bond formation. The current work opens a door to develop useful transformations with nitroarenes by reduction&#8208;interrupted strategy.

         <title>Exposed Zinc Sites on Hybrid ZnIn2S4@CdS Nanocages for Efficient Regioselective Photocatalytic Epoxide Alcoholysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow CdS nanocages wrapped in ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were synthesized to form the hierarchical photocatalyst ZnIn2S4@CdS. Surface&#8208;exposed Zn acid centers and the Z&#8208;Scheme pathway between ZnIn2S4 and CdS promote the polarization of epoxide molecules and interfacial charge transfer, leading to photoredox&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alcoholysis of epoxides.







Abstract
Photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis through C&#8722;O bond cleavage and formation has emerged as an alternative to synthesizing anti&#8208;tumoral pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, the lack of crucial evidence to interpret the interaction between reactants and photocatalyst surface makes it challenging for photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis with both high activity and regioselectivity. In this work, we report the hierarchical ZnIn2S4@CdS photocatalyst for epoxide alcoholysis with high regioselectivity nearly 100&#8201;%. Mechanistic studies unveil that the precise activation switch on exposed Zn acid sites for C&#8722;O bond polarization and cleavage has a critical significance for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the establishment of Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates the interface charge separation and transfer. Remarkably, the underlying regioselective photocatalytic reaction pathway has been distinctly revealed.

A concise electrophilic aromatic borylation reaction was used to synthesize a wide band gap U&#8208;shaped BN&#8208;doped heteroacene. The donor effect of the nitrogen atoms and the high electron affinity of the boron atoms fine&#8208;tuned the electronic features, as well as the dual&#8208;functional layer enabled by supramolecular engineering, resulting in an organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory with large ambipolar memory windows and a high charge storage density.







Abstract
Two wide&#8208;band gap U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with/without boron and nitrogen (BN&#8208;) doping (BN&#8208;1 and C&#8208;1) were synthesized to tune the electronic features to suit the performance requirements for organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory (OFET&#8208;NVM). The chemical structures were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Owing to the electron&#8208;donor effect of N and the high electron affinity of B, the BN&#8208;1&#8208;based OFET&#8208;NVM displays large ambipolar memory windows and an enhanced charge storage density compared to C&#8208;1 and most reported small molecules. A novel supramolecular system formed from BN&#8208;1 and PMMA contributes to fabricating uniform films with homogeneous microstructures, which serve as a two&#8208;in&#8208;one tunnelling dielectric and charge&#8208;trapping layer to realize long&#8208;term charge retention and reliable endurance. Our results demonstrate that both BN doping and supramolecular engineering are crucial for the charge trapping of OFET&#8208;NVM.

&lt;p&gt;A concise electrophilic aromatic borylation reaction was used to synthesize a wide band gap U-shaped BN-doped heteroacene. The donor effect of the nitrogen atoms and the high electron affinity of the boron atoms fine-tuned the electronic features, as well as the dual-functional layer enabled by supramolecular engineering, resulting in an organic field-effect transistor memory with large ambipolar memory windows and a high charge storage density.

&lt;p&gt;Two wide-band gap U-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with/without boron and nitrogen (BN-) doping (&lt;b&gt;BN-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;C-1&lt;/b&gt;) were synthesized to tune the electronic features to suit the performance requirements for organic field-effect transistor memory (OFET-NVM).

         <title>Enhancing Energy Conversion Efficiency and Durability of Alkaline Nickel&#8208;Zinc Batteries with Air&#8208;Breathing Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To leverage the oxygen produced from the avoidable side reaction of oxygen evolution in Ni&#8208;Zn battery, an air&#8208;breathing cathode is constructed by coupling oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst with the Ni(OH)2 cathode. Benefiting from the stabilizing effects on the electrolyte and electrodes, this novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB) exhibits an ultralong lifespan and ultrahigh energy efficiency (85&#8201;%), superior to Ni&#8208;Zn battery and Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB).







Abstract
Despite their high output voltage and safety advantages, rechargeable alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries face significant challenges associated with the cathodic side reaction of oxygen evolution, which results in low energy efficiency (EE) and poor stability. Herein, we propose to leverage the side oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in nickel&#8208;zinc batteries by coupling electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in the cathode, thus constructing an air breathing cathode. Such a novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB), designed in a pouch&#8208;type cell with a lean electrolyte, exhibits an outstanding EE of 85&#8201;% and a long cycle life of 100 cycles at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which are significantly superior to those of traditional Ni&#8208;Zn batteries (54&#8201;%, 50 cycles). Compared to Ni&#8208;Zn, the enhanced EE of Ni&#8208;ZnAB is attributed to the contribution from ORR, while the improved cycling stability is because the stability of the anode, cathode and electrolyte are also enhanced in Ni&#8208;ZnAB. Furthermore, an ultrahigh stability of 500 cycles with an average EE of 84&#8201;% at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved using a mold cell with rich electrolyte, demonstrating the strong application potential of Ni&#8208;ZnAB.

         <title>Carbazolylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle based Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Two shape&#8208;persistent macrocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (MC&#8208;COFs) with aligned porous channels were synthesized. The MC&#8208;COFs&#8217; electrical conductivities were enhanced over 6 orders of magnitude upon I2 doping, with the framework structural integrity maintained. The electrical properties of MC&#8208;COFs can be switched between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states through simple doping&#8208;regenerating cycles.







Abstract
Two covalent organic frameworks consisting of carbazolylene&#8208;ethynylene shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles with azine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1) or imine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;2) linkages were synthesized via imine condensation. The obtained 2D frameworks are fully conjugated which imparts semiconducting properties. In addition, the frameworks showed high porosity with aligned accessible porous channels along the z axis, serving as an ideal platform for post&#8208;synthetic incorporation of I2 into the channels to enable electrical conductivity. The resulting MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 showed an electrical conductivity up to 7.8&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature upon I2 doping with the activation energy as low as 0.09&#8197;eV. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the electrical properties of both MC&#8208;COFs are switchable between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states by simply implementing doping&#8208;regenerating cycles. The knowledge gained in this study opens new possibilities for the future development of tunable conductive 2D organic materials.

         <title>Isobaric Stable Isotope N&#8208;Phosphorylation Labeling (iSIPL) for Ultrasensitive Proteome Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel isobaric phosphorus reagent enables the accurate quantitative proteome analysis and peptide sequencing with high sensitivity. The reporter ion clusters with characteristic P&#8722;N bonds were efficiently generated with very high intensities for protein quantification.







Abstract
Stable isotope chemical labeling methods have been widely used for high&#8208;throughput mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based quantitative proteomics in biological and clinical applications. However, the existing methods are far from meeting the requirements for high sensitivity detection. In the present study, a novel isobaric stable isotope N&#8208;phosphorylation labeling (iSIPL) strategy was developed for quantitative proteome analysis. The tryptic peptides were selectively labeled with iSIPL tag to generate the novel reporter ions containing phosphoramidate P&#8722;N bond with high intensities under lower collision energies. iSIPL strategy are suitable for peptide sequencing and quantitative analysis with high sensitivity and accuracy even for samples of limited quantity. Furthermore, iSIPL coupled with affinity purification and mass spectrometry was applied to measure the dynamics of cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) interactomes during transactivation of the HIV&#8208;1 provirus. The interaction of CDK9 with PARP13 was found to significantly decrease during Tat&#8208;induced activation of HIV&#8208;1 gene transcription, suggesting the effectiveness of iSIPL strategy in dynamic analysis of protein&#8208;protein interaction in vivo. More than that, the proposed iSIPL strategy would facilitate large&#8208;scale accurate quantitative proteomics by increasing multiplexing capability.

         <title>Design of Multicomponent Peptide Fibrils with Ordered and Programmable Compositional Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent peptide nanofibrils are constructed with an unprecedented degree of control over peptide arrangement. A neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning method is described to convert 8 designed peptides into the fibrils with 412 different compositional patterns with tunable compositions and peptide positions. This strategy may enable application&#8208;specific tailoring of material and biological properties of peptide fibrils.







Abstract
Advanced applications of biomacromolecular assemblies require a stringent degree of control over molecular arrangement, which is a challenge to current synthetic methods. Here we used a neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning strategy to build multicomponent peptide fibrils with an unprecedented capacity to manipulate local composition and peptide positions. Eight peptides were designed to have regulable nearest neighbors upon co&#8208;assembly, which, by simulation, afforded 412 different patterns within fibrils, with varied compositions and/or peptide positions. The fibrils with six prescribed patterns were experimentally constructed with high accuracy. The controlled patterning also applies to functionalities appended to the peptides, as exemplified by arranging carbohydrate ligands at nanoscale precision for protein recognition. This study offers a route to molecular editing of inner structures of peptide assemblies, prefiguring the uniqueness and richness of patterning&#8208;based material design.

This study offers a route to molecular editing of inner structures of peptide assemblies, prefiguring the uniqueness and richness of patterning-based material design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Production of CO from Organic Pollutants by Coupling Piezocatalysis and Advanced Oxidation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an unprecedented Co3S4/MoS2/peroxymonosulfate/ultrasound system to achieve a high rate of conversion from pollutants to CO through the coupling of piezocatalysis and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). This system is assisted by the formation of an electron transfer chain from Mo and S to Co, thus improving the thermodynamic process from carbonate to CO and enhancing the yield and selectivity. Our discovery represents a significant boost to achieving low emissions in wastewater treatment.







Abstract
To date, the chemical conversion of organic pollutants into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks rather than CO2 remains a major challenge. Herein, we successfully developed a coupled piezocatalytic and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) system for achieving the conversion of various organic pollutants to CO. The CO product stems from the specific process in which organics are first oxidized to carbonate through peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs, and then the as&#8208;obtained carbonate is converted into CO by piezoelectric reduction under ultrasonic (US) vibration by using a Co3S4/MoS2 catalyst. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the introduction of Co3S4 not only effectively promotes the transfer and utilization of piezoelectric electrons but also realizes highly selective conversion from carbonate to CO. The Co3S4/MoS2/PMS system has achieved selective generation of CO in actual complex wastewater treatment for the first time, indicating its potential practical applicability.

Herein, a catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of N,N&#8208;disubstituted acrylamides has been developed. Sterically&#8208;disfavored and electronically&#8208;disfavored enantioselective hydroaminations of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes were obtained using different transition metals (Cu, Ni) and chiral ligands, delivering enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives in good yields and selectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoacid and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoacid derivatives play an important role in biological science and pharmaceutical chemistry. Thus, the development of methods for their synthesis is highly valuable and yet remains challenging. Herein, an unprecedented catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of N,N&#8208;disubstituted acrylamides with aminating agents has been developed, accessing enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives. Sterically&#8208;disfavored and electronically&#8208;disfavored enantioselective hydroamination of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes have been successfully tuned using different transition metals and chiral ligands. Notably, extremely hindered aliphatic &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam derivatives were synthesized by Cu&#8722;H catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;N bond forming with tertiary alkyl species. Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives have been accessed by Ni&#8722;H catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;selective formal hydroaminations of alkenes. This set of reactions tolerates a wide range of functional groups to deliver diverse &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives in good yields with high levels of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Small Molecule Degraders of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B and T&#8208;Cell Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inhibitor for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) was discovered and transformed into a first&#8208;in&#8208;class, potent, and selective dual PROTAC degrader for both targets. The degrader promotes antigen presentation of tumor cells and activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells. Importantly, the degrader is effective in vivo and suppresses syngeneic tumor growth.







Abstract
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) play non&#8208;redundant negative regulatory roles in T&#8208;cell activation, tumor antigen presentation, insulin and leptin signaling, and are potential targets for several therapeutic applications. Here, we report the development of a highly potent and selective small molecule degrader DU&#8208;14 for both PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP. DU&#8208;14 mediated PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation requires both target protein(s) and VHL E3 ligase engagement and is also ubiquitination&#8208; and proteasome&#8208;dependent. DU&#8208;14 enhances IFN&#8208;&#947; induced JAK1/2&#8208;STAT1 pathway activation and promotes MHC&#8208;I expression in tumor cells. DU&#8208;14 also activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells and augments STAT1 and STAT5 phosphorylation. Importantly, DU&#8208;14 induces PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation in vivo and suppresses MC38 syngeneic tumor growth. The results indicate that DU&#8208;14, as the first PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP dual degrader, merits further development for treating cancer and other indications.

         <title>Armor&#8208;like Inorganic&#8208;rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by the Pentafluorophenylboronic Acid Additive for High&#8208;voltage Li||NCM622 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;voltage stability of NCM622 is realized by armor&#8208;like CEI via electrolyte engineering, where the armored lithium borate on the CEI surface represses the dissolution of CEI moieties and improves the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed across whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) comprising Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathode could potentially realize high capacity and power density. However, suitable electrolytes to tolerate the oxidation on the cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage are urgently needed. Herein, we present an armor&#8208;like inorganic&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) strategy for exploring oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolytes for sustaining 4.8&#8197;V Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) batteries with pentafluorophenylboronic acid (PFPBA) as the additive. In such CEI, the armored lithium borate surrounded by CEI up&#8208;layer represses the dissolution of inner CEI moieties and also improves the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed over whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability and Li+ conductivity compared with polymer moieties. With such robust Li+ conductive CEI, the Li||NCM622 battery delivered excellent stability at 4.6&#8197;V cut&#8208;off voltage with 91.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 400&#8197;cycles. The excellent cycling performance was also obtained even at 4.8&#8197;V cut&#8208;off voltage.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Motif of Bacteroides vulgatus Lipopolysaccharides against Inflammatory Bowel Diseases through an Orthogonal One&#8208;Pot Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridecasaccharide from Bacteroides vulgatus mpk lipopolysaccharides has been synthesized for the first time by a strategy involving orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside&#8208;based orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation.







Abstract
Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, efficient access to long, branched and complex lipopolysaccharides remains challenging. Herein, we report the modular synthesis of a tridecasaccharide from Bacteroides vulgates through an orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoids the issues of thioglycoside&#8208;based one&#8208;pot synthesis. Our approach also features: 1) 5,7&#8208;O&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene&#8208;directed glycosylation for stereoselective construction of the &#945;&#8208;Kdo linkage; 2) hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery for the stereoselective formation of &#946;&#8208;mannosidic bonds; 3) remote anchimeric assistance for stereoselective assembly of the &#945;&#8208;fucosyl linkage; 4) several orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthetic steps and strategic use of orthogonal protecting groups to streamline oligosaccharide assembly; 5) convergent [1+6+6] one&#8208;pot synthesis of the target.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Metallosalphen&#8208;Based 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for NO2 Sensing: Metal Coordination Induced Planarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nonplanar Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) with C2v&#8208;symmetry was developed to construct 2D Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF via in situ one pot synthesis, featuring metal coordination induced planarization of the Salphen cores. The existence of N2O2 pocket of 6OH&#8208;Salphen endows 2D Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with higher metal density, shorter metal&#8208;metal distance and a narrower band gap, thus making it display a high response toward NO2 (766&#8201;% at 100&#8197;ppm).







Abstract
As an emerging class of promising porous materials, the development of two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) is hampered by the few categories and tedious synthesis of the specific ligands. Herein, we developed a nonplanar hexahydroxyl&#8208;functionalized Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) through a facile two&#8208;step synthesis, which was further applied to construct layered 2D c&#8208;MOFs through in situ one pot synthesis based on the synergistic metal binding effect of the N2O2 pocket of Salphen. Interestingly, the C2v&#8208;symmetry of ligand endows Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with periodically heterogeneous pore structures. Benefitting from the higher metal density and shorter in&#8208;plane metal&#8208;metal distance, Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF showcased excellent NO2 sensing performance with good sensitivity, selectivity and reversibility. The current work opens up a new avenue to construct 2D c&#8208;MOF directly from nonplanar ligands, which greatly simplifies the synthesis and provides new possibilities for preparing different topological 2D c&#8208;MOF based functional materials.

         <dc:description>
Some matrix chemicals used in MALDI mass spectrometry are not sufficiently vacuum&#8208;stable and therefore not suitable for extended MALDI imaging experiments. Caging the MALDI matrices by covalent attachment of a photocleavable group renders them vacuum&#8208;stable, as reported by Qiuqin Zhou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202217047). The caged matrix is eventually uncaged in&#8197;situ by the UV laser in the MALDI ion source. Thereby, the original matrix is liberated, thus enabling MALDI imaging of large clinical or pharmacological sample cohorts. Artwork by Miriam Rittel, Stefano Rizzo, and Silas Ackermann.

         <title>Back Cover: Isolated Tin(IV) Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 in Neutral Aqueous Solution (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 22/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;copper metal based catalyst for the deep electroreduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons is reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202301767). For the first time, a Sn&#8208;based catalyst was developed for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to produce hydrocarbons. This Sn&#8208;based MOF shows an unexpected performance in the eCO2RR to produce CH4, as formate or CO are usually common products for traditional Sn&#8208;based catalysts.

For the first time, a Sn-based catalyst was developed for the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) to produce hydrocarbons. This Sn-based MOF shows an unexpected performance in the eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to produce CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, as formate or CO are usually common products for traditional Sn-based catalysts.

Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. In their Research Article (e202301351), Guozhi Xiao and co&#8208;workers accomplished the first synthesis of a tridecasaccharide motif from Bacteroides vulgatus lipopolysaccharides by a strategy involving orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoided issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside&#8208;based orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation.

Ambergris is a highly valued natural product in the fragrance industry and is also known as "floating gold" because of its biosynthesis in the intestines of sperm whales. Owing to this scarce natural resource, the stereoselective synthesis of its most prominent olfactory component, (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide, via alternative routes is attractive. In their Research Article (e202301607), S&#237;lvia Osuna, Bernhard Hauer et&#8197;al. demonstrate the catalytic potential of an engineered squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase in the intricate cyclization of the precursor homofarnesol.

         <title>Engineering Graphdiyne for Solar Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of their large specific surface area, adjustable band gap, and uniformly pore structure, graphdiyne (GDY) materials have become a rising star for photocatalytic energy conversion. This Minireview summarizes the unique physicochemical properties of GDY as well as the construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction and nitrogen reduction.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY) with a direct band gap, excellent carrier mobility and uniform pores, is regarded as a promising photocatalytic material for solar energy conversion, while the research on GDY in photocatalysis is a less developed field. Herein, the distinctive structure, adjustable band gap, and electronic properties of GDY for photocatalysis is firstly summarized. The construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion, including H2 evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and N2 reduction reaction (NRR) are then elaborated. At last, the challenges and perspectives in developing GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production are discussed. It is anticipated that a timely Minireview will be helpful for rapid progress of GDY in solar energy conversion.

         <title>Lessons Learned from the Grouping of Chemicals to Assess Risks to Human Health</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grouping chemicals for risk assessment can consider the similarity of their intrinsic properties (e.g. structure), extrinsic properties, (e.g. persistence), and toxicological properties (e.g. genotoxicity). Based on the lessons learned on several substance classes, we derive principles of grouping, and differentiate between the prioritization of chemicals in groups of the same initial concern versus the definitive groups for justified read&#8208;across.







Abstract
In analogy to the periodic system that groups elements by their similarity in structure and chemical properties, the hazard of chemicals can be assessed in groups having similar structures and similar toxicological properties. Here we review case studies of chemical grouping strategies that supported the assessment of hazard, exposure, and risk to human health. By the EU&#8208;REACH and the US&#8208;TSCA New Chemicals Program, structural similarity is commonly used as the basis for grouping, but that criterion is not always adequate and sufficient. Based on the lessons learned, we derive ten principles for grouping, including: transparency of the purpose, criteria, and boundaries of the group; adequacy of methods used to justify the group; and inclusion or exclusion of substances in the group by toxicological properties. These principles apply to initial grouping to prioritize further actions as well as to definitive grouping to generate data for risk assessment. Both can expedite effective risk management.

     alt="Lessons Learned from the Grouping of Chemicals to Assess Risks to Human Health"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grouping chemicals for risk assessment can consider the similarity of their intrinsic properties (e.g. structure), extrinsic properties, (e.g. persistence), and toxicological properties (e.g. genotoxicity). Based on the lessons learned on several substance classes, we derive principles of grouping, and differentiate between the prioritization of chemicals in groups of the same initial concern versus the definitive groups for justified read-across.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In analogy to the periodic system that groups elements by their similarity in structure and chemical properties, the hazard of chemicals can be assessed in groups having similar structures and similar toxicological properties. Here we review case studies of chemical grouping strategies that supported the assessment of hazard, exposure, and risk to human health. By the EU-REACH and the US-TSCA New Chemicals Program, structural similarity is commonly used as the basis for grouping, but that criterion is not always adequate and sufficient. Based on the lessons learned, we derive ten principles for grouping, including: transparency of the purpose, criteria, and boundaries of the group; adequacy of methods used to justify the group; and inclusion or exclusion of substances in the group by toxicological properties. These principles apply to initial grouping to prioritize further actions as well as to definitive grouping to generate data for risk assessment. Both can expedite effective risk management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Molecular Oxygen Activation in Heterogeneous Thermo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Mini&#8208;review systematically summarized the recent research progress of dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) for molecular oxygen activation (MOA) in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Despite the rapid developments in this field, many great challenges still hinder the practical application of DASCs. We look forward to the challenges and application prospects of DASCs for MOA.







Abstract
Efficient molecular oxygen activation (MOA) is the key to environmentally friendly catalytic oxidation reactions. In the last decade, single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with nearly 100&#8201;% atomic utilization and unique electronic structure have been widely investigated for MOA. However, the single active site makes the activation effect unsatisfactory and difficult to deal with complex catalytic reactions. Recently, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) have provided a new idea for the effective activation of molecular oxygen (O2) due to more diverse active sites and synergetic interactions among adjacent atoms. In this review, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of DASCs for MOA in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Finally, we look forward to the challenges and application prospects in the construction of DASCs for MOA.

         <title>Gold Complexes in Anticancer Therapy: From New Design Principles to Particle&#8208;Based Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold compounds have attracted considerable interest as anticancer drugs. However, the clinical translation of this class of compounds is hampered by suboptimal pharmacological performance. To address this problem, strategies based on molecular design principles have been the primary focus. More recently, the use of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems has emerged as a promising strategy to circumvent many limitations of these promising anticancer metallodrugs.







Abstract
The discovery of the medicinal properties of gold complexes has fuelled the design and synthesis of new anticancer metallodrugs, which have received special attention due to their unique modes of action. Current research in the development of gold compounds with therapeutic properties is predominantly focused on the molecular design of drug leads with superior pharmacological activities, e.g., by introducing targeting features. Moreover, intensive research aims at improving the physicochemical properties of gold compounds, such as chemical stability and solubility in the physiological environment. In this regard, the encapsulation of gold compounds in nanocarriers or their chemical grafting onto targeted delivery vectors could lead to new nanomedicines that eventually reach clinical applications. Herein, we provide an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of gold anticancer compounds, andmore importantly we thoroughly revise the development of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems for gold chemotherapeutics.

         <title>A Flow Cytometry&#8208;Based Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for Directed Evolution of Oxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; was developed by integrating oxidation/Fenton reaction cascade, Fe3+ mediated eGFPHis decoration, and fluorescence&#8208;activated&#8208;cell&#8208;sorting into a general strategy. FlOxi was validated in two evolution campaigns targeting two oxidases, exemplifying the suitability of the platform for screening oxidase variants in an ultrahigh&#8208;throughput manner.







Abstract
Oxidases are of interest to chemical and pharmaceutical industries because they catalyze highly selective oxidations. However, oxidases found in nature often need to be re&#8208;engineered for synthetic applications. Herein, we developed a versatile and robust flow cytometry&#8208;based screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; for directed oxidase evolution. FlOxi utilizes hydrogen peroxide produced by oxidases expressed in E. coli to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ (Fenton reaction). Fe3+ mediates the immobilization of a His6&#8208;tagged eGFP (eGFPHis) on the E. coli cell surface, ensuring the identification of beneficial oxidase variants by flow cytometry. FlOxi was validated with two oxidases&#8212;a galactose oxidase (GalOx) and a D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (D&#8208;AAO)&#8212;yielding a GalOx variant (T521A) with a 4.4&#8208;fold lower Km value and a D&#8208;AAO variant (L86M/G14/A48/T205) with a 4.2&#8208;fold higher kcat than their wildtypes. Thus, FlOxi can be used for the evolution of hydrogen peroxide&#8208;producing oxidases and applied for non&#8208;fluorescent substrates.

         <title>Augmenting the Performance of Hydrogenase for Aerobic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution via Solvent Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are shown to be superior solvents for solar hydrogen generation using natural hydrogenase enzymes. This &#8220;inDEStructible&#8221; system demonstrates that DES&#8208;based engineered solvents stabilise hydrogenase towards oxygen and enable efficient H2 generation in air.







Abstract
This work showcases the performance of [NiFeSe] hydrogenase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen generation in a variety of organic&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. Despite its well&#8208;known sensitivity towards air and organic solvents, the hydrogenase shows remarkable performance under an aerobic atmosphere in these solvents when paired with a TiO2 photocatalyst. Tuning the water content further increases hydrogen evolution activity to a TOF of 60&#177;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 and quantum yield to 2.3&#177;0.4&#8201;% under aerobic conditions, compared to a TOF of 4&#8197;s&#8722;1 in a purely aqueous solvent. Contrary to common belief, this work therefore demonstrates that placing natural hydrogenases into non&#8208;natural environments can enhance their intrinsic activity beyond their natural performance, paving the way for full water splitting using hydrogenases.

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Human Cells at Near&#8208;Physiological Concentrations with Sensitive 19F NMR Chemical Tags</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using sensitive 19F NMR chemical tags, globular proteins (6&#8211;40.5&#8197;kD) were observed in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M after electroporation delivery. The method further enabled the quantification of protein&#8208;protein interactions in human cells, demonstrating a practical approach for studying the conformations and dynamics of human&#8208;derived proteins in their native conditions.







Abstract
In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is an effective tool for observing proteins at atomic resolution in their native cellular environment. However, its utility is limited by its low sensitivity and the extensive line broadening caused by nonspecific interactions in the cells, which is even more pronounced in human cells due to the difficulty of overexpressing or delivering high concentrations of isotopically labeled proteins. Here, we present a high&#8208;sensitivity tag (wPSP&#8208;6F) containing two trifluoromethyl groups that can efficiently label globular proteins with molecular weights in the 6&#8211;40&#8197;kDa range under mild conditions. This tag allowed us to detect globular proteins in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M, which would not have been achievable with 15N or 3&#8208;fluorotyrosine labeling. Moreover, we detected conformational changes and interactions of proteins in the cellular environment. The new sensitive 19F NMR tag may significantly expand the scope of protein NMR in human cells.

&lt;p&gt;By using sensitive &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR chemical tags, globular proteins (6&#8211;40.5&#8197;kD) were observed in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M after electroporation delivery. The method further enabled the quantification of protein-protein interactions in human cells, demonstrating a practical approach for studying the conformations and dynamics of human-derived proteins in their native conditions.

         <title>Isolated Tin(IV) Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 in Neutral Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>

Sn&#8208;based catalysts are known for their high yield of formate or CO in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, but here we report for the first time that a new Sn&#8208;based catalyst can achieve exceptional partial current density for the CH4 product.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts with non&#8208;copper metal sites for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) to hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, a stable metal&#8211;organic framework (DMA)4[Sn2(THO)2] (Sn&#8208;THO, THO6&#8722; = triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexakis(olate), DMA = dimethylammonium) with isolated and distorted octahedral SnO62&#8722; active sites is reported as an electrocatalyst for eCO2RR, showing an exceptional performance for eCO2RR to the CH4 product rather than the common products formate and CO for reported Sn&#8208;based catalysts. The partial current density of CH4 reaches a high value of 34.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most reported copper&#8208;based and all non&#8208;Cu metal&#8208;based catalysts. Our experimental and theoretical results revealed that the isolated SnO62&#8722; active site favors the formation of key *OCOH species to produce CH4 and can greatly inhibit the formation of *OCHO and *COOH species to produce *HCOOH and *CO, respectively.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers 5&#8208;Aminolevulinic Acid and Porphyrin for Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoplatform ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL for photodynamic therapy by conjugating 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a 2D Hf12&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic nanophotosensitizer (Hf&#8208;MOL). Upon endocytosis, ALA is released from Hf&#8208;MOL and accumulates in mitochondria for porphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis, while Hf&#8208;MOL is retained in lysosomes. Light irradiation excites both PpIX and Hf&#8208;MOL to elicit potent cytotoxicity and antitumor responses.







Abstract
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends on the subcellular localization of photosensitizers. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoparticle platform for enhanced PDT of cancer. By grafting 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a Hf12&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (Hf&#8208;MOL) via carboxylate coordination, ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL enhanced ALA delivery and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis in mitochondria, and trapped the Hf&#8208;MOL comprising 5,15&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;benzoatoporphyrin (DBP) photosensitizers in lysosomes. Light irradiation at 630&#8197;nm simultaneously excited PpIX and DBP to generate singlet oxygen and rapidly damage both mitochondria and lysosomes, leading to synergistic enhancement of the PDT efficacy. The dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL outperformed Hf&#8208;MOL in preclinical PDT studies, with a 2.7&#8208;fold lower half maximal inhibitory concentration in cytotoxicity assays in vitro and a 3&#8208;fold higher cure rate in a colon cancer model in vivo.

         <title>London Dispersion Effects in a Distannene/Tristannane Equilibrium: Energies of their Interconversion and the Suppression of the Monomeric Stannylene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of the dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3, affords an equilibrium mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2, and cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3, which suppresses monomer dissociation. Multinuclear NMR and computational analyses indicated that DED interactions are the main arbiter of the dimer&#8208;trimer thermal interconversion.







Abstract
Reaction of {LiC6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3&#8901;Et2O}2 (Cyp=cyclopentyl) (1) of the new dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, 2,4,6&#8208;triscyclopentylphenyl with SnCl2 afforded a mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2 (2), and the cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3 (3). 2 is favored in solution at higher temperature (345&#8197;K or above) whereas 3 is preferred near 298&#8197;K. Van't Hoff analysis revealed the 3 to 2 conversion has a &#916;H=33.36&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;S=0.102&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1, which gives a &#916;G300 K=+2.86&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, showing that the conversion of 3 to 2 is an endergonic process. Computational studies show that DED stabilization in 3 is &#8722;28.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 per {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2 unit, which exceeds the DED energy in 2 of &#8722;16.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 per unit. The data clearly show that dispersion interactions are the main arbiter of the 3 to 2 equilibrium. Both 2 and 3 possess large dispersion stabilization energies which suppress monomer dissociation (supported by EDA results).

         <title>Tough, Reprocessable, and Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Polymers with Ultrastable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8722;N coordination into a commercial epoxy matrix has led to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;based materials with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The polymers show excellent mechanical properties, environmental stability, shape memory, and recyclability, which could be useful for anticounterfeiting, data encryption, and information editing applications.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers, whose emission can persist for a long period after photoexcitation, are of great importance for practical applications. Herein, dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8722;N coordination are incorporated into a commercial epoxy matrix. The reversible dissociation of B&#8722;N bonds upon loading provides an efficient energy dissipation pathway for the epoxy network, while the rigid epoxy matrix can inhibit the quenching of triplet excitons in boronic esters. The obtained polymers exhibit enhanced mechanical toughness (12.26&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), ultralong RTP (&#964;=540.4&#8197;ms), and shape memory behavior. Notably, there is no apparent decrease in the RTP property upon prolonged immersion in various solvents because the networks are robust. Moreover, the dynamic bonds endow the polymers with superior reprocessablity and recyclability. These novel properties have led to their potential application for information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Breakthrough Separation of 2&#8208;Butene Isomers with High Dynamic Selectivity and Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mixed&#8208;linker MET&#8208;Fe (MET&#8208;Fe&#8208;x) was designed for breakthrough separation of 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates from petrochemical and refinery processes to higher value&#8208;added end products. We reported that the synergetic effect of shape&#8208;selective electrostatic repulsion at the pore window and electrostatic attraction inside the cavity can boost the dynamic separation performance.







Abstract
Developing porous sorbents represents a potential energy&#8208;efficient way for industrial gas separation. However, a bottleneck for reducing the energy penalty is the trade&#8208;off between dynamic adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we showed this problem can be overcome by modulating the kinetic and thermodynamic separation behaviours in metal&#8211;organic frameworks for sieving 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates to higher value&#8208;added end products. We found that the iron&#8208;triazolate framework can realize the selective shape screening of 2&#8208;butene isomers assisted by electrostatic interactions at the pore apertures. Further introducing uncoordinated N binding sites by ligand substitution lowered the gas diffusion barrier and greatly boosted the dynamic separation performance. In breakthrough tests under ambient conditions, trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 can be efficiently separated from cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 with a record capacity of 2.10&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with high dynamic selectivity of 2.39.

         <title>Chemical&#8208;Mechanical Robustness of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enabled by Surface Atomic Arrangement Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical effect of intrinsic surface composition and structure on the properties of single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides as cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries is demonstrated via control of the elemental&#8208;structural surface atomic arrangement. The concomitant concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure were thus constructed, enabling the chemical&#8208;mechanical robustness of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes in the electrochemical process.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxide cathodes have been one of the dominant cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with efficient Li+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by the weak layered interaction and unstable surface, mechanical and chemical failure plagues their electrochemical performance, especially for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. Here, adopting a simultaneous elemental&#8208;structural atomic arrangement control based on the intrinsic Ni&#8722;Co&#8722;Mn system, the surface role is intensively investigated. Within the invariant oxygen sublattice of the crystal, a robust surface with the synergistic concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure is constructed on the model single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode. With mechanical strain dissipation and chemical erosion suppression, the cathode exhibits an impressive capacity retention of 82&#8201;% even at the harsh 60&#8201;&#176;C after 150&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work highlights the coupling effect of structure and composition on the chemical&#8208;mechanical properties, and the concept will spur more researches on the cathodes that share the same sublattice.

         <title>11C&#8208;Cyanation of Aryl Fluorides via Nickel and Lithium Chloride&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiosynthetic method for [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;fluorine bond activation is reported. This method enables the efficient ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of a broad range of aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicate that LiCl greatly promotes the oxidative addition of aryl fluorides to a nickel(0) complex, affording aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complexes at room temperature.







Abstract
Aryl fluorides are expected to be useful as radiolabeling precursors due to their chemical stability and ready availability. However, direct radiolabeling via carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#8722;F) bond cleavage is a challenging issue due to its significant inertness. Herein, we report a two&#8208;phase radiosynthetic method for the ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of aryl fluorides to obtain [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation. We also established a practical protocol that avoids the use of a glovebox, except for the initial preparation of a nickel/phosphine mixture, rendering the method applicable for general PET centers. This method enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse [11C]aryl nitriles from the corresponding aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicated a significant promotion effect of lithium chloride on the oxidative addition, affording an aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complex, which serves as a precursor for rapid 11C&#8208;cyanation.

         <title>Photoinduced Fluorescence Switching in Molecular Aggregates by Topological [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates by the topological [2+2] photocycloaddition of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives promises a way to regulate molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. It was demonstrated that such a photocycloaddition can occur when derivatives are doped in selective polymer matrixes, which paves the way for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.







Abstract
The optical modulation of fluorescence characteristics in molecular aggregates, which mainly involves diverse molecular stacking and the consequent intermolecular interactions, remains a significant challenge for potential applications in optical anticounterfeiting, data storage, and imaging. Here we successfully realize in situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives by topological [2+2] photocycloaddition, which represents a promising way to regulate the molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. Notably, 2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;TF) in both crystal and powder forms exhibits a unique switching from an initial nonfluorescent state to a highly fluorescent state (&#934;PL=0.46) upon UV irradiation, because of the destruction of the [2+2] cycloaddition process by volume expansion of the photodimer. Furthermore, we demonstrate such a [2+2] photocycloaddition can occur when 2&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxypheny)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;OH) is doped within selective polymer matrixes, and can be utilized for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.

&lt;p&gt;In situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates by the topological [2+2] photocycloaddition of thianaphthene-dioxide derivatives promises a way to regulate molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. It was demonstrated that such a photocycloaddition can occur when derivatives are doped in selective polymer matrixes, which paves the way for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optical modulation of fluorescence characteristics in molecular aggregates, which mainly involves diverse molecular stacking and the consequent intermolecular interactions, remains a significant challenge for potential applications in optical anticounterfeiting, data storage, and imaging. Here we successfully realize in situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates of thianaphthene-dioxide derivatives by topological [2+2] photocycloaddition, which represents a promising way to regulate the molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. Notably, 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethylphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene-dioxide (BTO-TF) in both crystal and powder forms exhibits a unique switching from an initial nonfluorescent state to a highly fluorescent state (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;=0.46) upon UV irradiation, because of the destruction of the [2+2] cycloaddition process by volume expansion of the photodimer. Furthermore, we demonstrate such a [2+2] photocycloaddition can occur when 2-(4-carboxypheny)benzo[b]thiophene-dioxide (BTO-OH) is doped within selective polymer matrixes, and can be utilized for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Naphthospironone A, a cytotoxic and antibacterial natural product, was synthesised for the first time. The key to construction of its spiro[bicyclo[3.2.1]octane&#8208;pyran] core was a two&#8208;step sequence involving hydrogenolytic debrominative olefin migration followed by a base&#8208;induced intramolecular aldol&#8208;type cyclisation.







Abstract
Naphthospironone A, a polyhydroxy cagelike bioactive natural product, was synthesised for the first time in this study.

B as a modifier was introduced to tune the oxidation state of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction with dilute NO3&#8722; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8722;N). The optimal Cu(B) exhibits a 100&#8201;% ammonia Faraday efficiency (FENH3) and a record&#8208;high yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, superior over the pristine Cu (FENH3=23&#8201;%, 12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1).







Abstract
Electrochemically converting NO3&#8722; into NH3 offers a promising route for water treatment. Nevertheless, electroreduction of dilute NO3&#8722; is still suffering from low activity and/or selectivity. Herein, B as a modifier was introduced to tune electronic states of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) with dilute NO3&#8722; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8722;N). Notably, a linear relationship was established by plotting NH3 yield vs. the oxidation state of Cu, indicating that the increase of Cu+ content leads to an enhanced NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion activity. Under a low NO3&#8722;&#8722;N concentration of 100&#8197;ppm, the optimal Cu(B) catalyst displays a 100&#8201;% NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion at &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, which is more than 25&#8197;times compared with the pristine Cu nanoparticles (12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1). This research provides an effective method for conversion of dilute NO3&#8722; to NH3, which has certain guiding significance for the efficient and green conversion of wastewater in the future.

Di&#8208; through pentasubstituted pyridines were synthesized in one operation from readily accessible &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters and terminal alkynes with complete regiochemical control and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. The first total synthesis of the indolizinium alkaloid anibamine B was accomplished featuring this novel pyridine synthesis as a key step.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] heteroannulation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oximes and their derivatives with alkynes has been developed into a powerful strategy for the synthesis of pyridines. It nevertheless lacks regioselectivity when unsymmetrically substituted alkynes are used. We report herein the unprecedented synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines by a formal [5+1] heteroannulation of two readily accessible building blocks. A copper&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters and terminal alkynes affords ynimines, which, without isolation, undergo an acid&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction involving ketenimine formation, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and aromatization to afford pyridines. Terminal alkynes served as a one&#8208;carbon donor to the pyridine core in this transformation. Di&#8208; through pentasubstituted pyridines are accessible with complete regioselectivity and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. The first total synthesis of anibamine B, an indolizinium alkaloid with potent antiplasmodial activity, was accomplished featuring this reaction as a key step.

         <title>Chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) Units Realizing Giant Birefringence with Transparency in the Near&#8208;Infrared for Optoelectronic Materials</title>

The chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) species are shown to be excellent birefringent &#8220;genes&#8221;. The metal polysulfide family is a rich birefringent crystal source, realizing birefringence as large as 0.58, and wide band gaps of approximately 2.0&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals are requisite optical devices in laser and modern opto&#8208;electronic fields. Development of excellent birefringent materials is still challenging. Herein, the linear or chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) species were theoretically proved to be the origin of the large birefringence, and could be regarded as birefringent genes. Besides, the metal polysulfide family was first proposed to be rich birefringent materials source, among which Cs2S6 realizes giant birefringence 0.58@1064&#8197;nm together with a wide band gap of 1.70&#8197;eV (based on the generalized gradient approximation). Moreover, the first dual&#8208;anion group polysulfide Na4Ba3(S2)4S3 was obtained, showing wide infrared transmission range (0.5&#8211;6.2&#8197;&#956;m), wide band gap (2.3&#8197;eV), and large birefringence (0.37 at 1064&#8197;nm). This work provides a new guiding thought for exploring large birefringence crystals in the future.

&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=2&#8211;6) species are shown to be excellent birefringent &#8220;genes&#8221;. The metal polysulfide family is a rich birefringent crystal source, realizing birefringence as large as 0.58, and wide band gaps of approximately 2.0&#8197;eV.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birefringent crystals are requisite optical devices in laser and modern opto-electronic fields. Development of excellent birefringent materials is still challenging. Herein, the linear or chain-like [S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=2&#8211;6) species were theoretically proved to be the origin of the large birefringence, and could be regarded as birefringent genes. Besides, the metal polysulfide family was first proposed to be rich birefringent materials source, among which Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; realizes giant birefringence 0.58@1064&#8197;nm together with a wide band gap of 1.70&#8197;eV (based on the generalized gradient approximation). Moreover, the first dual-anion group polysulfide Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained, showing wide infrared transmission range (0.5&#8211;6.2&#8197;&#956;m), wide band gap (2.3&#8197;eV), and large birefringence (0.37 at 1064&#8197;nm). This work provides a new guiding thought for exploring large birefringence crystals in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Transmission Channels Promoting Charge Separation of Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Controllable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An accelerated electronic transmission channel with electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; was designed in conjugated polymers. This channel was found to promote charge separation and photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) represent a promising platform for photocatalytic CO2 fixation owing to their suitable band structures that meet the requirements of the reduction potential of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels. However, the photocatalytic performance of CPs is rather restrained by the low charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we rationally designed three CPs with a more delocalized electronic transmission channel and planar molecular structure, which are regarded to evidently reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) and accelerate the internal charge transfer process. Besides, the assembly of suitable electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; and cocatalysts on the surface of CPs could effectively facilitate interfacial electron delivery. Accordingly, the optimal P&#8208;2CN exhibits an apparent quantum yield of 4.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm for photocatalytic CO2 to CO. Further adjusting the amounts of cyano groups and cocatalysts, the CO selectivity could be obtained in the range of 0&#8211;80.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional LDH films templating for controlled preparation and performance enhancement of polyamide nanofiltration membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailored design of high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes that can be used in a variety of applications such as water desalination, resource recovery, and sewage treatment is desirable. Herein, we describe the use of layered double hydroxides (LDH) intermediate layer to control the interfacial polymerization between trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and piperazine (PIP) for the preparation of polyamide (PA) membrane. The dense surface of LDH layer and its unique mass transfer behavior influence the diffusion of PIP, and the supporting role of the LDH layer allows the formation of ultrathin PA membranes. By only changing the concentration of PIP, a series of membranes with controllable thickness from 10 to 50 nm and tunable crosslinking&#8208;degree can be prepared. The membrane prepared with a higher concentration of PIP shows excellent performance for divalent salt retention with water permeance of 28 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1, high rejection of 95.1% for MgCl2 and 97.1% for Na2SO4. While the membrane obtained with a lower concentration of PIP can sieve dye molecules of different sizes with a flux of 70 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for the controllable preparation of high&#8208;performance&#160;membranes and provides new insights into how the intermediate layer affects the IP reaction and the final separation performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Silicon semiconductor functionalized with molecular catalysts emerges as a promising cathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the limited kinetics and stabilities remains a major hurdle for the development of such composites.&#160;We herein report&#160;an assembling strategy&#160;of silicon photocathodes via chemically grafting a conductive graphene layer onto the surface of n+&#8208;p Si followed by catalyst immobilization.&#160;The covalently&#8208;linked graphene layer effectively enhances the photogenerated carriers transfer between the cathode and the reduction catalyst, and improves the operating stability of the electrode.&#160;Strikingly, we demonstrate that altering the stacking&#160;configuration of the immobilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP)&#160;catalyst through calcination can further enhance the electron transfer rate and the PEC performance.&#160;At the end, the graphene&#8208;coated Si cathode immobilized with CoTPP catalyst managed to sustain a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent of &#8208;1.65 mA cm&#8208;2 over 16 h for CO production in water at a near neutral potential of &#8208;0.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode.&#160;This represents a remarkable improvement of PEC CO2RR performance in contrast to the reported photocathodes functionalized with molecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Origin of Viscosity of Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viscosity is an extremely important property for ion transport and wettability of electrolytes. Easy access to viscosity values and a deep understanding of this property remain challenging yet critical to evaluating the electrolyte performance and tailoring electrolyte recipes with targeted properties. We proposed a screened overlapping method to efficiently compute the viscosity of lithium battery electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulations. The origin of electrolyte viscosity was further comprehensively probed. The viscosity of solvents exhibits a positive correlation with the binding energy between molecules, indicating viscosity is directly correlated to intermolecular interactions. Salts in electrolytes enlarge the viscosity significantly with increasing concentrations while diluents serve as the viscosity reducer, which is attributed to the varied binding strength from cation&#8211;anion and cation&#8211;solvent associations. This work develops an accurate and efficient method for computing the electrolyte viscosity and affords deep insight into viscosity at the molecular level, which exhibits the huge potential to accelerate advanced electrolyte design for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;fueled Mechanical Motions with Dynamic Phosphorescence Induced by Topochemical [2+2] Reactions in Organoboron Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the quest for essential energy solutions towards an ecological friendly future, the efficient transformation of visible light/solar energy into mechanical motions in metal&#8208;free luminescent crystals offers a sustainable choice of smart materials for lightweight actuating, sensing, and all&#8208;organic electronic devices. Such green energy&#8208;triggered photodynamic motions with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in molecular crystals have not been reported yet. Here, we demonstrate three new stoichiometrically different Lewis acid&#8208;base molecular organoboron crystals (PS1, PS2, and PS3), which exhibit rapid photosalient effects (ballistic splitting, moving, and jumping) under both UV and visible light associated with quantitative single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) [2+2] cycloaddition of preorganized olefins. Furthermore, these systems respond to sunlight and mobile (white) flashlight with a complete SCSC transformation in a relatively slow fashion. Remarkably, all PS1, PS2, and PS3 crystals display visible light&#8208;promoted dynamic green RTP as their emission peaks promptly blue&#8208;shift, due to instantaneous photomechanical effects. Time&#8208;dependent structural mapping of intermediate photoproducts during fast SCSC [2+2] photoreaction, by X&#8208;ray photodiffraction, reveals a rationale for the origin of these photodynamic motions associated with rapid topochemical transformations. The reported light&#8208;driven behavior (mechanical motions, dynamic phosphorescence, and topochemical reactivity), is considered advantageous for the strategic design of stimuli&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;functional crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Type All&#8208;Inorganic Heterometallic Nanoclusters: Record High&#8208;Nuclearity Cobalt Polyoxoniobates for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of rare Co&#8722;Nb&#8208;based core&#8211;shell polyoxometalates containing 50, 54, 62 and 87 metal polyhedra is prepared. The cobalt oxide cores correspond to increasingly large molecular analogues of infinite cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4. They are the largest cobalt polyoxoniobates and the polyoxometalates with the greatest number of Co ions and the highest&#8208;nuclearity cobalt clusters known thus far. They are shown to be efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Only rarely have polyoxometalates been found to form core&#8211;shell nanoclusters. Here, we succeeded in isolating a series of rare giant and all&#8208;inorganic core&#8211;shell cobalt polyoxoniobates (Co&#8722;PONbs) with diverse shapes, nuclearities and original topologies, including 50&#8208;nuclearity {Co12Nb38O132}, 54&#8208;nuclearity {Co20Nb34O128}, 62&#8208;nuclearity {Co26Nb36O140} and 87&#8208;nuclearity {Co33Nb54O188}. They are the largest Co&#8722;PONbs and also the polyoxometalates containing the greatest number of Co ions and the largest cobalt clusters known thus far. These molecular Co&#8722;PONbs have intriguing and atomically precise core&#8211;shell architectures comprising unique cobalt oxide cores and niobate oxide shells. In particular, the encapsulated cobalt oxide cores with different nuclearities have identical compositions, structures and mixed&#8208;valence Co3+/Co2+ states as the different sized Co&#8722;O moieties of the bulk cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4, suggesting that they can serve as various molecular models of the cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4. The successful construction of the series of the Co&#8722;PONbs reveals a feasible and versatile synthetic method for making rare core&#8211;shell heterometallic PONbs. Further, these new&#8208;type core&#8211;shell bimetal species are promising cluster molecular catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.

         <title>Exploring Synthetic Strategies for 1H&#8208;Indazoles and Their N&#8208;Oxides: Electrochemical Synthesis of 1H&#8208;Indazole N&#8208;Oxides and Their Divergent C&#8722;H Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study reports selective electrochemical synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazoles and N&#8208;oxides, where electrochemical outcomes were dictated by the cathode material (RVC=reticulated vitreous carbon). The adaptability of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides for various C&#8722;H functionalization reactions was showcased. Furthermore, 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides were utilized to synthesize the pharmaceutical molecules lificiguat and YD (3), key intermediates for various drugs, and a precursor for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
The selective electrochemical synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazoles and their N&#8208;oxides and the subsequent C&#8722;H functionalization of the 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides are described. The electrochemical outcomes were determined by the nature of the cathode material. When a reticulated vitreous carbon cathode was used, a wide range of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides were selectively synthesized, and the electrosynthesis products were deoxygenated to N&#8208;heteroaromatics, owing to cathodic cleavage of the N&#8722;O bond via paired electrolysis, when a Zn cathode was used. The scope of this electrochemical protocol is broad, as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor substrates were tolerated. The potency of this electrochemical strategy was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, making this reaction attractive for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazole derivatives for pharmaceutical research and development. Detailed mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry suggested a radical pathway featuring iminoxyl radicals. Owing to the rich reactivity of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides, diverse C&#8722;H functionalization reactions were performed. We demonstrated the synthetic utility of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides by synthesizing the pharmaceutical molecules lificiguat and YD (3); key intermediates for bendazac, benzydamine, norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SAM&#8208;531, and gamendazole analogues; and a precursor for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <dc:description>
Chemical analysis of volcanic&#8208;island&#8208;derived Streptomyces uncovered cihunamides, unique ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides with antibacterial activity. Genome mining, comparative bioinformatics, and heterologous co&#8208;expression revealed that the key step for cihunamide biosynthesis is the cytochrome&#8197;P450 mediated oxidative coupling of two tryptophan residues to form an endocyclic C&#8722;N bond.







Abstract
Cihunamides&#8197;A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4), novel antibacterial RiPPs, were isolated from volcanic&#8208;island&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. The structures of 1&#8211;4 were elucidated by 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR, MS, and chemical derivatization; they contain a tetrapeptide core composed of WNIW, cyclized by a unique C&#8722;N linkage between two Trp units. Genome mining of the producer strain revealed two biosynthetic genes encoding a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme and a precursor peptide. Heterologous co&#8208;expression of the core genes demonstrated the biosynthesis of cihunamides through P450&#8208;mediated oxidative Trp&#8208;Trp cross&#8208;linking. Further bioinformatic analysis uncovered 252 homologous gene clusters, including that of tryptorubins, which possess a distinct Trp&#8208;Trp linkage. Cihunamides do not display the non&#8208;canonical atropisomerism shown in tryptorubins, which are the founding members of the &#8220;atropitide&#8221; family. Therefore, we propose to use a new RiPP family name, &#8220;bitryptides&#8221;, for cihunamides, tryptorubins, and their congeners, wherein the Trp&#8208;Trp linkages define the structural class rather than non&#8208;canonical atropisomerism.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Targeted Glycan Editing on Living Cells Disrupts KRAS Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protein&#8208;targeted glycan editing strategy is developed for interfering with KRAS activity by manipulating the glycosylation of upstream membrane receptors. The attachment of mannotriose to the terminal galactose/N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine epitopes of integrin &#945;v&#946;3 blocks its binding with galectin&#8208;3, suppresses the activation of KRAS and downstream effectors, and mitigates KRAS&#8208;driven malignant phenotypes.







Abstract
The frequent mutation of KRAS oncogene in some of the most lethal human cancers has spurred incredible efforts to develop KRAS inhibitors, yet only one covalent inhibitor for the KRASG12C mutant has been approved to date. New venues to interfere with KRAS signaling are desperately needed. Here, we report a &#8220;localized oxidation&#8208;coupling&#8221; strategy to achieve protein&#8208;specific glycan editing on living cells for disrupting KRAS signaling. This glycan remodeling method exhibits excellent protein and sugar specificity and is applicable to different donor sugars and cell types. Attachment of mannotriose to the terminal galactose/N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine epitopes of integrin &#945;v&#946;3, a membrane receptor upstream of KRAS, blocks its binding to galectin&#8208;3, suppresses the activation of KRAS and downstream effectors, and mitigates KRAS&#8208;driven malignant phenotypes. Our work represents the first successful attempt to interfere with KRAS activity by manipulating membrane receptor glycosylation.

         <title>Ultrarapid Nanomanufacturing of High&#8208;Quality Bimetallic Anode Library toward Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloy fabrication through tube furnace annealing (TFA) faces many limitations, such as uncontrolled coarsening and volatilization of constituent metals. In this work, we apply an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature radiation (HTR) method to realize the general fabrication of a family of high&#8208;quality bimetallic alloys. The rapid HTR approach could create a new and wide space for broad applications of nano&#8208;sized unique alloys.







Abstract
Bimetallic alloy nanomaterials are promising anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) due to their high electrochemical performance. The most well&#8208;adopted fabrication method for bimetallic alloy nanomaterials is tube furnace annealing (TFA) synthesis, which can hardly satisfy the trade&#8208;off among granularity, dispersity and grain coarsening due to mutual constraints. Herein, we report a facile, scalable and ultrafast high&#8208;temperature radiation (HTR) method for the fabrication of a library of ultrafine bimetallic alloys with narrow size distribution (&#8776;10&#8211;20&#8197;nm), uniform dispersion and high loading. The metal&#8208;anchor containing heteroatoms (i.e., O and N), ultrarapid heating/cooling rate (&#8776;103&#8197;K&#8201;s&#8722;1) and super&#8208;short heating duration (several seconds) synergistically contribute to the successful synthesis of small&#8208;sized alloy anodes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the as&#8208;prepared BiSb&#8208;HTR anode shows ultrahigh stability indicated by negligible degradation after 800&#8197;cycles. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the K+ storage mechanism of BiSb&#8208;HTR. This study can shed light on the new, rapid and scalable nanomanufacturing of high&#8208;quality bimetallic alloys toward extended applications of energy storage, energy conversion and electrocatalysis.

         <title>Photochromic Polyoxoniobates with Photoinduced &#8220;D&#8208;f&#8208;A&#8221; Electron Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a general synthetic strategy for constructing a brand&#8208;new kind of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid polyoxoniobates (PONbs), organophosphate&#8208;Ln&#8208;PONb composite clusters. Fascinatingly, such composite PONbs can be reduced by M&#8208;UV irradiation to form long&#8208;term stable heteropoly blues with visible color changes in air. More fascinatingly, a unique &#8220;donor&#8208;f&#8208;bridge&#8208;acceptor&#8221; electron transfer mechanism for the reduction of the novel PONbs has been proposed and evidenced.







Abstract
Compounds with redox activities have appealing applications in catalytic, electronic and magnetic properties, but the redox inert of polyoxoniobates (PONbs) significantly limits their applications for a long time. In this work, we are able to integrate organophosphate and lanthanide cluster into PONb to create the first family of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid organophosphate&#8208;Ln&#8208;PONb composite clusters. These novel species not only present the first family of redox active PONbs that can be reduced to form long&#8208;lived &#8220;heteropoly blues&#8221; under ambient conditions, but also a new photochromic system. More importantly, the analyses of the electronic configurations and photochromic properties for a series of designed proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept PONbs models allow us to discover a D&#8208;f&#8208;A electron transfer mechanism, that is, photoinduced electron is transferred from a photosensitive organophosphate electron donor (D) to the NbV electron acceptor (A) through the unoccupied 4&#8201;f&#8208;orbitals of Ln (f). This work paves the way for developing diverse PONb&#8208;based redox materials and expanding the possibility of the applications of PONbs in the redox chemistry.

         <title>Reactive Polymer as Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive surrogate polymer containing carboxylic acid and cyclic ether moieties is developed, that can form an artificial polymeric SEI (APSEI) in situ with lithium metal anodes. This APSEI greatly facilitates the induction of uniform deposition of lithium ions while suppressing the growth of lithium dendrites. The APSEI significantly improved the performance of lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes have the highest theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential making them ideal for Li metal batteries (LMBs). However, Li dendrite formation on the anode impedes the proper discharge capacity and practical cycle life of LMBs, particularly in carbonate electrolytes. Herein, we developed a reactive alternative polymer named P(St&#8208;MaI) containing carboxylic acid and cyclic ether moieties which would in situ form artificial polymeric solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with Li. This SEI can accommodate volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. The presence of carboxylic acid and cyclic ether pendant groups greatly contribute to the induction of uniform Li ion deposition. In addition, the presence of benzyl rings makes the polymer have a certain mechanical strength and plays a key role in inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, the symmetric Li||Li cell with P(St&#8208;MaI)@Li layer can stably cycle for over 900&#8197;h under 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without polarization voltage increasing, while their Li||LiFePO4 full batteries maintain high capacity retention of 96&#8201;% after 930 cycles at 1C in carbonate electrolytes. The innovative strategy of artificial SEI is broadly applicable in designing new materials to inhibit Li dendrite growth on Li metal anodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li) metal anodes have the highest theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential making them ideal for Li metal batteries (LMBs). However, Li dendrite formation on the anode impedes the proper discharge capacity and practical cycle life of LMBs, particularly in carbonate electrolytes. Herein, we developed a reactive alternative polymer named P(St-MaI) containing carboxylic acid and cyclic ether moieties which would in situ form artificial polymeric solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with Li. This SEI can accommodate volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. The presence of carboxylic acid and cyclic ether pendant groups greatly contribute to the induction of uniform Li ion deposition. In addition, the presence of benzyl rings makes the polymer have a certain mechanical strength and plays a key role in inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, the symmetric Li||Li cell with P(St-MaI)@Li layer can stably cycle for over 900&#8197;h under 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; without polarization voltage increasing, while their Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full batteries maintain high capacity retention of 96&#8201;% after 930 cycles at 1C in carbonate electrolytes. The innovative strategy of artificial SEI is broadly applicable in designing new materials to inhibit Li dendrite growth on Li metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation of Unbiased C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds: Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of 1&#8208;Bromoalkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular insertion reaction of strictly unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is described. The reaction uses readily available starting materials and benefits from extremely simple reaction conditions. A library of structurally diverse scaffolds bearing a C(sp2)&#8722;Br bond has been obtained. In addition, an original reaction pathway in gold catalysis involving a concerted insertion on a gold&#8208;stabilized vinylcation has been disclosed.







Abstract
Selective functionalization of non&#8208;activated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is a major challenge in chemistry, so functional groups are often used to enhance reactivity. Here, we present a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of 1&#8208;bromoalkynes without any sort of electronic, or conformational bias. The reaction proceeds regiospecifically and stereospecifically to the corresponding bromocyclopentene derivatives. The latter can be readily modified, comprising an excellent library of diverse 3D scaffolds for medicinal chemistry. In addition, a mechanistic study has shown that the reaction proceeds via a so far unknown mechanism: a concerted [1,5]&#8208;H shift / C&#8722;C bond formation involving a gold&#8208;stabilized vinylcation&#8208;like transition state.

         <title>Overcoming the Ambient Manufacturability&#8208;Performance Bottleneck in Perovskite Nanocrystal Emitters for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crude large&#8208;scale synthesis strategy is proposed to overcome ambient the manufacturability&#8208;performance bottleneck to achieve high&#8208;quality perovskite nanocrystals with strong emission and narrow bandwidth, regardless of humidity or temperature. The resulting nanocrystals capped with PbSP&#8208;dominated shell have low trap and ligand density, facilitating charge&#8208;carrier hopping and tunneling.







Abstract
Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have risen rapidly in luminescence efficiency and color purity. However, their high performance requires careful and complex pre&#8208;treatment of precursors and precise regulation of the reaction atmosphere; otherwise, their emission will be weak and broad. To overcome these limitations, we develop a facile ligand exchange method using a new type of bidentate ligand, which is obtained by reacting cheap sulfur with tributylphosphine (S&#8208;TBP). During ligand exchange, the double bond between P and S atoms breaks and a single bond is formed between them, after which S&#8208;TBP switches into a bidentate ligand and binds to a perovskite NC at two points. With short&#8208;chain S&#8208;TBP ligands that have high spatial position resistance, both NC spacing and surface ligand density can be reduced, thereby improving carrier injection and transport. On the NC surface after ligand exchange, halogen vacancies were substantially filled, leading to a PbSP (Pb, S, and P elements) component&#8208;dominated shell that greatly decreases trap density and enhances material stability. The resulting perovskite NCs are stable and bright with a photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;96&#8201;%, and an external quantum efficiency of 22&#8201;%. Note that our ligand&#8208;exchange strategy remains effective even when scaling up, which should accelerate commercialization.

         <title>Utilizing Cationic Vacancies and Spontaneous Polarization on Cathode to Enhance Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage and Inhibit Dendrite Growth in Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic vacancies of nickel cobalt oxide (NCOV) and a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) at the heterojunction cathode are introduced to boost zinc&#8208;ion adsorption and transport in Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The growth of zinc dendrites is inhibited by a mitigating electrolyte concentration gradient resulting from the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization field (SPF). Consequently, the NCOV/BFO heterojunction//Zn cell exhibits a comparable specific capacity and delivers a competitive capacity retention of 83.3&#8201;% over 3000 cycles.







Abstract
High energy density and intrinsic safety are the central pursuits in developing rechargeable Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). The capacity and stability of nickel cobalt oxide (NCO) cathode are unsatisfactory because of its semiconductor character. Herein, we propose a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) approach by synergizing cationic vacancies and ferroelectric spontaneous polarization on cathode side to facilitate electron adsorption and suppress zinc dendrite growth on the anode side. Concretely, NCO with cationic vacancies was constructed to expand lattice spacing for enhanced zinc&#8208;ion storage. Heterojunction with BEF leads to the Heterojunction//Zn cell exhibiting a capacity of 170.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and delivering a competitive capacity retention of 83.3&#8201;% over 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. We conclude the role of spontaneous polarization in suppressing zinc dendrite growth dynamics, which is conducive to developing high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;safety batteries via tailoring defective materials with ferroelectric polarization on the cathode.

         <title>Carboxysome&#8208;Inspired Electrocatalysis using Enzymes for the Reduction of CO2 at Low Concentrations

A bioinspired approach using enzyme electrocatalysis for the efficient direct reduction of CO2 at low concentrations to formate using Carbonic Anhydrase co&#8208;immobilized with Formate Dehydrogenase in a mesoporous indium tin oxide electrode.







Abstract
The electrolysis of dilute CO2 streams suffers from low concentrations of dissolved substrate and its rapid depletion at the electrolyte&#8208;electrocatalyst interface. These limitations require first energy&#8208;intensive CO2 capture and concentration, before electrolyzers can achieve acceptable performances. For direct electrocatalytic CO2 reduction from low&#8208;concentration sources, we introduce a strategy that mimics the carboxysome in cyanobacteria by utilizing microcompartments with nanoconfined enzymes in a porous electrode. A carbonic anhydrase accelerates CO2 hydration kinetics and minimizes substrate depletion by making all dissolved carbon available for utilization, while a highly efficient formate dehydrogenase reduces CO2 cleanly to formate; down to even atmospheric concentrations of CO2. This bio&#8208;inspired concept demonstrates that the carboxysome provides a viable blueprint for the reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 streams to chemicals by using all forms of dissolved carbon.

         <title>Organohydrogels with High&#8208;Speed Lubrication by Confining Polymer Chain Mobility by an Interpenetrated Heteronetwork</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement effect of an oleophilic network limits the mobility of hydrophilic polymer chains on the countersurfaces. This reduces the energy dissipation on stretching polymer chains during shearing, thus decreasing the frictional stress in the high velocity region.







Abstract
Hydrogels with pure hydrophilic network have received much attention due to their excellent low frictional behavior. However, the lubrication performance of hydrogels is not satisfied under high&#8208;speed condition due to the energy dissipation caused by adsorbed polymer chains as well as the failure of lubricating mechanisms accompanied by the transition of lubrication regime. In this work, interpenetrating double&#8208;network organohydrogels were constructed by combining hydrophilic and oleophilic polymer networks to modify the physiochemical properties of surface polymer chains, especially the chain mobility. The oleophilic polymer network spatially restricting the mobility of the swollen hydrophilic network in water, resulted in a low coefficient of friction (ca. 0.01) compared with conventional hydrogels at high speed (0.1&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1). Meanwhile, the organohydrogels had superior wear resistance, with almost no wear observed on the sliding track after 5&#8197;k&#8197;cycles of rubbing at high speed.

     alt="Organohydrogels with High-Speed Lubrication by Confining Polymer Chain Mobility by an Interpenetrated Heteronetwork"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confinement effect of an oleophilic network limits the mobility of hydrophilic polymer chains on the countersurfaces. This reduces the energy dissipation on stretching polymer chains during shearing, thus decreasing the frictional stress in the high velocity region.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogels with pure hydrophilic network have received much attention due to their excellent low frictional behavior. However, the lubrication performance of hydrogels is not satisfied under high-speed condition due to the energy dissipation caused by adsorbed polymer chains as well as the failure of lubricating mechanisms accompanied by the transition of lubrication regime. In this work, interpenetrating double-network organohydrogels were constructed by combining hydrophilic and oleophilic polymer networks to modify the physiochemical properties of surface polymer chains, especially the chain mobility. The oleophilic polymer network spatially restricting the mobility of the swollen hydrophilic network in water, resulted in a low coefficient of friction (ca. 0.01) compared with conventional hydrogels at high speed (0.1&#8197;m&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Meanwhile, the organohydrogels had superior wear resistance, with almost no wear observed on the sliding track after 5&#8197;k&#8197;cycles of rubbing at high speed. The design concept of organohydrogels can be extended to a variety of low-wear, highly-lubricating materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Aminocyclobutane Monoesters: Synthesis and Silylium&#8208;Catalyzed (4+2) Annulation with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminocyclobutanes are high potential building blocks but have been underexplored. A one&#8208;step synthesis to access them from commercial starting materials was developed. Using these new donor&#8208;acceptor systems, a (4+2) annulation was conducted with indoles using silylium catalysis. When performed intramolecularly, the tetracyclic structure of either akuamma or malagasy alkaloids was obtained selectively depending on the temperature of the reaction.







Abstract
A convenient one&#8208;step synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminocyclobutane monoesters starting from commercially available reagents is reported. The obtained strained rings undergo (4+2) dearomative annulation with indole partners using silylium catalysis. This organocatalyzed annulation provided tricyclic indolines with four new stereocenters in up to quantitative yield and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 diastereoselectivity and can proceed both intra&#8208; and intermolecularly. When performed intramolecularly, the tetracyclic structure of either akuamma or malagasy alkaloids was obtained selectively depending on the temperature of the reaction. This divergent outcome could be rationalized based on DFT calculations.

         <title>A Crowning Achievement: The First Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circumcoronene is a highly symmetric polybenzenoid hydrocarbon that has fascinated organic chemists and materials scientists for decades. However, until recently, it had only been studied theoretically, because its synthesis in solution remained challenging. In a recent report, Wu and co&#8208;workers describe the first successful solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolation of crystalline circumcoronene derivatives, validating the long&#8208;predicted Clar structure. Their synthetic approach enables preparation of new polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons with multiple K&#8208;regions, which are difficult to obtain, and expands our understanding of the chemistry of these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Significant Two&#8208;Dimensional Structural Transformation in a Coordination Polymer that Changes Its Electronic and Protonic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D (2D: two&#8208;dimensional) structural transformation accompanying significant bond rearrangement and coordination environment change is demonstrated in a coordination polymer (CP) comprised of copper(II) ions and terephthalate (BDC2&#8211;) ligands for the first time. When immersed in water, a free&#8208;standing membrane of 2D Cu(BDC)(DMF) (Cu&#8208;1; DMF: N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide) transforms into 2D Cu(BDC)(H2O)2 (Cu&#8208;2) while maintaining its highly oriented layered structure. In the 2D sheet, paddlewheel&#8208;type Cu(II) dimers coordinated with four bidentate BDC ligands in a square&#8208;planar array in Cu&#8208;1 were released to form uniform aqua&#8208;bridged Cu(II) chains, which are cross&#8208;linked with each other by unidentate BDC ligands, in Cu&#8208;2. The present facile approach to implement the 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D transformation accompanied by bond rearrangement, which is characteristic of CPs, leads to a marked increase in in&#8208;plane magnetic susceptibility and proton conductivity. In situ experiments in support of theoretical calculations unveiled the energy diagram that governs the unique structural transformation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thermo&#8208;catalysis of CO2 into high valuable products is an efficient and green method for mitigating global warming and other environmental problems, of which Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 thermo&#8208;catalysis, and many excellent researches have been published. Hence, this review focuses on the valuable products obtained from various CO2 conversion reactions catalyzed by noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs, such as cyclic carbonates, oxazolidinones, carboxylic acids, N&#8208;phenylformamide, methanol, ethanol, and methane. We classified these published references according to the types of products, and analyzed the methods for improving the catalytic efficiency of MOFs in CO2 reaction. The advantages of using noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOF catalysts for CO2 conversion were also discussed along the text. This review concludes with future perspectives on the challenges to be addressed and potential research directions.

         <title>Macroscopic Assembly of Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Metal&#8208;free Supramolecular Glasses for Enhanced Color&#8208;tunable Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glassy materials, with desirable mechanical rigidity, shaping ability, high transparency, are attracting great interest in diverse fields. However, optically bulk molecule&#8208;based glasses are still rare, mainly due to limited monomeric species and harsh preparation conditions. Herein, we report a facile bottom&#8208;up solution fabrication process to obtain metal&#8208;free supramolecular glasses (SMGs) at the macroscopic scale using L&#8208;Histidine and hexamethylenetetramine as building blocks. The chiral SMGs possess color&#8208;tunable ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (decay lifetime up to 141.2 ms) and circular polarized luminescence (g factor up to 8.7 &#215; 10&#8211;3). The strong hydrogen bonds effectively drive the formation of SMGs, and provide a rigid microenvironment to boost triplet exciton generation. By virtue of excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent ultralong phosphorescence of the SMGs, applications including multicolored displays, visual UV detection, and persistently luminescent thermometer are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activated alkyl halides have been extensively explored to generate alkyl radicals with Ru&#8208; and Ir&#8208; photocatalysts for 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes, but unactivated alkyl bromides remain challenging substrates due to their strong reduction potential. Here we report a three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction of alkenes, unactivated alkyl bromides and nucleophiles (e.g., amines and indoles) using a trinuclear gold catalyst [Au3(tppm)2](OTf)3. It can achieve the 1,2&#8208;aminoalkylation and 1,2&#8208;alkylarylation readily. This protocol has a broad reaction scope and excellent functional group compatibility (&gt;100 examples with up to 96% yield). It also affords a robust formal [2+2+1] cyclization strategy for the concise construction of pyrrolidine skeletons under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies support an inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer pathway for the successful cleavage of inert C&#8211;Br bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal Free Electrophilic Aminations of Polyfunctional O&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Trimethylbenzoyl Hydroxylamines with Zinc and Magnesium Organometallics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported a new electrophilic amination of various primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl, benzylic, allylic zinc and magnesium organometallics with O&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl hydroxylamines (O&#8208;TBHAs) in 52&#8208;99% yield. These O&#8208;TBHAs displayed an excellent long&#8208;term stability and were readily prepared from various highly functionalized secondary amines via a convenient 3 step procedure. The amination reactions showed remarkable chemoselectivity proceeding without any transition&#8208;metal catalyst and were usually complete after 1&#8208;3 h reaction time at 25 &#176;C. Furthermore, this electrophilic amination also provided access to enantioenriched tertiary amines (up to 88% ee) by using optically enriched secondary alkylmagnesium reagents of the type s&#8208;AlkylMgCH2SiMe3.</dc:description>

         <title>The Formation of NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ Nanocrystals Studied by In Situ X&#8208;ray Scattering: Phase Transition and Size Focusing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals are a popular class of optical materials. They can be doped with optically active lanthanide ions and shaped into core&#8211;multi&#8208;shell geometries with controlled dopant distributions. Here, we follow the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals from &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles using in situ small&#8208;angle and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ex&#8208;situ electron microscopy. We observe an evolution from a monomodal particle size distribution to bimodal, and eventually back to monomodal. The final size distribution is narrower in absolute numbers than the initial distribution. These peculiar growth dynamics happen in large part before the &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#946; phase transformation. We propose that the splitting of the size distribution is caused by variations in the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles, potentially due to inter&#8208;particle differences in stoichiometry. Rate equation modeling confirms that a continuous distribution of reactivities can result in the observed particle growth dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Stimuli Responsive Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical approaches are widely used for the efficient, solvent&#8208;free synthesis of organic molecules, however their applicability to the synthesis of functional polymers has remained underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that mechanochemically triggered free&#8208;radical polymerization allows solvent&#8208; and initiator&#8208;free syntheses of structurally and morphologically well&#8208;defined complex functional macromolecular architectures, namely stimuli&#8208;responsive microgels. The developed mechanochemical polymerization approach is applicable to a variety of monomers and allows synthesizing microgels with tunable chemical structure, variable size, controlled number of crosslinks and reactive functional end&#8208;groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Torsional&#8208;cum&#8208;Steric Strains: A Pre&#8208;macrocyclization Strategy Enables Conformation&#8208;Specific Fullerene Binding in m&#8208;Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though the chemistry of resorcinarenes is half a century old, the conformationally&#8208;locked resorcinarene crowns are generally constructed using hydrogen bonds or covalent tethers. Often, covalent tethering involves extra post&#8208;macrocyclization steps involving upper&#8208;rim functionalities. We have leveraged the torsional&#8208;cum&#8208;steric strains through &#945;&#8208;substituents of the lower&#8208;rim C&#8208;alkyl chains and accomplished conformationally&#8208;rigid fluorescent m&#8208;cyclophane deep&#8208;crowns in a predetermined way. The strategy offers a pre&#8208;macrocyclization route conserving upper&#8208;rim functionalities, an aspect overlooked in resorcinarene chemistry. X&#8208;ray structural and computational analyses unveil the cause for conformational rigidity in&#160;m&#8208;cyclophanes due to &#945;&#8208;branching in C&#8208;alkyls (linear vs. &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;branched).&#160; The conformationally&#8208;locked fluorescent deep&#8208;crown with a preorganized cavity captures hydrophobic spherical guest C60 in both solution and solid states specifically, when compared to conformationally&#8208;dynamic boats, enabling conformation&#8208;specific binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones with Two Non&#8208;vicinal Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral heterocyclics with two or more carbon stereocenters are quite important in many fields. However, powerful strategies for the construction of such synthetically valuable heterocyclics, especially with two or more remote carbon stereocenters, have largely lagged behind. We report here a powerful method for the synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters from readily available chemical feedstocks under mild conditions. Both of the two diastereoisomers can be obtained with good to excellent enantioselectivities. Because the well&#8208;designed copper/PyBox catalytic system overrides the intrinsic stereoinduction of the close chirality center generated by the previous innocent radical addition step. Nevertheless, this work has the power to selectively provide only a single diastereoisomer of them by taking advantage of the epimerization effect and to synthesize all the four diastereoisomers with the pair of chiral ligands L2 and L2'&#160;that have opposite chirality. The obtained useful chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones can be synthetically transformed into acyclic or cyclic molecules with two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical reaction follows a linear relationship and even can be well performed with a less loading amount of ligand compared to that of the copper catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;Sheets Stabilized by Hydrogen Bond Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimics of protein secondary and tertiary structure offer rationally&#8208;designed inhibitors of biomolecular interactions. &#946;&#8208;Sheet mimics have a storied history in bioorganic chemistry and are typically designed with synthetic or natural turn segments. We hypothesized that replacement of terminal inter&#8208;&#946;&#8208;strand hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) may lead to conformationally&#8208;defined macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;sheets without the requirement for natural or synthetic &#946;&#8208;turns, thereby providing a minimal mimic of protein &#946;&#8208;sheets. To access turn&#8208;less antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet mimics, we developed a facile solid phase synthesis protocol. We surveyed a dataset of protein &#946;&#8208;sheets for naturally observed interstrand side chain interactions. This bioinformatics survey highlighted an over&#8208;abundance of aromatic&#8211;aromatic, cation&#8208;&#960; and ionic interactions in &#946;&#8208;sheets. In correspondence with natural &#946;&#8208;sheets, we find that minimal HBS mimics show robust &#946;&#8208;sheet formation when a specific pairing is incorporated. In isolated &#946;&#8208;sheets, aromatic interactions endow superior conformational stability over ionic or cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopies, along with high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystallography, support our design principles.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8210;Organic Framework Crystal&#8210;Glass Composite Membranes with Preferential Permeation of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8210;organic framework (MOF) glass is an easy to process and self&#8208;supported amorphous material that is suitable for fabricating gas separation membranes. However, MOF glasses, such as ZIF&#8208;62 and ZIF&#8208;4 have low porosity, which makes it difficult to obtain membranes with high permeance. Here, a self&#8208;supported MOF crystal&#8210;glass composite (CGC) membrane was prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the membrane matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler. The conversion of ZIF&#8208;62 from crystal to glass and the simultaneous partial melting of ZIF&#8208;8 facilitated by the melt state of ZIF&#8208;62 make the CGC membrane monolithic, eliminating non&#8208;selective grain boundaries and improving selectivity. The thickness of CGC membrane can be adjusted to fabricate a membrane without the need of a support substrate. CGC membranes exhibit a C2H6 permeance of 41,569 gas permeation units (GPU) and a C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 7.16. The CGC membrane has abundant pores from the glassy state of ZIF&#8208;62 and the crystalline ZIF&#8208;8, which enables high gas permeance. ZIF&#8208;8 has preferential adsorption for C2H6 and promotes C2H6 transport in the membrane, and thus the GCG membrane exhibits ultrahigh C2H6 permeance and good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Cross&#8208;Coupling of 1&#8208;Azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By judicious development of acylimidazolinone as activating group and the use of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid (CBA) catalyst, the cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;azonaphthalenes with 2&#8208;naphthols was realized with high efficiency, exclusive C4&#8208;selectivity and excellent enantioselectivity. The reaction tolerates various functional groups and stereoretentive conversions of products to other binaphthyl compounds were found viable.







Abstract
Atroposelective cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most appealing routes to construct axially chiral binaphthyl molecules due to the modular and succinct nature. Although transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings offer reliable synthetic means, alternative reaction modes that could be applied to broader substrate range without their pre&#8208;functionalization is highly desirable. Herein we show that the application of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst as organocatalyst could accomplish cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;naphthols with high efficiency, exclusive C4&#8208;selectivity as well as excellent enantioselectivity and functional group compatibility. The identification of acylimidazolinone auxiliary for azo activating group, effective remote catalyst control and arene resonance effect synergistically play key roles in the development of this method. The utility is further demonstrated by transformations of the products into other binaphthyl compounds with perfectly retained axial chirality.

         <title>Simultaneous Ring Contraction and Expansion Reaction: Electrosynthesis of Heterocycle&#8208;Fused Fulleroids and Photovoltaic Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemically triggered simultaneous ring contraction and expansion reaction of fullerotetrahydropyridazines with electrophiles in the presence of a trace amount of oxygen affords pyrazoline&#8208;fused fulleroids with unprecedented 1,1,2,6&#8208; or 1,1,4,6&#8208;addition patterns.







Abstract
Simultaneous electrochemical ring contraction and expansion reactions remain unexplored to date. Herein, the reductive electrosynthesis of heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids from fullerotetrahydropyridazines and electrophiles in the presence of a trace amount of oxygen has been achieved with concurrent ring contraction and ring expansion. When trifluoroacetic acid and alkyl bromides are employed as electrophiles, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,2,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively formed. In contrast, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,4,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively produced as two separable stereoisomers if phthaloyl chloride is used as the electrophile. The reaction proceeds through multiple steps of electroreduction, heterocycle ring&#8208;opening, oxygen oxidation, heterocycle contraction, fullerene cage expansion, and nucleophilic addition. The structures of these fulleroids have been determined by spectroscopic data and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The observed high regioselectivities have been rationalized by theoretical calculations. Representative fulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells as the third component and exhibit good performance.

         <title>A Quencher&#8208;Based Blood&#8208;Autofluorescence&#8208;Suppression Strategy Enables the Quantification of Trace Analytes in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we propose a strategy for the suppression of blood autofluorescence to develop an activatable fluorescent probe for reliable quantification of trace analytes in whole blood. As a result of the efficient quenching the blood autofluorescence, this probe achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H2S in 20&#8208;fold dilutions of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H2S in whole blood.







Abstract
Precise quantification of trace components in whole blood via fluorescence is of great significance. However, the applicability of current fluorescent probes in whole blood is largely hindered by the strong blood autofluorescence. Here, we proposed a blood autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy to develop an activable fluorescent probe for quantification of trace analyte in whole blood. Based on inner filter effect, by screening fluorophores whose absorption overlapped with the emission of blood, a redshift BODIPY quencher with an absorption wavelength ranging from 600&#8211;700&#8197;nm was selected for its superior quenching efficiency and high brightness. Two 7&#8208;nitrobenzo[c] [1,2,5] oxadiazole ether groups were introduced onto the BODIPY skeleton for quenching its fluorescence and the response of H2S, a gas signal molecule that can hardly be quantified because of its low concentration in whole blood. Such detection system shows a pretty low background signal and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;back ratio, the probe thus achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H2S in 20&#8208;fold dilution of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H2S in whole blood. Moreover, this autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy could be expanded to other trace analytes detection in whole blood, which may accelerate the application of fluorescent probes in clinical blood test.

     alt="A Quencher-Based Blood-Autofluorescence-Suppression Strategy Enables the Quantification of Trace Analytes in Whole Blood"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we propose a strategy for the suppression of blood autofluorescence to develop an activatable fluorescent probe for reliable quantification of trace analytes in whole blood. As a result of the efficient quenching the blood autofluorescence, this probe achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in 20-fold dilutions of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in whole blood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise quantification of trace components in whole blood via fluorescence is of great significance. However, the applicability of current fluorescent probes in whole blood is largely hindered by the strong blood autofluorescence. Here, we proposed a blood autofluorescence-suppressed sensing strategy to develop an activable fluorescent probe for quantification of trace analyte in whole blood. Based on inner filter effect, by screening fluorophores whose absorption overlapped with the emission of blood, a redshift BODIPY quencher with an absorption wavelength ranging from 600&#8211;700&#8197;nm was selected for its superior quenching efficiency and high brightness. Two 7-nitrobenzo[c] [1,2,5] oxadiazole ether groups were introduced onto the BODIPY skeleton for quenching its fluorescence and the response of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, a gas signal molecule that can hardly be quantified because of its low concentration in whole blood. Such detection system shows a pretty low background signal and high signal-to-back ratio, the probe thus achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in 20-fold dilution of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in whole blood. Moreover, this autofluorescence-suppressed sensing strategy could be expanded to other trace analytes detection in whole blood, which may accelerate the application of fluorescent probes in clinical blood test.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective Heteronuclear Polarization Transfer Method for Unambiguous Complex Structure Assignment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;scan ultraselective heteronuclear polarization transfer (UHPT) NMR method is presented. When applied to chromopeptide pharmaceuticals and a diastereomeric mixture of a fungicide with highly complex NMR signals in both the 1H and 13C dimension, this method provided accurate 1H&#8208;13C correlation and 13C&#8197;NMR spectra of individual subunits, which enabled unambiguous structure assignment.







Abstract
Complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals of organic compounds containing multiple analogous substructures or mixtures pose a significant challenge to structural identification, thus resulting in frequent misassignment of structures. The GEMSTONE method, a single&#8208;scan technique that selectively excites a specific proton signal among the crowded NMR signals, was recently proposed as a solution. However, its extension to the polarization transfer method for heteronuclear spin systems was unsuccessful. Herein, we present an extension method that addresses the altered heteronuclear polarization transfer efficiency and enables the acquisition of ultraselective 13C and 1H&#8208;13C correlation NMR subspectra with hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in the structural analysis of a chromopeptide pharmaceutical and a diastereomeric mixture of a fungicide.

         <title>A Time&#8208;Resolved FRET Assay Identifies a Small Molecule that Inhibits the Essential Bacterial Cell Wall Polymerase FtsW</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FtsW is a newly discovered peptidoglycan polymerase essential for cell division. We developed a time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR&#8208;FRET) assay, which we used to screen a Staphylococcus aureus lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a small molecule that inhibits FtsW in vitro. Using a fluorescently labeled, non&#8208;polymerizable Lipid&#8197;II derivative, we showed that this compound displaces Lipid&#8197;II from FtsW.







Abstract
The peptidoglycan cell wall is essential for bacterial survival. To form the cell wall, peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs) polymerize Lipid&#8197;II to make glycan strands and then those strands are crosslinked by transpeptidases (TPs). Recently, the SEDS (for shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) proteins were identified as a new class of PGTs. The SEDS protein FtsW, which produces septal peptidoglycan during cell division, is an attractive target for novel antibiotics because it is essential in virtually all bacteria. Here, we developed a time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR&#8208;FRET) assay to monitor PGT activity and screened a Staphylococcus aureus lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a compound that inhibits S.&#8197;aureus FtsW in vitro. Using a non&#8208;polymerizable Lipid&#8197;II derivative, we showed that this compound competes with Lipid&#8197;II for binding to FtsW. The assays described here will be useful for discovering and characterizing other PGT inhibitors.

         <title>Access to Polysulfides through Photocatalyzed Dithiosulfonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a general photocatalyzed difunctionalization of alkenes, alkynes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and [1.1.1]propellane with dithiosulfonates. The resulting dithiosulfonylated styrene is an excellent nucleophilic disulfuration reagent, which can react with a variety of electrophiles to access unsymmetric disulfides efficiently.







Abstract
In this study, we outline a general method for photocatalyzed difunctionalization of alkenes, a diene, alkynes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and [1.1.1]propellane using dithiosulfonate reagents (ArSO2&#8208;SSR) with improved atom economy. Both &#8220;ArSO2&#8208;&#8221; and &#8220;&#8208;SSR&#8221; on the dithiosulfonate are transferred under mild conditions with broad substrate scope, high stereoselectivity, and complete regioselectivity. Significantly, the resulting dithiosulfonylated styrene is a general and practical nucleophilic disulfuration reagent, reacting with a variety of electrophiles efficiently. Both reactions can be conducted on gram scale, rendering the approach highly valuable.

         <title>Layered Zeolite for Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional Separation Membranes for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new layered zeolite (ECNU&#8208;28) with interlayer swollen structure is prepared hydrothermally using decamethonium bromide as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). Its phase exfoliation is realized under mild conditions, giving high&#8208;quality suspensions containing flat and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. The resulting 2D zeolite membrane prepared by vacuum filtration gives high&#8208;performance sieving of H2 from CO2 or CH4.







Abstract
Membrane separation is an energy&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly process. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular sieving membranes featuring unique nanopores and low transport resistance have the potential to achieve highly permeable and selective mixture separation with low energy consumption. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio zeolite nanosheets with intrinsic molecular&#8208;sieving pores perpendicular to the layers are desirable building blocks for fabricating high&#8208;performance 2D zeolite membrane. However, a wider application of 2D zeolitic membranes is restricted by the limited number of recognized zeolite nanosheets. Herein, we report a swollen layered zeolite, ECNU&#8208;28, with SZR topology and eight&#8208;member ring (8&#8208;MR, 3.0&#8197;&#197;&#215;4.8&#8197;&#197;) pores normal to the nanosheets. It can be easily exfoliated to construct 2D membrane, which shows a high hydrogen selectivity up to 130 from natural gas and is promising for hydrogen purification and greenhouse gas capture.

         <title>Formal Insertion of Alkenes Into C(sp3)&#8722;F Bonds Mediated by Fluorine&#8208;Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent a powerful approach to prepare complex fluorinated compounds, yet they are extremely scarce. Here we report a hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated system that allows for activation of activated alkyl fluorides without sequestering the released fluoride in an unreactive by&#8208;product. This allows for formal insertion of fluorinated styrenes into the C&#8722;F bond affording gem&#8208;difluorinated products.







Abstract
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent an attractive approach to prepare valuable fluorinated compounds. The high strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the low reactivity of the fluoride released upon C&#8722;F bond cleavage, however, mean that examples of such processes are extremely scarce in the literature. Here we report a reaction system that overcomes these challenges using hydrogen bond donors that both activate C&#8722;F bonds and allow for downstream reactions with fluoride. In the presence of hexafluoroisopropanol, benzyl and propargyl fluorides undergo efficient formal C&#8722;F bond insertion across &#945;&#8208;fluorinated styrenes. This process, which does not require any additional fluorinating reagent, occurs under mild conditions and delivers products featuring the gem&#8208;difluoro motif, which is attracting increasing interest in medicinal chemistry. Moreover, readily available organic bromides can be engaged directly in a one&#8208;pot process that avoids the isolation of organic fluorides.

Here we report a hydrogen bonding-mediated system that allows for activation of activated alkyl fluorides without sequestering the released fluoride in an unreactive by-product. This allows for formal insertion of fluorinated styrenes into the C&#8722;F bond affording &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluorinated products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent an attractive approach to prepare valuable fluorinated compounds. The high strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the low reactivity of the fluoride released upon C&#8722;F bond cleavage, however, mean that examples of such processes are extremely scarce in the literature. Here we report a reaction system that overcomes these challenges using hydrogen bond donors that both activate C&#8722;F bonds and allow for downstream reactions with fluoride. In the presence of hexafluoroisopropanol, benzyl and propargyl fluorides undergo efficient formal C&#8722;F bond insertion across &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-fluorinated styrenes. This process, which does not require any additional fluorinating reagent, occurs under mild conditions and delivers products featuring the &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoro motif, which is attracting increasing interest in medicinal chemistry. Moreover, readily available organic bromides can be engaged directly in a one-pot process that avoids the isolation of organic fluorides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole alkaloids are of great interest to organic and medicinal chemists and material scientists. This unique direct C&#8722;H functionalization has enabled efficient derivatization of commercially available carbazoles in a highly site&#8208;selective manner via a unique six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate. This reaction boasts good functional group compatibility and displays distinct reactivities based on C3&#8208;substituents of unsymmetrical substrates.







Abstract
Carbazole alkaloids hold great potential in pharmaceutical and material sciences. However, the current approaches for C1 functionalization of carbazoles rely on the use of a pre&#8208;installed directing group, severely limiting their applicability and hindering their overall efficiency. Herein, we report for the first time the development of direct Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and acylation of carbazoles assisted by norbornene (NBE) as a transient directing mediator. Notably, the involvement of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate was suggested in this case, representing the first example of such intermediacy within the extensively studied Pd/norbornene reactions realm.

         <title>1D Choline&#8208;PbI3&#8208;Based Heterostructure Boosts Efficiency and Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ChPbI3 was obtained by ChI treatment of the CsPbI3 surface to construct a 1D/3D heterostructure, which significantly improves the defect&#8208;assisted recombination and stability of CsPbI3. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, the assembled carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion/certified efficiency of 18.05&#8201;%/17.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Defects in perovskite are key factors in limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Generally, choline halide (ChX) can effectively passivate defects by binding with charged point defects of perovskite. However, we verified that ChI can react with CsPbI3 to form a novel crystal phase of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) ChPbI3, which constructs 1D/3D heterostructure with 3D CsPbI3, passivating the defects of CsPbI3 more effectively and then resulting in significantly improved photoluminescence lifetime from 20.2&#8197;ns to 49.4&#8197;ns. Moreover, the outstanding chemical inertness of 1D ChPbI3 and the repair of undesired &#948;&#8208;CsPbI3 deficiency during its formation process can significantly enhance the stability of CsPbI3 film. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, CsPbI3 carbon&#8208;based PSCs (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 18.05&#8201;% and a new certified record of 17.8&#8201;% in hole transport material (HTM)&#8208;free inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.

Abstract
Herein we report a mild, efficient, and epimerization&#8208;free method for the synthesis of peptide&#8208;derived 2&#8208;thiazolines and 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazines based on a cyclodesulfhydration of N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptoethylamine or N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropylamine derivatives. The described reaction can be easily carried out in aqueous solutions at room temperature and it is triggered by change of the pH, leading to complex thiazoline or dihydrothiazine derivatives without epimerization in excellent to quantitative yields. The new method was applied in the total synthesis of the marine metabolite mollamide&#8197;F, resulting in the revision of its stereochemistry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design, synthesis and application of benzene bioisosteres have attracted a lot of attention in the past 20 years. Recently, bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have emerged as highly attractive bioisosteres for ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted benzenes. Herein we report a mild, scalable and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones through Lewis acid catalysed (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]&#8208;butane ketones with disubstituted ketenes. The reaction shows high functional group tolerance as documented by the successful preparation of various 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl as well as 3,3&#8208;bisalkyl bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones (26 examples, up to 89% yield).

         <title>Understanding MOF Flexibility: An Analysis Focused on Pillared Layer MOFs as a Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks respond to molecular or physical stimuli with spontaneous pore opening or closing, leading to applications in gas separation, storage, sensing, actuation etc. The review provides insights into decisive factors affecting switchability gained from combined simulations, in situ characterization methods and the dedicated design of pillared&#8208;layer MOF model materials varying in composition, structure, size, morphology, and disorder.







Abstract
Flexible porous frameworks are at the forefront of materials research. A unique feature is their ability to open and close their pores in an adaptive manner induced by chemical and physical stimuli. Such enzyme&#8208;like selective recognition offers a wide range of functions ranging from gas storage and separation to sensing, actuation, mechanical energy storage and catalysis. However, the factors affecting switchability are poorly understood. In particular, the role of building blocks, as well as secondary factors (crystal size, defects, cooperativity) and the role of host&#8211;guest interactions, profit from systematic investigations of an idealized model by advanced analytical techniques and simulations. The review describes an integrated approach targeting the deliberate design of pillared layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks as idealized model materials for the analysis of critical factors affecting framework dynamics and summarizes the resulting progress in their understanding and application.

         <title>Smart Materials Based on Synthetic Host Molecules: The Role of Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry in the Fabrication and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart materials that can respond to stimuli have the potential to revolutionize many fields such as the chemical and medical industries. This Minireview summarizes the recent development in smart materials based on synthetic host molecules (SHMs) and their associated host&#8211;guest chemistry. The role of the host&#8211;guest recognition in the material's fabrication and application is highlighted. Understanding the responsiveness of smart materials at the molecular level should empower researchers to design and prepare extremely intelligent systems that can complement the rising demands on automation and robotics.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive or smart materials have recently shown a significant impact on the frontier of material science and engineering. The exponential development of synthetic host molecules (SHMs) over the last decades and their corresponding host&#8211;guest chemistry, have empowered researchers with new opportunities to design and construct tailored or guest&#8208;specific smart materials. In this Minireview, we present the recent advancements in synthetic host based smart materials, ranging from the fabrication strategies to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications including adsorption, separation, luminescence, self&#8208;healing and actuation. The role that the host&#8211;guest chemistry plays in these systems is highlighted throughout to give a better prospective of the available possibilities for emerging materials of future economies.

         <title>Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;Enabled Cell&#8208;Surface Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling toward More Efficient Capture of Physically Interacting Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intercellular proximity labeling has emerged as a promising approach to enable the study of cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs), but the efficiency of current platforms is limited. Here, we use Ru(bpy)32+ to construct an efficient photocatalytic proximity labeling (PPL) system on the cell surface that allows the highly discriminative CCI detection with spatiotemporal resolution. Through the mechanism study and quantitative characterization on living cells, we demonstrate that the singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) mechanism is more efficient and specific than the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism in Ru&#8208;mediated PPL. Three Ru(bpy)32+ catalysts with different cell&#8208;anchoring moieties are prepared to facilitate the catalyst loading on different primary cells. Finally, based on this Ru&#8208;1O2&#8208;hydrazide system, we develop a &#8220;live&#8221; T cell receptor (TCR) multimer with TCR&#8208;T cells that could sensitively identify and discriminate cells presenting antigens of different affinity, providing a powerful tool to better understand the heterogeneity of antigen presenting cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis Strategies towards Tagged Homogeneous Catalysts to Improve Their Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recycling of homogeneous catalysts while keeping them in the homogeneous matrix is an ongoing challenge many reactions face if they are to take the step into industrial application. While a plethora of different synthetic approaches towards better, recyclable homogeneous catalysts exist, the literature shows a gap when one searches for a concise overview of the different catalyst modifications. This review is designed to close that gap by summarising the existing synthesis pathways towards polar, non&#8208;polar, fluorous, and molecular&#8208;weight&#8208;enlarged catalysts and examining their respective synthesis routes with a focus on modular and late&#8208;stage approaches. Furthermore, we map out the potential for a generally applicable tag library that allows straightforward catalyst modifications to tune them for each desired recycling strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Electrodes With Sensing Membranes Covalently Attached to Both the Inert Polymer Substrate and Conductive Carbon Contact</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) is of interest to many clinical, environmental, and industrial applications. However, upon extended exposure to samples and under thermal and mechanical stress, adhesion between these membranes and underlying substrates often weakens gradually. Eventually, this results in the formation of a water layer at the interface to the underlying electron conductor and in delamination of the membrane from the electrode body, both major limitations to long&#8208;term monitoring. To prevent these problems without increasing the complexity of design with a mechanical attachment, we use photo&#8208;induced graft polymerization to simultaneously attach ionophore&#8208;doped crosslinked poly(decyl methacrylate) sensing membranes covalently both to a high surface area carbon as ion&#8208;to&#8208;electron transducer and to inert polymeric electrode body materials (i.e., polypropylene and poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;tetrafluoroethylene)). The sensors provide high reproducibility (standard deviation of E0 of 0.2 mV), long&#8208;term stability (potential drift 7 &#181;V/h over 260 h), and resistance to sterilization in an autoclave (121 &#176;C, 2.0 atm for 30 min). For this work, a covalently attached H+ selective ionophore was used to prepare pH sensors with advantages over conventional pH glass electrodes, but similar use of other ionophores makes this approach suitable to the fabrication of ISEs for a variety of analytes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancing the development of perfecting the use of polar organometallics in bio&#8208;inspired solvents, we report on the effective generation in batch of organosodium compounds, by the oxidative addition of a C&#8211;Cl bond to sodium, a halogen/sodium exchange, or by direct sodiation, when using sodium bricks or neopentylsodium in hexane as sodium sources. C(sp3)&#8208;, C(sp2)&#8208;, and C(sp)&#8208;hybridized alkyl and (hetero)aryl sodiated species have been chemoselectively trapped (in competition with protonolysis), with a variety of electrophiles when working &#8220;on water&#8221;, or in biodegradable choline chloride/urea or L&#8208;proline/glycerol eutectic mixtures, under hydrous conditions and at room temperature. Additional benefits include a very short reaction time (20 s), a wide substrate scope, and good to excellent yields (up to 98%) of the desired adducts. The practicality of the proposed protocol was demonstrated by setting up a sodium&#8208;mediated multigram&#8208;scale synthesis of the anticholinergic drug orphenadrine.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Copper 1,3&#8208;Rearrangement: the New Concept Behind the Boryl Migration from C(sp2) in Alkenyl Boranes to C(sp3).</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective borylcupration of borylated skipped (Z)&#8208;dienes generates diborylated alkylcopper species that are involved in an intramolecular stereospecific B/Cu 1,3&#8208;rearrangement by migration of Bpin moiety from C(sp2) to C(sp3). DFT mechanistic studies showed that boryl migration occurs through the formation of 4&#8208;membered boracycle intermediate with a moderate free&#8208;energy barrier. Moreover, the use of KOMe forms stable Lewis base adducts with Bpin moieties that blocks the reaction. Subsequently to the 1,3&#8208;boron shift, the in situ electrophilic trapping allows selective C&#8208;H, C&#8208;C and C&#8208;X bonds, followed by intramolecular cross coupling giving access to cyclic functionalized alkylidenecyclohexanes or alkylidenecyclobutanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Rh on High&#8208;Index CeO2 Facet for Highly Enhanced Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reducible oxide&#8208;supported noble metal nanoparticles exhibit high activity in catalyzing many important oxidation reactions. However, atom migration under harsh reaction conditions leads to deactivation of the catalyst. Meanwhile, single&#8208;atom catalysts demonstrate enhanced stability, but often suffer from poor catalytic activity owing to the ionized surface state. In this work, we address the poor activity and stability issues simultaneously by synthesizing highly active and durable rhodium (Rh) single&#8208;atom catalysts through a &#8220;wrap&#8208;bake&#8208;peel&#8221; process. The pre&#8208;coated SiO2 layer during synthesis of catalyst plays a crucial role in not only protecting CeO2 support against sintering, but also donating electron to weaken the Ce&#8208;O bond, producing highly loaded Rh single atoms on the CeO2 support exposed with high&#8208;index&#160;{420}. Benefiting from the unique electronic structure of CeO2&#160;facets, more oxygen vacancies are generated along with the deposition of more electropositive Rh single atoms, leading to remarkably improved catalytic performance in CO oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Volatile Dual&#8208;Solvent Assisted Intermediate Phase Regulation for Anti&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unprecedented development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) makes them one of the most promising candidates for terawatt&#8208;scale green energy production with low cost. However, the high boiling point solvents during the solution&#8208;processed film deposition cause anisotropic crystal growth and toxic solvent vapor during high&#8208;throughput manufacturing. Here, a dual&#8208;component green solvent consisting of isopropyl acetate and acetonitrile is proposed to form a volatile perovskite precursor, which can realize the high&#8208;quality perovskite thin film deposition by intermediate phase regulation. A room&#8208;temperature stable perovskite intermediate phase is constructed with the engagement of isopropyl acetate as co&#8208;solvent, which suppresses the exploding nucleation rate in volatile perovskite precursor, providing a fine grain growth rate and wide processing window in scalable film deposition. The corresponding PSCs fabricated by blade coating without anti&#8208;solvents or gas quenching achieve power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.37% and 15.29% for the areas of 14.08 cm2 and 37.83 cm2, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Conjugated Dienes with Tertiary Silanes Controlled by Hemilabile Hybrid P,O Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel P,O&#8208;type ligands, N&#8208;disulfonyl bicyclic bridgehead phosphorus triamides, were synthesized and utilized in Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation involving tertiary silanes, unactivated alkenes, and conjugated dienes. The ligand displayed a remarkable level of reactivity for alkene hydrosilylation with tertiary silanes and its use resulted in a significant improvement in the regioselectivity of diene hydrosilylation towards 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis confirmed the bidentate nature of the ligand, with coordination of phosphorus and oxygen. Control experiments provided evidence for the formation of Pd(0) species and the reversibility of Pd&#8208;H insertion in the reaction mechanism.&#160;Density functional theory (DFT) computations supported the importance of the hemilabile P,O ligand in stabilizing both the rate&#8208;determining transition state of Pd&#8208;H insertion and the transition state of reductive elimination that determines the regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Hydrogenation of Cyclic Tetra&#8208;Substituted &#946;&#8208;Enamido Phosphorus Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of&#160;enamido phosphorus derivatives is one of the most efficient methods for the construction of chiral amino phosphorus products, among which the congested tetra&#8208;substituted substrates remains an unaddressed challenge. In this study, we utilize a commercially available Rh&#8208;Josiphos system for the efficient and stereoselective hydrogenation of a wide set of tetra&#8208;substituted cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamido phosphonates/phosphine oxides, thus enabling access to chiral &#946;&#8208;amino phosphorus compounds featuring two vicinal stereocenters. This protocol was broadly applicable to different ring systems possessing various phosphonate/phosphine oxide&#160;groups and further applied in the preparation of amino&#8208;phosphine ligands. DFT mechanistic explorations indicate that the C=C migratory insertion into Rh(III)&#8208;H bond could be the rate&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step. The origins of stereoselectivity are revealed through distortion/interaction analysis, which is primarily regulated by distinguished dispersion interactions and steric repulsions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Effect of Chiral Small Molecules in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Vaccine&#8208;Induced Immune Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although numerous chiral small molecules have been discovered and synthesized, the investigation on their enantioselective immunological effects remains limited. In this study, we designed and synthesized a pair of small molecule enantiomers (R/S&#8208;ResP) by covalently bonding two immunostimulators (resiquimod/Res) onto a planar chiral framework (paracyclophane/P). Notably, we found that S&#8208;ResP exhibits a 4.05&#8208;fold higher affinity for toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) than R&#8208;ResP, thereby more effectively enhancing the functions of dendritic cells and macrophages in cytokine secretion and antigen internalization. Furthermore, we observed that S&#8208;ResP significantly enhances RBD antigen&#8208;induced cross&#8208;neutralization against various SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains compared to R&#8208;ResP. These findings demonstrate the enantioselective effects of small molecules on regulating vaccine&#8208;induced immune responses and emphasize the significance of chirality in designing small molecular adjuvants.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Strapped Zwitterionic NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II Heptamethine Cyanine Dyes for Bioconjugation and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heptamethine cyanine dyes enable deep tissue fluorescence imaging in the near infrared (NIR) window. Small molecule conjugates of the benchmark dye ZW800&#8208;1 have been tested in humans. However, long&#8208;term imaging protocols using ZW800&#8208;1 conjugates are limited by their instability, primarily because the chemically labile C4&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl linker is susceptible to cleavage by biological nucleophiles. Here, we report a modular synthetic method that produces novel doubly strapped zwitterionic heptamethine cyanine dyes, including a structural analogue of ZW800&#8208;1, with greatly enhanced dye stability. NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II versions of these doubly strapped dyes can be conjugated to proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, without causing undesired fluorophore degradation or dye stacking on the protein surface.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heptamethine cyanine dyes enable deep tissue fluorescence imaging in the near infrared (NIR) window. Small molecule conjugates of the benchmark dye ZW800-1 have been tested in humans. However, long-term imaging protocols using ZW800-1 conjugates are limited by their instability, primarily because the chemically labile C4&#8217;-O-aryl linker is susceptible to cleavage by biological nucleophiles. Here, we report a modular synthetic method that produces novel doubly strapped zwitterionic heptamethine cyanine dyes, including a structural analogue of ZW800-1, with greatly enhanced dye stability. NIR-I and NIR-II versions of these doubly strapped dyes can be conjugated to proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, without causing undesired fluorophore degradation or dye stacking on the protein surface. The fluorescent antibody conjugates show excellent tumor-targeting specificity in a xenograft mouse tumor model. The enhanced stability provided by doubly strapped molecular design will enable new classes of in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging experiments with possible translation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx Cocatalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting by Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ photo&#8208;deposition of both Pt and CoOx cocatalysts on the facets of poly triazine imide (PTI) crystals has been developed for photocatalytic overall water splitting. However, undesired backward reaction (i.e., water formation) on the noble Pt surface is a spontaneously down&#8208;hill process, which restricts their efficiency to run overall water splitting reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that the efficiency for photocatalytic overall water splitting could be largely promoted by the decoration of Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx as H2 and O2 evolution cocatalysts, respectively. Results reveal that the dual cocatalysts greatly extract charges from bulk to surface, while Rh/Cr2O3 cocatalyst dramatically restrains the backward reaction, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 20.2% for photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Monomer Design Synergizing Property Trade&#8208;offs in Developing Polymers for Circularity and Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid monomer design can unify desired but conflicting properties in a single monomer that in turn leads to intrinsically circular polymers with tunable performance properties that can be radically different than those of the parent homopolymers or copolymers.







Abstract
Current search for more sustainable plastics seeks to redesign polymers possessing both chemical recyclability to monomer for a circular plastics economy and desirable performance that can rival or even exceed today's non&#8208;recyclable or hard&#8208;to&#8208;recycle petroleum&#8208;based incumbents. However, within a traditional monomer framework it is challenging to optimize, concurrently, contrasting polymerizability/depolymerizability and recyclability/performance properties. Here, we highlight the emerging hybrid monomer design strategy to develop intrinsically circular polymers with tunable performance properties, aiming to unify desired, but otherwise conflicting, properties in a single monomer. Conceptually, this design hybridizes parent monomer pairs of contrasting, mismatching, or matching properties into offspring monomers that not only unify the above&#8208;described conflicting properties but also radically alter the resultant polymer properties far beyond the limits of what either parent homopolymers or their copolymers can achieve.

         <title>Appealing sheath&#8208;core spun high&#8208;performance composite carbon molecular sieve membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes are attractive candidates meet energy demands for challenging gas separations. The added ability to maintain such intrinsic properties in an asymmetric morphology with a structure that we term a &#8220;Pseudo Wheel+ Hub &amp; Spoke&#8221; asymmetric form offers new opportunities. &#160;For CMS membrane, specifically, the structure provides both selective layer support and low flow resistance even for high feed pressures and fluxes in CO2 removal from natural gas. This capability is unavailable to even rigid glassy polymers due to the much higher modulus of CMS materials. Combining precursor asymmetric hollow fiber formation and optimized pyrolysis creates a defect free CMS proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept membrane for this application. Facile formation of the sheath&#8208;core spun precursor with a 6FDA&#8208;DAM sheath and Matrimid&#174; core also avoids the need to seal defects before or after the carbonization of the precursors. The composite CMS membranes shows CO2/CH4 (50:50) mixed gas feed with an attractive CO2/CH4 selectivity of 64.3 and CO2 permeance of 232 GPU at 35&#8239;&#176;C. A key additional benefit of the approach is reduction in use of the more costly high performance 6FDA&#8208;DAM in a composite sheath&#8208;core CMS membrane with the &#8220;Pseudo Wheel+ Hub &amp; Spoke&#8221; structure.</dc:description>

Herein, we report the synthesis of a distorted trigonal cage 1 from a twisted tetratopic ligand (L) and a Pd(II) acceptor.

         <title>Catalytic Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Cyclopropanation of gem&#8208;Dihaloalkanes and Terminal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral cyclopropane derivatives are essential in synthetic chemistry and drug discovery. Their synthesis commonly relies on asymmetric cyclopropanation of diazo compounds, potentially explosive and needing stabilizing substituents. Thus, asymmetric catalytic transformations of non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids remain a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation of readily available gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes and terminal olefins. Distinct from previous approaches, gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes serve as suitable precursors for non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids, furnishing various functionalized chiral cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping, non&#8208;linear effect, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, provide insights into the catalytic process, featuring radical&#8208;polar crossover.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Wide Temperature&#8208;Range Zinc Metal Batteries with Unique Electrolyte and Substrate Designing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable zinc metal batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical application is limited by harsh issues such as uncontrollable dendrite growth, low Coulombic efficiency, and poor temperature tolerance. Herein, a unique design strategy using &#947;&#8208;valerolactone electrolyte and nanocarbon&#8208;coated aluminum substrate was reported to solve the above problems. The &#947;&#8208;valerolactone electrolyte with extremely low freezing point and high thermal stability enables the symmetric cells with long cycle life over a wide temperature range (&#8722;50 &#176;C to 80 &#176;C) due to its ability to regulate zinc nucleation and preferential epitaxial growth. Besides, the nanocarbon&#8208;coated aluminum substrate can also promote a higher Coulombic efficiency over a wide temperature range in contrast to the low Coulombic efficiency of copper substrates with significant irreversible alloying reactions because this unique substrate with excellent chemical stabilization can homogenize the interfacial electron/ion distribution. The optimized zinc metal batteries can operate stably under various temperature conditions (2000 cycles at 30 &#176;C with 66% depth of discharge and 1200 cycles at 80 &#176;C with 50% depth of discharge). This unique electrolyte and substrate design strategy achieves a robust zinc metal battery over a wide temperature range.</dc:description>

Herein, a unique design strategy using &#947;-valerolactone electrolyte and nanocarbon-coated aluminum substrate was reported to solve the above problems. The &#947;-valerolactone electrolyte with extremely low freezing point and high thermal stability enables the symmetric cells with long cycle life over a wide temperature range (&#8722;50 &#176;C to 80 &#176;C) due to its ability to regulate zinc nucleation and preferential epitaxial growth. Besides, the nanocarbon-coated aluminum substrate can also promote a higher Coulombic efficiency over a wide temperature range in contrast to the low Coulombic efficiency of copper substrates with significant irreversible alloying reactions because this unique substrate with excellent chemical stabilization can homogenize the interfacial electron/ion distribution. The optimized zinc metal batteries can operate stably under various temperature conditions (2000 cycles at 30 &#176;C with 66% depth of discharge and 1200 cycles at 80 &#176;C with 50% depth of discharge). This unique electrolyte and substrate design strategy achieves a robust zinc metal battery over a wide temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Supramolecular Framework Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals could modulate the polarization of light and are widely used as polarizers, waveplates, optical isolators, etc. To date, commercial birefringent crystals have been exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds such as &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4 with birefringence of about 0.12. Herein, we report a new hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework, namely, Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#183;8H2O, which exhibits exceptionally large birefringence up to about 0.60. To the best of our knowledge, the birefringence of Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#183;8H2O is significantly larger than those of all commercial birefringent crystals and is the largest among hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework crystals. First&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that the exceptional birefringence is mainly ascribed to strong covalent interactions within (H2C6N7O3)&#8208; organic ligands and the perfect coplanarity between them. Given the rich structural diversity and tunability, hydrogen bonded supramolecular frameworks would offer unprecedented opportunities beyond the traditional purely inorganic oxides for birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Cyclization by the Use of Acylammonium Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although cyclic peptides have become increasingly important as drugs, the most conventional peptide cyclization using moderately active coupling agents suffers from a lot of waste, high cost as well as long reaction times and burdensome purification. Here, we report an unconventional approach to peptide cyclization that uses acylammonium species generated from inexpensive and less wasteful Me2NBn and ClCO2i&#8208;Pr. Using this approach, we observed a desired rapid activation of C&#8208;terminal of cyclization precursors by acylammonium species, and achieved a rapid and epimerization/dimerization&#8208;free cyclization of synthetically challenging peptides, which included a difficult cyclization via N&#8208;methyl amide bond formation. The ease of purification, productivities, and reaction mass efficiencies of our approach were significantly superior to those in previous reports. We synthesized a previously reported versicotide D analogue and our data indicated that its stereochemistry should be revised.</dc:description>
