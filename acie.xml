         <title>Multicolor Zinc(II)&#8208;coordinated Hydrazone&#8208;based Bistable Photoswitches for Rewritable Transparent Luminescent Labels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Repeatable printing of invisible multicolor luminescence patterns with long retention times on transparent substrates is of significant importance, but it remains a formidable challenge. Here, two novel hydrazone&#8208;based on/off fluorescent photoswitches with decent emission quantum efficiencies, good reversible photoisomerization properties, and extremely long thermal half&#8208;lives, were designed and synthesized. Excitingly, X&#8208;ray crystallography data of both Z and E isomers of one hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitch were obtained. Multiple emission colors of blue, cyan, green, yellow, and orange can be obtained readily for these two photoswitches upon coordination with various zinc salts. Moreover, the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of invisible multicolor images with high resolution was achieved by using these photoswitches. Importantly, the legibility of the printed patterns can last at least over 3 months without detectable emission intensity loss under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>ESA&#8217;s Cometary Mission Rosetta &#8211; Re&#8208;Characterization of the COSAC Mass Spectrometry Results</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The most pristine material of the Solar System is assumed to be preserved in comets in the form of dust and ice as refractory matter. ESA&#8217;s mission Rosetta and its lander Philae had been developed to investigate the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov&#8208;Gerasimenko&#160;in situ. Twenty&#8208;five minutes after the initial touchdown of Philae on the surface of comet 67P in November 2014, a mass spectrum was recorded by the time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer COSAC onboard Philae. The new characterization of this mass spectrum through non&#8208;negative least squares fitting and Monte Carlo simulations reveals the chemical composition of comet 67P. A suite of 12 organic molecules, 9 of which also found in the original analysis of this data, exhibit high statistical probability to be present in the grains sampled from the cometary nucleus. These volatile molecules are among the most abundant in the comet&#8217;s chemical composition and represent an inventory of the first raw materials present in the early Solar System.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Sequence High&#8208;Specificity Dual&#8208;Reporter Unlocking of Fluorescent Probe Enables the Precise Identification of Atherosclerotic Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of atherosclerotic&#160;plaques is the root cause of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Effective CVD interventions thus call for precise identification of the plaques to aid clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of such diseases. In this study, we introduce a dual&#8208;target sequentially activated fluorescence reporting system, termed  i  n&#8208;  s  equence  h  igh&#8208;sp  e  cificity dual&#8208;  r  eporter un  lock  ing (iSHERLOCK), to precisely identify the&#160; atherosclerotic plaques  in vivo  and  ex vivo  . ISHERLOCK was achieved by creating a three&#8208;in&#8208;one fluorescent probe that permits highly specific and sensitive detection of lipid droplets and hypochlorous acid via &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; and ratiometric readouts, respectively. Based on this format, the upregulated lipid accumulation and oxidative stress&#8212;the two hallmarks of atherosclerosis (AS)&#8212;were specifically measured in the atherosclerotic&#160;plaques, breaking through the barrier of precise tissue biopsy of AS and thus aiding effective CVD stewardship.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Alloy PtWMn as a Mn Nanoreservoir for High&#8208;field MRI Monitoring and Highly Selective Ferroptosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis exhibits a potential to damage drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. However, it is still restricted with the &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity from the undesirable leakage of metal ions from ferroptosis agents, and lack of reliable imaging for monitoring ferroptosis process in living system. Herein, we develop a novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanocube as a Mn reservoir, and further design a microenvironment&#8208;triggered nanoplatform that can accurately release Mn ions within tumor to increase ROS generation, produce O  2  and consume excess glutathione for synergistically enhancing nonferrous ferroptosis. Moreover, this nanoplatform exerts the responsive signal in high&#8208;field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which enables the real&#8208;time report of Mn release and the monitoring of ferroptosis initiation through the signal changes of T  1  &#8208;/T  2  &#8208;MRI. Thus, our nanoplatform provides a novel strategy to reserve, deliver and precisely release Mn ions for MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocaging of Activity&#8208;based Ubiquitin Probes via a C&#8208;Terminal Backbone Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocaged, activity&#8208;based ubiquitin (Ub) probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) have been developed for the time&#8208;resolved probing of deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activities, but many Ub&#8208;ABPs are still challenging to photocage because their warheads (e.g. propargylamide (PA) or dehydroalanine (Dha)) are difficult to temporally block and activate. Here, we describe a new C&#8208;terminal backbone modification strategy for the construction of photocaged Ub&#8208;ABPs in which a light&#8208;sensitive group is placed at the backbone amide bond of the Ub Gly75. This strategy enabled the facile generation of cell&#8208;permeable photocaged Ub&#8208;PA and Dha probes that could be activated to capture DUBs after photo&#8208;irradiation, and were used to profile DUBs in cells under specially designed conditions (e.g. in cells experiencing oxidative stress) or DUBs with isopeptide linkage selectivity. This backbone modification strategy is anticipated to provide a general solution to the development of photocaged Ub ABPs bearing any warheads for DUB profiling.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Phase Mechanism of O&#8226;&#8722;/Ni2+&#8208;mediated Methane Conversion to Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The gas phase reaction of NiAl  2  O  4  +  with CH  4  is studied by mass spectrometry in combination with vibrational action spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Two product ions, NiAl  2  O  4  H  +  and NiAl  2  O  3  H  2  +  , are identified in the mass spectra. The DFT calculations predict that the global minimum&#8208;energy isomer of NiAl  2  O  4  +  contains Ni in the +II oxidation state and features a terminal Al&#8211;O  &#8226;&#8722;  oxygen radical site. They show that methane can react along two competing pathways leading to formation of either a methyl radical (CH  3  &#8226;  ) or formaldehyde (CH  2  O). Both reactions are initiated by hydrogen atom transfer from methane to the terminal O  &#8226;&#8722;  site, followed by either CH  3  &#8226;  loss or CH  3  &#8226;  migration to an O  2&#8722;  site next to the Ni  2+  center. The CH  3  &#8226;  attaches as CH  3  +  to O  2&#8722;  and its unpaired electron is transferred to the Ni&#8208;center reducing it to Ni  +  . The proposed mechanism is experimentally confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy of the reactant and two different product ions.</dc:description>

They show that methane can react along two competing pathways leading to formation of either a methyl radical (CH  3  &#8226;  ) or formaldehyde (CH  2  O). Both reactions are initiated by hydrogen atom transfer from methane to the terminal O  &#8226;&#8722;  site, followed by either CH  3  &#8226;  loss or CH  3  &#8226;  migration to an O  2&#8722;  site next to the Ni  2+  center. The CH  3  &#8226;  attaches as CH  3  +  to O  2&#8722;  and its unpaired electron is transferred to the Ni-center reducing it to Ni  +  . The proposed mechanism is experimentally confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy of the reactant and two different product ions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with predicted structure has been a long&#8208;term challenge. Herein, by using the efficient, simple, low&#8208;cost, and scalable mechanosynthesis, we demonstrate that reticular chemistry is applicable to HOF assemblies based on building blocks with different geometry, connectivity, and functionality. The obtained crystalline HOFs show uniform nano&#8208;size morphology, which is challenging or unachievable for conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Furthermore, the one&#8208;pot mechanosynthesis generated a series of Pd@HOF composites with noticeably different CO oxidation activities. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS studies indicate that the most efficient composite, counterintuitively, shows the weakest CO affinity to Pd sites while the strongest CO affinity to HOF matrix, revealing the vital role of porous matrix to the catalytic performance. This work paves a new avenue for rational synthesis of HOF and HOF&#8208;based composites for broad application potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Head Terpene Cyclizations by Optically Active Hexameric Resorcin[4]arene Capsule Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of enantioenriched hexameric resorcin[4]arene capsules have been synthesized. These large molecular containers, with an inner volume of approximately 1400&#8197;&#197;3, enable the enantioselective tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization of terpenes within their interior.







Abstract
Molecular capsules enable the conversion of substrates inside a closed cavity, mimicking to some extent enzymatic catalysis. Chirality transfer from the molecular capsule onto the encapsulated substrate has been only studied in a few cases. Here we demonstrate that chirality transfer is possible inside a rather large molecular container of approximately 1400&#8197;&#197;3. Specifically, we present 1) the first examples of optically active hexameric resorcin[4]arene capsules, 2) their ability to enantioselectively catalyze tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclizations, and 3) the surprisingly high sensitivity of enantioselectivity on the structural modifications.

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Addition for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Pyrrolidinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a catalytic asymmetric protocol for the preparation of chiral pyrrolidinones proceeding via a radical pathway. The chemistry exploits the combination of photoredox catalysis and Lewis base catalysis to realise the first example of asymmetric radical conjugate addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides and esters. The reaction is initiated by photoredox activation of N&#8208;arylglycines to generate, upon decarboxylation, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals. These radicals are then intercepted stereoselectively by &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediates, whose formation is mastered by a chiral isothiourea organocatalyst. Cyclisation leads to catalyst turnover and formation of enantioenriched pyrrolidinones. The utility of the protocol was demonstrated with application to the synthesis of biologically&#8208;active &#947;&#8208;amino butyric acids.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production can be achieved by using renewables or decoupling sluggish oxygen evolution reaction from overall water splitting, which, however, still needs electricity input. Herein, we realize hydrogen production and water desalination with on&#8208;demand electricity output by electrochemical neutralization chemistry coupling acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with the ionic exchange. The electrochemical neutralization cells allow efficient use of not only chemical energy but also the low&#8208;grade heat from the surroundings to output 0.81 kWh electricity for per m  3  hydrogen. Cell function can be rapidly switched to electricity output with high peak power density up to 85.5 mW cm  &#8211;2  or spontaneous hydrogen production at a high rate up to 70.1 mol h  &#8211;1  m  &#8211;2  without breaking cell operation or changing cell configuration. Fast water desalination is simultaneously achieved at a high salt removal rate of 56.1 mol h  &#8722;1  m  &#8211;2  without external electricity supply.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;surface Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Graphene Nanoribbon with Multiple Substitutional Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doped graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with heteroatoms are a principal strategy to fine&#8208;tune the electronic structures of GNRs for future device applications.  Here, we successfully synthesized N=9 nitrogen&#8208;doped armchair GNR on the Au(111) surface. Due to the flexibility of precursor molecules, three different covalent bonds (C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, N&#8208;N) are formed in the GNR backbone.  Scanning tunneling spectroscopy analysis together with band structure calculations reveals that the bandgap of the N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNRs (C&#8208;C) will be enlarged compared to pristine 9&#8208;AGNRs, and the C&#8208;N bond and N&#8208;N bond at the isolated site of N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8208;C) will introduce new defect states near the Fermi level. DFT calculation shows that the electronic structure of N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8208;C) is semiconductor characters, while N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8208;N) and N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (N&#8208;N) are metallic characters. Our results provide a promising route for creating more complex molecular heterostructures with tunable bandgaps, which may be useful for future molecular electronics and memory device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Back&#8208;gated van der Waals Heterojunction Manipulates Local Charges toward Fine&#8208;tuning Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The charge redistribution plays a prominent role in interpreting the intrinsic electrocatalytic mechanism. Constructing a quantitative relationship between the local charges and electrochemical performance can fundamentally update the design philosophies rather than exhaustive methods. Herein, we exerted an external electric field in the CoPc/MoS2 heterojunction to finely manipulate the intermolecular charge transfer. The injected charges (e&#8722;) from CoPc to MoS2 will migrate to natural S vacancies and enhance the Mo&#8722;H bonding. Moreover, the bandgap of MoS2 and CoPc can be readily tuned by the electric field, verifying band engineering at the heterointerface. The in&#8208;situ photoluminescence spectra and the gate&#8208;dependent electrochemical measurement discover the linear correlation between the charge accumulation and HER activity. This approach provides a new fingerpost for catalysts design, enabling precise regulation of the electronic configuration to improve catalytic activity</dc:description>

         <title>A Valence&#8208;Engineered Self&#8208;Cascading Antioxidant Nanozyme for the Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antioxidant treatment strategy by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a highly effective disease treatment option. Nanozymes with multiple antioxidant activities can cope with the diverse ROS environment. However, lack of design strategies and limitation of negative correlation for nanozymes with multiple antioxidant activities hindered their development. To overcome these difficulties, here we used ZnMn  2  O  4  as a model to explore the role of Mn valency at the octahedral site via a valence&#8208;engineered strategy, and found that its multiple antioxidant activities are positively correlated with the content of Mn  4+  . Therefore, through this strategy, a self&#8208;cascading antioxidant nanozyme LiMn  2  O  4  was constructed, and its efficacy was verified at the cellular level and in an inflammatory bowel disease model. This work not only provides guidance for the design of multiple antioxidant nanozymes, but also broadens the biomedical application potential of multiple antioxidant nanozymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Soft Electrodes for Electrochemical and Electrophysiological Monitoring of Beating Cardiomyocytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many cells in vivo have their inherent motions, which involve numerous biochemical and biophysical  signals synergistically regulating cell behaviors and functions. However, existing methods offer little information about the concurrently chemical and physical responses of dynamically pulsing cells. Here, we report a soft electrode with electrospun poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)&#8208;based nanomesh to fully comply with spontaneous motions of cells. Moreover, this electrode demonstrated excellent electrical conductivity, electrochemical performance and cellular biocompatibility. Cardiomyocytes cultured thereon exhibited autonomous and rhythmic contractility, and synchronously induced mechanical deformation of the underlying electrode, which allowed real&#8208;time monitoring of nitric oxide release and electrophysiological activity of cardiomyocytes. This work provides a promising way toward recording chemical and electrical signals of biological systems with their natural motions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Chemical Crosslinking for Profiling RNA&#8208;Protein Interactions in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic interactions between RNAs and proteins play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular processes. Proteome&#8208;wide characterization of these interactions in their native cellular context remains desirable but challenging. Herein, we developed a photocatalytic crosslinking (PhotoCAX) strategy coupled with mass spectrometry (PhotoCAX&#8208;MS) and RNA sequencing (PhotoCAX&#8208;seq) for the study of the composition and dynamics of protein&#8208;RNA interactions. By integrating the blue light&#8208;triggered photocatalyst with a dual&#8208;functional RNA&#8208;protein crosslinker (RP&#8208;linker) and the phase separation&#8208;based enrichment strategy, PhotoCAX&#8208;MS revealed a total of 2,044 RBPs in human HEK293 cells. We further employed PhotoCAX to investigate the dynamic change of RBPome in macrophage cells upon LPS&#8208;stimulation, as well as the identification of RBPs interacting directly with the 5&#8217;untranslated regions of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur has been important in dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) since the beginning of the field. Mainly as part of disulfides and thioesters, dynamic sulfur&#8208;based bonds (DSBs) have a leading role in several remarkable reactions. Part of this success is due to the almost ideal properties of DSBs for the preparation of dynamic covalent systems, including high reactivity and good reversibility under mild aqueous conditions, the possibility of exploiting supramolecular interactions, access to isolable structures and easy experimental control to turn the reaction on/off. DCC is currently witnessing an increase in the importance of DSBs. The chemical flexibility offered by DSBs opens the door to multiple applications. This review presents an overview of all the DSBs used in DCC, their applications, and remarks on the interesting properties that they confer on dynamic chemical systems, especially those containing several DSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Active Site Geometry to Activity in Immobilized Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immobilization of molecular catalysts imposes spatial constraints on their active site. We reveal that in bifunctional catalysis such constraints can also be utilized as an appealing handle to boost intrinsic activity through judicious control of the active site geometry. To demonstrate this, we develop a pragmatic approach, based on nonlinear scaling relationships, to map the spatial arrangements of the acid&#8208;base components of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to their performance in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO_2. The resulting activity map shows that fixing the donor&#8208;acceptor centers at specific distances and locking them into appropriate orientations leads to an unforeseen many&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic activity of FLPs compared to their unconstrained counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl Dot&#8208;on&#8208;Plate Z&#8208;Scheme Junction with Strong Internal Electric Field for Selective Photo&#8208;oxidation of Aromatic Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemically bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl (M=Nb, Ta) dot&#8208;on&#8208;plate Z&#8208;scheme junctions with strong internal electric field are crafted by an in situ growth route, which provides a powerful driving force, abundant atomic&#8208;level charge flow highways and a decreased energy barrier for directional migration and spatial separation of photocharges, greatly improving the photocatalytic activity for selective photo&#8208;oxidation of aromatic alcohols.







Abstract
Inferior contact interface and low charge transfer efficiency seriously restrict the performance of heterojunctions. Herein, chemically bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl (M=Nb, Ta) dot&#8208;on&#8208;plate Z&#8208;scheme junctions with strong internal electric field are crafted by an in situ growth route. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the internal electric field provides a powerful driving force for vectorial migration of photocharges between Bi4MO8Cl and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, and the interfacial Fe&#8722;O bond not only serves as an atomic&#8208;level charge flow highway but also lowers the charge transfer energy barrier, thereby accelerating Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer and realizing effective spatial charge separation. Impressively, &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl manifests a significantly improved photocatalytic activity for selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols into aldehydes (Con. &#8805;92&#8201;%, Sel. &#8805;96&#8201;%), with a performance improvement of one to two orders of magnitude. This work presents atomic&#8208;level insight into interfacial charge flow steering.

         <title>Syntheses of Covalent Organic Frameworks via a One&#8208;Pot Suzuki Coupling and Schiff's Base Reaction for C2H4/C3H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;pot strategy is used to prepare covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via a Suzuki coupling reaction and Schiff's base reaction by using diamino&#8208;aryl halide and dialdehyde aryl&#8208;borate compounds as monomers. The resulting COFs are used for C2H4/C3H6 separation. This work provides a novel modular approach involving irreversible coupling reactions for constructing COF materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring permanent porosity, designable topologies, and tailorable functionalities have attracted great interest in the past two decades. Developing efficient modular approaches to rationally constructing COFs from a set of molecules via covalent linking has been long pursued. Herein, we report a facile one&#8208;pot strategy to prepare COFs via an irreversible Suzuki coupling reaction followed by a reversible Schiff's base reaction without the need for intermediate isolation. Gram&#8208;scale ordered frameworks with kgm topology and rich porosities can be obtained by using diamino&#8208;aryl halide and dialdehyde aryl&#8208;borate compounds as monomers. The resultant microporous CR&#8208;COFs were used for efficient C2H4/C3H6 separation. This strategy reduces the waste generated and efforts consumed by stepwise reactions and relative purification processes, making the large&#8208;scale syntheses of stable COFs feasible. Moreover, it offers a novel modular approach to designing COF materials.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Magnetic Mechanistic Study of Ni&#8208;Seamed Pyrogallol[4]arene Nanocapsules Reveal Presence of Novel Cylindrical and Spherical Species</title>

         <dc:description>
First solution&#8208;phase magnetic study of Ni&#8208;seamed pyrogallol4]arene leads to the discovery of novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded 8&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius dimeric sphere, Ni&#8208;seamed 13&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius sphere and a Ni&#8208;seamed 11&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius tubular nanoassemblies.







Abstract
The magnetic properties of nickel&#8208;seamed C&#8208;pyrogallol[4]arene (PgC3Ni) hexamers and dimers are studied for the first time in solution. The combination of small&#8208;angle neutron scattering and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer measurements of the solution species reveal their paramagnetic and weakly antiferromagnetic behaviour. Surprisingly, the magnetic results indicated the presence of an unprecedented 13&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius species, larger than both the dimeric and hexameric nanocapsules with both octahedral and square&#8208;planar metal centers. To confirm the presence of this novel species, we performed a mechanistic study of PgC3Ni as a function of temperature and solvent and deduced the presence of two additional new species: a) an 11&#8197;&#197; cylinder with Ni atoms seaming the tubular framework and b) an 8&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius sphere with non&#8208;interacting Ni centers located within the internal cavity. Select parameters that shift the equilibrium towards desired species are also identified.

         <title>Bifunctionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Pore&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Enantioselective Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porosity is fundamental in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) but has always been underestimated for luminescent sensing applications. A simple and general synthetic strategy was developed for isoreticular MOFs with nanochannels of identical shapes but different pore sizes, which revealed the fundamentals of the pore effect in luminescent sensors.







Abstract
Porosity is a fundamental property of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, the role of the pore size has always been underestimated in MOF&#8208;based luminescent sensors for enantioselective sensing. The construction of isoreticular MOFs (IRMOFs) with variable pore sizes and the synergy between chirality and luminescence is challenging. Herein, a general strategy was developed to introduce chirality into two well&#8208;known IRMOF&#8208;74 analogs with nanochannels of identical shapes but different pore sizes by functionalizing the open metal site under mild conditions. To enhance the detection accuracy, a second luminescent center was introduced into the IRMOF&#8208;74 system to achieve ratiometric sensing. The two bifunctionalized IRMOF&#8208;74 compounds exhibited pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent sensing performance for enantiomers. This study not only provides a convenient method to construct chiral MOFs as advanced sensing materials but also reveals the fundamental of the pores in MOF&#8208;based luminescent sensors.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Surfactant Assemblies: Responsiveness to Orthogonal Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently modifying a polyoxometalate with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin has led to the formation of a polyoxometalate/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin hybrid. The hybrid, when dissolved in water, can assemble at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces with ligands dissolved in toluene, thereby generating polyoxometalate surfactants (POMSs) with pH, redox or guest&#8211;competitive responsiveness.







Abstract
Integrating different types of supramolecular interactions opens the possibility to generate nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface that are responsive to multiple stimuli. Here we develop a covalently modified polyoxometalate/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (POM/&#946;&#8208;CD) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid, consisting of a negatively charged POM cluster with &#946;&#8208;CD host groups. The POM/&#946;&#8208;CD hybrid can be dispersed in water and interacts at a water/oil interface with ligands dissolved in an oil phase through electrostatic or host&#8211;guest interactions, thereby generating POM&#8208;surfactants (POMSs) having pH, redox, and guest&#8208;competitive responsiveness, respectively. By taking advantage of the jamming of POMSs at the interface, a reconfigurable all&#8208;liquid system could be produced that is responsive to orthogonal changes in the external environment.

         <title>Fluorescent Organic &#960;&#8208;Radicals Stabilized with Boron: Featuring a SOMO&#8211;LUMO Electronic Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design strategy of emissive and stable &#960;&#8208;radicals is established based on incorporation of a boron atom at a position distant from the radical center. SOMO&#8211;LUMO electronic transition in the boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;radicals gives rise to intense red fluorescence, irrespective of solvent polarity, different from donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type emissive &#960;&#8208;radicals.







Abstract
We report on the fluorescence properties of a new class of emissive and stable &#960;&#8208;radicals that contain a boron atom at a position distant from the radical center. A fully planarized derivative exhibited an intense red fluorescence with high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F &gt;0.67) even in polar solvents. To elucidate the origin of this phenomenon, we synthesized another boron&#8208;stabilized radical that contains a bulky aryl group on the boron atom. A comparison of these derivatives, as well as with conventional donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A)&#8208;type emissive &#960;&#8208;radicals, unveiled several characteristic features in their photophysical properties. A theoretical analysis revealed that the SOMO&#8211;LUMO electronic transition generates an emissive D1 state. Unlike conventional D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;radicals, this state does not undergo significant structural relaxation. The boron&#8208;stabilized &#960;&#8208;radicals demonstrated promising potential for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes as an emitting material.

         <title>Direct and Simultaneous Identification of Multiple Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species in Living Cells Using a SERS Borrowing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SERS&#8208;borrowing&#8208;strategy&#8208;based Au@Pt core&#8211;shell nanoprobe (Au@Pt NP) was developed for simultaneous and direct spectroscopic detection and identification of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS). Triphenylphosphine&#8208;functionalized Au@Pt&#8208;TPP NPs were able to locate to the mitochondria for the detection and identification of different mitochondrial ROS simultaneously in living cells under oxidative stress.







Abstract
Identification of different mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) simultaneously in living cells is vital for understanding the critical roles of different ROS in biological processes. To date, it remains a great challenge to develop ROS probes for direct and simultaneous identification of multiple ROS with high specificity. Herein, we report a SERS&#8208;borrowing&#8208;strategy&#8208;based nanoprobe (Au@Pt core&#8211;shell nanoparticles) for simultaneous and direct identification of different ROS by their distinct Raman fingerprints. Isotope substitution experiments and DFT calculations confirmed the ability of Au@Pt nanoprobe to capture and identify different mitochondrial ROS (i.e. &#8901;OOH, H2O2, and &#8901;OH). When functionalized with triphenylphosphine (TPP), the Au@Pt&#8208;TPP nanoprobe located to mitochondria and detected multiple ROS simultaneously in living cells under oxidative stimulation. Our method offers a new tool for the study of the functions of various ROS in biological processes.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Stabilizes Olefin Facilitated Transport Membranes Against Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver ions, olefin carriers, are generally vulnerable to hydrogen present in olefin/paraffin mixture feed. Ionic liquid solubilizes and stabilizes silver ion carriers for olefins by forming aggregates. The aggregates significantly enhance carrier stability against reduction by hydrogen.







Abstract
Separation of olefins from their paraffin analogs relies on energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation. Facilitated transport&#8208;based membranes that reversibly and selectively bind olefins, but not paraffins, could save considerable amounts of energy. However, the chemical instability of the silver ion olefin&#8208;binding carriers in such membranes has been a longstanding roadblock for this approach. We discovered long&#8208;term carrier stability against extended exposure to hydrogen, a common contaminant in such streams. Based on UV/Vis absorption and Raman spectroscopy, along with XRD analysis results, certain ionic liquids solubilize silver ions, and anion aggregates surrounding the silver ion carriers greatly attenuate their reduction by hydrogen. Here, we report the stability of olefin/paraffin separation properties under continuous exposure to high pressure hydrogen, which addresses a critical technical roadblock in membrane&#8208;based olefin/paraffin separation.

         <title>Molecular Iron Oxide Clusters Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction of Platinum Electrocatalysts at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant oxygen reduction reaction reactivity enhancements are observed when aqueous solutions containing iron oxide clusters {Fe28} are used as electrolyte. Mechanistic, experimental and theoretical studies explore possible roles of this polyion in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key energy conversion process, which is critical for the efficient operation of fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. Here, we report the significant enhancement of the ORR&#8208;performance of commercial platinum&#8208;on&#8208;carbon electrocatalysts when operated in aqueous electrolyte solutions (pH&#8197;5.6), containing the polyoxoanion [Fe28(&#956;3&#8208;O)8(L&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;tart)16(CH3COO)24]20&#8722;. Mechanistic studies provide initial insights into the performance&#8208;improving role of the iron oxide cluster during ORR. Technological deployment of the system is demonstrated by incorporation into a direct formate microfluidic fuel cell (DFMFC), where major performance increases are observed when compared with reference electrolytes. The study provides the first examples of iron oxide clusters in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Effects on Aqueous Electrolyte for Electrochemical Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical isotope effects between heavy water (D2O) and light water (H2O) were revealed to shed light on rational electrolyte design towards the realization of high&#8208;performance aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
As two stable hydrogen isotopes, protium and deuterium show magnified isotope effects in physicochemical properties due to the significantly varied atomic masses. In this work, aqueous electrolytes based on heavy water (D2O) and light water (H2O) were prepared to reveal the electrochemical isotope effects between the hydrogen isotopes. The covalent hydrogen&#8211;oxygen bond and intermolecular hydrogen bond in D2O are much stronger than those in H2O, making them thermodynamically more stable. Compared with the H2O&#8208;based electrolyte, the D2O&#8208;based electrolyte shows a broader electrochemical window, a higher percentage of coordinated water and a longer lifetime of hydrogen bond. Because of the above electrochemical isotope effects, the D2O&#8208;based electrolyte shows high anodic stability against operation of high&#8208;voltage layered oxide cathode materials including LiCoO2 and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, which enables long cycle life and favorable rate performance of aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A New Cation&#8208;Ordered Structure Type with Multiple Thermal Redistributions in Co2InSbO6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corundum&#8208;derived Co2InSbO6 undergoes an unprecedented sequence of cation rearrangements on heating, from a previously unreported ordered&#8208;R32 type distribution to two successive ordered&#8208;LiNbO3 type arrangements.







Abstract
Cation ordering in solids is important for controlling physical properties and leads to ilmenite (FeTiO3) and LiNbO3 type derivatives of the corundum structure, with ferroelectricity resulting from breaking of inversion symmetry in the latter. However, a hypothetical third ABO3 derivative with R32 symmetry has never been observed. Here we show that Co2InSbO6 recovered from high pressure has a new, ordered&#8208;R32 A2BCO6 variant of the corundum structure. Co2InSbO6 is also remarkable for showing two cation redistributions, to (Co0.5In0.5)2CoSbO6 and then Co2InSbO6 variants of the ordered&#8208;LiNbO3 A2BCO6 structure on heating. The cation distributions change magnetic properties as the final ordered&#8208;LiNbO3 product has a sharp ferrimagnetic transition unlike the initial ordered&#8208;R32 phase. Future syntheses of metastable corundum derivatives at pressure are likely to reveal other cation&#8208;redistribution pathways, and may enable ABO3 materials with the R32 structure to be discovered.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on Ordered Silicon Nanowire Array Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction on an Au&#8208;decorated ordered silicon nanowire (O_SiNW) array photocathode provides a new path to green ammonia production with an outstanding Faradaic efficiency at low overpotentials using solar energy.







Abstract
As a new path to &#8220;green&#8221; ammonia production, photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (PEC NO3RR) is investigated for the first time. An Au&#8208;decorated ordered silicon nanowire (O_SiNW) array photocathode demonstrates 95.6&#8201;% of Faradaic efficiency (FE) to ammonia at 0.2&#8197;VRHE, which represents a more positive potential than the thermodynamic reduction potential of nitrate by utilizing photovoltage. The high FE is possible because both Si and Au surfaces are inactive for competing water reduction to hydrogen. The O_SiNW array structure is favorable to promote the PEC NO3RR relative to planar Si or randomly&#8208;grown Si nanowire, by enabling the uniform distribution of small Au nanoparticles as an electrocatalyst and facilitating the mass transport during the reaction. The results demonstrate the feasibility of PEC nitrate conversion to ammonia and would motivate further studies and developments.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge&#8208;Transfer State in Spiro Compact Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads Based on Pyromellitimide&#8208;Derived Rhodamine: Charge Transfer Dynamics and Electron Spin Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fully rigid spiro electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyad is prepared by linking the electron donor and acceptor via a spiro quaternary carbon atom, thus the torsion between the electron donor and acceptor is completely inhibited, the dyad shows a long&#8208;lived 3CT state (2.6&#8197;&#956;s) with a high energy level (ca. 2.61&#8197;eV), the electron spin multiplicity of the CT state was confirmed with time&#8208;resolved EPR spectra.







Abstract
We observed a long&#8208;lived charge transfer (CT) state in a novel orthogonal compact electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyads, with closed form of rhodamine (Rho) as electron donor and pyromellitimide (PI),or thionated PI, as electron acceptor. The two parts in the dyads are connected via a spiro quaternary carbon atom, thus the torsion between the donor and acceptor is completely inhibited, which is beneficial to reduce the reorganization energy and to exploit the Marcus inverted region effect to prolong the CT state lifetime. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show that the charge separation is rather fast, while nanosecond transient absorption spectra confirmed the formation of long&#8208;lived CT state (2.6&#8197;&#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra determined the spin multiplicity of the long living state and assigned it to a 3CT state. Replacement of an oxygen atom in the PI part with a sulfur atom favoring classical intersystem crossing processes, causes a consistently shortening of the lifetime of the 3CT state (0.29&#8197;&#956;s).

         <title>LiNbO3&#8208;Type Polar Antiferromagnet InVO3 Synthesized under High&#8208;Pressure Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
InVO3 was found to crystallize in the polar LiNbO3&#8208;type structure under high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions. The high&#8208;pressure InVO3 phase is a potential multiferroic exhibiting polarization and magnetic ordering.







Abstract
The ambient pressure cation disordered InVO3 bixbyite has been predicted to form a GdFeO3&#8208;type perovskite phase under high pressure and high temperature. Contrary to the expectation, InVO3 was found to crystallize in the polar LiNbO3&#8208;type structure with a calculated spontaneous polarization as large as 74&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Antiferromagnetic coupling of V3+ magnetic moments and a cooperative magnetic ground state below about 10&#8197;K coupled with a polar structure suggest an intriguing ground state of the novel LiNbO3&#8208;type high&#8208;pressure InVO3 structure.

Contrary to the expectation, InVO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was found to crystallize in the polar LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-type structure with a calculated spontaneous polarization as large as 74&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Antiferromagnetic coupling of V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; magnetic moments and a cooperative magnetic ground state below about 10&#8197;K coupled with a polar structure suggest an intriguing ground state of the novel LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-type high-pressure InVO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Mechanochemistry of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed o&#8208;carborane as a new mechanophore that possesses an unexpected combination of force&#8208;free stability and force&#8208;coupled activity. By contrast, m&#8208;carborane, which has a different regiochemistry maintained its high mechanical stability. This fundamental research straightforwardly presents new insights into the remarkable &#8220;expandability of the C&#8722;C covalent bond&#8221; in o&#8208;carborane by applying external force stimuli.







Abstract
We developed o&#8208;carborane as a new mechanophore by showing that the o&#8208;carborane cluster is the preferred scission site in chain&#8208;centered polymers through ultrasonication mechanochemistry. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a predominately homolytic mechanism of chain scission. The mechanically generated monocarbaborane fragments are highly reactive toward alcohol nucleophiles. By contrast, carborane with a different regiochemistry (m&#8208;carborane) maintained its high mechanical stability. DFT simulations provide insights into the origins of carborane's mechanical lability. This fundamental research provides a new stimulus for carborane cage activation.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polymer Drives Performance Enhancement of Non&#8208;fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of ferroelectric polymer polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) as additive into non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells substantially enhances the built&#8208;in electric field. The promoted exciton separation, significantly accelerated charge transport, reduced the charge recombination, as well as the optimized film morphology were observed in the device, leading to a significantly improved device performance.







Abstract
Enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field to promote charge dynamitic process is of great significance to boost the performance of the non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs), which has rarely been concerned. In this work, we introduced a cheap ferroelectric polymer as an additive into the active layers of non&#8208;fullerene OSCs to improve the device performance. An additional and permanent electrical field was produced by the polarization of the ferroelectric dipoles, which can substantially enhance the built&#8208;in electric field. The promoted exciton separation, significantly accelerated charge transport, reduced the charge recombination, as well as the optimized film morphology were observed in the device, leading to a significantly improved performance of the PVDF&#8208;modified OSCs with various active layers, such as PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;IT&#8208;4F and PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;Y6. Especially, a record efficiency of 17.72&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based OSC and an outstanding efficiency of 18.17&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSC were achieved.

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Passivation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crosslinked and compact membrane is constructed throughout the perovskite film by a self&#8208;assembly strategy based on cholesterol&#8208;based molecules. This enables durable passivation against harsh conditions and effective defects passivation from surface toward inner grain boundaries. The modified planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit a 23.34&#8201;% champion efficiency and remain almost unchanged after heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 500&#8197;h.







Abstract
Defect passivation via post&#8208;treatment of perovskite films is an effective method to fabricate high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the passivation durability is still an issue due to the weak and vulnerable bonding between passivating functional groups and perovskite defect sites. Here we propose a cholesterol derivative self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct crosslinked and compact membranes throughout perovskite films. These supramolecular membranes act as a robust protection layer against harsh operational conditions while providing effective passivation of defects from surface toward inner grain boundaries. The resultant PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 23.34&#8201;% with an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.164&#8197;eV. The unencapsulated devices retain 92&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after 1600&#8197;h of storage under ambient conditions, and remain almost unchanged after heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 500&#8197;h in a nitrogen atmosphere, showing significantly improved stability.

         <title>Enhancing Circulation and Tumor Accumulation of Carboplatin via an Erythrocyte&#8208;Anchored Prodrug Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboplatin&#8208;based platinum(IV) anticancer prodrug that can hitchhike on erythrocytes is reported. The as&#8208;prepared prodrug ERY1&#8208;PtIV has a prolonged circulatory half&#8208;life, enhanced tumor accumulation, and improved antitumor effect compared to carboplatin in vivo via this erythrocyte&#8208;anchored strategy.







Abstract
The short circulatory half&#8208;lives and low tumor accumulation of carboplatin greatly limit the drug's efficacy in vivo. Herein, we address these challenges by using a prodrug strategy and present the rational design of a novel platinum(IV) anticancer prodrug that can hitchhike on erythrocytes. This prodrug, designated as ERY1&#8208;PtIV, can bind to erythrocytes efficiently and stably, possessing a circulatory half&#8208;life 18.5&#8197;times longer than that of carboplatin in mice. This elongated circulatory half&#8208;life enables platinum to accumulate at levels 7.7&#8197;times higher than with carboplatin, with steady levels in the tumors. As a consequence, the ERY1&#8208;PtIV prodrug is proved to exhibit significantly enhanced antitumor activity and reduced side effects compared with carboplatin. Collectively, our novel approach highlights an efficient strategy to utilize intrinsic erythrocytes as auto&#8208;binding carriers to enhance the tumor accumulation and subsequent antitumor efficacy of platinum drugs.

         <title>Controlling Thermal Expansion in Supramolecular Halogen&#8208;Bonded Mixed Cocrystals through Synthetic Feed and Dynamic Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy has been developed for controlling thermal expansion using a mixed cocrystal approach, wherein thermal expansion is tuned by controlling the synthetic feed and functionality of the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor molecules. The appearance and composition of the bulk material is similar across the series, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction and SEM&#8208;EDS; however, expansion behaviors differ due to the dynamic motion ability of the acceptor molecules.







Abstract
Control over thermal expansion (TE) behaviors in solid materials is often accomplished by modifying the molecules or intermolecular interactions within the solid. Here, we use a mixed cocrystal approach and incorporate molecules with similar chemical structures, but distinct functionalities. Development of mixed cocrystals is at a nascent stage, and here we describe the first mixed cocrystals sustained by one&#8208;dimensional halogen bonds. Within each mixed cocrystal, the halogen&#8208;bond donor is fixed, while the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor site contains two molecules in a variable ratio. X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates isostructurality across the series, and SEM&#8208;EDS shows equal distribution of heavy atoms and similar atomic compositions across all mixed cocrystals. The acceptor molecules differ in their ability to undergo dynamic motion in the solid state. The synthetic equivalents of motion capable and incapable molecules were systematically varied to yield direct tunabililty in TE behavior.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy has been developed for controlling thermal expansion using a mixed cocrystal approach, wherein thermal expansion is tuned by controlling the synthetic feed and functionality of the halogen-bond acceptor molecules. The appearance and composition of the bulk material is similar across the series, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction and SEM-EDS; however, expansion behaviors differ due to the dynamic motion ability of the acceptor molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control over thermal expansion (TE) behaviors in solid materials is often accomplished by modifying the molecules or intermolecular interactions within the solid. Here, we use a mixed cocrystal approach and incorporate molecules with similar chemical structures, but distinct functionalities. Development of mixed cocrystals is at a nascent stage, and here we describe the first mixed cocrystals sustained by one-dimensional halogen bonds. Within each mixed cocrystal, the halogen-bond donor is fixed, while the halogen-bond acceptor site contains two molecules in a variable ratio. X-ray diffraction demonstrates isostructurality across the series, and SEM-EDS shows equal distribution of heavy atoms and similar atomic compositions across all mixed cocrystals. The acceptor molecules differ in their ability to undergo dynamic motion in the solid state. The synthetic equivalents of motion capable and incapable molecules were systematically varied to yield direct tunabililty in TE behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dehydroxylative Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Carboxylic Acids Derivatives via a Spin&#8208;Center Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DMAP&#8208;boryl radical breaks the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;O bond of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides and esters via a spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) mechanism, enabling the facile conversion of abundantly available and/or naturally occurring &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids to value&#8208;added alkylated products.







Abstract
A strategically distinct dehydroxylative alkylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives with alkenes is developed. The reaction starts with the attack of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical to the carbonyl oxygen atom, followed by a spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) to trigger the C&#8722;O bond scission. The resulting &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals couple with a wide range of alkenes to furnish various alkylated products. This strategy allows for the efficient conversion of a wide array of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides and esters derived from several biomass molecules and natural products to value&#8208;added compounds. Experimental and computational studies verified the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Cobalt/Salox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Arylphosphinamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of arylphosphinamides with alkynes and allenes using a simple cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalyst is reported. This new methodology provides an efficient approach for the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic compounds with excellent enantioselectivities (45 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Previous methods on CoIII&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation rely on the use of tailor&#8208;made cyclopentadienyl&#8208;ligated CoIII complexes, which require lengthy steps for the preparation. Herein, we report an unprecedented enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization enabled by a simple cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalysis. The chiral Salox ligands can be easily prepared in one step from salicylonitrile and chiral amino alcohols. A broad range of P&#8208;stereogenic compounds were synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (45 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The isolation and characterization of several intermediates provided insights into the generation of active catalytic cobalt species, the action of Salox, and the mode of stereocontrol.

         <title>Steering Self&#8208;Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional Iptycenes on Au(111) by Tuning Molecule&#8208;Surface Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passivation of Au(111) with an iodine monolayer provides effective means to steer the adsorption of three&#8208;dimensional (f)antrip molecules. The stronger interaction on pristine Au(111) favours adsorption with two anthracene blades flat, promoting self&#8208;assembly of a densely packed structure. By contrast, on passivated Au(111) f(antrip) adsorbs with its three anthracene blades edge&#8208;on, giving rise to self&#8208;assembly of a porous structure.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of three&#8208;dimensional molecules is scarcely studied on surfaces. Their modes of adsorption can exhibit far greater variability compared to (nearly) planar molecules that adsorb mostly flat on surfaces. This additional degree of freedom can have decisive consequences for the expression of intermolecular binding motifs, hence the formation of supramolecular structures. The determining molecule&#8208;surface interactions can be widely tuned, thereby providing a new powerful lever for crystal engineering in two dimensions. Here, we study the self&#8208;assembly of triptycene derivatives with anthracene blades on Au(111) by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, Near Edge X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure and Density Functional Theory. The impact of molecule&#8208;surface interactions was experimentally tested by comparing pristine with iodine&#8208;passivated Au(111) surfaces. Thereby, we observed a fundamental change of the adsorption mode that triggered self&#8208;assembly of an entirely different structure.

         <title>Investigation of the Molecular Landscape of Bacterial Aromatic Polyketides by Global Analysis of Type&#8197;II Polyketide Synthases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The global distribution and structural diversity of bacterial aromatic polyketides were assessed by pan&#8208;genomic analysis of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. Such a global atlas will guide genome mining efforts to fully exploit natural products, as exemplified by the discovery of the unusual angular naphthopyrans from a rare actinobacterium.







Abstract
Aromatic polyketides biosynthesized by microorganisms are a prominent class of natural products widely used in clinical treatments. Although genome mining approaches have accelerated the discovery of these molecules, the molecular diversity, abundance, and distribution of bacterial aromatic polyketides at a global scale remain elusive. Here, we provide a global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides based on large&#8208;scale analysis of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. We first established the chain length factor protein as a marker that can predict both chemical class and molecular uniqueness of the biosynthetic product, and analyzed the abundance, taxonomic distribution, estimated structural diversity, and the total number of aromatic polyketides in bacteria. We further show the identification of oryzanaphthopyrans with an unprecedented angular naphthopyran scaffold from a rare actinobacterium by genome mining guided by the global atlas. These results serve as a compass for exploiting the entire type&#8197;II polyketide synthase&#8208;derived aromatic polyketides in bacteria.

         <title>Triggering near&#8208;infrared luminescence of vanadyl phthalocyanine by charging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;state dependent &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; molecular photo&#8208;switches are of present interest for novel optoelectronics. We have used mass&#8208;selective ion beam deposition into solid Ne at 5&#8197;K to compare the spectral properties of vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc&#8901;) with its singly charged cation. Electron detachment from VOPc&#8901; leads to a diradical cation (VOPc+..) which shows profound NIR photoluminescence. By contrast, VOPc&#8901; is essentially non&#8208;emissive.







Abstract
Probing electrofluorochromism (EFC) at the molecular level remains challenging. Here we study the strongly charge state&#8208;dependent photoluminescence of vanadyl phthalocyanine. We report vibrationally resolved absorption and laser&#8208;induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of samples comprising both the mass&#8208;selected neutral molecule (VOPc&#8901;, a stable radical) and its cation produced upon electron ionization (EI) isolated in 5&#8197;K neon matrices. Ionization of the essentially non&#8208;emissive VOPc&#8901; forms a high&#8208;spin diradical cation (VOPc+..) which shows profound photoluminescence (PL) in the NIR range. This unique phenomenon is potentially of interest for NIR&#8208;emitting electro&#8208;optic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Probing electrofluorochromism (EFC) at the molecular level remains challenging. Here we study the strongly charge state-dependent photoluminescence of vanadyl phthalocyanine. We report vibrationally resolved absorption and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of samples comprising both the mass-selected neutral molecule (VOPc&#8901;, a stable radical) and its cation produced upon electron ionization (EI) isolated in 5&#8197;K neon matrices. Ionization of the essentially non-emissive VOPc&#8901; forms a high-spin diradical cation (VOPc&lt;sup&gt;+..&lt;/sup&gt;) which shows profound photoluminescence (PL) in the NIR range. This unique phenomenon is potentially of interest for NIR-emitting electro-optic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemiexcitation&#8208;Triggered Prodrug Activation for Targeted Carbon Monoxide Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new prodrug strategy, namely chemiexcitation triggered prodrug activation, is proposed herein to achieve targeted CO delivery to the tumor site. The CO release from a photoresponsive CO prodrug is activated by chemical energy transfer instead of by UV irradiation. As such, the inherent limitations with light irradiation are perfectly addressed.







Abstract
Photolysis&#8208;based prodrug strategy can address some critical drug delivery issues, which otherwise are very challenging to tackle with traditional prodrug strategy. However, the need for external light irradiation significantly hampers its in vivo application due to the poor light accessibility of deep tissue. Herein, we propose a new strategy of chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered prodrug activation, wherein a photoresponsive prodrug is excited for drug payload release by chemiexcitation instead of photoirradiation. As such, the bond&#8208;cleavage power of photolysis can be employed to address some critical drug delivery issues while obviating the need for external light irradiation. We have established the proof of concept by the successful development of a chemiexcitation responsive carbon monoxide delivery platform, which exhibited specific CO release at the tumor site and pronounced tumor suppression effects. We anticipate that such a concept of chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered prodrug activation can be leveraged for the targeted delivery of other small molecule&#8208;based drug payloads.

         <title>The Limited Palette for Photonic Block&#8208;Copolymer Materials: A Historical Problem or a Practical Limitation?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of block&#8208;copolymers into photonic films and pigments has drawn significant attention due to the tunability of the optical response. In this Scientific Perspective we identify and rationalize the limited range of monomers and polymerization methods employed to produce such structurally colored materials to date. By considering historical development and practical limitations, new strategies are proposed to inspire new research directions.







Abstract
Block&#8208;copolymer self&#8208;assembly has proven to be an effective route for the fabrication of photonic films and, more recently, photonic pigments. However, despite extensive research on this topic over the past two decades, the palette of monomers and polymers employed to produce such structurally colored materials has remained surprisingly limited. In this Scientific Perspective, the commonly used block&#8208;copolymer systems reported in the literature are summarized (considering both linear and brush architectures) and their use is rationalized from the point of view of both their historical development and physicochemical constraints. Finally, the current challenges facing the field are discussed and promising new areas of research are highlighted to inspire the community to pursue new directions.

         <title>Integrating Unexpected High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobility and Low&#8208;Threshold Lasing Action in an Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;2) was designed and synthesized. Comprehensive characterizations demonstrate that LD&#8208;2 combines the properties of high charge carrier mobility of 2.7&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and superior lasing characteristics (low threshold of Eth=9.43&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Eth=9.93&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the peaks of 420&#8197;nm and 443&#8197;nm), which demonstrates promising potential for integrated optoelectronic device applications.







Abstract
Integrating high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and low&#8208;threshold lasing action in an organic semiconductor is crucial for the realization of an electrically pumped laser, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we present an organic semiconductor, named as 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;2), which shows an unexpected high charge&#8208;carrier mobility of 2.7&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and low&#8208;threshold lasing characteristic of 9.43&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 9.93&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high&#8208;quality factor (Q) of 2131 and 1684 at emission peaks of 420 and 443&#8197;nm, respectively. Detailed theoretical calculations and photophysical data analysis demonstrate that a large intermolecular transfer integral of 10.36&#8211;45.16&#8197;meV together with a fast radiative transition rate of 8.0&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1 are responsible for the achievement of the superior integrated optoelectronic properties in the LD&#8208;2 crystal. These optoelectronic performances of LD&#8208;2 are among the highest reported low&#8208;threshold lasing organic semiconductors with efficient charge transport, suggesting its promise for research of electrically pumped organic lasers (EPOLs).

         <title>Photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;Cycloadditions of Alkenylboronates and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process for the synthesis of cyclobutylboronates by [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition is presented. The reaction is enabled by triplet energy transfer to an alkenylboronate, which is an underexplored photochemical process. The process operates with a wide array of alkenylboronates and alkenes to generate a diverse range of products. The utility of the products is demonstrated in the synthesis of melicodenine&#8197;C.







Abstract
A new strategy for the synthesis of highly versatile cyclobutylboronates via the photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of alkenylboronates and alkenes is presented. The process is mechanistically different from other processes in that energy transfer occurs with the alkenylboronate as opposed to the other alkene. This strategy allows for the synthesis of an array of diverse cyclobutylboronates. The conversion of these adducts to other compounds as well as their utility in the synthesis of melicodenine&#8197;C is demonstrated.

         <title>Reaction Rate Acceleration of Cooperative Catalytic Systems: Metal Nanoparticles and Lewis Acids in Arene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arene hydrogenation was greatly accelerated by a cooperative catalytic system that consisted of heterogeneous Rh&#8208;Pt nanoparticles and Lewis acids. Remarkably, particularly challenging substrates that contained strong electron&#8208;donating groups and sterically hindered substituents could be smoothly hydrogenated.







Abstract
Employing two distinct catalysts in one reaction medium synergistically is a powerful strategy for activating less reactive substrates. Although the approach has been well&#8208;developed in homogeneous conditions, it remains challenging and rare in heterogeneous catalysis, especially under gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid multiphase reaction conditions. Here, we describe the development of cooperative and synergistic catalyst systems of heterogeneous Rh&#8208;Pt bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, Rh&#8208;Pt/DMPSi&#8208;Al2O3, and Sc(OTf)3 in the liquid phase for the hydrogenation of arenes under very mild conditions. Dramatic rate acceleration was achieved with cooperative activation. Remarkably, more challenging substrates that contained strong electron&#8208;donating groups and sterically hindered substituents were smoothly hydrogenated. Mechanistic insights into the cooperative activation of an aromatic substrate by heterogeneous metal nanoparticles and a soluble Lewis acid was obtained by kinetic studies and by direct observation of 1H and 45Sc NMR spectra.

&lt;p&gt;Arene hydrogenation was greatly accelerated by a cooperative catalytic system that consisted of heterogeneous Rh-Pt nanoparticles and Lewis acids. Remarkably, particularly challenging substrates that contained strong electron-donating groups and sterically hindered substituents could be smoothly hydrogenated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing two distinct catalysts in one reaction medium synergistically is a powerful strategy for activating less reactive substrates. Although the approach has been well-developed in homogeneous conditions, it remains challenging and rare in heterogeneous catalysis, especially under gas-liquid-solid multiphase reaction conditions. Here, we describe the development of cooperative and synergistic catalyst systems of heterogeneous Rh-Pt bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, Rh-Pt/DMPSi-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Sc(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the liquid phase for the hydrogenation of arenes under very mild conditions. Dramatic rate acceleration was achieved with cooperative activation. Remarkably, more challenging substrates that contained strong electron-donating groups and sterically hindered substituents were smoothly hydrogenated. Mechanistic insights into the cooperative activation of an aromatic substrate by heterogeneous metal nanoparticles and a soluble Lewis acid was obtained by kinetic studies and by direct observation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;Sc NMR spectra.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Histidine&#8208;Mediated Ion Specific Effects Enable Salt Tolerance of a Pore&#8208;Forming Marine Antimicrobial Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of density functional theory, synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, mutational studies, and antimicrobial assays show that the histidine residues of a marine antimicrobial peptide coordinate sodium ions and the phosphate in headgroups of lipids to maintain the activity of the peptide at high salt concentrations. The placement of histidines in the &#945;&#8208;helical conformation of the peptide is critical.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) preferentially permeate prokaryotic membranes via electrostatic binding and membrane remodeling. Such action is drastically suppressed by high salt due to increased electrostatic screening, thus it is puzzling how marine AMPs can possibly work. We examine as a model system, piscidin&#8208;1, a histidine&#8208;rich marine AMP, and show that ion&#8208;histidine interactions play unanticipated roles in membrane remodeling at high salt: Histidines can simultaneously hydrogen&#8208;bond to a phosphate and coordinate with an alkali metal ion to neutralize phosphate charge, thereby facilitating multidentate bonds to lipid headgroups in order to generate saddle&#8208;splay curvature, a prerequisite to pore formation. A comparison among Na+, K+, and Cs+ indicates that histidine&#8208;mediated salt tolerance is ion specific. We conclude that histidine plays a unique role in enabling protein/peptide&#8208;membrane interactions that occur in marine or other high&#8208;salt environment.

         <title>Guided Synthesis of a Mo/Zn Dual Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Synergistic Effect and Peroxidase&#8208;like Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis strategy for a dual single&#8208;atom nanozyme has been developed by using a macroscopic polymer aerogel as the supporting substrate and supramolecular coordination complexes/polyoxometalates as the metal precursor. The nanozyme with high catalytic activity and super&#8208;long stability has been applied in the detection of various analytes including intracellular H2O2, glucose in serum, cholesterol, and ascorbic acid in commercial beverages.







Abstract
We present a facile route towards a dual single&#8208;atom nanozyme composed of Zn and Mo, which utilizes the non&#8208;covalent nano&#8208;assembly of polyoxometalates, supramolecular coordination complexes as the metal&#8208;atom precursor, and a macroscopic amphiphilic aerogel as the supporting substrate. The dual single&#8208;atoms of Zn and Mo have a high content (1.5 and 7.3&#8197;wt%, respectively) and exhibit a synergistic effect and a peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The Zn/Mo site was identified as the main active center by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation. The detection of versatile analytes, including intracellular H2O2, glucose in serum, cholesterol, and ascorbic acid in commercial beverages was achieved. The nanozyme has an outstanding stability and maintained its performance after one year's storage. This study develops a new peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme and provides a robust synthetic strategy for single&#8208;atom catalysts by utilizing an aerogel as a facile substrate that is capable of stabilizing various metal atoms.

         <title>Cold Denaturation of Proteins in the Absence of Solvent: Implications for Protein Storage**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't put your protein in the &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C freezer: a well&#8208;known fact for biochemists and here it is demonstrated why this is right even in a vacuum. Variable&#8208;temperature ion mobility allows measurement of the structure of isolated proteins at sub&#8208;ambient temperatures. For three isotypes of monoclonal antibody, it is found that there is substantial structural rearrangement at 250&#8197;K (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C), indicating a cold denaturation transition. At deep&#8208;freezing temperatures (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C) the structure is unaffected.







Abstract
The effect of temperature on the stability of proteins is well explored above 298&#8197;K, but harder to track experimentally below 273&#8197;K. Variable&#8208;temperature ion mobility mass spectrometry (VT IM&#8208;MS) allows us to measure the structure of molecules at sub&#8208;ambient temperatures. Here we monitor conformational changes that occur to two isotypes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on cooling by measuring their collision cross sections (CCS) at discrete drift gas temperatures from 295 to 160&#8197;K. The CCS at 250&#8197;K is larger than predicted from collisional theory and experimental data at 295&#8197;K. This restructure is attributed to change in the strength of stabilizing intermolecular interactions. Below 250&#8197;K the CCS of the mAbs increases in line with prediction implying no rearrangement. Comparing data from isotypes suggest disulfide bridging influences thermal structural rearrangement. These findings indicate that in vacuo deep&#8208;freezing minimizes denaturation and maintains the native fold and VT IM&#8208;MS measurements at sub ambient temperatures provide new insights to the phenomenon of cold denaturation.

         <dc:description>The enantioselective cascade reaction between racemic 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols and alkynols/alkynamides was realized by using a gold and iridium sequential catalytic system. In this procedure, the in situ&#8208;generated exocyclic vinyl ethers or enamides undergo the asymmetric allylation/spiroketalization with &#960;&#8208;ally&#8208;Ir amphiphilic species, which provides an efficient and straightforward access to spiroketals and spiroaminals with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, racemic 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines were also suitable in this reaction along with a kinetic resolution process, affording enantioenriched spiroaminals and 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines in good yields. The synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated by efficient enantioselective synthesis of the analogue of Paecilospirone.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteoform&#8208;Selective Imaging of Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the complexity of biological systems relies on the development of new approaches for spatially resolved proteoform&#8208;specific analysis of the proteome. Herein, we employ nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (nano&#8208;DESI MSI) for the proteoform&#8208;selective imaging of biological tissues. Nano&#8208;DESI generates multiply charged protein ions, which is advantageous for their structural characterization using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) directly on the tissue. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments demonstrate that nano&#8208;DESI MSI combined with on&#8208;tissue top&#8208;down proteomics is ideally suited for the proteoform&#8208;selective imaging of tissue sections. Using rat brain tissue as a model system, we provide the first evidence of differential proteoform expression in different regions of the brain.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Decorated Conjugated Organic Polymers Activate Oxygen for Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidizing CH  4  into liquid products with O  2  under mild conditions still mainly relies on metal catalysis. We prepared a series of sulfone&#8208;modified conjugated organic polymers and found that the catalyst with proper S(VI) content (0.10) could drive O  2  &#8594;H  2  O  2  &#8594;&#8226;OH to oxidize CH  4  into CH  3  OH and HCOOH directly and efficiently at room temperature under light irradiation. Experimental results showed that after 4 h reaction, decomposition rate and residual amounts of H  2  O  2  were 81.21% and 4.83 mmol g  cat  &#8208;1  respectively, and CH  4  conversion rate was 22.81%. Mechanism studies revealed that illumination could induce the homolytic dissociation of S=O bonds on catalyst to produce oxygen and sulfur radicals, where the &#8226;O could adsorb and activate CH  4  , and the &#8226;S could supply electrons for  1  O  2  to generate H  2  O  2  and then for decomposing the H  2  O  2  into &#8226;OH timely to oxidize CH  4  . This research provided a novel organic catalysis approach for oxygen activation and utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Picolinamides and Iodoalkynes Enable Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed syn&#8208;Aminoalkynylation of Di&#8208; and Trisubstituted Alkenes to Give Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminoalkynylation of electronically unbiased olefins with iodoalkynes is reported. The picolinamide auxiliary enables for the first time the  syn  &#8208;selective aminoalkynylation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes to afford the corresponding pyrrolidines in up to 97% yield and as single diastereomers. Furthermore, through a C&#8211;H activation approach, the picolinamide allows the rapid synthesis of functionalized olefins, which are suitable cyclization precursors. Facile and orthogonal deprotection of the amides and Si  i  Pr  3  &#8208;acetylenes in the products, and a subsequent Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Free Copying of 12 Bases of RNA with Dinucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of complementary strands is the reaction underlying the replication of genetic information. It is likely that the earliest self&#8208;replicating systems used RNA as genetic material. How RNA was copied in the absence of enzymes and what sequences were most likely to have supported replication is not clear.&#160; Here we show that mixtures of dinucleotides with C and G as bases copy an RNA sequence of up to 12 nucleotides in dilute aqueous solution. Successful enzyme&#8208;free copying occurred with  in situ  activation at 4 &#176;C and pH 6.0. Dimers were incorporated in favor of monomers when both competed as reactants, and little misincorporation was detectable in mass spectra. Simulations using experimental rate constants confirmed that mixed C/G sequences are good candidates for successful replication with dimers. Because dimers are intermediates in the synthesis of longer strands, our results support evolutionary scenarios encompassing formation and copying of RNA strands in enzyme&#8208;free fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Arene Ligand as Stereocontroller for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of chiral ligands is the most fundamental task in metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis. In the last 60 years, various kinds of ligands have been sophisticatedly developed. However, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge to develop practically useful chiral &#951;6&#8208;arene ligands, thereby seriously hampered the asymmetric synthesis promoted by arene&#8208;metal catalysts. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a class of readily tunable, C2 symmetric chiral arene ligands derived from [2.2]paracyclophane. Its ruthenium(II) complexes have been prepared and successfully applied in the enantioselective C&#8208;H activation to afford a series of axially chiral isoquinolones (up to 99% yield and 96% ee). This study not only lays chemists'&#160;longstanding doubts about whether it is possible to use chiral arene ligand to stereocontrol ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8208;H activation, but also opens up a new avenue to achieve asymmetric C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Porphyrazine&#8208;linked Fused Aromatic Networks with High Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused aromatic networks (FANs) have been studied in efforts to overcome the low physicochemical stability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), while preserving crystallinity. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a highly stable and crystalline FAN (denoted as Pz&#8208;FAN) using pyrazine&#8208;based building blocks to form porphyrazine (Pz) linkages via irreversible reaction. Unlike most COFs and FANs, which are synthesized from two different building blocks, the new Pz&#8208;FAN is formed using a single building block by self&#8208;cyclotetramerization. Controlled and optimized reaction conditions resulted in highly crystalline Pz&#8208;FAN with physicochemical stability. The newly prepared Pz&#8208;FAN displayed a high magnitude (1.16 &#215; 10  &#8722;2  S cm  &#8722;1  ) of proton conductivity compared to other reported FANs and polymers. Finally, the Pz&#8208;FAN&#8208;based membrane was evaluated for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which showed maximum power and current densities of 192 mW cm  &#8722;2  and 481 mA cm  &#8722;2  , respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquity of sulfur&#8208;containing molecules in biologically active natural products and pharmaceuticals has long attracted synthetic chemists to develop efficient strategies towards their synthesis. The strategy of direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8722;H modification of sulfides provides a streamlining access to complex sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, we report a photoinduced chemo&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereoselective &#945;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8722;H functionalization of sulfides using isatins as the photoredox reagent and coupling partner catalyzed by chiral gallium(III)&#8210; N  ,  N'  &#8208;  dioxide complex. The reaction proceeds through a verified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism with high efficiency, excellent functional group tolerance, as well as a broad substrate scope. Importantly, this cross&#8208;coupling protocol is highly selective for the direct late&#8208;stage functionalization of methionine&#8208;related peptides, regardless of the inherent structural similarity and complexity of diverse residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Design of seco&#8208;Chlorin Photosensitizers to Overcome Phototoxic Effects in Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non&#8208;invasive treatment modality against a range of cancers and nonmalignant diseases, however one must be aware of the risk of causing phototoxic reactions after treatment. We herein report a bioinspired design of next&#8208;generation photosensitizers (PSs) that not only effectively produce ROS but undergo fast metabolism after treatment to overcome undesirable side effects. We constructed a series of  b  &#8208;pyrrolic ring&#8208;opening secochlorins, termed beidaphyrin (  BP  ), beidapholactone (  BPL  ), and their zinc(II) derivatives (  ZnBP  and  ZnBPL  ), featuring intense near&#8208;infrared absorption and effective O  2  photosensitization. Irradiation of  ZnBPL  led to a non&#8208;cytotoxic, metabolizable beidaphodiacetamide (  ZnBPD  ) via in situ generated O  2  &#8226;&#8722;  but not  1  O  2  , as revealed by mechanistic studies including time&#8208;resolved absorption, kinetics, and isotope labeling. Furthermore, water&#8208;soluble  ZnBPL  showed an effective therapeutic outcome, fast metabolism, and negligible phototoxic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Transmetalation between Copper and Palladium Nanoparticle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Cu nanoparticles enhances transmetalation and phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu surface to the Pd surface by low&#8208;flux visible light. This feature enables a choice between the cross&#8208;coupling product and homo&#8208;coupling product dependent on wavelength.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;mediated phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu to the Pd surface affords a novel mechanism for transmetalation, enabling wavelength&#8208;tunable cross&#8208;coupling and homo&#8208;coupling reaction pathway control. C&#8722;C bond forming Sonogashira coupling and Glaser coupling reactions in O2 atmosphere are efficiently driven by visible light over heterogeneous Cu and Pd nanoparticles as a mixed catalyst without base or other additives. The reaction pathway can be controlled by switching the excitation wavelength. Shorter wavelengths (400&#8211;500&#8197;nm) give the Glaser homo&#8208;coupling diyne, whereas longer wavelength irradiation (500&#8211;940&#8197;nm) significantly increases the degree of cross&#8208;coupling Sonogashira coupling products. The ratio of the activated intermediates of alkyne to the iodobenzene is wavelength dependent and this regulates transmetalation. This wavelength&#8208;tunable reaction pathway is a novel way to optimize the product selectivity in important organic syntheses.

         <title>A Pd&#8722;H/Isothiourea Cooperative Catalysis Approach to anti&#8208;Aldol Motifs: Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Esters with Oxyallenes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperation between isothiourea and Pd catalysts enables the preparation of anti&#8208;aldol products via enantioselective alkylation of esters with oxyallenes. Key to the successful development of this method was the recognition that Pd&#8722;H intermediates could be leveraged within this cooperative framework giving access to oxygen&#8208;substituted &#960;(allyl)Pd intermediates. Preliminary deuterium&#8208;tracking experiments support the proposed reaction pathway.







Abstract
The biological and therapeutic significance of natural products is a powerful impetus for the development of efficient methods to facilitate their construction. Accordingly, and reflecting the prevalence of &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;carbonyl motifs, a sophisticated arsenal of aldol&#8208;based strategies has evolved that is contingent on the generation of single enolate isomers. Since this has the potential to compromise efficiency in reagent&#8208;based paradigms, direct catalysis&#8208;based solutions would be enabling. To complement the array of substrate&#8208;based strategies, and regulate enolate geometry at the catalyst level, a direct catalytic alkylation of esters with oxyallenes has been developed. Synergizing metal hydride reactivity with Lewis base catalysis has resulted in a broad reaction scope with useful levels of stereocontrol (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Facile derivatization of these ambiphilic linchpins is demonstrated, providing access to high&#8208;value vicinal stereocenter&#8208;containing motifs, including 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols.

         <title>Catalytic DNA Polymerization Can Be Expedited by Active Product Release**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of the primer exchange reaction is a strongly peaked function of the binding strength between the reactant and catalyst strands. This trend holds for many catalytic reactions and is known as Sabatier's principle. A helicase that consumes ATP to selectively remove the products from the catalysts can speed up the reaction in the strong&#8208;binding regime and reduce the dependency of the catalytic rate on the binding strength.







Abstract
The sequence&#8208;specific hybridization of DNA facilitates its use as a building block for designer nanoscale structures and reaction networks that perform computations. However, the strong binding energy of Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing that underlies this specificity also causes the DNA dehybridization rate to depend sensitively on sequence length and temperature. This strong dependency imposes stringent constraints on the design of multi&#8208;step DNA reactions. Here we show how an ATP&#8208;dependent helicase, Rep&#8208;X, can drive specific dehybridization reactions at rates independent of sequence length, removing the constraints of equilibrium on DNA hybridization and dehybridization. To illustrate how this new capacity can speed up designed DNA reaction networks, we show that Rep&#8208;X extends the range of conditions where the primer exchange reaction, which catalytically adds a domain provided by a hairpin template to a DNA substrate, proceeds rapidly.

A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8722;S battery is constructed with an electrocatalyst&#8208;assisted sulfur positive electrode and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The electrocatalyst accelerates the sulfur conversion and the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfide, endowing the Al&#8722;S battery with a high energy density and a long cycle life.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8211;sulfur (Al&#8722;S) batteries of ultrahigh energy&#8208;to&#8208;price ratios are a promising energy storage technology, while they suffer from a large voltage gap and short lifespan. Herein, we propose an electrocatalyst&#8208;boosting quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8722;S battery, which involves a sulfur&#8208;anchored cobalt/nitrogen co&#8208;doped graphene (S@CoNG) positive electrode and an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;impregnated metal&#8211;organic framework (IL@MOF) electrolyte. The Co&#8722;N4 sites in CoNG continuously catalyze the breaking of Al&#8722;Cl and S&#8722;S bonds and accelerate the sulfur conversion, endowing the Al&#8722;S battery with a shortened voltage gap of 0.43&#8197;V and a high discharge voltage plateau of 0.9&#8197;V. In the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state IL@MOF electrolytes, the shuttle effect of polysulfides has been inhibited, which stabilizes the reversible sulfur reaction, enabling the Al&#8722;S battery to deliver 820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 specific capacity and 78&#8201;% capacity retention after 300&#8197;cycles. This finding offers novel insights to design Al&#8722;S batteries for stable energy storage.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis for Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates Using Oxygen over PdCu/Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdCu/zeolite exhibited promising catalytic performance for selective oxidation of CH4 to oxygenates with O2 and H2 via tandem catalysis. The PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H2O2, while Cu single atoms activated the H2O2 and facilitated the direct conversion of CH4 to CH3OH by a radical&#8208;triggered pathway.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates with O2 under mild conditions remains a great challenge. Here we report a ZSM&#8208;5 (Z&#8208;5) supported PdCu bimetallic catalyst (PdCu/Z&#8208;5) for methane conversion to oxygenates by reacting with O2 in the presence of H2 at low temperature (120&#8201;&#176;C). Benefiting from the co&#8208;existence of PdO nanoparticles and Cu single atoms via tandem catalysis, the PdCu/Z&#8208;5 catalyst exhibited a high oxygenates yield of 1178&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1Pd&#8201;h&#8722;1 (mmol of oxygenates per gram Pd per hour) and at the same time high oxygenates selectivity of up to 95&#8201;%. Control experiments and mechanistic studies revealed that PdO nanoparticles promoted the in situ generation of H2O2 from O2 and H2, while Cu single atoms not only accelerated the activation of H2O2 for the generation of abundant hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) from H2O2 decomposition, but also enabled the homolytic cleavage of CH4 by &#8901;OH to methyl radicals (&#8901;CH3). Subsequently, the &#8901;OH reacted quickly with the &#8901;CH3 to form CH3OH with high selectivity.

         <title>A Hierarchical (Macro)molecular Assembly Assisted by Donor&#8211;Acceptor Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions Exhibiting Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;transfer interactions aid the formation of the tertiary structure of an aromatic acceptor&#8208;appended polymer. The presence of an aromatic donor produces an organogel with nanotubular morphology, which exhibits room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity.







Abstract
This communication reveals co&#8208;assembly of an electron&#8208;deficient naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI)&#8208;appended polyurethane (P1) and electron&#8208;rich pyrene (Py), forming an organogel with prominent room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity. In a non&#8208;polar medium, intra&#8208;chain hydrogen&#8208;bonding among the urethane groups of P1 produces a folded structure with an array of the NDIs in the periphery, which intercalate Py by charge&#8208;transfer (CT)&#8208;interaction. Such CT&#8208;complexation enables slow crystallization of the peripheral hydrocarbons, causing gelation with nanotubular morphology, in which the wall consists of the alternating NDI&#8722;Py stack. Such D&#8208;A assembly exhibits ferroelectricity (saturation polarization Ps&#8776;0.8&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and coercive field Ec&#8776;8&#8197;kV&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 500&#8197;V and 10&#8197;Hz frequency) with Curie temperature (Tc) of &#8776;350&#8197;K, which can be related to the disassembly of the CT&#8208;complex. In the absence of Py, P1 forms spherical aggregates, showing dielectric behaviour.

         <title>Electrophilic Spirocyclization of a 2&#8208;Biphenylacetylene via Conformational Fixing within a Hollow&#8208;Cage Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective spirocyclization of a 2&#8208;biphenyl acetylene was achieved by virtue of a spatial constraint in a self&#8208;assembled molecular cage. The unusual, folded conformation in the cavity alters the selectivity of the electrophilic cyclization from 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig to 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig to form a hindered spiro compound. NBS= N&#8208;bromosuccinimide; NIS= N&#8208;iodosuccinimide.







Abstract
A 2&#8208;biphenylacetylene was fixed into a specific conformation within the confined cavity of a hollow cage, where it underwent a regioselective spirocyclization in the presence of an electrophile. A 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization proceeded selectively in the cage, which stands in sharp contrast to the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization that normally occurs in common organic media. The folded conformation adopted by the substrate within the cage was examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis.

         <title>Catalytic Degradation of Polyethylene Terephthalate Using a Phase&#8208;Transitional Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) UiO&#8208;66 catalyzes the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into monomers. During the degradation process, UiO&#8208;66 transforms into another Zr&#8208;MOF MIL&#8208;140 which also shows good catalytic reactivity for the degradation of PET.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is utilized as one of the most popular consumer plastics worldwide, but difficulties associated with recycling PET have generated a severe environmental crisis with most PET ending its lifecycle in landfills. We report that zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) UiO&#8208;66 deconstructs waste PET into the building blocks terephthalic acid (TA) and mono&#8208;methyl terephthalate (MMT) within 24&#8197;hours at 260&#8201;&#176;C (total yield of 98&#8201;% under 1&#8197;atm H2 and 81&#8201;% under 1&#8197;atm Ar). Extensive structural characterization studies reveal that during the degradation process, UiO&#8208;66 undergoes an intriguing transformation into MIL&#8208;140A, which is another Zr&#8208;MOF that shows good catalytic activity toward PET degradation under similar reaction conditions. These results illustrate the diversity of applications for Zr&#8208;MOFs and establish MOFs as a new class of polymer degradation catalysts with the potential to address long&#8208;standing challenges associated with plastic waste.

         <title>A Biostable L&#8208;DNA Hydrogel with Improved Stability for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA hydrogels have attracted more and more attentions due to their excellent permeability, high mechanical strength together with thixotropy, versatile programmability and good biocompatibility. However, the moderate biostability and immune stimulation of DNA arose as big concerns for future potential clinical applications. Here, we reported a novel l&#8208;DNA hydrogel by self&#8208;assembly, which inherited the extraordinary physical properties of d&#8208;DNA hydrogel. With the mirror&#8208;isomerized deoxyribose, this hydrogel exhibited improved biostability, which withstood fetal bovine serum (FBS) at least one month without obviously decay on its mechanical properties. Low inflammatory response of l&#8208;DNA hydrogel has been verified both  in vitro  and  in vivo  . Hence, this l&#8208;DNA hydrogel with outstanding biostability and biocompatibility can be anticipated to serve as an ideal 3D cell culture matrix and implanted bio&#8208;scaffold for long&#8208;term biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Bioisosteres: Divergent Synthesis of Azabicyclohexanes and Cyclobutenyl Amines from Bicyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of two divergent and complementary Lewis acid catalyzed additions of bicyclobutanes to imines is described. Microscale high&#8208;throughput experimentation was integral to the discovery and optimization of both reactions.  N  &#8208;arylimines undergo formal (3+2) cycloaddition with bicyclobutanes to yield azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes in a single step; in contrast,  N  &#8208;alkylimines undergo an addition/elimination sequence to generate cyclobutenyl methanamine products with high diastereoselectivity. These new products contain a variety of synthetic handles for further elaboration, including many functional groups relevant to pharmaceutical synthesis. The divergent reactivity observed is attributed to differences in basicity and nucleophilicity of the nitrogen atom in a common carbocation intermediate, leading to either nucleophilic attack (  N  &#8208;aryl) or E1 elimination (  N  &#8208;alkyl).</dc:description>

         <title>A Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Machine Controls K+ Channel Transport and Induces Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of artificial ion channels with high activity, selectivity and gating function is challenging. Herein, we designed the light&#8208;driven motor molecule  MC2  , which provides new design criteria to overcome these challenges.  MC2  forms a selective K  +  channel through a single molecular transmembrane mechanism, and the light&#8208;driven rotary motion significantly accelerates ion transport, which endows the irradiated motor molecule with excellent cytotoxicity and cancer cell selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the rotary motion of  MC2  promotes K  +  efflux, generates reactive oxygen species and eventually activates caspase&#8208;3&#8208;dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. Combined with the spatiotemporally controllable advantages of light, we believe this strategy can be exploited in the structural design and application of next&#8208;generation synthetic cation transporters for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered Organic Metal Chalcogenides (OMCs): from Bulk to 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The modification of inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with organic functional motifs is in high demanded for the optimization of their pristine properties, but it is still a daunting challenge. Organic metal chalcogenides (OMCs) are a type of newly&#8208;emerging 2D materials, with metal chalcogenide layers covalently anchored by long&#8208;range ordered organic functional motifs, which are extremely desirable but impossible to achieve in traditional 2D materials. Both the inorganic layer and organic functional motifs of OMCs are highly designable and thus provide this type of 2D materials with enormous varieties on their structure and property. This review aims to review the latest developments in OMCs and their bulk precursors. Firstly, the structure types of the bulk precursors for OMCs are introduced. Second, the synthesis and applications of OMC 2D materials in photoelectricity, catalysis, sensors, and energy transfer are explored. Finally, the remarks on the challenges and perspectives for future research on OMCs are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Ligand&#8208;Controlled Remote para&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Activation and Borylation of Twisted Aromatic Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method of para selective borylation of aromatic amides is described. The borylation proceeded via an unprecedented substrate&#8211;ligand distortion between the twisted aromatic amides and a newly designed ligand framework (defa) that is different from the traditionally used ligand (dtbpy) for the C&#8211;H borylation reactions. The designed ligand framework (defa) has led to the development of a new type of catalytic system that shows excellent para selectivity for a range of aromatic amides. Moreover, the designed ligand has shown excellent reactivity and selectivity for a range of heterocyclic aromatic amides. The identification of key transition states and intermediates using the DFT computations associated with the three regio&#8208;isomeric pathways revealed that the most efficient catalytic pathway with the defa ligand leads to the para borylation while in the case of bpy the borylation at the para and meta sites compete.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Catalytic Route to Polymerizable Bicyclic Cyclic Carbonate Monomers from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new catalytic route has been developed for the coupling of epoxides and CO2 affording polymerizable six&#8208;membered bicyclic carbonates. Cyclic epoxides equipped with a b&#8208;positioned OH group can be transformed into structurally diverse bicyclic cyclic carbonates in good yields and with high selectivity. Key to the chemo&#8208;selectivity is the difference between the reactivity of syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;configured epoxy alcohols, with the latter leading to six&#8208;membered ring carbonate formation in the presence of a binary Al(III) aminotriphenolate complex/DIPEA catalyst. X&#8208;ray analyses show that the conversion of the syn&#8208;configured substrate evolves via a standard double inversion pathway providing a five&#8208;membered carbonate product, whereas the anti&#8208;isomer allows for activation of the oxirane unit of the substrate opposite to the pendent alcohol. The potential use of these bicyclic products is shown in ring&#8208;opening polymerization offering access to rigid polycarbonates with improved thermal resistance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible organic crystals with unique mechanical properties and excellent optical properties are of paramount significance for their wide applications in various research fields such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. &#160;However, low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant flexible organic crystal with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) ability has never been reported. Herein, chiral organic crystals with CPL activity and low&#8208;temperature flexibility (77 K) are fabricated by the solvent diffusion method from chiral Schiff bases, S(R)&#8208;4&#8208;  b  romo&#8208;2&#8208;(((1&#8208;  p  henyl  e  thyl)imino)  m  ethyl)  p  henol (S(R)&#8208;BPEMP). The corresponding chiroptical properties for the two enantiomeric crystals were thoroughly investigated, including the measurements of circular dichroism (CD) and CPL. &#160;To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight flexible organic crystals with CPL activity, and we believe that the results will give a new impetus to the research of organic crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetracoordinate Boron&#8208;Based Multifunctional Chiral Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Amphiphilic Polycarbonate Micellar Rhenium Catalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A triblock amphiphilic polymer derived from the copolymerization of CO  2  and epoxides containing a bipyridine rhenium complex in its backbone is shown to effectively catalyze the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of CO  2  to CO. This polymer provides uniformly spherical micelles in aqueous solution, where the metal catalyst is sequestered in the hydrophobic portion of the nanostructured micelle. CO  2  to CO reduction occurs in an efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven process in aqueous media with turnover numbers up to 110 (&gt; 99% selectivity) in the absence of a photosensitizer, which is a 37&#8208;fold enhancement over the corresponding molecular rhenium catalyst in organic solvent. Notably, the amphiphilic polycarbonate micelle rhenium catalyst suppresses H  2  generation, presumably by preventing deactivation of the active catalytic center by water.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Nitrate Treatment for Constructing Integrated Surface Structures to Mitigate Capacity Fading and Voltage Decay of Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capacity fading and voltage decay is one of the most obstacle for the practical application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides due to the serious surface&#8208;related detrimental reactions. Herein, we develop a versatile and scalable method to construct a robust surface integrated structure. All the designed samples deliver very outstanding capacity and voltage stability, among which the Zn&#8208;treated sample possesses the best electrochemical performance. Its capacity retention is larger than 90% after 400 cycles with a voltage decay ratio as small as 0.73 mV per cycle. What is more, the rule of surface integrated structure with different cations on capacity and voltage stability is further deciphered by combining with density function theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that, to obtain an advanced Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, cations in Li&#8208;sites should firstly ensure the binding energy of the surface integrated structure in a lower level and then provide Bader charge for the nearest O atoms as small as possible.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfate&#8208;Enabled Nitrate Synthesis from Nitrogen Electrooxidation  on Rh Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to nitrate gains increasing attention as an alternative approach to conventional high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;pressure manufacture industry. But, current progress in NOR is limited by the difficulties in activation and conversion of strong N&#8801;N bond (941 kJ mol  &#8208;1  ). Here, we designed to utilize sulfate to enhance NOR performance over Rh electrocatalyst. After the addition of sulfate, the inert Rh nanoparticles exhibited superior NOR performance with a nitrate yield of 168.0 &#956;mol g  cat  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  . The  15  N isotope&#8208;labeling experiment proved the produced nitrate from nitrogen electrooxidation. A series of electrochemical  in situ  characterizations and theoretical calculation unveiled that sulfate promoted nitrogen adsorption and decreased the reaction energy barrier, and  in situ  formed sulfate radicals reduced the activation energy of the potential&#8208;determining step, thus accerlerating NOR.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Dewar benzenes, the metastable valence isomers of benzenes, have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. In contrast, little is known about Dewar metallabenzenes having a transition metal in the skeletal framework, despite the recent intensive interest in the development of chemistry of metallabenzenes. Herein, we report the isolation and characterization of the first examples of structurally characterized Dewar metallabenzenes. These compounds were generated via unprecedented reactions of metallacyclobutadienes with aminoalkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Dissolved Ni2+ on Solid Electrolyte Interphase of Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dissolution of transition metal ions, such as Ni  2+  , Mn  2+  , from layered&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;rich cathode can migrate to the anode side and aggravate the electrochemical polarization and capacity degradation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The investigations of the impact and distribution of Ni species on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode are crucial to understand the failure mechanism of LIBs in this scenario, yet few works have been reported due to the complicated structure of SEI. Herein, we used Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF&#8208;SIMS) technique coupled with multivariate data analysis (MVA) to intuitively characterize the distribution of Ni species in SEI. We find that, in EC&#8208;based electrolyte, SEI on the graphite electrode exhibits a multi&#8208;stratum structure. In contrary to the conventional view, the outer and intermediate stratums are dominated by the decomposition products related with LiPF  6  salt, such as phosphates, fluorophosphates, and LiF, during the formation cycles. After accelerated aging the full cell of LiNi  0.88  Co  0.08  Mn  0.04  O  2  (NCM88)/graphite for 50 cycles, the concentration of Ni dissolved in electrolyte reaches ca. 690 ppm. With multivariate curve resolution analysis of TOF&#8208;SIMS 3D data, a strong correlation between the dissolved&#8208;Ni and organic species in SEI on graphite is illustrated. The ion exchange reaction between Ni  2+  and Li  +  in SEI is demonstrated to be the main reason for the increase of SEI resistivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying the Electrocatalytic Selectivity of Oxidation Reactions with Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#8216;solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer&#8217; (SCILL) is an extremely successful new concept in heterogeneous catalysis. The idea is to boost the selectivity of a catalyst by its modification with an ionic liquid (IL). Here, we show that it is possible to use the same concept in electrocatalysis for the selective transformation of organic compounds. We scrutinize the electrooxidation of 2,3&#8208;butane&#173;diol, a reaction which yields two products, singly oxidized acetoin and doubly oxidized diacetyl. When adding the IL (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolium trifluormethanesulfonate, [C  2  C  1  Im][OTf]), the selectivity for acetoin increases drastically. By in&#8208;situ spectros&#173;copy, we analyze the underlying mechanism: Specific adsorption of the IL anions suppresses the activation of water for the second oxidation step and, thus, enhances the selectivity for acetoin. Our study demonstrates the great potential of this approach for selective transformation of organic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Recycling of Poly(Cyclohexene Carbonate) Using a Di&#8208;Mg(II) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical recycling of polymers to true monomers is pivotal for a circular plastics economy. Here, the first catalyzed chemical recycling of the widely investigated carbon dioxide derived polymer, poly(cyclohexene carbonate), to cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide is reported. The reaction requires dinuclear catalysis, with the di&#8208;Mg(II) catalyst showing both high monomer selectivity (&gt;98%) and activity (TOF = 150 h  &#8208;1  , 0.33 mol %, 120 &#176;C). The depolymerization occurs via a chain&#8208;end catalyzed depolymerization mechanism and DFT calculations indicate the high selectivity arises from Mg&#8208;alkoxide catalyzed epoxide extrusion being kinetically favorable compared to cyclic carbonate formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Amine&#8208;Catalyzed Copper&#8208;Mediated C&#8211;H Sulfonylation of Benzaldehydes via a Transient Imine Directing Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transient directing groups (TDGs) can provide a powerful means for C&#8211;H functionalization without requiring additional steps for directing group introduction and removal. We report the first use of a TDG in combination with copper to effect C&#8211;H functionalization. The regioselective copper mediated &#946;&#8211;C(sp2)&#8211;H sulfonylation of aldehydes with sulfinate salts is accomplished using catalytic &#946;&#8208;alanine to form a transient imine. A broad range of sulfonylated benzaldehydes are prepared using copper fluoride as both copper source and oxidant, involving a [5,6] cupracyclic intermediate. &#947;&#8208;(peri)&#8208;Sulfonylation of napthyl and phenanthrenyl carboxaldehydes is achieved through [6,6] cupracyclic intermediates. Further derivatisation of the aldehyde products is demonstrated. Kinetic experiments and Hammett analysis suggest the turnover limiting step to be a concerted asynchronous C&#8211;H cleavage via a dearomative Wheland&#8208;type transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>Partial Metalation of Porphyrin Moieties in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks Provides Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In natural photosynthesis, the architecture of multiprotein integrates more numerous chromophores than redox centers and simultaneously creates well&#8208;controlled environment around active site. Herein, we demonstrate that these features can be emulated in a prototype hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) through simply varying the proportion of metalated porphyrin in structure. Further studies demonstrate that changing the metalloporphyrin content not only realizes a fine tuning on the photosensitizer/catalyst ratio, but also alters the microenvironment surrounding active site and the charge separation efficiency. As a result, the obtained material achieves the challenging overall CO2&#160;reduction with a high HCOOH production rate (29.8 &#956;mol/g/h, scavenger free), standing out from existing competitors. This work unveils that the degree of metalation is vital to the catalytic activity of porphryinic framework, presenting as a new strategy to optimize the performance of heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating the Water Dissociation Electrocatalytic Sites of Bimetallic Ni&#8208;based Alloy for Highly&#8208;Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal alloys are currently drawing increasing attention as promising alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts due to their unique advantages. However, traditional density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;derived  d  &#8208;band theory fails to describe the hydrogen adsorption energy (&#916;  G  H  ) on hollow sites. Herein, by studying the &#916;  G  H  for a series of Ni&#8208;M (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Mo, W) bimetallic alloys, an improved  d  &#8208;band center is provided by considering multi&#8208;metals&#8208;H bonds cooperative effect as a dependable descriptor of hydrogen adsorption energy, and screen out a potential NiCu HER electrocatalyst with a near&#8208;optimal &#916;  G  H  . Moreover, oxygen atoms were introduced into Ni&#8208;M (O&#8208;NiM) to balance the adsorption/desorption of *OH, the tailored water dissociation electrocatalytic sites can synergistically accelerate the multi&#8208;step alkaline HER. Direct experimental evidence is offered that O&#8208;NiCu possesses the optimum HER activity with ultralow overpotentials of 23 and 69 mV to obtain current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm  &#8208;2  , respectively, which is much lower than those of noble metal Pt/C and reported electrocatalysts. The micro&#8208;kinetics analysis and DFT calculations further affirm the energetic alkaline HER kinetic process. This work not only broadens the applicability of  d  &#8208;band theory, but provides crucial understanding in designing efficient alkaline HER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomacromolecule&#8208;fueled Transient Volume Phase Transition of a Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metabolic cycle&#8208;inspired hydrogel which exhibits the biomacromolecule&#8208;fueled transient volume phase transition is reported. This hydrogel has the affinity and digestive capacity for a fuel &#945;&#8208;poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine by introducing acrylic acid and trypsin. The hydrogel captured fuel and transiently shrank owing to the construction of electrostatic cross&#8208;linkages. This process was inherently connected with the digestion of these cross&#8208;linkages and the release of oligo&#8208;lysine as waste, which induced the reswelling of the hydrogel at equilibrium. The transient volume change of the hydrogel realized the fuel&#8208;stimulated transient release of a payload. This study provides a strategy for engineering materials with biomacromolecule&#8208;fueled dynamic functions under the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium condition.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Selenide Catalyst for the Activation of Alkenes through&#160;Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonding catalysis with divalent chalcogenides required using heteroatoms as electron donors to give reactivity, while the activation of hydrocarbons such as alkenes by this concept remains an unresolved challenge. Herein, we discovered a powerful selenide catalyst that showed unprecedented capability in the activation of alkenes. The Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; interactions were capable of catalyzing a broad range of transformations, including intermolecular cyclization and coupling reactions. Significantly, Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bonding activation mode can be exploited to achieve intermolecular enyne cyclizations and controlled cross coupling of triple alkenes. The activation of alkenes by divalent selenides opens up a new avenue for supramolecular catalysis.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a novel strategy based on Te4+/Ln3+ (Ln = Er, Nd, and Yb) co&#8208;doping to achieve efficient NIR luminescence in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6 phosphors, which are excitable by a low&#8208;cost near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) chip. Through sensitization by the spin&#8208;orbital allowed 1S0 &#8594; 3P1 transition of Te4+, intense and multi&#8208;wavelength NIR luminescence originating from the 4f &#8594; 4f transitions of Er3+, Nd3+, and Yb3+ was acquired, with a quantum yield of 6.1% for the Er3+ emission. These findings provide a general approach to achieve efficient NIR emission in lead&#8208;free metal halides through ns2&#8208;metal and lanthanide ion co&#8208;doping, thereby opening up a new avenue for exploring NIR&#8208;emitting perovskite derivatives towards versatile applications such as NIR&#8208;LEDs and bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustaining Electron Transfer Pathways Extends Biohybrid Photoelectrode Stability to Years</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The viability of biohybrid technologies is primarily limited by the inherent fragility of the biological component. The operational stability of photoproteins adsorbed to mesoporous ITO electrodes is prolonged to 33&#8197;days under intense illumination, and 28&#8197;months in storage, demonstrating the feasibility of protein&#8208;based devices that last years.







Abstract
The exploitation of natural photosynthetic enzymes in semi&#8208;artificial devices constitutes an attractive and potentially sustainable route for the conversion of solar energy into electricity and solar fuels. However, the stability of photosynthetic proteins after incorporation in a biohybrid architecture typically limits the operational lifetime of biophotoelectrodes to a few hours. Here, we demonstrate ways to greatly enhance the stability of a mesoporous electrode coated with the RC&#8208;LH1 photoprotein from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. By preserving electron transfer pathways, we extended operation under continuous high&#8208;light to 33&#8197;days, and operation after storage to over two years. Coupled with large photocurrents that reached peak values of 4.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the optimized biophotoelectrode produced a cumulative output of 86&#8197;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the largest reported performance to date. Our results demonstrate that the factor limiting stability is the architecture surrounding the photoprotein, and that biohybrid sensors and photovoltaic devices with operational lifetimes of years are feasible.

         <title>Hydrophobization Engineering of the Air&#8211;Cathode Catalyst for Improved Oxygen Diffusion towards Efficient Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic&#8208;inspired hydrophobization engineering of electrocatalysts is developed to enable the formation of more three&#8208;phase reaction interfaces and promoted oxygen diffusion on an air cathode, achieving enhanced electrocatalytic efficiency toward zinc&#8211;air battery with higher energy density in comparison with that employing the air cathode without hydrophobic surface design.







Abstract
Poor oxygen diffusion at multiphase interfaces in an air cathode suppresses the energy densities of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Developing effective strategies to tackle the issue is of great significance for overcoming the performance bottleneck. Herein, inspired by the bionics of diving flies, a polytetrafluoroethylene layer was coated on the surfaces of Co3O4 nanosheets (NSs) grown on carbon cloth (CC) to create a hydrophobic surface to enable the formation of more three&#8208;phase reaction interfaces and promoted oxygen diffusion, rendering the hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode a higher limiting current density (214&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#8197;V) than that (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) of untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC electrode. Consequently, the assembled ZAB employing hydrophobic&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode acquired a higher power density (171&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) than that (102&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) utilizing untreated&#8208;Co3O4 NSs/CC cathode, proving the enhanced interfacial reaction kinetics on air cathode benefiting from the hydrophobization engineering.

         <title>Strong Circularly&#8208;Polarized Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from a Feasibly Separable Scaffold of Bidibenzo[b,d]furan with Locked Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasibly separable bidibenzofuran compound exhibits strong circularly&#8208;polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) when doping into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The silica&#8208;gel column can separate the absolute chiral R&#8208;isomer. The treated PVA films have a RTP efficiency of 14.8&#8201;%, a largest glum of 0.12, and a lifetime of 0.56&#8197;s. The impressive results indicate that the locked axial chirality skeleton endows the potential of achieving superior circularly&#8208;polarized emission for the small molecules.







Abstract
Novel accessible scaffold featuring circularly&#8208;polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is attractive but challenging. Herein, we report a new feasibly separable bidibenzo[b,d]furan compound with strong circularly&#8208;polarized RTP when doping into the rigid polymer matrix. The simple silica&#8208;gel column can separate the absolute chiral R&#8208;isomer with excellent chiroptical properties. The experimental data reveal that the treated films exhibit an RTP efficiency of 14.8&#8201;%, a largest dissymmetric factor of 0.12, and a longest lifetime of 0.56&#8197;s under ambient conditions. It is found that reducing the nonradiative decays boosts the intrinsic circularly&#8208;polarized RTP emission. The impressive results indicate that the locked axial chirality skeleton endows the potential of achieving superior circularly&#8208;polarized emission for the small organic optoelectronic molecules.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Adaptive Capillarity Enabling Densified 3D Printing for Ultra&#8208;High Areal and Volumetric Energy Density Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface&#8208;adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for fabrication of highly loaded supercapacitors. Coupling with controllable capillary densification, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.







Abstract
Endowing supercapacitors with higher energy density is of great practical significance but remains extremely challenging. In this work, an innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface&#8208;adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for the first time. The printable ink formulated with pyrrole surface&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide renders the printed electrodes excellent surface tension regulability to the subsequent capillary densification, creating an intensely condensed electrode with well&#8208;maintained structural integrity. Furthermore, simultaneous in situ nitrogen doping and hierarchical micro&#8211;meso porosity are readily realized upon post&#8208;carbonization, encouraging enhanced capacitance and fast reaction dynamics. As a result, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective (3+2) Annulation of Vinylcyclopropanes with Imines for the Synthesis of Chiral Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopropanes are important synthetic building blocks in organic chemistry. In this study, the first phosphine&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective (3+2) annulation between vinylcyclopropanes and N&#8208;tosylaldimines was achieved, which led to the formation of a range of highly functionalized pyrrolidines in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective and diastereoselective (up to 98&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) (3+2) annulation between vinylcyclopropanes and N&#8208;tosylaldimines has been developed, which allows facile access to a range of highly functionalized chiral pyrrolidines. Notably, this method makes use of vinylcyclopropanes as a synthon for phosphine&#8208;mediated asymmetric annulation reaction, which will offer new opportunities for potential applications of cyclopropanes substrates in phosphine&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Expeditious Synthesis of Diblock Copolymers with Different Morphologies by Lewis Pair Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful application of Lewis pair polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly enabled the expeditious, single&#8208;step synthesis of well&#8208;defined diblock copolymeric nano&#8208;assemblies with different morphologies from acrylate and methacrylate mixture in minutes.







Abstract
Lewis pair polymerization has demonstrated its unique advantages and powerful capability in polymer synthesis. Here we employ strong nucleophilic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) and bulky organoaluminum to construct a frustrated Lewis pair, which can realize the compounded sequence control (CSC) copolymerization and self&#8208;assembly the mixture of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate and fluoride&#8208;functionalized methacrylate into diblock copolymers (di&#8208;BCPs) nano&#8208;assemblies through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly in one&#8208;pot, single&#8208;step manner within minutes. These di&#8208;BCPs were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, GPC, DSC, and TEM. By utilizing appropriate solvophilic block and solvophobic block, such Lewis pair polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy enables the expeditious, room&#8208;temperature synthesis of di&#8208;BCP nanoparticles with different morphologies, including spheres, worms, vesicles, and even fibers, thus suggesting the great application potential of such method in the future.

         <title>Anionic Cyanine J&#8208;Type Aggregate Nanoparticles with Enhanced Photosensitization for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, anionic cyanines are designed as the phototherapy agents by controlling their aggregates through counterion engineering. The resulting J&#8208;type aggregate nanoparticles show NIR emission, high photostability, negatively charge surface, mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, and significantly enhanced singlet oxygen generation efficiency, leading to efficient antitumor phototherapy efficacy.







Abstract
Cyanines have been widely used as the photosensitizers (PSs) in the biomedical field, but controlling their molecular aggregates in nanoparticles (NPs) remains a major challenge. Moreover, the impact of aggregate behaviors of cyanines on the photosensitization is still unclear. Herein, the first anionic cyanine PSs based on a tricyanofuran end group have been designed by achieving supramolecular J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs via counterion engineering. Our results indicate that J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs can not only bring significantly red&#8208;shifted emission, negatively charged surface, and high photostability, but also enable a significant 5&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen generation efficiency compared to that in the nonaggregate state, providing strong experimental evidence for the superiority of J&#8208;aggregates in enhancing photosensitization. Thus, combined with the mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, the J&#8208;type aggregate NPs show remarkable in vivo antitumor phototheranostic efficacy, making them have a potential for clinical use.

         <title>Intermolecular Carbosilylation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins with C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) Bond Formation Involving Silylium&#8208;Ion Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically unhindered silylium ions can initiate the silylalkynylation of terminal alkenes with silylated phenylacetylene derivatives in a two&#8208;component reaction. These alkynylsilanes and the silylium&#8208;ion initiator form bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocations as the actual catalysts (gray box). This new carbosilylation enables the formation of a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bond (see scheme).







Abstract
A regioselective addition of alkynylsilanes across unactivated, terminal alkenes is reported. The reaction is initiated by the capture of a sterically unhindered silylium ion by a silylated phenylacetylene derivative to form a bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocation. This in situ&#8208;generated key intermediate is the actual catalyst that maintains the catalytic cycle by a series of electrophilic addition reactions of silylium ions and &#946;&#8208;silicon&#8208;stabilized carbocations. The computed reaction mechanism is fully consistent with the experimental findings. This unprecedented two&#8208;component carbosilylation establishes a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bond and a C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond in atom&#8208;economic fashion.

         <title>Prodrugs of Persulfide and Sulfide: Is There a Pharmacological Difference between the Two in the Context of Rapid Exchanges among Various Sulfur Species In Vivo?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of sulfur species prodrugs (reactive sulfur species in a capsule) that can release pure hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and hydrogen persulfide (H2S2) were used by Bowen Ke et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202201668) to compare the pharmacological differences between sulfide and persulfide. H2S2 prodrug exhibits increased activities and reduced toxicity as compared to H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.

         <title>Dual In Situ Laser Techniques Underpin the Role of Cations in Impacting Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ Raman spectroscopy and the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique elucidated the fact that the nature of alkali metal cations can significantly influence the oxygen evolution activity of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework derived NiFe(OOH) electrocatalyst, following the order of Cs+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+.







Abstract
Understanding the electrode/electrolyte interface is crucial for optimizing electrocatalytic performances. Here, we demonstrate that the nature of alkali metal cations can profoundly impact the oxygen evolution activity of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) derived electrocatalysts, which are based on NiFe(OOH). In situ Raman spectroscopy results show that Raman shifts of the Ni&#8722;O bending vibration are inversely proportional to the mass activities from Cs+ to Li+. Particularly, a laser&#8208;induced current transient technique was introduced to study the cation&#8208;dependent electric double layer properties and their effects on the activity. The catalytic trend appeared to be closely related to the potential of maximum entropy of the system, suggesting a strong cation impact on the interfacial water layer structure. Our results highlight how the electrolyte composition can be used to maximize the performance of SURMOF derivatives toward electrochemical water splitting.

&lt;p&gt;In situ Raman spectroscopy and the laser-induced current transient (LICT) technique elucidated the fact that the nature of alkali metal cations can significantly influence the oxygen evolution activity of surface-mounted metal&#8211;organic framework derived NiFe(OOH) electrocatalyst, following the order of Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;gt;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;gt;Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the electrode/electrolyte interface is crucial for optimizing electrocatalytic performances. Here, we demonstrate that the nature of alkali metal cations can profoundly impact the oxygen evolution activity of surface-mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) derived electrocatalysts, which are based on NiFe(OOH). In situ Raman spectroscopy results show that Raman shifts of the Ni&#8722;O bending vibration are inversely proportional to the mass activities from Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Particularly, a laser-induced current transient technique was introduced to study the cation-dependent electric double layer properties and their effects on the activity. The catalytic trend appeared to be closely related to the potential of maximum entropy of the system, suggesting a strong cation impact on the interfacial water layer structure. Our results highlight how the electrolyte composition can be used to maximize the performance of SURMOF derivatives toward electrochemical water splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution NMR H/D Exchange of Human Superoxide Dismutase Inclusion Bodies Reveals Significant Native Features Despite Structural Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Measurements of quenched hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange by NMR, FTIR, and Congo red binding provide a rare, high&#8208;resolution view of the inclusion body (IB) structure at the atomic level. Diverse mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) adopt remarkably similar IB structures comprising an ensemble with some amyloid&#8208;like structure together with extensive native&#8208;like conformations.







Abstract
Protein aggregation is central to aging, disease and biotechnology. While there has been recent progress in defining structural features of cellular protein aggregates, many aspects remain unclear due to heterogeneity of aggregates presenting obstacles to characterization. Here we report high&#8208;resolution analysis of cellular inclusion bodies (IBs) of immature human superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutants using NMR quenched amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (qHDX), FTIR and Congo red binding. The extent of aggregation is correlated with mutant global stability and, notably, the free energy of native dimer dissociation, indicating contributions of native&#8208;like monomer associations to IB formation. This is further manifested by a common pattern of extensive protection against H/D exchange throughout nine mutant SOD1s despite their diverse characteristics. These results reveal multiple aggregation&#8208;prone regions in SOD1 and illuminate how aggregation may occur via an ensemble of pathways.

         <title>An Anionic Dinuclear Ruthenium Dihydrogen Complex of Relevance for Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic and neutral non&#8208;classical &#963;&#8208;H2 complexes are plentiful, but anionic ones remain exceedingly rare. It was during an investigation into the fate of a Ru&#8208;precatalyst in the light&#8208;driven alkyne gem&#8208;hydrogenation that such a species was encountered, which seems to be &#8220;first&#8208;in&#8208;class&#8221;: it lacks any substructures that counteract the negative charge and prevent oxidative insertion of the metal centers into the ligated H&#8722;H bond from occurring.







Abstract
During an investigation into the fate of ruthenium precatalysts used for light&#8208;driven alkyne gem&#8208;hydrogenation reactions with formation of Grubbs&#8208;type ruthenium catalysts, it was found that the reaction of [(IPr)(&#951;6&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] with H2 under UV&#8208;irradiation affords an anionic dinuclear &#963;&#8208;dihydrogen complex, which is thermally surprisingly robust. Not only are anionic &#963;&#8208;complexes in general exceedingly rare, but the newly formed species seems to be the first example lacking any structural attributes able to counterbalance the negative charge and, in so doing, prevent oxidative insertion of the metal centers into the ligated H2 from occurring.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Starfish Cyclic Steroid Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by de novo construction of the ether&#8208;linked hexopyranosyl units, the use of olefinic pyranoses as sugar precursors, and a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing glycosylation, the major starfish cyclic steroid glycosides, namely luzonicoside&#8197;A and D and sepositoside&#8197;A, have been synthesized for the first time.







Abstract
Starfishes have evolved with a special type of secondary metabolites, namely starfish saponins, to ward off various predators and parasites; among them, the starfish cyclic steroid glycosides stand out structurally, featuring a unique 16&#8208;membered ring formed by bridging the steroidal C3 and C6 with a trisaccharide. The rigid cyclic scaffold and the congested and vulnerable steroid&#8208;sugar etherate linkage present an unprecedented synthetic challenge. Here we report a collective total synthesis of the major starfish cyclic steroid glycosides, namely luzonicosides&#8197;A (1) and D (2) and sepositoside&#8197;A (3), with an innovative approach, which entails a de novo construction of the ether&#8208;linked hexopyranosyl units, use of olefinic pyranoses as sugar precursors, and a decisive ring&#8208;closing glycosylation under the mild gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.

         <title>Dismutation of Tricyanoboryllead Compounds: The Homoleptic Tetrakis(tricyanoboryl)plumbate Tetraanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricyanoborylplumbate anions have been obtained and isolated as thermally robust salts. The tetrakis(tricyanoboryl)plumbate tetraanion [Pb{B(CN)3}4]4&#8722; was obtained from [EtPbB(CN)3]&#8722; by stepwise dismutation in water or hydrochloric acid via [Et2Pb{B(CN)3}2]2&#8722; and [EtPb{B(CN)3}3]3&#8722;.







Abstract
A series of unprecedently air&#8208;stable (tricyanoboryl)plumbate anions was obtained by the reaction of the boron&#8208;centered nucleophile B(CN)32&#8722; with triorganyllead halides. Salts of the anions [R3PbB(CN)3]&#8722; (R=Ph, Et) were isolated and found to be stable in air at room temperature. In the case of Me3PbHal (Hal=Cl, Br), a mixture of the anions [Me4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=1, 2) was obtained. The [Et3PbB(CN)3]&#8722; ion undergoes stepwise dismutation in aqueous solution to yield the plumbate anions [Et4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=1&#8211;4) and PbEt4 as by&#8208;product. The reaction rate increases with decreasing pH value of the aqueous solution or by bubbling O2 through the reaction mixture. Adjustment of the conditions allowed the selective formation and isolation of salts of all anions of the series [Et4&#8722;nPb{B(CN)3}n]n&#8722; (n=2&#8211;4) including the homoleptic tetraanion [Pb{B(CN)3}4]4&#8722;.

         <title>Synergistic Generation and Accumulation of Triplet Excitons for Efficient Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic effect of generation and accumulation of triplet excitons, an efficient UOP molecule (2Br&#8208;OSPh), which exhibits a fast rate of intersystem crossing and a small energy gap between monomeric phosphorescence and aggregated state phosphorescence has been synthesized with the longest lifetime and brightest UOP among its isomers.







Abstract
The traditional method to achieve ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) is to hybrid n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* configurations in appropriate proportion, which are contradictory to each other for improving efficiency and lifetime of phosphorescence. In this work, through replacing the electron&#8208;donating aromatic group with a methoxy group and combining intramolecular halogen bond to promote intersystem crossing and suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, an efficient UOP molecule (2Br&#8208;OSPh) has been synthesized with the longest lifetime and brightest UOP among its isomers. As compared to CzS2Br, which has a similar substituted position of bromine atom and a larger kisc (the rate of intersystem crossing), the smaller &#916;ETT* (the energy gap between monomeric phosphorescence and aggregated state phosphorescence) in 2Br&#8208;OSPh could accelerate the transition from T1 to T1*. This research indicates that both generation and accumulation of triplet excitons play an important role in realizing efficient UOP materials.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Corrole&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers are synthesized and are more active and durable than metal corrole monomers for electrocatalytic O2 reduction and evolution reactions. By tuning the metal active site, the Co&#8208;based framework showed the highest activity among examined catalysts. With the benefits of using highly active metal corrole cores, this work presents unparalleled examples of metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based frameworks for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Integrating molecular catalysts into designed frameworks often enables improved catalysis. Compared with porphyrin&#8208;based frameworks, metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based frameworks have been rarely developed, although monomeric metal corroles are usually more efficient than porphyrin counterparts for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report on metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts. M&#8208;POPs (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) were synthesized by coupling metal 10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;(4&#8208;iodophenyl)corrole with tetrakis(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)methane. Compared with metal corrole monomers, M&#8208;POPs displayed significantly enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Co&#8208;POP outperformed other M&#8208;POPs by achieving four&#8208;electron ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87&#8197;V vs. RHE and reaching 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 OER current density at 340&#8197;mV overpotential. This work is unparalleled to develop and explore metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based POPs as electrocatalysts.

         <title>Photoinduced Controlled/Living Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review highlights strategies for photoinduced controlled living radical and cationic polymerization and their combinations for the fabrication of different macromolecular architectures. The wavelength tunability and the advantages of the light&#8208;induced reactions carried out under mild conditions are presented.







Abstract
The application of photochemistry in polymer synthesis is of interest due to the unique possibilities offered compared to thermochemistry, including topological and temporal control, rapid polymerization, sustainable low&#8208;energy processes, and environmentally benign features leading to established and emerging applications in adhesives, coatings, adaptive manufacturing, etc. In particular, the utilization of photochemistry in controlled/living polymerizations often offers the capability for precise control over the macromolecular structure and chain length in addition to the associated advantages of photochemistry. Herein, the latest developments in photocontrolled living radical and cationic polymerizations and their combinations for application in polymer syntheses are discussed. This Review summarizes and highlights recent studies in the emerging area of photoinduced controlled/living polymerizations. A discussion of mechanistic details highlights differences as well as parallels between different systems for different polymerization methods and monomer applicability.

         <title>Atom Swapping on Aromatic Rings: Conversion of Phosphinine Pincer Metal Complexes to Metallabenzenes Triggered by O2 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;swapping method for the synthesis of metallabenzenes, where a phosphorus atom on phosphinine is replaced by a transition metal fragment, is reported by Kyoko Nozaki and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117096). Swapping of the P atom by Rh or Ir proceeded by oxidation of the phosphorous atom and subsequent reductive cleavage of the C&#8722;P bond of the phosphinine ring.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Formal Hydroamination of Allylic Alcohols: A Remarkable Macrocyclic Ligand Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique family of chiral peraza  N  6  &#8208;macrocyclic ligands, which are conformationally rigid and have a tunable saddle&#8208;shaped cavity, is described. Utilizing their manganese(I) complexes, the first example of earth&#8208;abundant transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamination of allylic alcohols was realized, providing a practical access to synthetically important chiral &#947;&#8208;amino alcohols in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield and 97% ee). The single crystal structure of a Mn(I) complex indicates that the manganese atom coordinates with the chiral dialkylamine moiety in a bidentate fashion. Further DFT calculation revealed that five of the six nitrogen atoms in the ligand were engaged in multiple noncovalent interactions with Mn, an isopropanol molecule, and &#946;&#8208;amino ketone intermediate  via  coordination, hydrogen bonding, and/or CH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; interactions in the transition state, showing a remarkable role of the macrocyclic framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Bound Inward&#8208;Growth of Artificial Cytoskeletons and Their Selective Disassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytoskeleton is one of the most important cellular components. Up to now, most of the reported artificial cytoskeletons are based on a gel&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle strategy. Herein, we report a membrane&#8208;bound inward&#8208;growth pathway to prepare cytoskeleton&#8208;like and radially aligned nanofibers grown from capsule membranes to get membrane&#8208;bound artificial cytoskeletons (MACs). The mechanism therein is disclosed thorough the direct observation of the intermediates in both dried and liquid states. Furthermore, the as&#8208;prepared MACs show a selective disassembly behavior in the presence of reductants: both capsule membranes and MACs can be disassembled or only MACs can be disassembled through the selective introduction of dynamic disulfide bonds (DS) into them and by the switch of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The present work has provided a new hierarchical self&#8208;assembly way to construct artificial cytoskeletons with controlled compositions and orientations.</dc:description>

Furthermore, the as-prepared MACs show a selective disassembly behavior in the presence of reductants: both capsule membranes and MACs can be disassembled or only MACs can be disassembled through the selective introduction of dynamic disulfide bonds (DS) into them and by the switch of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The present work has provided a new hierarchical self-assembly way to construct artificial cytoskeletons with controlled compositions and orientations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Active, Reversible, and Irreversible Covalent Inhibitors that Selectively Target the Catalytic Lysine of BCR&#8208;ABL Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent interests in developing lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors, no general approach is available to create such compounds. We report herein a general approach to develop cell&#8208;active covalent inhibitors of protein kinases by targeting the conserved catalytic lysine residue using key SuFEx and salicylaldehyde&#8208;based imine chemistries. We validated the strategy by successfully developing (irreversible and reversible) covalent inhibitors against BCR&#8208;ABL kinase. Our lead compounds showed high levels of selectivity in biochemical assays, exhibited nanomolar potency against endogenous ABL kinase in cellular assays, and were active against most drug&#8208;resistant ABL mutations. Among them, the salicylaldehyde&#8208;containing A5 is the first&#8208;ever reversible covalent ABL inhibitor that possessed time&#8208;dependent ABL inhibition with prolonged residence time and few cellular off&#8208;targets in K562 cells. Bioinformatics further suggested the generality of our strategy against the human kinome.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the development of a method for highly regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselective B&#8211;H bond insertion reactions of &#945;&#8208;silylcarbenes generated from 1&#8208;silylcyclopropenes in the presence of a chiral copper(I)/bisoxazoline catalyst for the construction of chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic gem&#8208;silylboranes, which cannot be prepared by any other known methods. This reaction is the first highly enantioselective carbene insertion reaction of &#945;&#8208;silylcarbenes ever to be reported. The method shows general applicability for various 3,3&#8208;disubstituted silylcyclopropenes and exclusively affords E&#8208;products. The novel chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic gem&#8208;silylborane products are versatile allylic bimetallic reagents with high stability and have great synthetic potential, especially for the construction of complex molecules with continuous chiral centers.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene Analogue: A 2D Nitridene Solid Solution for High Rate Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalysts for high rate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are crucial to clean energy production. Nitrogen&#8208;rich two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal nitride (TMN), designated &#8216;nitridene&#8216;, has shown practically promising HER performance because of unique physical/chemical properties. However, its synthesis is complex because of the sluggish growth kinetics. Here for the first time using a catalytic molten&#8208;salt method, we report a facile synthesis of a V&#8208;Mo bimetallic solid solution, V0.2Mo0.8N1.2, with tunable electrocatalytic property. The molten&#8208;salt synthesis reduces the growth barrier of nitridene and facilitates dissolution of V atoms into 2D lattice via a unique monomer&#8208;assembly, as confirmed by synchrotron spectroscopy and ex&#8208;situ electron microscopy. Electron transfer from V to Mo in V0.2Mo0.8N1.2 leads to an optimized electronic structure for fast protons coupling to produce hydrogen. We conclude that findings offer a quantitative engineering strategy for developing analogues of MXenes for high rate hydrogen production and application in clean energy conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypercoordinated Silicon Anions: Catching Intermediates of Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic hypercoordinated silicates with weak donors were proposed as key intermediates in numerous silicon&#8208;based reactions. However, their short&#8208;lived nature rendered even spectroscopic observations highly challenging. Here, we characterize hyper&#173;coordinated silicon anions, including the first bromido, iodido, formato, acetato, triflato and sulfato silicates. This is enabled by a new, donor&#8208;free polymeric form of Lewis superacidic bis(perchloro&#173;&#173;catecholato)&#173;silane  1  . Spectroscopic, structural, and computational insights allow a reassessment of Gutmann's empirical rules for the role of silicon hypercoordination in synthesis and catalysis. The electronic perturbations of  1  exerted on the bound anions indicate pronounced substrate activation.</dc:description>

The novel 1a and 2b were characterized by NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and also by X&#8208;ray crystallography (r(C=Ge) = 1.865&#197; for 1a and 1.877&#197; for 2b). Nucleophilic addition reaction of 1a with MeI, and a C&#8208;H insertion reaction to the C=Ge bond of 1a, 2a and 2b, are reported.

         <title>Electronically Engineering Water Resistance in Methane Combustion with an Atomically Dispersed Tungsten on PdO Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;resistance of methane combustion catalysts is of vital importance for industrial applications and it is challenging. A stepwise strategy is presented for the preparation of atomically dispersed tungsten species at the catalytically active site (Pd nanoparticles). After an activation process, a Pd&#8211;O&#8211;W1&#8208;like nanocompound is formed on the PdO surface with an atomic scale interface. The resulting supported catalyst possesses much stronger water resistance than the conventional catalysts for methane combustion. The integrated characterization results confirm that catalytic combustion of methane involves water, proceeding via a hydroperoxyl&#8208;promoted reaction mechanism on the catalyst surface. The results of density functional theory calculations indicate an upshift of the d&#8208;band center of palladium caused by electron transfer from atomically dispersed tungsten, which greatly facilitates the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing high energy&#8208;density and actual applications of fibre&#8208;based electrochemical supercapacitors (FESCs) are pivotal but challenging, as the ability to architect advanced fibres for accelerating charges kinetic diffusion and faradic storage remains key bottlenecks. Here, we demonstrate high&#8208;performance FESCs based on hetero&#8208;structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core&#8208;sheath fibres, where the large pseudo&#8208;active polymetallic oxides (PMO) sheath is uniformly loaded on hierarchical porous graphene fibre (PGF) core.&#160;&#160;Due to the abundant micro&#8208;/mesoporous pathways, large accessible surface, excellent redox activity and good interface electron conduction, the PMO&#8208;PGF possesses high areal capacitance (2959.78 mF cm&#8208;2) and manageable faradic reversibility in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the PMO&#8208;PGF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state FESCs present high energy&#8208;density (187.22 &#956;Wh cm&#8208;2), long&#8208;life cycles (95.8% capacitive retention after 20000 cycles), diverse&#8208;powered capabilities and actual energy&#8208;supply applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Polymer Adhesives: Straightforward Synthesis and Strong Substrate Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance adhesives are of great interest in view of industrial demand. We herein identify a straightforward synthetic strategy towards universal hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) polymeric adhesives, using a side&#8208;chain barbiturate (Ba) and Hamilton wedge (HW) functionalized copolymer. Starting from a rubbery copolymer containing thiolactone derivatives, Ba and HW moieties are tethered as pendant groups via an efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step amine&#8208;thiol&#8208;bromo conjugation. Hetero&#8208;complementary Ba/HW interactions thus yield H&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymeric networks. In addition to an enhanced polymeric network integrity induced by specific Ba/HW association, the presence of individual Ba or HW moieties enables strong binding to a range of substrates, outstanding compared to commercial glues and reported adhesives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Very recently, Boronski  et al.  reported the first thorium&#8208;tho&#173;rium bond in a crystalline cluster prepared under normal experimental conditions. By using a range of experimental techniques and compu&#173;tational models, the authors found that the isolated actinide cluster contains at its heart two paired electrons delocalized over the tri&#8208;tho&#173;rium ring. The recorded Raman spectrum allegedly confirmed the ex&#173;istence of a &#963;&#8208;aromatic three&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bond. In the follow&#173;ing we demonstrate that the experimentally observed broad inelastic scattering bands between 60 and 135 cm  &#8208;1  , originally assigned by the authors to thorium&#8208;thorium vibrations, represent the combination of Th&#8211;Cl stretching and Th&#8211;Cl&#8211;Th bending modes, and they establish the existence of an unprecedented multicenter charge&#8208;shift bonding (ThCl  2  )  3  rather than the &#963;&#8208;aromatic bonding Th  3  .

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroalkynylation of Unactivated 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes is reported. Taking advantage of amide coordination and ligand control, both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkynylation were readily accessible with high enantioselectivities. Computational studies revealed the origin of the ligand&#8208;controlled change of regioselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective functionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes is challenging due to the difficulty to discriminate the enantiotopic faces. Enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes with tunable Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity remains elusive. We report here an amide&#8208;directed, regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated alkenes. The regioselectivity can be readily tuned by the choice of a proper ligand. Catalytic alkynylations occurred with tunable Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity to afford products containing acyclic tertiary or quaternary stereocenters &#946; to an amide. Combining a sequence of alkene isomerization and regioselective hydroalkynylation, we further realized an iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal asymmetric conjugated alkynylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. Computational studies suggest that the regioselectivity is dictated by the ligand structures.

Enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of unactivated 1,1-disubstituted alkenes with tunable Markovnikov and &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov selectivity remains elusive. We report here an amide-directed, regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated alkenes. The regioselectivity can be readily tuned by the choice of a proper ligand.

         <dc:description>
Stereochemistry and curvature of porphyrin&#8208;based nanographenes change in response to coordination of metal ions and heat. By judicious choice of ionic radii, peripheral substituents and apical ligands, it is possible to control the thermodynamics and kinetics of isomerization, to achieve conversion between achiral and chiral structures.







Abstract
Peripheral substitution of a &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrin with bulky groups produces a curved chromophore with four helical stereogenic units. The curvature and stereochemistry of such porphyrins can be controlled by varying the substituents, coordinated metal ions, and apical ligands. In particular, when the achiral saddle&#8208;shaped free bases are treated with large metal ions, i.e., CdII or HgII, the resulting complexes convert to chiral propeller&#8208;like configurations. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses show that apical coordination of a water molecule is sufficient to induce a notable bowl&#8208;like distortion of the cadmium complex, which however retains its chiral structure. For phenyl&#8208; and tolyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, the conversion is thermodynamically controlled, whereas complexes bearing bulky 4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl groups transform into their chiral forms upon heating. In the latter case, the chiral Hg porphyrin was converted into the corresponding free base and other metal complexes without any loss of configurational purity, ultimately providing access to stable, enantiopure porphyrin propellers.

         <title>Extreme Enhancement of Carbon Hydrogasification via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plants capture CO2 from the air and fix it with H2O into carbohydrate molecules via photosynthesis. The main photosynthesized biomass, wood, can be converted into charcoal and chemicals via pyrolysis. The charcoal can then be hydrogenated into hydrocarbons using a mechanochemical method. The produced CH4 can be used directly as fuel, or as a feedstock for the synthesis of other chemicals, thereby creating a neutral or negative carbon cycle.







Abstract
Carbon hydrogasification is the slowest reaction among all carbon&#8208;involved small&#8208;molecule transformations. Here, we demonstrate a mechanochemical method that results in both a faster reaction rate and a new synthesis route. The reaction rate was dramatically enhanced by up to 4 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional thermal method. Simultaneously, the reaction exhibited very high selectivity (99.8&#8201;% CH4, versus 80&#8201;% under thermal conditions) with a cobalt catalyst. Our study demonstrated that this extreme increase in reaction rate originates from the continuous activation of reactive carbon species via mechanochemistry. The high selectivity is intimately related to the activation at low temperature, at which higher hydrocarbons are difficult to form. This work is expected to advance studies of carbon hydrogasification, and other solid&#8208;gas reactions.

         <title>Photoswitchable Serotonins for Optical Control of the 5&#8208;HT2A Receptor**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first&#8208;in&#8208;class photoswitchable agonists for the 5HT2A receptor (serotonin family GPCR) have been developed. Bifunctional, tethered variants (PORTLs) enable genetically targeted optical control.







Abstract
Serotonin receptors play central roles in neuromodulation and are critical drug targets for psychiatric disorders. Optical control of serotonin receptor subtypes has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of receptor function. While other neuromodulatory receptors have been successfully rendered photoswitchable, reversible photocontrol of serotonin receptors has not been achieved, representing a major gap in GPCR photopharmacology. Herein, we develop the first tools that allow for such control. Azo5HT&#8208;2 shows light&#8208;dependent 5&#8208;HT2AR agonism, with greater activity in the cis&#8208;form. Based on docking and test compound analysis, we also develop photoswitchable orthogonal, remotely&#8208;tethered ligands (PORTLs). These BG&#8208;Azo5HTs provide rapid, reversible, and repeatable optical control following conjugation to SNAP&#8208;tagged 5&#8208;HT2AR. Overall, this study provides a foundation for the broad extension of photopharmacology to the serotonin receptor family.

         <title>The Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Rhonin Targets RHOGDI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identification of the pseudo&#8208;natural product Rhonin as the first small&#8208;molecule modulator of RHO GDP dissociation inhibitor (RHOGDI) is reported. Rhonin binds to RHOGDI and interferes with its function by disrupting the interaction between RHOGDI and RHO GTPases.







Abstract
For the discovery of novel chemical matter generally endowed with bioactivity, strategies may be particularly efficient that combine previous insight about biological relevance, e.g., natural product (NP) structure, with methods that enable efficient coverage of chemical space, such as fragment&#8208;based design. We describe the de novo combination of different 5&#8208;membered NP&#8208;derived N&#8208;heteroatom fragments to structurally unprecedented &#8220;pseudo&#8208;natural products&#8221; in an efficient complexity&#8208;generating and enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis sequence. The pseudo&#8208;NPs inherit characteristic elements of NP structure but occupy areas of chemical space not covered by NP&#8208;derived chemotypes, and may have novel biological targets. Investigation of the pseudo&#8208;NPs in unbiased phenotypic assays and target identification led to the discovery of the first small&#8208;molecule ligand of the RHO GDP&#8208;dissociation inhibitor 1 (RHOGDI1), termed Rhonin. Rhonin inhibits the binding of the RHOGDI1 chaperone to GDP&#8208;bound RHO GTPases and alters the subcellular localization of RHO GTPases.

         <title>In Situ Constructed Nano&#8208;Drug Depots through Intracellular Hydrolytic Condensation for Chemotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots in situ is presented. Based on silicon particles, the nano&#8208;drug depots are capable of sustained drug release, which results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer.







Abstract
Intravesical administration of first&#8208;line drugs has shown failure in the treatment of bladder cancer owing to the poor tumor retention time of chemotherapeutics. Herein, we report an intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots in situ, wherein sustained drug release results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer. Briefly, the designed doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;silane conjugates self&#8208;assemble into silane&#8208;based prodrug nanoparticles, which condense into silicon particle&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug depots inside tumor cells. Significantly, we demonstrate that the IHC system possesses highly potent antitumor efficacy, which leads to the regression and eradication of large established tumors and simultaneously extends the overall survival of air pouch bladder cancer mice compared with that of mice treated with Dox. The concept of intracellular hydrolytic condensation can be extended via conjugating other chemotherapeutic drugs, which may facilitate rational design of novel nanomedicines for augmentation of chemotherapy.

         <title>Critical Role of Removing Impurities in Nickel Oxide on High&#8208;Efficiency and Long&#8208;Term Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

High&#8208;quality NiOx nanoparticles have been synthesized via an ionic liquid&#8208;assisted synthesis method (NiOx&#8208;IL). The inverted perovskite solar cell based on a NiOx&#8208;IL hole transport layer exhibits a striking efficiency exceeding 22.62&#8201;%, and a superior operational stability maintaining 92&#8201;% of its initial efficiency at a maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
The performance enhancement of inverted perovskite solar cells applying nickel oxide (NiOx) as the hole transport layer (HTL) has been limited by impurity ions (such as nitrate ions). Herein, we have proposed a strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality NiOx nanoparticles via an ionic liquid&#8208;assisted synthesis method (NiOx&#8208;IL). Experimental and theoretical results illustrate that the cation of the ionic liquid can inhibit the adsorption of impurity ions on nickel hydroxide through a strong hydrogen bond and low adsorption energy, thereby obtaining NiOx&#8208;IL HTL with high conductivity and strong hole&#8208;extraction ability. Importantly, the removal of impurity ions can effectively suppress the redox reaction between the NiOx film and the perovskite film, thus slowing down the deterioration of device performance. Consequently, the modified inverted device shows a striking efficiency exceeding 22.62&#8201;%, and superior stability maintaining 92&#8201;% efficiency at a maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h.

         <title>Thionolactone as a Resin Additive to Prepare (Bio)degradable 3D Objects via VAT Photopolymerization**

Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) UV&#8208;printing produces cross&#8208;linked materials that are stable and non&#8208;degradable. The introduction of a thionolactone dopant (2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of dibenzo[c,e]&#8208;oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT)) to acrylate&#8208;based resins produced via radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization confers (bio)degradability through the thioester units in the network. The resin was used in different setups, including commercial 3D printers, and the objects were shown to degrade in basic solution under mild conditions.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing and especially VAT photopolymerization leads to cross&#8208;linked materials with high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Nevertheless, these properties are incompatible with requirements of degradability and re/upcyclability. We show here that thionolactone and in particular dibenzo[c,e]&#8208;oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) can be used as an additive (2&#8197;wt&#8201;%) to acrylate&#8208;based resins to introduce weak bonds into the network via a radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization process. The low amount of additive makes it possible to modify the printability of the resin only slightly, keep its resolution intact, and maintain the mechanical properties of the 3D object. The resin with additive was used in UV microfabrication and two&#8208;photon stereolithography setups and commercial 3D printers. The fabricated objects were shown to degrade in basic solvent as well in a homemade compost. The rate of degradation is nonetheless dependent on the size of the object. This feature was used to prepare 3D objects with support structures that could be easily solubilized.

         <title>Catalytic Substrate&#8208;Selective Silylation of Primary Alcohols via Remote Functional&#8208;Group Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular recognition of the substrate structure by catalyst 3 enabled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of long&#8208;chain primary alcohols. Silylation of A proceeded 11 times faster than that of B by recognition of a one&#8208;carbon difference between primary alcohols A and B. Preferential silylation of A took place over that of C by a factor of 21 owing to discrimination of the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting OH group at C(1).







Abstract
Silylation of alcohols has generally been known to take place at the sterically most accessible less&#8208;hindered hydroxy group. Herein, the catalyst&#8208;controlled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of primary alcohols, in which the selectivity was controlled independently of the innate reactivity of the hydroxy group, based on the steric environment, is reported. The chain&#8208;length&#8208;selective silylation of 1,n&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives was achieved and 1,5&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives showed outstandingly high reactivity in the presence of analogues with a shorter or longer chain length under catalyst&#8208;controlled conditions. A highly substrate&#8208;selective catalytic silylation of pentanol analogues was also developed, in which the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting hydroxy groups was effectively discriminated on silylation.

         <title>Profiling of the ADP&#8208;Ribosylome in Living Cells</title>

For further studies on protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation, two new NAD+ derivatives are introduced, which carry either a fluorophore or an affinity tag. In combination with developed methods for their mild cell delivery, studies of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living human cells were conducted. This approach allows not only the imaging of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living cells but also the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of cellular adaptation by protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation as a consequence of environmental changes.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) with ADP&#8208;ribose and poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as substrate is involved in the regulation of numerous cellular pathways in eukaryotes, notably the response to DNA damage caused by cellular stress. Nevertheless, due to intrinsic properties of NAD+ e.g., high polarity and associated poor cell passage, these PTMs are difficult to characterize in cells. Here, two new NAD+ derivatives are presented, which carry either a fluorophore or an affinity tag and, in combination with developed methods for mild cell delivery, allow studies in living human cells. We show that this approach allows not only the imaging of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living cells but also the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of cellular adaptation by protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation as a consequence of environmental changes such as H2O2&#8208;induced oxidative stress or the effect of the approved anti&#8208;cancer drug olaparib. Our results therefore pave the way for further functional and clinical studies of the ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteome in living cells in health and disease.

         <title>Diversifying Nanoparticle Superstructures and Functions Enabled by Translative Templating from Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>

Information transfer from &#960;&#8208;conjugated perylene diimide isomers to nanoparticle assemblies is successfully achieved through synchronized supramolecular polymerization and nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly, which enables the generation of self&#8208;assembled superstructures with long&#8208;range ordering, and potentially macroscopic materials, from synthetic small molecules and nanoparticles.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Information transfer from &#960;-conjugated perylene diimide isomers to nanoparticle assemblies is successfully achieved through synchronized supramolecular polymerization and nanoparticle self-assembly, which enables the generation of self-assembled superstructures with long-range ordering, and potentially macroscopic materials, from synthetic small molecules and nanoparticles.

         <title>Heterotrimetallic Double Cavity Cages: Syntheses and Selective Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the synthesis of two heterotrimetallic double cavity cages, [PdnPtmL4]6+, (where n=1 and m =2 or n=2 and m=1) is described. The cages are shown to interact with several different guest molecules. The cage with two identical cavities can bind two identical guest molecules in a non&#8208;cooperative fashion, whereas the cage with two different cavities can bind two different guests in a segregated manner.







Abstract
A strategy for the generation of heterotrimetallic double cavity (DC) cages [PdnPtmL4]6+ (DC1: n=1, m=2; and DC2: n=2, m=1) is reported. The DC cages were generated by combining an inert platinum(II) tetrapyridylaldehyde complex with a suitably substituted pyridylamine and PdII ions. 1H and DOSY nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) data were consistent with the formation of the DC architectures. DC1 and DC2 were shown to interact with several different guest molecules. The structure of DC1, which features two identical cavities, binding two 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (DAQ) guest molecules was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, DC1 was shown to bind two molecules of 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) in a statistical (non&#8208;cooperative) manner. In contrast, DC2, which features two different cage cavities, was found to interact with two different guests, 5&#8208;FU and cisplatin, selectively.

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Arylation of Tertiary C&#8722;H Bonds of Cyclobutylmethyl Ketones Using Transient Directing Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PdII&#8208;catalyzed tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group is reported. An electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand was identified as an external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers was readily accessed in up to 81&#8201;% yield and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8722;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation.







Abstract
We report the first example of selective PdII&#8208;catalyzed tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group. An electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand was identified as the optimal external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers was readily accessed without preinstalling internal directing groups in up to 81&#8201;% yield and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8722;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Dynamic Microbial Fe(III) Respiration Metabolism with a Living Cell&#8208;Compatible Electron&#8208;Sensing Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;sensing probe Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ was developed to achieve dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolism monitoring in S. putrefaciens. With excellent monitoring performance, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe offers the potential to track the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolic response of S. putrefaciens to environmental stress and microbial co&#8208;culture interactions. Additionally, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe provides guidance for biosynthesis efficiency optimization.







Abstract
Monitoring microbial metabolism is vital for biomanufacturing processes optimization. However, it remains a grand challenge to offer insight into microbial metabolism due to particularly complex and dynamic processes. Here, we report an electron&#8208;sensing probe Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ for real&#8208;time and dynamic monitoring of Fe(III) respiration metabolism. The quenched persistent luminescence of Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ is recovered when Fe3+ accepted electrons from the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolism, enabling the real&#8208;time monitoring of microbial metabolism. The probe shows the capability to verify the role of related biomolecules in microbial Fe(III) respiration metabolism, to track the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolic response to environmental stress and microbial co&#8208;culture interactions. Furthermore, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe provides guidance for improving biosynthesis efficiency by monitoring Fe redox recycling in microbial co&#8208;culture.

         <title>Mechanochemical Access to a Short&#8208;Lived Cyclic Dimer Pd2L2: An Elusive Kinetic Species En Route to Molecular Triangle Pd3L3 and Molecular Square Pd4L4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions between cis&#8208;protected Pd ions and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, a classic self&#8208;assembly reaction studied for the past 30&#8197;years, would always give molecular square Pd4L4 and/or triangle Pd3L3. By solvent&#8208;free ball&#8208;milling, a highly&#8208;reactive cyclic dimer Pd2L2 is isolated for the first time as the major species, highlighting that unique chemical space mechanochemistry can provide an environment to stabilize species that are otherwise too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;based molecular square Pd4L4 and triangle Pd3L3 represent the molecular ancestors of metal&#8208;coordination polyhedra that have been an integral part of the field for the last 30&#8197;years. Conventional solution&#8208;based reactions between cis&#8208;protected Pd ions and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine exclusively give Pd4L4 and/or Pd3L3 as the sole products. We herein show that, under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical conditions, the self&#8208;assembly energy landscape can be thermodynamically manipulated to form an elusive cyclic dimer Pd2L2 for the first time. In the absence of solvent, Pd2L2 is indefinitely stable in the solid&#8208;state, but converts rapidly to its thermodynamic products Pd3L3 and Pd4L4 in solution, confirming Pd2L2 as a short&#8208;lived kinetic species in the solution&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly process. Our results highlight how mechanochemistry grants access to a vastly different chemical space than available under conventional solution conditions. This provides a unique opportunity to isolate elusive species in self&#8208;assembly processes that are too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.

&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. By solvent-free ball-milling, a highly-reactive cyclic dimer &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is isolated for the first time as the major species, highlighting that unique chemical space mechanochemistry can provide an environment to stabilize species that are otherwise too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pd-based molecular square &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and triangle &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; represent the molecular ancestors of metal-coordination polyhedra that have been an integral part of the field for the last 30&#8197;years. Conventional solution-based reactions between &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-protected Pd ions and 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine exclusively give &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and/or &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the sole products. We herein show that, under solvent-free mechanochemical conditions, the self-assembly energy landscape can be thermodynamically manipulated to form an elusive cyclic dimer &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the first time. In the absence of solvent, &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is indefinitely stable in the solid-state, but converts rapidly to its thermodynamic products &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in solution, confirming &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a short-lived kinetic species in the solution-based self-assembly process. Our results highlight how mechanochemistry grants access to a vastly different chemical space than available under conventional solution conditions. This provides a unique opportunity to isolate elusive species in self-assembly processes that are too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selectively Regulating Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Achieving Turn&#8208;On/Off of the Catalytic Activity in Different CO2 Reactions</title>

Selective regulation of Lewis acid&#8211;base sites in metal&#8211;organic framework catalysts is an effective strategy to turn&#8208;on/off the catalytic activity for different CO2 reactions.







Abstract
Regulating Lewis acid&#8211;base sites in catalysts to investigate their influence in the chemical fixation of CO2 is significant but challenging. A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with open metal Co sites, {(NH2Me2)[Co3(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(BTB)2(H2O)]&#8901;9&#8201;H2O&#8901;5&#8201;DMF}n (1), was obtained and the results of the catalytic investigation show that 1 can catalyze cycloaddition of CO2 and aziridines to give 99&#8201;% yield. The efficiency of the cyclization of CO2 with propargyl amines is only 32&#8201;%. To improve the catalytic ability of 1, ligand XN with Lewis base sites was introduced into 1 and coordinated with the open Co sites, resulting in a decrease of the Lewis acid sites and an increase in the Lewis base sites in a related MOF 2 ({(NH2Me2)[Co3(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(NHMe2)(BTB)2(XN)]&#8901;8&#8201;H2O&#8901;4&#8201;DMF}n). Selective regulation of the type of active centers causes the yield of oxazolidinones to be enhanced by about 2.4 times, suggesting that this strategy can turn on/off the catalytic activity for different reactions. The catalytic results from 2 treated with acid solution support this conclusion. This work illuminates a MOF&#8208;construction strategy that produces efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Demonstrating and Unraveling a Controlled Nanometer&#8208;Scale Expansion of the Vacancy Defects in Graphene by CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 is demonstrated as a promising etchant for controlled manipulation of graphene edges and vacancy defects down to a rate of a few &#197; per minute while completely avoiding the nucleation of new vacancy defects. This makes CO2 a unique etchant for decoupling pore nucleation and expansion.







Abstract
A controlled manipulation of graphene edges and vacancies is desired for molecular separation, sensing and electronics applications. Unfortunately, available etching methods always lead to vacancy nucleation making it challenging to control etching. Herein, we report CO2&#8208;led controlled etching down to 2&#8211;3&#8197;&#197; per minute while completely avoiding vacancy nucleation. This makes CO2 a unique etchant for decoupling pore nucleation and expansion. We show that CO2 expands the steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;free edges with an activation energy of 2.71&#8197;eV, corresponding to the energy barrier for the dissociative chemisorption of CO2. We demonstrate the presence of an additional configurational energy barrier for nanometer&#8208;sized vacancies resulting in a significantly slower rate of expansion. Finally, CO2 etching is applied to map the location of the intrinsic vacancies in the polycrystalline graphene film where we show that the intrinsic vacancy defects manifest mainly as grain boundary defects where intragrain defects from oxidative etching constitute a minor population.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework as an Efficient Protection Layer for a Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin covalent organic framework layer is in situ fabricated on Li (COF&#8208;Li) to suppress Li dendrite growth and mitigate side reactions on the Li anode. COF&#8208;Li exhibits a non&#8208;dendritic morphology during repeated Li plating/stripping and demonstrates a remarkable cycle life of &gt;13&#8201;200&#8197;h with an impressive low overpotential of 16&#8197;mV at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal shows great potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the practical applications of Li&#8208;metal batteries are still challenged by the formation of Li dendrites and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on metallic Li. Herein, a thin covalent organic framework layer is in situ fabricated on Li (COF&#8208;Li) to suppress Li dendrite growth and mitigate the side reaction on the Li anode. The COF has a periodic and uniform porosity, allowing for selectively sieving Li ions and guiding a uniform Li deposition. As a result, the COF&#8208;Li exhibits a non&#8208;dendrite morphology during repeated Li plating/stripping and demonstrates a remarkable cycle life over 13&#8201;200&#8197;h with an extremely low overpotential of only 16&#8197;mV at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Deep Downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 by Caged Peptide&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen/miR&#8208;140 Nanoparticles for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tumor cells, a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe self&#8208;assembled with miR&#8208;140 could release the GO203 peptide binding to MUC1 and miR&#8208;140 degrading the PD&#8208;L1 mRNA, thus, achieving the deep downregulation of the PD&#8208;L1 expression. Subsequently, activated immune cells by PDT&#8208;induced release of TAAs would achieve more effective immunotherapy.







Abstract
Downregulating programmed cell death ligand 1(PD&#8208;L1) protein levels in tumor cells is an effective way to achieve immune system activation for oncology treatment, but current strategies are inadequate. Here, we design a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe (GCP) to self&#8208;assemble with miR&#8208;140 forming GCP/miR&#8208;140 nanoparticles. After entering tumor cells, GCP/miR&#8208;140 disassembles in the presence of Cathepsin B (CB) and releases caged GO203 peptide, miR&#8208;140 and PyTPA. Peptide decages in the highly reductive intracellular environment and binds to mucin 1 (MUC1), thereby downregulating the expression of PD&#8208;L1. Meanwhile, miR&#8208;140 reduces PD&#8208;L1 expression by targeting downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 mRNA. Under the action of PyTPA&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), tumor&#8208;associated antigens are released, triggering immune cell attack on tumor cells. This multiple mechanism&#8208;based strategy of deeply downregulating PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells activates the immune system and thus achieves effective immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;In tumor cells, a caged peptide-AIEgen probe self-assembled with miR-140 could release the GO203 peptide binding to MUC1 and miR-140 degrading the PD-L1 mRNA, thus, achieving the deep downregulation of the PD-L1 expression. Subsequently, activated immune cells by PDT-induced release of TAAs would achieve more effective immunotherapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downregulating programmed cell death ligand 1(PD-L1) protein levels in tumor cells is an effective way to achieve immune system activation for oncology treatment, but current strategies are inadequate. Here, we design a caged peptide-AIEgen probe (GCP) to self-assemble with miR-140 forming GCP/miR-140 nanoparticles. After entering tumor cells, GCP/miR-140 disassembles in the presence of Cathepsin B (CB) and releases caged GO203 peptide, miR-140 and PyTPA. Peptide decages in the highly reductive intracellular environment and binds to mucin 1 (MUC1), thereby downregulating the expression of PD-L1.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Embedded [n]Helicenes (n=5, 6 and 7)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; approach has been used to synthesize azulene&#8208;embedded pristine [n]helicenes (n=5, 6 and 7) that show low&#8208;lying first electric states, small optical energy gaps, and anti&#8208;Kasha emissions. These azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes contribute to the non&#8208;benzenoid helicene library and allow structure&#8211;property relationships to be better understood.







Abstract
Azulene is a non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic building block with unique chemical structure and physicochemical properties. By using the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthetic strategy, we synthesized three azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes ([n]AzHs, n=5, 6 and 7), in which one terminal azulene subunit was fused with n&#8208;2 benzene rings. P&#8208; and M&#8208;enantiomers were observed in the packing diagrams of [5]&#8208;, and [6]AzHs. However, P&#8208; and M&#8208;[7]AzHs could be isolated by recrystallization of the racemic mixture. These [n]AzHs were endowed with new properties through the azulene moiety such as low&#8208;lying first electric state (S1), small optical energy gap and anti&#8208;Kasha emission. [6]&#8208;, and [7]AzHs exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (gabs) maxima of about 0.02, which is among the highest |gabs| values of helicenes in the visible range. These azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes contribute to the non&#8208;benzenoid helicene library and allow the structure&#8211;property relationships to be better understood.

         <title>A Host&#8211;Guest Electron Transfer Mechanism for Magnetic and Electronic Modifications in a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first reversible magnetic phase switch between antiferromagnet and paramagnet has been achieved through host&#8211;guest electron transfer via I2&#8208;vapor sorption. The partial charge delocalization was formed in the I2&#8208;loaded framework, resulting in a hundred&#8208;fold increase in electrical conductivity via hopping electronic transport.







Abstract
Host&#8211;guest electron transfer (HGET) in molecular framework systems is a critical trigger for drastic functional changes in both host framework and guest. A reversible magnetic phase transition was achieved via HGET in a layered framework, [{Ru2(2,6&#8208;F2PhCO2)4}2(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)] (1), where 2,6&#8208;F2PhCO2&#8722; and BTDA&#8208;TCNQ represent 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzoate and bis[1,2,5]dithiazolotetracyanoquinodimethane, respectively. The guest&#8208;free 1 with an antiferromagnetic ground state transformed into a paramagnet, [{Ru2(2,6&#8208;F2PhCO2)4}2(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)]I3 (1&#8208;I3), by adsorbing iodine (I2). The local charge distribution of [{Ru2II,III}+&#8208;(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ).&#8722;&#8208;{Ru2II,II}] in 1 was reversibly modified to [{Ru2II,III}+&#8208;(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)0&#8208;{Ru2II,II}](I3&#8722;) in 1&#8208;I3 through HGET. Theoretical calculations of 1&#8208;I3 indicated a partial charge delocalization as [{Ru2}(1&#8722;&#948;)+&#8208;(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)0&#8208;{Ru2}&#948;+](I3&#8722;) with &#948;&#8776;0.2, aided by weak ferromagnetic coupling. 1&#8208;I3 exhibited a hundred&#8208;fold enhancement in electrical conductivity compared to that of 1.

         <title>Increasing the Number of Aluminum Atoms in T3 Sites of a Mordenite Zeolite by Low&#8208;Pressure SiCl4 Treatment to Catalyze Dimethyl Ether Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
After low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST), the undesired framework aluminum atoms in the 12&#8208;MR channels of a mordenite (MOR) zeolite migrate to the desired T3 sites to increase the number of favorable active sites.







Abstract
Controlling the location of aluminum atoms in a zeolite framework is critical for understanding structure&#8211;performance relationships of catalytic reaction systems and tailoring catalyst design. Herein, we report a strategy to preferentially relocate mordenite (MOR) framework Al atoms into the desired T3 sites by low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST). High&#8208;field 27Al NMR was used to identify the exact location of framework Al for the MOR samples. The results indicate that 73&#8201;% of the framework Al atoms were at the T3 sites after LPST under optimal conditions, which leads to controllably generating and intensifying active sites in MOR zeolite for the dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation reaction with higher methyl acetate (MA) selectivity and much longer lifetime (25&#8197;times). Further research reveals that the Al relocation mechanism involves simultaneous extraction, migration, and reinsertion of Al atoms from and into the parent MOR framework. This unique method is potentially applicable to other zeolites to control Al location.

         <title>Gadolinium Changes the Local Electron Densities of Nickel 3d Orbitals for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of Gd atoms into a Ni&#8208;based catalyst readily changes local electron densities of the Ni 3d orbitals and strengthens the electronic activity. The resulting Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst achieves high selectivity, large current density and outstanding stability in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Generally, in terms of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, single&#8208;atom catalysts show high selectivities yet low current densities whereas conventional nanoparticle catalysts exhibit relatively high current densities but low selectivities. This work combines the advantages of the two classes of catalysts by constructing a Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst within which NiI active sites are exposed outside the carbon layers and Ni nanoparticles are encapsulated inside the carbon layers. The Gd atoms can not only influence the local electron densities of Ni 3d orbitals, thus strengthening the electronic activity, but also tailor the sizes of the Ni nanoparticles, thereby minimizing the activity toward hydrogen evolution. Accordingly, this electrocatalyst yields both a high CO faradaic efficiency (97&#8201;%) and a large current density (308&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), alongside an outstanding stability (100&#8197;h).

         <title>Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interfacial Chemistry Modulation for Ultra&#8208;High Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a THF&#8208;based electrolyte with a weak solvation structure, Na+ desolvation is fast and a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with abundant NaF and organic compounds is generated on the commercial hard carbon anode. This greatly enhances the interface stability and enables the rapid migration of Na+ in the SEI, thus realizing the high rate capability, long&#8208;term stability and good low&#8208;temperature performance for the hard carbon anode.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries capable of operating at rate and temperature extremes are highly desirable, but elusive due to the dynamics and thermodynamics limitations. Herein, a strategy of electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfacial chemistry modulation is proposed. The commercial hard carbon demonstrates superior rate performance with 212&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the electrolyte with weak ion solvation/desolvation, which is much higher than those in common electrolytes (nearly no capacity in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes). Even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, a high capacity of 175&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (74&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity) can be maintained at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Such an electrode retains 90&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. As proven, weak ion solvation/desolvation of tetrahydrofuran greatly facilitates fast&#8208;ion diffusion at the SEI/electrolyte interface and homogeneous SEI with well&#8208;distributed NaF and organic components ensures fast Na+ diffusion through the SEI layer and a stable interface.

         <title>Directing Multivalent Aptamer&#8208;Receptor Binding on the Cell Surface with Programmable Atom&#8208;Like Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA framework&#8208;based programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (aptPANs) and their assemblies with fixed aptamer copy numbers but different directionality were designed. These are employed to direct multivalent aptamer&#8211;receptor binding on the cell membrane interface. The directional&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible aptPAN molecules exhibit the adaptability to the receptor distribution on cell surfaces and thus high affinity against target tumor cells.







Abstract
Multivalent interactions of biomolecules play pivotal roles in physiological and pathological settings. Whereas the directionality of the interactions is crucial, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic multivalent ligand&#8211;receptor systems generally lack programmable approaches for orthogonal directionality. Here, we report the design of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (aptPANs) to direct multivalent aptamer&#8211;receptor binding on the cell interface. The positions of the aptamer motifs can be prescribed on tetrahedral DNA frameworks to realize atom&#8208;like orthogonal valence and direction, enabling the construction of multivalent molecules with fixed aptamer copy numbers but different directionality. These directional&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible aptPAN molecules exhibit the adaptability to the receptor distribution on cell surfaces. We demonstrate the high&#8208;affinity tumor cell binding with a linear aptPAN oligomer (&#8776;13&#8208;fold improved compared to free aptamers), which leads to &#8776;50&#8201;% suppression of cell growth.

         <title>Oxidative Coupling of Methane: Examining the Inactivity of the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalyst at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction, the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst enriched with Q2 units in the SiO2 carrier achieves 23&#8201;% CH4 conversion and 72&#8201;% C2&#8211;3 selectivity at 660&#8201;&#176;C. A large number of Q2 units in MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 is a trigger for markedly lowering the light&#8208;off temperature of the Mn3+&#8596;Mn2+ redox cycle because of the easy formation of MnSiO3.







Abstract
Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) catalyzed by MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 has great industrial promise to convert methane directly to C2&#8211;3 products, but its high light&#8208;off temperature is the most challenging obstacle to commercialization and its working mechanism is still a mystery. We report the discovery of a low&#8208;temperature active and selective MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst enriched with Q2 units in the SiO2 carrier, being capable of converting 23&#8201;% CH4 with 72&#8201;% C2&#8211;3 selectivity at 660&#8201;&#176;C. From experiments and theoretical calculations, a large number of Q2 units in the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst is a trigger for markedly lowering the light&#8208;off temperature of the Mn3+&#8596;Mn2+ redox cycle involved in the OCM reaction because of the easy formation of MnSiO3. Notably, the MnSiO3 formation proceeds merely through the SiO2&#8208;involved reaction in the presence of Na2WO4: Mn7SiO12+6&#8201;SiO2&#8596;7&#8201;MnSiO3+1.5&#8201;O2. The Na2WO4 not only drives the light&#8208;off of this cycle but also gets it working with substantial selectivity toward C2&#8211;3 products. Our findings shine a light on the rational design of more advanced MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4 based OCM catalysts through establishing new Mn3+&#8596;Mn2+ redox cycles with lowered light&#8208;off temperature.

         <title>Allosteric Binding&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Mechanical&#8208;Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analogous to allosteric enzymes, guest binding introduces a directional pulling or pushing force that acts on the reverse side of a Zn salen complex. This tunable intramolecular force promotes various degrees of conformational and torsional strain, as predicted by both classical conformational analysis and DFT. This strain energy can be further applied to cleave chemical bonds, and the efficiency can be tuned by the identity of the allosteric guest.







Abstract
Recently, polymer mechanochemistry has attracted much scientific interest due to its potential to develop degradable polymers. When the two ends of a polymer chain experience a linear pulling stress, molecular strain builds up, at sufficiently strong force, a bond scission of the weakest covalent bond results. In contrast, bond&#8208;breaking events triggered by conformational stress are much less explored. Here, we discovered that a Zn salen complex would undergo conformational switching upon allosteric complexation with alkanediammonium guests. By controlling the guest chain length, the torsional strain experienced by Zn complex can be modulated to induce bond cleavage with chemical stimulus, and reactivity trend is predicted by conformational analysis derived by DFT calculation. Such strain&#8208;release reactivity by a Zn(salen) complex initiated by guest binding is reminiscent of conformation&#8208;induced reactivity of enzymes to enable chemical events that are otherwise inhibited.

An unprecedentedly large cove&#8208;edged nanographene (NG), hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzo&#8208;bis&#8208;peri&#8208;octacene (HBPO), was synthesized. Different ratios of contorted conformations, &#8220;waggling&#8221; and &#8220;butterfly&#8221;, were found in the crystals. The amplified spontaneous emission, which was previously only reported for zigzag&#8208;edged NGs, can be observed in this cove&#8208;edged NG, thus enriching the choices of edge structures for potential applications in laser cavities.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of an unprecedentedly large cove&#8208;edged nanographene, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzo&#8208;bis&#8208;peri&#8208;octacene (HBPO), is reported in this work. Chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed multiple conformations in solution. Two different molecular conformations, &#8220;waggling&#8221; and &#8220;butterfly&#8221;, were found in crystals by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the selectivity of conformations could be tuned by solvents. The optoelectronic properties of HBPO were investigated by UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations. The contorted geometry and branched alkyl groups suppress the aggregation of HBPO in solution, leading to a high fluorescence quantum yield of 79&#8201;%. The optical&#8208;gain properties were explored through transient absorption and amplified spontaneous emission spectroscopies, which enrich the choices of edge structures for potential applications in laser cavities.

         <title>Exploring the Circular Polarization Capacity from Chiral Cellulose Nanocrystal Films for a Photo&#8208;Controlled Chiral Helix of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>

Transmitted circularly polarized light (CPL) and CPL emission were obtained from chiral cellulose nanocrystal films, and these CPL&#8208;active materials were applied for the photo&#8208;induced chiral alignment of supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is key to asymmetric photochemistry as it could impart the chiral organization information into chemical products. Here, we demonstrate the circular polarization capacity of chiral cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) films to trigger photo&#8208;alignment of achiral supramolecular polymers into helical structures. Right&#8208;handed transmitted (T&#8208;) CPL was generated from self&#8208;assembled CNC films, which induced amorphous azobenzene (Azo) supramolecular polymers into chiral structures. The chiral induction effect of T&#8208;CPL is enhanced on Azo polymers with longer spacers. The absorptive dissymmetry factor (gabs) values of liquid&#8208;crystal supramolecular polymers can be amplified significantly (over 10&#8197;times) after T&#8208;CPL irradiation. Moreover, by integrating carbon dots into CNC films, CPL emission with a considerable luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) up to &#8722;0.66 was achieved, and it could be used for the photo&#8208;alignment of Azo polymers with high chiroptical properties. This work provides new insight for the photo modulation of supramolecular polymers by CPL&#8208;active materials.

         <title>A Morphing [4Fe&#8208;3S&#8208;nO]&#8208;Cluster within a Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange of one amino acid (Cys&#8208;&gt;Glu) coordinating the Ni/Fe/S&#8208;cluster in carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODH) is the main difference resulting in the formation of a Fe/S/O&#8208;hybrid&#8208;cluster, found in CooS&#8208;V, while conserving the overall architecture of CODHs. The Fe/S/O&#8208;hybrid&#8208;cluster in CooS&#8208;V reversibly rearranges dependent on its redox&#8208;state.







Abstract
Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of CO2 to CO. Several anaerobic microorganisms encode multiple CODHs in their genome, of which some, despite being annotated as CODHs, lack a cysteine of the canonical binding motif for the active site Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster. Here, we report on the structure and reactivity of such a deviant enzyme, termed CooS&#8208;VCh. Its structure reveals the typical CODH scaffold, but contains an iron&#8208;sulfur&#8208;oxo hybrid&#8208;cluster. Although closely related to true CODHs, CooS&#8208;VCh catalyzes neither CO oxidation, nor CO2 reduction. The active site of CooS&#8208;VCh undergoes a redox&#8208;dependent restructuring between a reduced [4Fe&#8208;3S]&#8208;cluster and an oxidized [4Fe&#8208;2S&#8208;S*&#8208;2O&#8208;2(H2O)]&#8208;cluster. Hydroxylamine, a slow&#8208;turnover substrate of CooS&#8208;VCh, oxidizes the hybrid&#8208;cluster in two structurally distinct steps. Overall, minor changes in CODHs are sufficient to accommodate a Fe/S/O&#8208;cluster in place of the Ni,Fe&#8208;heterocubane&#8208;cluster of CODHs.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Osmotic Energy Conversion Enabled by Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Membranes with Record Output Power Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process for simultaneous and direct conversion of energy from the low&#8208;gradient heat and salinity differences into electricity was developed using ionic covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework membranes. A higher membrane charge density enables greater ion&#8208;transport resistance. The optimal thermo&#8208;osmotic energy conversion device offers a power density of 231&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 with a temperature difference.







Abstract
A vast amount of energy can be extracted from the untapped low&#8208;grade heat from sources below 100&#8201;&#176;C and the Gibbs free energy from salinity gradients. Therefore, a process for simultaneous and direct conversion of these energies into electricity using permselective membranes was developed in this study. These membranes screen charges of ion flux driven by the combined salinity and temperature gradients to achieve thermo&#8208;osmotic energy conversion. Increasing the charge density in the pore channels enhanced the permselectivity and ion conductance, leading to a larger osmotic voltage and current. A 14&#8208;fold increase in power density was achieved by adjusting the ionic site population of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes. The optimal COF membrane was operated under simulated estuary conditions at a temperature difference of 60&#8197;K, which yielded a power density of &#8776;231&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2, placing it among the best performing upscaled membranes. The developed system can pave the way to the utilization of the enormous supply of untapped osmotic power and low&#8208;grade heat energy, indicating the tremendous potential of using COF membranes for energy conversion applications.

     alt="Thermo-Osmotic Energy Conversion Enabled by Covalent-Organic-Framework Membranes with Record Output Power Density"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A process for simultaneous and direct conversion of energy from the low-gradient heat and salinity differences into electricity was developed using ionic covalent-organic-framework membranes. A higher membrane charge density enables greater ion-transport resistance. The optimal thermo-osmotic energy conversion device offers a power density of 231&#8197;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a temperature difference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vast amount of energy can be extracted from the untapped low-grade heat from sources below 100&#8201;&#176;C and the Gibbs free energy from salinity gradients. Therefore, a process for simultaneous and direct conversion of these energies into electricity using permselective membranes was developed in this study. These membranes screen charges of ion flux driven by the combined salinity and temperature gradients to achieve thermo-osmotic energy conversion. Increasing the charge density in the pore channels enhanced the permselectivity and ion conductance, leading to a larger osmotic voltage and current. A 14-fold increase in power density was achieved by adjusting the ionic site population of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes. The optimal COF membrane was operated under simulated estuary conditions at a temperature difference of 60&#8197;K, which yielded a power density of &#8776;231&#8197;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, placing it among the best performing upscaled membranes. The developed system can pave the way to the utilization of the enormous supply of untapped osmotic power and low-grade heat energy, indicating the tremendous potential of using COF membranes for energy conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The discovery of ligands for the &#8220;undruggable proteome&#8221; is likely to require the development of new chemical matter with a greater &#8220;molecular wingspan&#8221; than traditional Lipinski&#8208;compliant small molecules. A DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) of non&#8208;peptidic thioether macrocycles has been constructed and screened for high affinity protein ligands to a model protein, SA.







Abstract
There is considerable interest in the development of libraries of non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles as a source of ligands for difficult targets. We report here the solid&#8208;phase synthesis of a DNA&#8208;encoded library of several hundred thousand thioether&#8208;linked macrocycles. The library was designed to be highly diverse with respect to backbone scaffold diversity and to minimize the number of amide N&#8722;H bonds, which compromise cell permeability. The utility of the library as a source of protein ligands is demonstrated through the isolation of compounds that bind Streptavidin, a model target, with high affinity.

         <title>Nanographene with Multiple Embedded Heptagons: Cascade Radical Photocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced radical cyclization was used in the synthesis of nanocarbons with embedded heptagons, providing a new approach towards nanocarbons with novel topologies. The nanographene reported herein bears six heptagons, representing the nanocarbon containing the largest number of heptagons by organic synthesis reported to date. The embedded heptagons distort the graphene core into a Monkey&#8208;saddle&#8208;shaped conformation.







Abstract
Although heptagons are widely found in graphenic materials, the precise synthesis of nanocarbons containing heptagons remains a challenge, especially for the nanocarbons containing multiple&#8208;heptagons. Herein, we show that photo&#8208;induced radical cyclization (PIRC) can be used to synthesize multi&#8208;heptagon&#8208;embedded nanocarbons. Notably, a nanographene containing six heptagons (1) was obtained via a six&#8208;fold cascade PIRC reaction. The structure of 1 was clearly validated and showed a Monkey&#8208;saddle&#8208;shaped conformation. Experimental bond analysis and theoretical calculations indicated that the heptagons in 1 were non&#8208;aromatic, whereas the peripheral rings were highly aromatic. Compared to planar nanographene with the same number of &#960; electrons, 1 had a similar optical gap due to a compromise between the decreased conjugation in the wrapped structure and enhanced electronic delocalization at the rim. Electrochemical studies showed that 1 had low&#8208;lying oxidation potentials, which was attributed to the nitrogen&#8208;doping.

         <title>Intrinsic Hole Mobility in Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Its Application in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design concept involving introduction of sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen atom to conjugated organic linkers leads to intrinsic hole mobility in a luminescent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The triarylamine&#8208;based MOF (Zr&#8208;NBP) has strong fluorescence and high hole mobility of 1.05&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. A thin film of Zr&#8208;NBP in pure phase was used directly as an emissive layer (EML) and a hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) in OLED devices.







Abstract
Most metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) lack charge mobility, which is crucial for realizing their use in optoelectronic applications. This work proposes the design of a MOF using triarylamine&#8208;based ligands (Zr&#8208;NBP) as the lone pair electron spacer to enhance the hole mobility in the MOF while maintaining its luminescent properties. Zr&#8208;NBP has strong fluorescence with a good hole mobility of 1.05&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is comparable to organic materials used in optoelectronic devices. We also employed a Zr&#8208;NBP nanofilm in the pure phase as both a non&#8208;doped emissive layer and a hole&#8208;transporting layer within organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The obtained OLED device produced a bright green light with a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.9&#8197;V. This work presents an advance in developing the electronic properties of MOFs by modifying the chemical properties of its building blocks, and will likely inspire further design of MOF materials as active layers in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Exceptional Selectivity to Olefins in the Deoxygenation of Fatty Acids over an Intermetallic Platinum&#8211;Zinc Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report an intermetallic PtZn alloy catalyst for the highly selective production of long&#8208;chain olefins from the direct deoxygenation of fatty acids. In the reaction over conventional metal catalysts like Pt, saturated alkanes are usually obtained as the major decarboxylation product.







Abstract
Direct deoxygenation of long&#8208;chain fatty acids can produce both saturated alkanes (CnH2n+2) and unsaturated olefins (CnH2n). However, the selectivity for the production of olefins via the decarbonylation route is relatively low because of the more favorable decarboxylation pathway. We present an atomically ordered intermetallic PtZn alloy on carbon catalyst (PtZn/C) with a record&#8208;high total selectivity (97&#8201;%) for undecane (C11H24) and undecene (C11H22) in the deoxygenation of lauric acid (C12H24O2). Interestingly, the selectivity for C11H22 is as high as 67.0&#8201;% on PtZn/C, which is significantly higher than that of 27.5&#8201;% obtained on the Pt/C counterpart under the same reaction conditions. Characterization and theoretical calculation results reveal that the intermetallic PtZn alloy not only inhibits the decarboxylation route by increasing the energy barrier of &#8722;COO* cleavage, but also facilitates the decarbonylation route by decreasing CO desorption energy, and therefore the major product is switched from alkanes to olefins.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanosensitizer Performs Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Reprogrammed Oxygen Metabolism for Cancer Radiotherapy Intensification and Immunogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;traced metal&#8208;phenolic nanosensitizer was developed that performed H2S&#8208;reprogrammed oxygen metabolism for radiotherapy intensification and immunogenicity. Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX nanoparticles generate H2S under an acidic tumor microenvironment to inhibit mitochondrial respiration and reprogram oxygen metabolism for tumor oxygenation. The chelated Hf ions simultaneously make full use of the preserved oxygen to improve the generation of local reactive oxygen species against tumor cells and to trigger antitumor immune activation.







Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is hampered by the limited oxygen in tumors, which could be potentiated via reprogramming the oxygen metabolism and increasing the oxygen utilization efficiency. Herein, a metal&#8208;phenolic nanosensitizer (Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX) was integrated via an acid&#8208;sensitive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (polyethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;polydithiocarbamates, PEG&#8208;DTC) and a hafnium&#8208;chelated polyphenolic semiconducting polymer (Hf&#8208;PSP) in an amphiphilic polymer (poloxamer F127, PLX). Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX elicited a high imaging performance for precise RT and generated H2S to reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate via mitochondrial respiration inhibition, which reprogrammed the oxygen metabolism for improvement of the tumor oxygenation. Then, Hf&#8208;sensitization could fully utilize the well&#8208;preserved oxygen to intensify RT efficacy and activate immunogenicity. Such a synergistic strategy for improvement of oxygenation and oxygen utilization would have great potential in optimizing oxygen&#8208;dependent therapeutics.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Dearomative Hydrogen Atom Abstraction/ Cyclization Cascade of Indoles</title>

Upon irradiation with visible light and sensitization with thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (TXT), substituted indoles undergo a facile and high&#8208;yielding hydrogen atom transfer/cyclization cascade to dearomatized, spirocyclic products.







Abstract
The photochemical synthesis of yet unknown 2&#8208;oxospiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (17 examples, 80&#8211;95&#8201;% yield), 2,4&#8208;dioxospiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (eight examples, 87&#8211;97&#8201;% yield), and 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (17 examples, 85&#8211;97&#8201;% yield) is described. Starting from readily accessible 3&#8208;substituted indoles, a dearomatization of the indole core was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955;=420&#8197;nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10&#8197;mol%) as the sensitizer. Based on mechanistic evidence (triplet energy determination, deuteration experiments, by&#8208;product analysis) it is proposed that the reaction proceeds by energy transfer via a 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;diradical intermediate. The latter intermediates are formed by excited state hydrogen atom transfer from suitable alkyl groups within the C3 substituent to the indole C2 carbon atom. Subsequent ring closure proceeds with pronounced diastereoselectivity to generate a 4&#8208; or 5&#8208;membered spirocyclic dearomatized product with several options for further functionalization.

         <title>Construction of Single&#8208;Crystalline Hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 with Open Nanoarchitectures via Anisotropic&#8208;Kinetics Transformation for the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
An anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy is developed to synthesize single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with highly open nanoarchitectures and different compositions. The as&#8208;prepared ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages exhibit remarkably improved catalytic lifetime and reduced coke formation rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction.







Abstract
We report an anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy to prepare single&#8208;crystalline aluminosilicate MFI zeolites (ZSM&#8208;5) with highly open nanoarchitectures and hierarchical porosities. The methodology relies on the cooperative effect of in situ etching and recrystallization on the evolution of pure&#8208;silica MFI zeolite (silicalite&#8208;1) nanotemplates under hydrothermal conditions. The strategy enables a controllable preparation of ZSM&#8208;5 nanostructures with diverse open geometries by tuning the relative rate difference between etching and recrystallization processes. Meanwhile, it can also be extended to synthesize other heteroatom&#8208;substituted MFI zeolite nanocages. Compared with conventional ZSM&#8208;5 microcrystals, nanocrystals, and nanoboxes, the ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages with single&#8208;crystalline nature, highly open nanoarchitectures, and hierarchical porosities exhibit remarkably enhanced catalytic lifetime and low coking rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction.

         <title>Comprehensive Pore Tuning in an Ultrastable Fluorinated Anion Cross&#8208;Linked Cage&#8208;Like MOF for Simultaneous Benchmark Propyne Recovery and Propylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented ultrastable fluorinated anion cross&#8208;linked cage&#8208;like MOF (ZNU&#8208;2) was prepared for benchmark propyne/propylene separation with large C3H4 capacity (7.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), high C3H4/C3H6 selectivity (16.2), low adsorption enthalpy (43.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and high practical C3H4 and C3H6 productivity due to the precise control of pore size, shape and functionality.







Abstract
Propyne/propylene (C3H4/C3H6) separation is an important but challenging industrial process to produce polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 and recover high&#8208;purity C3H4. Herein, we report an ultrastable TiF62&#8722; anion cross&#8208;linked metal&#8211;organic framework (ZNU&#8208;2) with precisely controlled pore size, shape and functionality for benchmark C3H4 storage (3.9/7.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.01/1.0&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K) and record high C3H4/C3H6 (10/90) separation potential (31.0&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1). The remarkable C3H4/C3H6 (1/99, 10/90, 50/50) separation performance was fully demonstrated by simulated and experimental breakthroughs under various conditions with excellent recyclability and high productivity (42&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) of polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 from a 1/99&#8197;C3H4/C3H6 mixture. A modelling study revealed that the symmetrical spatial distribution of six TiF62&#8722; on the icosahedral cage surface provides two distinct binding sites for C3H4 adsorption: one serves as a tailored single C3H4 molecule trap and the other boosts C3H4 accommodation by cooperative host&#8211;guest and guest&#8211;guest interactions.

A low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST) strategy to selectively relocate zeolite framework aluminum atoms into the desired positions is reported in the Research Article by Zhengxi Yu, Zhongmin Liu, and co&#8208;workers (e202116990). After treatment, the undesired framework aluminum atoms in the 12&#8208;MR channels of a mordenite zeolite migrate to the desired T3 sites to increase the number of favorable active sites.

Host&#8211;guest electron transfer (HGET) plays a fundamental role in host&#8211;guest chemistry to modulate the functionality of molecular frameworks. In their Research Article (e202115976), Hitoshi Miyasaka and co&#8208;workers introduce this concept for a redox&#8208;active magnetic metal&#8211;organic framework, achieving a guest&#8208;induced magnetic phase transition between a guest&#8208;free antiferromagnet and a guest&#8208;containing paramagnet, which may aid the design of novel porous magnets.

         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;shifting molecules were probed in the gas phase, which conclusively unveiled the valence tautomerism phenomena for an archetypal barbaralone as described by Jos&#233; L. Alonso et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202117045). The two valence tautomers of this bistable molecular system were isolated in a supersonic jet for the first time and characterized by high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy coupled with laser ablation techniques. This observation opens the door towards the characterization of new fluxional systems under isolation conditions.

A Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N ternary doped porous carbon black catalyst was developed for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, as reported by Lang Xu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202201166). NiI active sites with high product selectivity and Ni nanoparticles with high conductivity are integrated within one catalyst. The Gd atoms not only tailor the sizes of the Ni nanoparticles but also change the local densities of the Ni 3d orbitals, thus enabling the catalyst to achieve high faradaic efficiency, large current density, and excellent stability.

         <title>Biosensing with Fluorescent Carbon Nanotubes</title>

Optical biosensors are important tools for basic research and non&#8208;invasive diagnostics. Carbon nanotubes are versatile near&#8208;infrared fluorescent and non&#8208;bleaching materials that can be chemically functionalized to detect a broad variety of biomolecules. This Review highlights chemical design strategies and provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in this dynamic field.







Abstract
Biosensors are powerful tools for modern basic research and biomedical diagnostics. Their development requires substantial input from the chemical sciences. Sensors or probes with an optical readout, such as fluorescence, offer rapid, minimally invasive sensing of analytes with high spatial and temporal resolution. The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region is beneficial because of the reduced background and scattering of biological samples (tissue transparency window) in this range. In this context, single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have emerged as versatile NIR fluorescent building blocks for biosensors. Here, we provide an overview of advances in SWCNT&#8208;based NIR fluorescent molecular sensors. We focus on chemical design strategies for diverse analytes and summarize insights into the photophysics and molecular recognition. Furthermore, different application areas are discussed&#8212;from chemical imaging of cellular systems and diagnostics to in&#8197;vivo applications and perspectives for the future.

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on intracellular supramolecular self&#8208;assembly that follows different strategies via host&#8211;guest interactions, enzymes, and polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. The resulting in cellulo non&#8208;natural aggregates, including nanofibers, gels, nanoparticles, and colloidal droplets of coacervate, exhibit a variety of topological structures suitable for applications ranging from cancer treatment to bioimaging.







Abstract
Supramolecular interactions rely on non&#8208;covalent forces, such as hydrophobic effects, hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and electrostatic interactions, which govern many intracellular biological pathways. In cellulo supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is mainly based on host&#8211;guest interactions, changes in pH, enzymes, and polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly to accurately induce various unnatural reactions without disturbing natural biological processes. This process can produce synthetic biocompatible macromolecules to control cell properties and regulate biological functions, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. This Minireview focuses on the latest reports in the field of in cellulo supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and anticipates future advances regarding its activation in response to internal and external stimuli, such as pH changes, reactive oxygen species, and enzymes, as well as external light illumination.

         <title>A Desaturative Approach for Aromatic Aldehyde Synthesis via Synergistic Enamine, Photoredox and Cobalt Triple Catalysis</title>

Synergistic enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis enables a desaturative approach for the preparation of aromatic aldehydes.







Abstract
Aromatic aldehydes are fundamental intermediates that are widely utilised for the synthesis of important materials across the broad spectrum of chemical industries. Accessing highly substituted derivatives can often be difficult as their functionalizations are generally performed via electrophilic aromatic substitution, SEAr. Here we provide an alternative and mechanistically distinct approach whereby aromatic aldehydes are assembled from saturated precursors via a desaturative process. This novel strategy harnesses the high&#8208;fidelity of Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions to quickly construct multi&#8208;substituted cyclohexenecarbaldehyde cores which undergo desaturation via the synergistic interplay of enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis.

         <title>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Glycoprotein Directly Binds Exogeneous Sialic Acids: A NMR View</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR experiments using 13C&#8208;labelled sialyl&#8208;containing trisaccharides unequivocally demonstrate that the N&#8208;terminal domain of the Spike (S) SARS CoV&#8208;2 glycoprotein directly binds sialic acid residues, highlighting the possibility of additional cellular receptor loci for the viral S protein at our cells.







Abstract
The interaction of the SARS CoV2 spike glycoprotein with two sialic acid&#8208;containing trisaccharides (&#945;2,3 and &#945;2,6 sialyl N&#8208;acetyllactosamine) has been demonstrated by NMR. The NMR&#8208;based distinction between the signals of those sialic acids in the glycans covalently attached to the spike protein and those belonging to the exogenous &#945;2,3 and &#945;2,6 sialyl N&#8208;acetyllactosamine ligands has been achieved by synthesizing uniformly 13C&#8208;labelled trisaccharides at the sialic acid and galactose moieties. STD&#8208;1H,13C&#8208;HSQC NMR experiments elegantly demonstrate the direct interaction of the sialic acid residues of both trisaccharides with additional participation of the galactose moieties, especially for the &#945;2,3&#8208;linked analogue. Additional experiments with the spike protein in the presence of a specific antibody for the N&#8208;terminal domain and with the isolated receptor binding and N&#8208;terminal domains of the spike protein unambiguously show that the sialic acid binding site is located at the N&#8208;terminal domain.

         <title>Synthesis of Molecular Phenylcalcium Derivatives: Application to the Formation of Biaryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolable and hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble &#946;&#8208;diketiminato calcium phenyls are accessible from the reaction of Ph2Hg and [(BDI)CaH]2. The compounds were shown to react with bromoarenes through a direct SNAr displacement of halide, leading to the uncatalyzed formation of biaryl molecules.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble &#946;&#8208;diketiminato phenylcalcium derivatives, which display various modes of Ca&#8722;&#956;2&#8208;Ph&#8722;Ca bridging, are accessible from reactions of Ph2Hg and [(BDI)CaH]2. Although the resultant compounds are inert toward the C&#8722;H bonds of benzene, they yield selective and uncatalyzed biaryl formation when reacted with readily available aryl bromides.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Hosted Enzymes for Continuous Flow Catalysis in Aqueous and Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow enzyme reactor was developed using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to immobilize the enzyme. The MOF NU&#8208;1000 was inserted into a HPLC column and loaded with esterase without any modification of the MOF or the enzyme. A high space&#8208;time yield of 1432&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved, and the stability of the immobilized enzyme was enhanced to about 30 times that of the free enzyme.

Fully exploiting the potential of enzymes in cell&#8208;free biocatalysis requires stabilization of the catalytically active proteins and their integration into efficient reactor systems. Although in recent years initial steps towards the immobilization of such biomolecules in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been taken, these demonstrations have been limited to batch experiments and to aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate a MOF&#8208;based continuous flow enzyme reactor system, with high productivity and stability, which is also suitable for organic solvents. Under aqueous conditions, the stability of the enzyme was increased 30&#8208;fold, and the space&#8211;time yield exceeded that obtained with other enzyme immobilization strategies by an order of magnitude. Importantly, the infiltration of the proteins into the MOF did not require additional functionalization, thus allowing for time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient fabrication of the biocatalysts using label&#8208;free enzymes.

&lt;p&gt;A continuous flow enzyme reactor was developed using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to immobilize the enzyme. The MOF NU-1000 was inserted into a HPLC column and loaded with esterase without any modification of the MOF or the enzyme. A high space-time yield of 1432&#8197;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved, and the stability of the immobilized enzyme was enhanced to about 30 times that of the free enzyme.

         <title>Selective Catalytic Oxidation of Methane to Methanol in Aqueous Medium over Copper Cations Promoted by Atomically Dispersed Rhodium on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Rh on TiO2 was used for the oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen under mild conditions. Promoted by copper cations, the Rh/TiO2 catalysts produced a millimole level of methanol with a selectivity higher than 99&#8201;%. Copper maintained the low&#8208;valence state of Rh. Moreover, copper acted as a scavenger for suppressing the overoxidation, thus leading to the high selectivity of methanol.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane into value&#8208;added chemicals, such as methanol under mild conditions, is a promising route for industrial applications. In this work, atomically dispersed Rh on TiO2 suspended in an aqueous solution was used for the oxidation of methane to methanol. Promoted by copper cations (as co&#8208;catalyst) in solution, the catalysts exhibited high activity and selectivity for the production of methanol using molecular oxygen with the presence of carbon monoxide at 150&#8201;&#176;C with a reaction pressure of 31&#8197;bar. Millimole level yields of methanol were reached with the selectivity higher than 99&#8201;% using the Rh/TiO2 catalysts with the promotion of the copper cation. CO was the reductive agent to generate H2 from H2O, which led to the formation of H2O2 through the reaction of H2 and O2. Atomically dispersed Rh activated the C&#8722;H bond in CH4 and catalyzed the oxidation using H2O2. Copper cations maintained the low&#8208;valence state of Rh. Moreover, copper acted as a scavenger for suppressing the overoxidation, thus leading to the high selectivity of methanol.

         <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis Enabled Formal C&#8722;O/O&#8722;H Cross&#8208;Metathesis of 4&#8208;Alkoxy Anilines with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel alternating current promoted formal C&#8722;O/O&#8722;H cross&#8208;metathesis reaction of 4&#8208;alkoxy anilines with alcohols has been developed for the first time.







Abstract
While multiple bond metathesis reactions, for example olefin metathesis, have seen considerable recent progress, direct metathesis of traditionally inert C&#8722;O single bonds is extremely rare and particularly challenging. Undoubtedly, metathesis reaction of C&#8722;O bonds is one of the most ideal routes for the value&#8208;added upgrading of molecules involving C&#8722;O bonds. Reported here is a new protocol to achieve the formal C&#8722;O/O&#8722;H cross&#8208;metathesis via alternating current electrolysis. Featuring mild reaction conditions, the protocol allows readily available 4&#8208;alkoxy anilines and alcohols to be converted into a wide range of valuable products in highly regioselective and chemoselective manner. Moreover, the present strategy can be used in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals as well as biologically active compounds, which demonstrated the potential application.

         <title>Haptotropism in a Nickel Complex with a Neutral, &#960;&#8208;Bridging cyclo&#8208;P4 Ligand Analogous to Cyclobutadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;dependent reaction of white phosphorus with a Ni0 reagent incorporating a chelating bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) leads to complexes with neutral P2 and P4 ligands. The latter mirrors the coordination of cyclobutadiene to Ni0, displaying olefin&#8208;like bonding and &#951;2&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;haptotropism, and can be converted to the former. These findings emphasize the fluidity of cyclo&#8208;P4 coordination modes.







Abstract
Dedicated to Professor Manfred Scheer on the occasion of his 65th birthday
The reaction of (1)Ni(&#951;2&#8208;cod), 2, incorporating a chelating bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) 1, with P4 in pentane yielded the dinuclear complex [(2)Ni]2(&#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P4), 3, formally featuring a cyclobutadiene&#8208;like, neutral, rectangular, &#960;&#8208;bridging P4&#8208;ring. In toluene, the butterfly&#8208;shaped complex [(1)Ni]2(&#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P2), 4, with a formally neutral P2&#8208;unit was obtained from 2 and either P4 or 3. Computational studies showed that a haptotropic rearrangement involving two isomers of the &#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P4 coordination mode and a low&#8208;energy &#956;2,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P4 coordination mode, as previously predicted for related nickel cyclobutadiene complexes, could explain the coalescence observed in the low&#8208;temperature NMR spectra of 3. The insertion of the (1)Ni fragment into a P&#8722;P bond of P7(SiMe3)3, forming complex 5 with a norbornane&#8208;like P7 ligand, was also observed.

         <title>Selective Coupling of 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Boronic Esters at the more Substituted Site through Visible&#8208;Light Activation of Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective monofunctionalization of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters was achieved by using a catalyst&#8208;free photoinduced coupling with (hetero)aryl nitriles. The reaction proceeds through electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;driven deboronation and radical 1,2&#8208;boron shift, giving &#946;&#8208;aryl primary boronic ester products. The reaction also works with primary, secondary, and tertiary boronic esters.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;boronic esters are useful synthetic intermediates particularly as the two boronic esters can be selectively functionalized. Usually, the less hindered primary boronic ester reacts, but herein, we report a coupling reaction that enables the reversal of this selectivity. This is achieved through the formation of a boronate complex with an electron&#8208;rich aryllithium which, in the presence of an electron&#8208;deficient aryl nitrile, leads to the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex. Following visible&#8208;light photoinduced electron transfer, a primary radical is generated which isomerizes to the more stable secondary radical before radical&#8208;radical coupling with the arene radical&#8208;anion, giving &#946;&#8208;aryl primary boronic ester products. The reactions proceed under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. This method also allows stereodivergent coupling of cyclic cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters to provide trans&#8208;substituted products, complementing the selectivity observed in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Highly Graphitic Carbon Urchin&#8208;Like Hollow Structures Loaded with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms towards Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous urchin&#8208;like N&#8208;doped carbon structures with abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites (Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)) are fabricated by a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed and Ni&#8208;templated strategy. The unique hollow thorns on the surface, high accessible surface area and good conductivity enable effective electron/mass transfer and afford numerous singe&#8208;Ni sites towards highly efficient CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
The rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts featuring excellent conductivity, highly accessible discrete active sites and favorable mass transfer is crucial for electrocatalysis but remains challenging. In this study, a reliable Ni&#8208;catalyzed and Ni&#8208;templated strategy is developed to synthesize a single&#8208;atom catalyst by transforming metallic Ni into single&#8208;Ni atoms anchored on hollow porous urchin&#8208;like (HPU) N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)), which possesses high crystallinity and sufficient Ni&#8208;N4 moiety (2.4&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The unique hollow thorns on the surface, good conductivity and large external surface area facilitate electron/mass transfer and exposure of single&#8208;Ni sites. As a result, the Ni&#8208;NC(HPU) catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and high stability for CO2 electroreduction. Moreover, this synthetic strategy can also be facilely extended to prepare distinct hollow porous architectures with similar components, such as the wire&#8208; and sphere&#8208;like ones.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Shifting Molecules: Unveiling the Valence Tautomerism Phenomena in Bare Barbaralones</title>

         <dc:description>
Two valence tautomers have been revealed in the supersonic expansion for an archetypal fluxional molecule phenyl&#8208;barbaralone, providing definite experimental evidence of the [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement in these shape&#8208;shifting systems.







Abstract
We report a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic study of an archetypical barbaralone, conclusively revealing the valence tautomerism phenomena for this bistable molecular system. The two distinct 1&#8208; and 5&#8208;substituted valence tautomers have been isolated in a supersonic expansion for the first time and successfully characterized by high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy. This work provides irrefutable experimental evidence of the [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement in barbaralones and highlights the use of rotational spectroscopy to analyze shape&#8208;shifting mixtures. Moreover, this observation opens the window toward the characterization of new fluxional systems in the isolation conditions of the gas phase and should serve as a reference point in the general understanding of valence tautomerism.

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Covalent Triazine Frameworks in a NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 Eutectic Salt for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent triazine&#8208;based frameworks with ordered molecular structures were synthesized in a ternary NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 eutectic salt system at 200&#8201;&#176;C to produce photocatalysts for hydrogen production.







Abstract
Covalent triazine&#8208;based frameworks (CTFs) are typically produced by the salt&#8208;melt polycondensation of aromatic nitriles in the presence of ZnCl2. In this reaction, molten ZnCl2 salt acts as both a solvent and Lewis acid catalyst. However, when cyclotrimerization takes place at temperatures above 300&#8201;&#176;C, undesired carbonization occurs. In this study, an ionothermal synthesis method for CTF&#8208;based photocatalysts was developed using a ternary NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 eutectic salt (ES) mixture with a melting point of approximately 200&#8201;&#176;C. This temperature is lower than the melting point of pure ZnCl2 (318&#8201;&#176;C), thus providing milder salt&#8208;melt conditions. These conditions facilitated the polycondensation process, while avoiding carbonization of the polymeric backbone. The resulting CTF&#8208;ES200 exhibited enhanced optical and electronic properties, and displayed remarkable photocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Self&#8208;Replication Allows Selection for Dynamic Kinetic Stability in a System of Competing Replicators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two competing self&#8208;replicators are formed from two different dithiol building blocks through oxidation and disulfide exchange. The self&#8208;replicators differ in their size, building block composition, and dynamic kinetic stability. The slower replicator prevails over the faster competitor in a closed vial, but the outcome of the competition is reversed in an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium replication&#8211;destruction regime, implemented in a flow system.







Abstract
Among the key characteristics of living systems are their ability to self&#8208;replicate and the fact that they exist in an open system away from equilibrium. Herein, we show how the outcome of the competition between two self&#8208;replicators, differing in size and building block composition, is different depending on whether the experiments are conducted in a closed vial or in an open and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium replication&#8211;destruction regime. In the closed system, the slower replicator eventually prevails over the faster competitor. In a replication&#8208;destruction regime, implemented through a flow system, the outcome of the competition is reversed and the faster replicator dominates. The interpretation of the experimental observations is supported by a mass&#8208;action&#8208;kinetics model. These results represent one of the few experimental manifestations of selection among competing self&#8208;replicators based on dynamic kinetic stability and pave the way towards Darwinian evolution of abiotic systems.

         <title>Amorphous Boron Carbide on Titanium Dioxide Nanobelt Arrays for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic NO Reduction to NH3</title>

The a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti acts as an efficient and stable 3D electrocatalyst for converting NO to NH3, exhibiting an NH3 yield of 3678.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 87.6&#8201;%. An a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Zn&#8722;NO battery achieves both high power densities and NH3 yields. An in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic NO reduction is regarded as an attractive strategy to degrade the NO contaminant into useful NH3, but the lack of efficient and stable electrocatalysts to facilitate such multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer processes impedes its applications. Here, we report on developing amorphous B2.6C supported on a TiO2 nanoarray on a Ti plate (a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti) as an NH3&#8208;producing nanocatalyst with appreciable activity and durability toward the NO electroreduction. It shows a yield of 3678.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a FE of 87.6&#8201;%, superior to TiO2/Ti (563.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 42.6&#8201;%) and a&#8208;B2.6C/Ti (2499.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 85.6&#8201;%). An a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Zn&#8722;NO battery achieves a power density of 1.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 1125&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. An in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by theoretical calculations.
