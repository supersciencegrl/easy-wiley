         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Atom Tunneling in a Homochiral Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How would a chiral environment impact the dynamics of hydrogen atoms? Using rotational spectroscopy in combination with the solutions of a simple one&#8208;dimensional Schr&#246;dinger equation approach, we revealed the intriguing distinctions of hydrogen atom dynamics between homochiral and heterochiral dimers of trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediol.







Abstract
The role&#8208;exchanging concerted torsional motion of two hydrogen atoms in the homochiral dimer of trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediol was characterized through a combination of broadband rotational spectroscopy and theoretical modeling. The results reveal that the concerted tunneling motion of the hydrogen atoms leads to the inversion of the sign of the dipole moment components along the a and b principal axes, due to the interchange motion that cooperatively breaks and reforms one intermolecular hydrogen bond. This motion is also coupled with two acceptor switching motions. The energy difference between the two ground vibrational states arising from this tunneling motion was determined to be 29.003(2) MHz. The corresponding wavefunctions suggest that the two hydrogen atoms are evenly delocalized on two equivalent potential wells, which differs from the heterochiral case where the hydrogen atoms are confined in separate wells, as the permutation&#8208;inversion symmetry breaks down. This intriguing contrast in hydrogen&#8208;atom behavior between homochiral and heterochiral environments could further illuminate our understanding of the role of chirality in intermolecular interactions and dynamics.

         <title>Supramolecular Block Copolymers from Tricarboxamides. Biasing Co&#8208;assembly by the Incorporation of Pyridine Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;assembly of the pyridine&#8208;based tricarboxamides 2&#8211;4 with tricarboxamide 1 is investigated. Whilst the formation of the supramolecular co&#8208;polymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;2 is not possible, co&#8208;polymers poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3 and poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;4 are formed. The latter has been investigated by mass&#8208;balance model that shed an alternated blocky microstructure.







Abstract
The synthesis of a series of triangular&#8208;shaped tricarboxamides endowed with three picoline or nicotine units (compounds 2 and 3, respectively) or just one nicotine unit (compound 4) is reported, and their self&#8208;assembling features investigated. The pyridine rings make compounds 2&#8211;4 electronically complementary with our previously reported oligo(phenylene ethynylene)tricarboxamides (OPE&#8208;TA) 1 to form supramolecular copolymers. C3&#8208;symmetric tricarboxamide 2 forms highly stable intramolecular five&#8208;membered pseudocycles that impede its supramolecular polymerization into poly&#8208;2 and the co&#8208;assembly with 1 to yield copolymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;2. On the other hand, C3&#8208;symmetric tricarboxamide 3 readily forms poly&#8208;3 with great stability but unable to form helical supramolecular polymers despite the presence of the peripheral chiral side chains. The copolymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3 can only be obtained by a previous complete disassembly of the constitutive homopolymers in CHCl3. Helical poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3 arises in a process involving the transfer of the helicity from racemic poly&#8208;1 to poly&#8208;3, and the amplification of asymmetry from chiral poly&#8208;3 to poly&#8208;1. Importantly, C2v&#8208;symmetric 4, endowed with only one nicotinamide moiety and three chiral side chains, self&#8208;assembles into a P&#8208;type helical supramolecular polymer (poly&#8208;4) in a thermodynamically controlled cooperative process. The combination of poly&#8208;1 and poly&#8208;4 generates chiral supramolecular copolymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;4, whose blocky microstructure has been investigated by applying the previously reported supramolecular copolymerization model.

         <title>Template&#8208;Oriented Polyaniline&#8208;Supported Palladium Nanoclusters for Reductive Homocoupling of Furfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Pd/PANI catalysts with tunable morphologies and structures was prepared by using crystalline MnO2 as a sacrificial template. The various oxidation states of the support and the coordination modes of metal in the Pd/PANI catalysts led to differences in metal dispersion and electron structure. The most electron&#8208;rich Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI nanocluster catalyst showed the highest TOF for reductive coupling to afford a bifuran ester as a bio&#8208;plasticizer with extremely low migration resistance.







Abstract
Developing well&#8208;defined structures and desired properties for porous organic polymer (POP) supported catalysts by controlling their composition, size, and morphology is of great significance. Herein, we report a preparation of polyaniline (PANI) supported Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable structure and morphology. The protocol involves the introduction of MnO2 with different crystal structures (&#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, &#1013;) serving as both the reaction template and the oxidant. The different forms of MnO2 each convert aniline to a PANI that contains a unique regular distribution of benzene and quinone. This leads to the Pd/PANI catalysts with different charge transfer properties between Pd and PANI, as well as different dispersions of the metal NPs. In this case, the Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI catalyst greatly improves the turnover frequency (TOF; to 88.3&#8197;h&#8722;1), in the reductive coupling of furfural derivatives to potential bio&#8208;based plasticizers. Systematic characterizations reveal the unique oxidation state of the support in the Pd/&#1013;&#8208;PANI catalyst and coordination mode of Pd that drives the formation of highly dispersed Pd nanoclusters. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the more electron rich Pd/PANI catalyst has the lower energy barrier in the oxidative addition step, which favors the C&#8722;C coupling reaction.

         <title>Migration and Precipitation of Platinum in Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the complementary techniques of X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, Pt ion migration was identified as an important factor to explain the decay in performance of anion&#8208;exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells. The picture shows 3D reconstruction micro&#8208;CT images of the cross&#8208;section MEAs with Sustainion AEM and Pt/C cathode electrode after (a) 5&#8197;h and (b) 70&#8197;h of operation at 0.15&#8197;A/cm2.







Abstract
Despite the recent progress in increasing the power generation of Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), their durability is still far lower than that of Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Using the complementary techniques of X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;computed tomography (CT), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) spectroscopy, we have identified Pt ion migration as an important factor to explain the decay in performance of AEMFCs. In alkaline media Pt+2 ions are easily formed which then either undergo dissolution into the carbon support or migrate to the membrane. In contrast to PEMFCs, where hydrogen cross over reduces the ions forming a vertical &#8220;Pt line&#8221; within the membrane, the ions in the AEM are trapped by charged groups within the membrane, leading to disintegration of the membrane and failure. Diffusion of the metal components is still observed when the Pt/C of the cathode is substituted with a FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst, but in this case the Fe and Co ions are not trapped within the membrane, but rather migrate into the anode, thereby increasing the stability of the membrane.

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of Heptacoordinated FeIII Bifunctional Complexes for Efficient Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, [Fe2L2(H2O)2(SO4)].2(CH4O)] (C2), has been designed to optimize H2O splitting activity via strategically altering the ligand substitution. The favourable structural conformation with bridging &#8722;SO42&#8722; and engineered electronic environment facilitate the intramolecular oxo&#8208;oxo coupling leading to O&#8722;O bond formation during electrolysis, effectively enhanced the catalytic functionalities of C2.







Abstract
In this research, highly efficient heterogeneous bifunctional (BF) electrocatalysts (ECs) have been strategically designed by Fe coordination (CR) complexes, [Fe2L2(H2O)2Cl2] (C1) and [Fe2L2(H2O)2(SO4)].2(CH4O) (C2) where the high seven CR number synergistically modifies the electronic environment of the Fe centre for facilitation of H2O electrolysis. The electronic status of Fe and its adjacent atomic sites have been further modified by the replacement of &#8722;Cl&#8722; in C1 by &#8722;SO42&#8722; in C2. Interestingly, compared to C1, the O&#8722;S&#8722;O bridged C2 reveals superior BF activity with extremely low overpotential (&#951;) at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (140&#8197;mVOER, 62&#8197;mVHER) and small Tafel slope (120.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1OER, 45.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1HER). Additionally, C2 also facilitates a high&#8208;performance alkaline H2O electrolyzer with cell voltage of 1.54&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits remarkable long&#8208;term stability. Thus, exploration of the intrinsic properties of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based ECs opens up a new approach to the rational design of a wide range of molecular catalysts.

         <title>Reply to Correspondence on &#8220;Structural Insight into the Catalytic Mechanism of the Endoperoxide Synthase FtmOx1&#8242;&#8242;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme enzyme FtmOx1 can catalyze the endoperoxidation of fumitremorgin B, producing verruculogen. The side product of deisoprenylation becomes the major product when the analogue 13&#8208;oxo&#8208;fumitremorgin B is used as the substrate. Fumitremorgin B and 13&#8208;oxo&#8208;fumitremorgin B show similar substrate&#8208;binding patterns with FtmOx1 but different enzymatic conversions.







Abstract
The high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the ternary complex FtmOx1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2OG&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;fumitremorgin B and the catalytic mechanism were recently reported by us (DOI 10.1002/anie.202112063). In their Correspondence, Zhang, Costello, Liu et&#8197;al. criticize our work in several aspects. Herein, we address these questions one by one. These structural clarifications and new computational results further support the CarC&#8208;like mechanistic model.

Recently, Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. reported a crystal structure of a ternary complex of the non&#8208;heme iron endoperoxidase FtmOx1 (PDB entry&#8197;7ETK) and concluded that it provides evidence supporting the FtmOx1 catalysis CarC&#8208;like mechanistic model. However, this work did not accurately describe key mechanistic features and differences of the Carc&#8208;like and COX&#8208;like models, and their data do not support their conclusions.







Abstract
In their recent Angewandte Chemie publication (doi: 10.1002/anie.202112063), Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. reported the crystal structure of a ternary complex of the non&#8208;heme iron endoperoxidase FtmOx1 (PDB entry&#8197;7ETK). The biochemical data assessed in this study were from a retracted study (doi: 10.1038/nature15519) by Zhang, Liu, Zhang et&#8197;al.; no additional biochemical data were included, yet there was no discussion on the source of the biochemical data in the report by Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. Based on this new crystal structure and subsequent QM/MM&#8208;MD calculations, Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. concluded that their work provided evidence supporting the CarC&#8208;like mechanistic model for FtmOx1 catalysis. However, the authors did not accurately describe either the CarC&#8208;like model or the COX&#8208;like model, and they did not address the differences between them. Further, and contrary to their interpretations in the manuscript, the authors&#8217; data are consistent with the COX&#8208;like model once the details of the CarC&#8208;like and COX&#8208;like models have been carefully analyzed.

         <title>A Strategy for Controlling the Polymerizations of Thiyl Radical Propagation by RAFT Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy that could enable the polymerizations of thiyl radical propagation to be controlled by existing RDRP methods has been reported. The key to this strategy is the propagating thiyl radicals could undergo desulfurization with isocyanides to generate stabilized alkyl radicals, thereby allowing for controlling the polymerization via RAFT agents, leading to the formation of main&#8208;chain polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures.







Abstract
The ability to extend the polymerizations of thiyl radical propagation to be regulated by existing controlled methods would be highly desirable, yet remained very challenging to achieve because the thiyl radicals still cannot be reversibly controlled by these methods. In this article, we reported a novel strategy that could enable the radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of macrocyclic allylic sulfides, wherein propagating specie is thiyl radical, to be controlled by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents. The key to the success of this strategy is the propagating thiyl radical can undergo desulfurization with isocyanide and generate a stabilized alkyl radical for reversible control. Systematic optimization of the reaction conditions allowed good control over the polymerization, leading to the formation of polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures, exemplified by the radical block copolymerization of macrocyclic allylic sulfides and vinyl monomers and the incorporation of sequence&#8208;defined segments into the polymer backbone. This work represents a significant step toward directly enabling the polymerizations of heteroatom&#8208;centered radical propagation to be regulated by existing reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques.

         <title>Electrochemical Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first report on electrochemical AuI/AuIII catalysis for 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of C&#8722;C multiple bonds has been presented. This external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free approach utilizes the anodic oxidation of vinyl&#8208;AuI to vinyl&#8208;AuIII complexes to achieve oxy&#8208;alkynylation of allenoates to access alkyne&#8208;substituted butenolides in an undivided cell.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The first report on electrochemical Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; catalysis for 1,2-difunctionalization of C&#8722;C multiple bonds has been presented. This external-oxidant-free approach utilizes the anodic oxidation of vinyl-Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; to vinyl-Au&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes to achieve oxy-alkynylation of allenoates to access alkyne-substituted butenolides in an undivided cell.

         <title>Nano Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) with Anti&#8208;Hook Effect for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ peptide self&#8208;assembly into a nano proteolysis targeting chimeras (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) system was reported with &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221; to realize dose&#8208;dependent and long&#8208;acting protein degradation in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is an emerging pharmacological modality with innovated post&#8208;translational protein degradation capabilities. However, off&#8208;target induced unintended tissue effects and intrinsic &#8220;hook effect&#8221; hinder PROTAC biotechnology to be maturely developed. Herein, an intracellular fabricated nano proteolysis targeting chimeras (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) modality with a center&#8208;spoke degradation network for achieving efficient dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation in tumor is reported. The PROTAC precursors are triggered by higher GSH concentrations inside tumor cells, which subsequently in situ self&#8208;assemble into Nano&#8208;PROTACs through intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions. The fibrous Nano&#8208;PROTACs can form effective polynary complexes and E3 ligases degradation network with multi&#8208;binding sites, achieving dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation with &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221;. The generality and efficacy of Nano&#8208;PROTACs are validated by degrading variable protein of interest (POI) such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and androgen receptor (AR) in a wide&#8208;range dose&#8208;dependent manner with a 95&#8201;% degradation rate and long&#8208;lasting potency up to 72&#8197;h in vitro. Significantly, Nano&#8208;PROTACs achieve in vivo dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation up to 79&#8201;% and tumor growth inhibition in A549 and LNCap xenograft mice models, respectively. Taking advantages of in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy, the Nano&#8208;PROTACs provide a generalizable platform to promote precise clinical translational application of PROTAC.

         <title>Modulating Electronic Structures of Iron Clusters through Orbital Rehybridization by Adjacent Single Copper Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined density function theory calculation and experimental analysis demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent Cu&#8722;N4 single atoms could regulate the d orbitals of Fe clusters through rehybridization to improve the release of *OH intermediates, thus achieving an excellent oxygen reduction reaction kinetic.







Abstract
The atom&#8208;cluster interaction has recently been exploited as an effective way to increase the performance of metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the rational design of such catalysts and understanding their structure&#8208;property correlations remain a great challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent metal (M)&#8722;N4 single atoms (SAs) could significantly improve the ORR performance of a well&#8208;screened Fe atomic cluster (AC) catalyst by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analysis. The DFT studies suggest that the Cu&#8722;N4 SAs act as a modulator to assist the O2 adsorption and cleavage of O&#8722;O bond on the Fe AC active center, as well as optimize the release of OH* intermediates to accelerate the whole ORR kinetic. The depositing of Fe AC with Cu&#8722;N4 SAs on nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nanosheet are then constructed through a universal interfacial monomicelles assembly strategy. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the resultant catalyst exhibits an outstanding ORR performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;eV in alkali and 0.80&#8197;eV in acid, as well as a high power density of 214.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in zinc air battery. This work provides a novel strategy for precisely tuning the atomically dispersed poly&#8208;metallic centers for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Chiral Adaptive Induction of an Achiral Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Organic Framework by Dipeptides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected chiral adaptive induction of an achiral CB[8]&#8208;based supramolecular organic framework (SOF) was explored, exhibiting the opposite CD and CPL spectra in the presence of L&#8208;TrpTrp and L&#8208;PhePhe, respectively. Furthermore, this SOF demonstrates the sequence&#8208;selective chiral induction for sequences&#8208;opposite Trp&#8208;/Phe&#8208;containing dipeptides, allowing for the discrimination and differentiation of these dipeptide sequences.







Abstract
Chiral induction by natural biomolecules can reveal the indispensable role of chiral structures in life and can be used to develop the chirality&#8208;sensing biomolecular recognition. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of an achiral supramolecular organic framework (SOF&#8208;1) constructed from cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and hexaphenylbenzene (HPB) derivative (1) in water. Due to the propeller&#8208;like rotational chiral conformation of HPB units and the specific recognition properties of CB[8], SOF&#8208;1 demonstrates chiral adaptive induction in water when interacting with the N&#8208;terminal Trp&#8208;/Phe&#8208;containing dipeptides including L&#8208;TrpX and L&#8208;PheX (X is an amino acid residue), respectively, exhibiting contrasting circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra. Consequently, SOF&#8208;1 has been developed as a supramolecular host and chiroptical sensor capable of recognizing and distinguishing the sequence&#8208;opposite Trp&#8208;/Phe&#8208;containing dipeptide pairs including L&#8208;TrpX/L&#8208;XTrp and L&#8208;PheX/L&#8208;XPhe based on the sequence&#8208;selective CD responses.

         <title>Porphyrin Supramolecule as Surface Carrier Modulator Imparts Hole Transporter with Enhanced Mobility for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the charge&#8208;transport behavior of hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) is a path toward improved hole mobility and enhanced device properties when used in solar cells. Here, we design a porphyrin supramolecule to modulate the surface properties of the commonly used Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD HTM in perovskite solar cells. Upon doping monoamine FeIII porphyrin into Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, the porphyrins self&#8208;assemble into oxygen&#8208;bridged dimer&#8208;based supramolecules located at the grain boundaries of the HTM. The doped perovskite devices exhibit an increased efficiency from 19.8&#8201;% to 23.2&#8201;%, and greatly improved stability.







Abstract
Modulating the surface charge transport behavior of hole transport materials (HTMs) would be as an potential approach to improve their hole mobility, while yet realized for fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices. Here, an oxygen bridged dimer&#8208;based monoamine FeIII porphyrin supramolecule is prepared and doped in HTM film. Theoretical analyses reveal that the polaron distributed on dimer can be coupled with the parallel arranged polarons on adjacent dimers. This polaron coupling at the interface of supramolecule and HTM can resonates with hole flux to increase hole transport efficiency. Mobility tests reveal that the hole mobility of doped HTM film is improved by 8&#8208;fold. Doped perovskite device exhibits an increased efficiency from 19.8&#8201;% to 23.2&#8201;%, and greatly improved stability. This work provides a new strategy to improve the mobility of HTMs by surface carrier modulation, therefore fabricating efficient photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Modular Alcohol Click Chemistry Enables Facile Synthesis of Recyclable Polymers with Tunable Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile method to synthesize a series of recyclable plastics has been developed. It involves the step polyaddition of diols, diacrylates, and COS and arises from the discovery of a new, modular, and efficient click reaction involving alcohol.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers derived from sustainable feedstocks presents enormous challenges. Here, we develop a novel, modular, and efficient click reaction for connecting primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohols with activated alkenes via a bridge molecule of carbonyl sulfide (COS). The click reaction is successfully applied to synthesize a series of recyclable polymers by the step polyaddition of diols, diacrylates, and COS. Diols and diacrylates are common chemicals and can be produced from biorenewable sources, and COS is released as the industrial waste. In addition to sustainable monomers, the approach is atom&#8208;economical, wide in scope, metal&#8208;free, and performed under mild conditions, affording unprecedented polymers with nearly quantitative yields. The produced polymers also possess predesigned and widely tunable structure owing to the versatility of our method and the broad variety of monomers. The in&#8208;chain thiocarbonate and ester polar groups can play as breakpoints, allowing these polymers to be easily recycled. Overall, the polymers have broad prospects for green materials given their facile synthesis, readily available feedstocks, desirable performance, and chemical recyclability.

         <title>Atomization&#8208;Induced High Intrinsic Activity of a Biocompatible MgAl&#8208;LDH Supported Ru Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Efficient Radicals Scavenging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible MgAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) supported Ru single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Ru1/LDH SAE) was developed to mimic multi&#8208;enzymes. Ru1/LDH SAE shows high intrinsic peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity, which outperforms the Ru nanoclusters nanozyme by a factor of 20 and surpasses most SAEs reported so far.







Abstract
Developing efficient nanozymes to mimic natural enzymes for scavenging reactive radicals remains a significant challenge owing to the insufficient activity of conventional nanozymes. Herein, we report a novel Ru single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAE), featuring atomically dispersed Ru atoms on a biocompatible MgAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide (Ru1/LDH). The prepared Ru1/LDH SAE shows high intrinsic peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activity, which outperforms the Ru nanoclusters (NCs) nanozyme by a factor of 20 and surpasses most SAEs. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the high intrinsic POD&#8208;like activity of Ru1/LDH can be attributed to a heterolytic path of H2O2 dissociation on the single Ru sites, which requires lower free energy (0.43&#8197;eV) compared to the homolytic path dissociation on Ru NC (0.63&#8197;eV). In addition, the Ru1/LDH SAE shows excellent multiple free radicals scavenging ability, including superoxide anion radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;), hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH), nitric oxide radical (NO&#8901;) and 2, 2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH&#8901;). Given the advantages of Ru1/LDH with high enzymatic activities, biosafety, and ease to scale up, it paves the way for exploring SAEs in the practical biological immunity system.

         <title>Regulating Degradation Pathways of Polymers by Radical&#8208;Triggered Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have proposed the radical&#8208;triggered luminescence to monitor the radical behaviours during polymer degradation. It was disclosed that the pure polymers showed a single sigmoidal dynamic curve from ROO&#8901; emissions, leading to the exponential proliferation for the degradation evolution. Alternatively, the degradation pathways of polymers were regulated into a double sigmoidal curve by anti&#8208;degradation LDHs.







Abstract
Understanding the radical behaviours during polymer degradation is beneficial to unveil and regulate the degradation pathways of polymers to achieve a sustainable polymer development. However, it is a long&#8208;standing challenge to study radical behaviours owing to the ultra&#8208;short lifetime of the transient radicals generated during the polymer degradation. In this contribution, we have proposed the radical&#8208;triggered luminescence to monitor the radical behaviours during polymer degradation without/with the addition of inorganic additives. It was disclosed that the pure polymers showed a single sigmoidal dynamic curve from peroxy radicals (ROO&#8901;) emissions, leading to the exponential proliferation for the degradation evolution. Alternatively, the degradation pathways with the addition of additives, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with positively charged Al centers, could be modulated into a double sigmoidal dynamics, involving the main product of alkoxy radicals (RO&#8901;) with the activation energy of 40.2&#8197;kJ/mol and a small amount of ROO&#8901; with 76.3&#8197;kJ/mol, respectively. Accordingly, the polymers with the additive&#8208;regulated pathways could exhibit prominently anti&#8208;degradation behaviours. This work is beneficial for the deep understanding of the radical mechanisms during polymer degradation, and for the rational design of anti&#8208;degradation polymers.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Cation Solvation Structure for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile molecular engineering strategy for regulating the solvation shell of metal cations has been reported, aiming to achieve a balanced H2O activation behavior. By enriching the interface with aprotic organic molecules, the density of H2O is decreased, and a second&#8208;sphere effect is delivered to stabilize the adsorbed H2O molecule, leading to highly selective CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Balancing the activation of H2O is crucial for highly selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), as the protonation steps of CO2RR require fast H2O dissociation kinetics, while suppressing hydrogen evolution (HER) demands slow H2O reduction. We herein proposed one molecular engineering strategy to regulate the H2O activation using aprotic organic small molecules with high Gutmann donor number as a solvation shell regulator. These organic molecules occupy the first solvation shell of K+ and accumulate in the electrical double layer, decreasing the H2O density at the interface and the relative content of proton suppliers (free and coordinated H2O), suppressing the HER. The adsorbed H2O was stabilized via the second sphere effect and its dissociation was promoted by weakening the O&#8722;H bond, which accelerates the subsequent *CO2 protonation kinetics and reduces the energy barrier. In the model electrolyte containing 5&#8197;M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive (KCl&#8208;DMSO&#8208;5), the highest CO selectivity over Ag foil increased to 99.2&#8201;%, with FECO higher than 90.0&#8201;% within &#8722;0.75 to &#8722;1.15&#8197;V (vs. RHE). This molecular engineering strategy for cation solvation shell can be extended to other metal electrodes, such as Zn and Sn, and organic molecules like N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide.

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;divergent Bissilylation of Alkynoates: Scope, Mechanism, and Origin of Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed divergent bissilylation of alkynoates using disilane reagent TMDQ (see TOC graphic) is presented. Reversing regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity was obtained through addition of Lewis acids. MAD (methylaluminum bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxide) impacted electronically&#8208;favored migratory insertion through steric effect while the addition of BCF (tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane) allowed reductive elimination as the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed bissilylation reactions of alkynes with disilane reagents have become one of the most straightforward and efficient protocols to rapidly produce structurally diverse alkenyl silicon derivatives. In these reactions, the utilization of unsymmetrical disilane reagents provided the possibilities for reactivity enhancement as well as the synthetic merits in contrast to symmetrical disilane reagents. However, a major yet challenging objective is achieving precise control over the selectivity including the regioselectivity and the cis/trans&#8208;selectivity. Herein we realized the first divergent bissilylation of alkynoates with our developed air&#8208;stable disilane reagent 8&#8208;(2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetramethyldisilanyl)quinoline (TMDQ) by means of synergistic Pd/Lewis acid catalytic system. The catalytic system precisely dictates the selectivity, resulting in the divergent synthesis of 1,2&#8208;bissilyl alkenes. The power of these 1,2&#8208;bissilyl alkenes serving as the key synthetic intermediates has been clearly demonstrated by rapid construction of diverse motifs and densely functionalized biologically active compounds. In addition, the origins of the switchable selectivities were well elucidated by experimental and computational studies on the reaction mechanism and were mainly attributed to different ligand steric effects, the use of the specific disilane reagent TMDQ and the different coordination modes of different Lewis acid with alkynoates.

In these reactions, the utilization of unsymmetrical disilane reagents provided the possibilities for reactivity enhancement as well as the synthetic merits in contrast to symmetrical disilane reagents. However, a major yet challenging objective is achieving precise control over the selectivity including the regioselectivity and the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity. Herein we realized the first divergent bissilylation of alkynoates with our developed air-stable disilane reagent 8-(2-substituted-1,1,2,2-tetramethyldisilanyl)quinoline (TMDQ) by means of synergistic Pd/Lewis acid catalytic system. The catalytic system precisely dictates the selectivity, resulting in the divergent synthesis of 1,2-bissilyl alkenes. The power of these 1,2-bissilyl alkenes serving as the key synthetic intermediates has been clearly demonstrated by rapid construction of diverse motifs and densely functionalized biologically active compounds. In addition, the origins of the switchable selectivities were well elucidated by experimental and computational studies on the reaction mechanism and were mainly attributed to different ligand steric effects, the use of the specific disilane reagent TMDQ and the different coordination modes of different Lewis acid with alkynoates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Control over Reversible Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticle Folding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimanes allow the synthesis of water&#8208;soluble single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) and enable the effective unfolding with mild visible light from a compact structure into a linear chain. The unfolding of the fluorescent nanoparticles is reversible and occurs in aqueous systems, making it promising for controlling and tracing the SCNPs in biological environments.







Abstract
We introduce a class of single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) that respond to visible light (&#955;max=415&#8197;nm) with complete unfolding from their compact structure into linear chain analogues. The initial folding is achieved by a simple esterification reaction of the polymer backbone constituted of acrylic acid and polyethylene glycol carrying monomer units, introducing bimane moieties, which allow for the photochemical unfolding, reversing the ester&#8208;bond formation. The compaction and the light driven unfolding proceed cleanly and are readily followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), monitoring the change in the hydrodynamic radius (RH). Importantly, the folding reaction and the light&#8208;induced unfolding are reversible, supported by the high conversion of the photo cleavage. As the unfolding reaction occurs in aqueous systems, the system holds promise for controlling the unfolding of SCNPs in biological environments.

         <title>Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Electronegative Channels as Cationic Highways for Sustainable Lithium Metal Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electronegative 1D channels are presented as a cationic highway membrane strategy for sustainable Li metal battery anodes. Introduction of triazine rings and fluorinated groups into the COF skeletons played a viable role in enhancing salt dissociation and guiding uniform Li+ flux within the channels. The resulting COF membrane exhibited reliable Li plating/stripping cyclability and stable capacity retention in the Li/LiFePO4 full cell.







Abstract
Despite the enormous interest in Li metal as an ideal anode material, the uncontrollable Li dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase have plagued its practical application. These limitations can be attributed to the sluggish and uneven Li+ migration towards Li metal surface. Here, we report olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electronegative channels for facilitating selective Li+ transport. The triazine rings and fluorinated groups of the COFs are introduced as electron&#8208;rich sites capable of enhancing salt dissociation and guiding uniform Li+ flux within the channels, resulting in a high Li+ transference number (0.85) and high ionic conductivity (1.78&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The COFs are mixed with a polymeric binder to form mixed matrix membranes. These membranes enable reliable Li plating/stripping cyclability over 700&#8197;h in Li/Li symmetric cells and stable capacity retention in Li/LiFePO4 cells, demonstrating its potential as a viable cationic highway for accelerating Li+ conduction.

         <title>Highly Efficient Biomass Upgrading by a Ni&#8722;Cu Electrocatalyst Featuring Passivation of Water Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bimetallic Ni&#8722;Cu electrode for the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with an industrial&#8208;scale current density of up to 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been successfully developed. Superior stability and activity of the prepared electrode enable the gram&#8208;scale production of FDCA with a very high overall yield, purity, and Faradaic efficiency.







Abstract
Electricity&#8208;driven organo&#8208;oxidations have shown an increasing potential recently. However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the primary competitive reaction, especially under high current densities, which leads to low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the product and catalyst detachment from the electrode. Here, we report a bimetallic Ni&#8722;Cu electrocatalyst supported on Ni foam (Ni&#8722;Cu/NF) to passivate the OER process while the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is significantly enhanced. A current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can be achieved at 1.50&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, and both FE and yield keep close to 100&#8201;% over a wide range of potentials. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that Cu doping impedes the OH* deprotonation to O* and hereby OER process is greatly passivated. Those instructive results provide a new approach to realizing highly efficient biomass upgrading by regulating the OER activity.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystalline Poly (Triazine Imide) Nanosheets for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline poly (Triazine Imide)/Li+Cl&#8722; nanosheets with more exposed active sites and efficient charge transfer presents record apparent quantum efficiency of 25&#8201;% for photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
Poly (triazine imide) (PTI/Li+Cl&#8722;), one of the crystalline versions of polymeric carbon nitrides, holds great promise for photocatalytic overall water splitting. In principle, the photocatalytic activity of PTI/Li+Cl&#8722; is closely related to the morphology, which could be reasonably tailored by the modulation of the polycondensation process. Herein, we demonstrate that the hexagonal prisms of PTI/Li+Cl&#8722; could be converted to hexagonal nanosheets by adjusting the binary eutectic salts from LiCl/KCl or NaCl/LiCl to ternary LiCl/KCl/NaCl. Results reveal that the extension of in&#8208;plane conjugation is preferred, when the polymerisation was performed in the presence of ternary eutectic salts. The hexagonal nanosheets bears longer lifetimes of charge carriers than that of hexagonal prisms due to lower intensity of structure defects and shorter hopping distance of charge carriers along the stacking direction of triazine nanosheets. The optimized hexagonal nanosheets exhibits a record apparent quantum yield value of 25&#8201;% (&#955;=365&#8197;nm) for solar hydrogen production by one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting.

         <title>Proton/Mg2+ Co&#8208;Insertion Chemistry in Aqueous Mg&#8208;Ion Batteries: From the Interface to the Inner</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton co&#8208;insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion. At the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, hydrated Mg2+ has poor insertion kinetics and thus accumulates on the surface of VO2(B) to hydrolyze, triggering the formation of Mg&#8208;rich SEI and production of protons. In the tunnels, co&#8208;inserted/lattice H2O molecules block the Mg2+ diffusion while facilitate proton diffusion.







Abstract
Co&#8208;insertion of protons happens widely and enables divalent&#8208;ion aqueous batteries to achieve high performances. However, detailed investigations and comprehensive understandings of proton co&#8208;insertion are scarce. Herein, we demonstrate that proton co&#8208;insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion: at the interface, hdrated Mg2+ has poor insertion kinetics, and therefore accumulates and hydrolyzes to produce protons; in the tunnels, co&#8208;inserted/lattice H2O molecules block the Mg2+ diffusion while facilitate the proton diffusion. When monoclinic vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) anode is tested in Mg(CH3COO)2 aqueous solution, the formation of Mg&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase on the VO2(B) electrode and co&#8208;insertion of derived protons are probed; in the tunnels, the diffusion energy barrier of Mg2++H2O is 2.7&#8197;eV, while that of the protons is 0.37&#8197;eV.

&lt;p&gt;Proton co-insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion. At the electrode-electrolyte interface, hydrated Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has poor insertion kinetics and thus accumulates on the surface of VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(B) to hydrolyze, triggering the formation of Mg-rich SEI and production of protons. In the tunnels, co-inserted/lattice H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules block the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion while facilitate proton diffusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-insertion of protons happens widely and enables divalent-ion aqueous batteries to achieve high performances. However, detailed investigations and comprehensive understandings of proton co-insertion are scarce. Herein, we demonstrate that proton co-insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion: at the interface, hdrated Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has poor insertion kinetics, and therefore accumulates and hydrolyzes to produce protons; in the tunnels, co-inserted/lattice H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules block the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion while facilitate the proton diffusion. When monoclinic vanadium dioxide (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(B)) anode is tested in Mg(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; aqueous solution, the formation of Mg-rich solid electrolyte interphase on the VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(B) electrode and co-insertion of derived protons are probed; in the tunnels, the diffusion energy barrier of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;+H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is 2.7&#8197;eV, while that of the protons is 0.37&#8197;eV. Thus, protons dominate the subsequent insertion and inner diffusion. As a consequence, the VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(B) achieves a high capacity of 257.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high rate retention of 59.1&#8201;% from 1 to 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and stable cyclability of 3000 times with a capacity retention of 81.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Platinum and Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Ceria as Dual&#8208;Active Sites for Efficient Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;active sites comprising Pt clusters and frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) on porous CeO2 nanorods provide an interface&#8208;independent pathway to boost the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction at low temperatures. The FLP sites enable strong adsorption of CO2 for efficient activation, but weak adsorption of CO that suppresses CH4 formation.







Abstract
The low&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction faces the following obstacles: low activity and unsatisfactory selectivity. Herein, the dual&#8208;active sites of platinum (Pt) clusters and frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) on porous CeO2 nanorods (Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2) provide an interface&#8208;independent pathway to boost high performance RWGS reaction at low temperatures. Mechanistic investigations illustrate that Pt clusters can effectively activate and dissociate H2. The FLP sites, instead of the metal and support interfaces, not only enhance the strong adsorption and activation of CO2, but also significantly weaken CO adsorption on FLP to facilitate CO release and suppress the CH4 formation. With the help of hydrogen spillover from Pt to PN&#8722;CeO2, the Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2 catalysts achieved a CO yield of 29.6&#8201;%, which is very close to the thermodynamic equilibrium yield of CO (29.8&#8201;%) at 350&#8201;&#176;C. Meanwhile, the Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2 catalysts delivered a large turnover frequency of 8720&#8197;h&#8722;1. Moreover, Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2 operated stably and continuously for at least 840&#8197;h. This finding provides a promising path toward optimizing the RWGS reaction.

         <title>Anomalous Charge Transfer from Organic Ligands to Metal Halides in Zero&#8208;Dimensional [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5 Enabled by Pressure&#8208;Induced Lone Pair&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge transfer from organic ligands to metal halides in zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrids [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5 is achieved through pressure modulation. It leads to high excitonic emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. In situ experimental and theoretical methods show that the pressure&#8208;induced electronic coupling between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of Sb3+ and the &#960; electrons of benzene acts as an unexpected &#8220;bridge&#8221; for the charge transfer.







Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional (low&#8208;D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have emerged as fascinating candidates for optoelectronics due to their integrated properties from both organic and inorganic components. However, for most of low&#8208;D OMHHs, especially the zero&#8208;D (0D) compounds, the inferior electronic coupling between organic ligands and inorganic metal halides prevents efficient charge transfer at the hybrid interfaces and thus limits their further tunability of optical and electronic properties. Here, using pressure to regulate the interfacial interactions, efficient charge transfer from organic ligands to metal halides is achieved, which leads to a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) at around 6.0&#8197;GPa in a 0D OMHH, [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the pressure&#8208;induced electronic coupling between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of Sb3+ and the &#960; electrons of benzene ring (lp&#8208;&#960; interaction) serves as an unexpected &#8220;bridge&#8221; for the charge transfer. Our work opens a versatile strategy for the new materials design by manipulating the lp&#8208;&#960; interactions in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid systems.

         <title>Performance Descriptors for Catalysts Based on Molybdenum, Tungsten, or Rhenium Oxides for Metathesis of Ethylene with 2&#8208;Butenes to Propene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis revealed the fundamentals of in situ transformation of M(W, Mo or Re)Ox into M&#8208;carbenes in C2H4&#8722;2&#8208;C4H8 metathesis to C3H6. Their concentration and intrinsic activity follow the order Re&gt;Mo&#8811;W. The concentration but not the activity can be increased through the usage of metathesis&#8208;inactive ZrO2 cocatalyst. The enhancing effect depends on the ability of ZrO2 to activate CH bonds in 2&#8208;butenes.







Abstract
The metathesis of ethylene with 2&#8208;butenes to propene is an established large&#8208;scale process. However, the fundamentals behind in situ transformation of supported WOx, MoOx, or ReOx species into catalytically active metal&#8208;carbenes and the intrinsic activity of the latter as well as the role of metathesis&#8208;inactive cocatalysts are still unsolved. This is detrimental for catalyst development and process optimization. In this study, we provide the required essentials derived from steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis. For the first time, the steady&#8208;state concentration, the lifetime, and the intrinsic reactivity of metal carbenes were determined. The obtained results can be directly used for the design and the preparation of metathesis&#8208;active catalysts and cocatalysts, thereby opening up possibilities for optimizing propene productivity.

         <title>Designing F/P Hybrid Polymer as Ultrastable Cationic Shielding Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the on&#8208;demand development of phosphonium fluoropolymers as the electrostatic shielding interlayer to stabilize Li metal anodes, where the periodic arrangement of F/P units not only adaptively homogenized electric field distribution to induce dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, but also restrained undesirable coating decomposition to provide persistent protection for long&#8208;term battery cycling.







Abstract
Dendrite growth on electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase has severely limited applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we developed an ionic alternating polymer with fluorocarbons and phosphonium cations in repeating units to regulate Li deposition for the first time. The combined functionalities in the F/P hybrid polymer exhibit remarkable characteristics as a protective layer on top of Li anode, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical stability, ion flux redistributing capability and adaptive chain mobility. Based on characterizations and simulations, this cationic interlayer could effectively furnish long&#8208;standing electrostatic shielding for anodes, allowing restrained coating decomposition and homogenized electric field distribution to induce dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, and enabling full cells with enhanced rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance. Given the importance of LMBs, this work will promote polymer design to stabilize anodes with superior electrochemical behavior.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation to Formate over Edge&#8208;Sulfur Vacancies of Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Edge&#8208;rich MoS2 is presented as a promising catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate with superior activity and stability. The selective formation of formate is enabled by using surface OH* and H* species from H2O dissociation on the edge&#8208;sulfur vacancies as moderate hydrogenating agents.







Abstract
Synthesis of formate from hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is an atom&#8208;economic reaction but is confronted with challenges in developing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for application of the process. Herein, we report a highly durable edge&#8208;rich molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to formate at 200&#8201;&#176;C, which delivers a high selectivity of over 99&#8201;% with a superior turnover frequency of 780.7&#8197;h&#8722;1 surpassing those of previously reported non&#8208;precious metal catalysts. Multiple experimental characterization techniques combined with theoretical calculations reveal that sulfur vacancies at MoS2 edges are the active sites and the selective production of formate is enabled via a completely new water&#8208;mediated hydrogenation mechanism, in which surface OH* and H* species in dynamic equilibrium with water serve as moderate hydrogenating agents for CO2 with residual O* reduced by hydrogen. This study provides a new route for developing low&#8208;cost high&#8208;performance catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to formate.

         <title>One/Two&#8208;Photon&#8208;Excited ESIPT&#8208;Attributed Coordination Polymers with Wide Temperature Range and Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One/two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited long persistent luminescence (LPL) was obtained in an ESIPT&#8208;attributed CdII coordination polymer (LIFM&#8208;106) with wide temperature range (100&#8211;380&#8197;K) and color tune. Comparative study manifests the rational ligand modification and J&#8208;aggregation in LIFM&#8208;106 enhances the competitiveness of monomer LPL to counter&#8208;balance the excimer emission.







Abstract
The multiple metastable excited states provided by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) molecules are beneficial to bring temperature&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL). Meanwhile, ESIPT molecules are intrinsically suitable to be modulated as D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure to obtain both one/two&#8208;photon excitation and LPL emission simultaneously. Herein, we report the rational design of a dynamic CdII coordination polymer (LIFM&#8208;106) from ESIPT ligand to achieve the above goals. By comparing LIFM&#8208;106 with the counterparts, we established a temperature&#8208;regulated competitive relationship between singlet excimer and triplet LPL emission. The optimization of ligand aggregation mode effectively boost the competitiveness of the latter. In result, LIFM&#8208;106 shows outstanding one/two&#8208;photon excited LPL performance with wide temperature range (100&#8211;380&#8197;K) and tunable color (green to red). The multichannel radiation process was further elucidated by transient absorption and theoretical calculations, benefiting for the application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems.

         <title>A Nuclearity&#8208;Dependent Enantiodivergent Epoxide Opening via Enthalpy&#8208;Controlled Mononuclear and Entropy&#8208;Controlled Dinuclear (Salen)Titanium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nuclearity&#8208;dependent enantiodivergent epoxide opening reaction has been developed by mononuclear (salen)TiIII complex and its self&#8208;assembled oxygen&#8208;bridged dinuclear counterparts within the same stereogenic ligand scaffold. Mechanistic studies reveal that the nuclearity&#8208;distinct catalysts regulate the enthalpy and entropy controlling modes in the enantiodifferentiation process to achieve profound chirality inversion.







Abstract
A nuclearity&#8208;dependent enantiodivergent epoxide opening reaction has been developed, in which both antipodes of chiral alcohol products are selectively accessed by mononuclear (salen)TiIII complex and its self&#8208;assembled oxygen&#8208;bridged dinuclear counterparts within the same stereogenic ligand scaffold. Kinetic studies based on the Eyring equation revealed an enthalpy&#8208;controlled enantio&#8208;differentiation mode in mononuclear catalysis, whereas an entropy&#8208;controlled one in dinuclear catalysis. DFT calculations outline the origin of the enantiocontrol of the mononuclear catalysis and indicate the actual catalyst species in the dinuclear catalytic system. The mechanistic insights may shed a light on a strategy for stereoswichable asymmetric catalysis utilizing nuclearity&#8208;distinct transition&#8208;metal complexes.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 Clusters as Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Selective H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 cluster electrocatalysts were prepared through a mild and facile synthetic method, affording excellent 2 e&#8722; ORR activity for efficient and selective H2O2 synthesis.







Abstract
Co&#8208;based material catalysts have shown attractive application prospects in the 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, for the industrial synthesis of H2O2, there is still lack of Co&#8208;based catalysts with high production yield rate. Here, novel cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 cluster catalysts were prepared via a mild and facile method. The catalyst exhibited remarkable H2O2 selectivity (94.2&#8201;% ~ 98.2&#8201;%), good stability (99&#8201;% activity retention after 35&#8197;h), and ultra&#8208;high H2O2 production yield rate (5.58&#8197;mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the H&#8208;type electrolytic cell), demonstrating its promising industrial application potential. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the cyclodextrin&#8208;mediated Co(OH)2 electronic structure optimizes the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and significantly enhances the activation energy barrier for dissociation, leading to the high reactivity and selectivity for the 2 e&#8722; ORR. This work offers a valuable and practical strategy to design Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.

Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the cyclodextrin-mediated Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electronic structure optimizes the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and significantly enhances the activation energy barrier for dissociation, leading to the high reactivity and selectivity for the 2 e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR. This work offers a valuable and practical strategy to design Co-based electrocatalysts for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;emissive Iridium(III) Complexes as Phosphorescent Probes with Orthogonal Responses to Analyte Binding and Oxygen Quenching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported dual&#8208;emissive iridium(III) complexes bearing a di(2&#8208;picolyl)&#8208;amine (DPA) unit, which exhibited green and red dual phosphorescence in aqueous solutions. The complexes exhibited static and dynamic phosphorescence quenching in response to copper(II) ions and oxygen, respectively, at different wavelengths, achieving colorimetric emission response in solutions and multichannel response in live cell imaging.







Abstract
Phosphorescent probes often show sensitive response toward analytes at a specific wavelength. However, oxygen quenching usually occurs at the same wavelength and thus hinders the accurate detection of analytes. In this study, we have developed dual&#8208;emissive iridium(III) complexes that exhibit phosphorescence responses to copper(II) ions at a wavelength distinct from that where oxygen quenching occurs. The complexes displayed colorimetric phosphorescence response in aqueous solutions under different copper(II) and oxygen conditions. In cellular imaging, variation in oxygen concentration over a large range from 5&#8201;% to 80&#8201;% can modulate the intensity and lifetime of green phosphorescence without affecting the response of red phosphorescence toward intracellular copper(II) ions.

         <title>Pore Modulation of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of HOFs with unique pore structures have been designed by precise pore modulation engineering through the introduction of structure directing agents, including HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 with a one&#8208;dimensional pearl&#8208;chain channel that balances size control, adsorption capacity, and functional sites for efficient storage and separation of propylene.







Abstract
Developing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) that combine functional sites, size control, and storage capability for targeting gas molecule capture is a novel and challenging venture. However, there is a lack of effective strategies to tune the hydrogen&#8208;bonded network to achieve high&#8208;performance HOFs. Here, a series of HOFs termed as HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;M (M=1, 2, and 3) with different pore structures are obtained by introducing structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs) into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP). These HOFs have distinct space configurations with pore channels ranging from discrete to continuous multi&#8208;dimensional. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals a rare diversity of hydrogen&#8208;bonding models dominated by SDAs. HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2, which forms a strong layered hydrogen&#8208;bonding network with ammonium (NH4+) through multiple carboxyl groups, has a suitable 1D &#8220;pearl&#8208;chain&#8221; channel for the selective capture of propylene (C3H6). At 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, the C3H6 storage density of HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 reaches 0.6&#8197;kg&#8201;L&#8722;1, representing one of the best C3H6 storage materials, while offering a propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) selectivity of 12.2. Theoretical calculations and in situ SCXRD provide a detailed analysis of the binding strength of C3H6 at different locations in the pearl&#8208;chain channel. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirm that HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 can effectively separate C3H6 from multi&#8208;mixtures.

         <title>Xylene Synthesis Through Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation and Toluene Methylation Over a Composite ZnZrO Zeolite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective xylene synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation was achieved by regulating the interaction between two active components of a composite catalyst through a toluene&#8208;containing coupling reaction. The relationship between ZnZrO and the zeolite involved in the promotion effect were explored with detailed characterization.







Abstract
Selective synthesis of specific value&#8208;added aromatics from CO2 hydrogenation is of paramount interest for mitigating energy and climate problems caused by CO2 emission. Herein, we report a highly active composite catalyst of ZnZrO and HZSM&#8208;5 (ZZO/Z5&#8208;SG) for xylene synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation via a coupling reaction in the presence of toluene, achieving a xylene selectivity of 86.5&#8201;% with CO2 conversion of 10.5&#8201;%. A remarkably high space time yield of xylene could reach 215&#8197;mg&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, surpassing most reported catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The enhanced performance of ZZO/Z5&#8208;SG could be due to high dispersion and abundant oxygen vacancies of the ZZO component for CO2 adsorption, more feasible hydrogen activation and transfer due to the close interaction between the two components, and enhanced stability of the formate intermediate. The consumption of methoxy and methanol from the deep hydrogenation of formate by introduced toluene also propels an oriented conversion of CO2.

         <title>Intracellular Molecules Induced Extracellular Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly for Efficient and Effective In Situ Cell Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unavoidable leaky protein expression limits in situ cell purification of synthetic mRNA switches. Harnessing the power of controlled self&#8208;assembly, we use synthetic mRNA switch to convey intracellular biomarker information into enzyme&#8208;controlled toxic assemblies only on the surface of undesired cells, promising high purity and high retention of target cells.







Abstract
Synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) switches are powerful tools for in situ cell purification, especially for cells derived from stem cells. However, the retention effectiveness of the target cells is limited by the leaky expression of toxic protein. The elimination efficiency of non&#8208;target cells is also constrained due to the lack of signal amplification. In this study, we designed a novel approach that uses synthetic mRNA switch to convey intracellular marker molecule information into spatially controlled extracellular toxic assembly formation. The approach bypasses the use of toxic protein to ensure high target cell recovery effectiveness. Meanwhile, the marker molecule information is amplified at multiple levels to ensure high non&#8208;target cell elimination effectiveness. Our approach can be tailored to meet various in situ cell purification needs, promising high&#8208;quality in situ cell purification for a wide range of biomedical applications.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life, High&#8208;Rate Rechargeable Lithium Batteries Based on Soluble Bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) Disulfide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) disulfide (Pym2S2) has proven to be a high rate cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. The superdelocalization of pyrimidyl groups is reducing the S&#8722;S bond dissociation energy, which depletes the intrinsic energy barrier of dissociated electron transfer. The lithium half cell achieves 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C. In addition, the cell shows a capacity retention of 78.0&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles at 30&#8197;C.







Abstract
Organosulfides are promising candidates as cathode materials for the development of electric vehicles and energy storage systems due to their low&#8208;cost and high capacity properties. However, they generally suffer from slow kinetics because of the large rearrangement of S&#8722;S bonds and structural degradation upon cycling in batteries.

     alt="Long-Life, High-Rate Rechargeable Lithium Batteries Based on Soluble Bis(2-pyrimidyl) Disulfide Cathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bis(2-pyrimidyl) disulfide (Pym&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has proven to be a high rate cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. The superdelocalization of pyrimidyl groups is reducing the S&#8722;S bond dissociation energy, which depletes the intrinsic energy barrier of dissociated electron transfer. The lithium half cell achieves 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C. In addition, the cell shows a capacity retention of 78.0&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles at 30&#8197;C.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organosulfides are promising candidates as cathode materials for the development of electric vehicles and energy storage systems due to their low-cost and high capacity properties. However, they generally suffer from slow kinetics because of the large rearrangement of S&#8722;S bonds and structural degradation upon cycling in batteries. In this paper, we reveal that soluble bis(2-pyrimidyl) disulfide (Pym&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be a high-rate cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. Benefiting from the superdelocalization of pyrimidyl group, the extra electrons prefer to be localized on the &#960;* (pyrimidyl group) than &#963;* (S&#8722;S bond) molecular orbitals initially, generating the anion-like intermedia of [Pym&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and thus decreasing the dissociation energy of the S&#8722;S bond. It makes the intrinsic energy barrier of dissociative electron transfer depleted, therefore the lithium half cell exhibits 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C. This study provides a distinct pathway for the design of high-rate, long-cycle-life organic cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NH4+ Charge Carrier Coordinated H&#8208;Bonded Organic Small Molecule for Fast and Superstable Rechargeable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key H&#8208;bonding networks between octuple&#8208;active 2, 7&#8208;dinitropyrene&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone and tetrahedral NH4+ charge carrier is designed, which conquers its stability barrier in aqueous electrolyte and achieves fast diffusion kinetics of non&#8208;metallic charge carrier. A unique two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron NH4+ coordination mechanism brings the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity, superior rate capability and superstable cyclability.







Abstract
Organic small molecules as high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Zn&#8208;organic batteries have inspired numerous interests, but are trapped by their easy&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes. Here we knit ultrastable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks between 2, 7&#8208;dinitropyrene&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone (DNPT) and NH4+ charge carrier. DNPT with octuple&#8208;active carbonyl/nitro centers (H&#8208;bond acceptor) are redox&#8208;exclusively accessible for flexible tetrahedral NH4+ ions (H&#8208;bond donator) but exclude larger and rigid Zn2+, due to a lower activation energy (0.14 vs. 0.31&#8197;eV). NH4+ coordinated H&#8208;bonding chemistry conquers the stability barrier of DNPT in electrolyte, and gives fast diffusion kinetics of non&#8208;metallic charge carrier. A stable two&#8208;step 4e&#8722; NH4+ coordination with DNPT cathode harvests a high capacity (320&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), a high&#8208;rate capability (50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an ultralong life (60,000 cycles). This finding points to a new paradigm for H&#8208;bond stabilized organic small molecules to design advanced zinc batteries.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Impact Electrochemistry Reveals Kinetics Information of Metal&#8208;Ion Battery Materials with Multiple Redox Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical processes of individual Prussian blue particles with two distinct redox centres were investigated using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry, which successfully revealed the precise kinetic mechanism of each oxidation/reduction reaction aided by theoretical simulation. A partially contradictory conclusion between single&#8208;particle analysis and the ensemble&#8208;averaged measurement was also discussed.







Abstract
Prussian blue (PB) has emerged as a promising cathode material in aqueous batteries. It possesses two distinct redox centers, and the potassium ions (K+) are unevenly distributed throughout the compound, adding complexity to the interpretation of the K+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion kinetic mechanism. Traditional ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements are limited in uncovering the precise kinetic information of the PB particles, as the results are influenced by the construction of the porous composite electrode and the redox behavior from different particles. In this study, the electrochemical processes of individual PB particles were investigated using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. By varying the potentials, different types of transient current signals were obtained that revealed the kinetic mechanism of each oxidation/reduction reaction in combination with theoretical simulation. Additionally, a partially contradictory conclusion between single&#8208;particle analysis and the ensemble&#8208;averaged measurement was discussed. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the electrochemical processes of cathode materials with multiple redox centers, which facilitates the development of effective strategies to optimize these materials.

         <title>A Homo&#8208;Mannich Reaction Strategy Enables Collective Access to Ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homo&#8208;Mannich reaction of cyclopropanol with an iminium ion, generated by an asymmetric allylic dearomatization of indole, has been developed to construct a tricyclic hydrocarbazole core. This approach enables a collective asymmetric synthesis of ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus alkaloids having either a five&#8208;, six&#8208;, or seven&#8208;membered E ring.







Abstract
We report here a homo&#8208;Mannich reaction of cyclopropanol with an iminium ion, generated by an asymmetric allylic dearomatization of indole, to construct a tricyclic hydrocarbazole core, which is shared by a variety of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids across families. Through this approach, an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center as well as an allyl and a ketone group were installed. Using this functionalized hydrocarbazole as the structural platform, D ring and E rings of different sizes (i.e., five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered) were successively or simultaneously assembled, leading to a collective asymmetric synthesis of seven alkaloids belonging to the ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus alkaloid families.

         <dc:description>Hydrogenation reactions are staple transformations commonly used across scientific fields to synthesise pharmaceuticals, natural products, and various functional materials. However, the vast majority of these reactions require the use of a toxic and costly catalyst leading to unpractical, hazardous and often functionally limited conditions. Herein, we report a new, general, practical, efficient, mild and high&#8208;yielding hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical method for the reduction of alkene, alkyne, nitro and azido groups. Finally, this method has been applied to deuterium labelling.</dc:description>

         <title>MIDA and TIDA Boronates Stabilize &#945;&#8208;Radicals Through B&#8208;N Hyperconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional organoboron compounds increasingly enable the simple generation of complex, Csp3&#8208;rich small molecules. The ability of boron&#8208;containing functional groups to modify the reactivity of &#160;&#945;&#8208;radicals has also enabled a myriad of chemical reactions. Boronic esters with vacant p&#8208;orbitals have a significant stabilizing effect on &#945;&#8208;radicals due to delocalization of spin density into the empty orbital. The effect of coordinatively saturated derivatives, such as N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates and counterparts, remains less clear. Herein, we demonstrate that coordinatively saturated MIDA and TIDA boronates stabilize secondary alkyl &#945;&#8208;radicals via &#963;B&#8208;N hyperconjugation in a manner that allows site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H bromination. DFT calculated radical stabilization energies and spin density maps as well as LED&#8208;NMR kinetic analysis of photochemical bromination rates of different boronic esters further these findings. This work clarifies that the &#945;&#8208;radical stabilizing effect of boronic esters does not only proceed via delocalization of radical character into vacant boron p&#8208;orbitals, but that hyperconjugation of tetrahedral boron&#8208;containing functional groups and their ligand electron delocalizing ability also play a critical role. These findings establish boron ligands as a useful dial for tuning reactivity at the a&#8208;carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Fe&#8208;N4 Sites through Anion Exchange&#8208;mediated Transformation of Fe Coordination Environments in Hierarchical Carbon Support for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal single atoms (SAs) anchored in carbon support via coordinating with N atoms are efficient active sites to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, rational design of single atom catalysts with highly exposed active sites is challenging and urgently desirable. Herein, an anion exchange strategy is presented to fabricate Fe&#8208;N4 moieties anchored in hierarchical carbon nanoplates composed of hollow carbon spheres (Fe&#8208;SA/N&#8208;HCS). With the coordinating O atoms are substituted by N atoms, Fe SAs with Fe&#8208;O4 configuration are transformed into the ones with Fe&#8208;N4 configuration during the thermal activation process. Insights into the evolution of central atoms demonstrate that the SAs with specific coordination environment can be obtained by modulating in situ anion exchange process. The strategy produces a large quantity of electrochemical accessible site and high utilization rate of Fe&#8208;N4. Fe&#8208;SA/N&#8208;HCS shows excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH, and outstanding performance when used in rechargeable aqueous and flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries. The evolution pathway for SAs demonstrated in this work offers a novel strategy to design SACs with various coordination environment and enhanced electrocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Second&#8208;Annealed 2D/3D Perovskite Films with Graded Energy Funnels and Toughened Heterointerfaces for Efficient and Durable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures have been widely investigated to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, rational manipulation of phase distribution and energy level alignment in such 2D/3D perovskite hybrids are still of great challenge. Herein, we successfully achieved spontaneous phase alignment of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures by concurrently introducing both 2D perovskite component and organic halide additive. The graded phase distribution of 2D perovskites with different n values and 3D perovskites induced favorable energy band alignment across the perovskite film and boosted the charge transfer at the relevant heterointerfaces. Moreover, the 2D perovskite component also acted as a &#8220;band&#8208;aid&#8221; to simultaneously passivate the defects and release the residual tensile stress of perovskite films. Encouragingly, the blade&#8208;coated PSCs based on only ~2s in&#8208;situ flash annealed 2D/3D perovskite films with favorable energy funnels and toughened heterointerfaces achieved promising efficiencies of 22.5%, accompanied by extended lifespan. To our knowledge, this is the highest reported efficiency for the PSCs fabricated with energy&#8208;saved thermal treatment just within a few seconds, which also outperformed those state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art annealing&#8208;free analogues. Such two&#8208;seconds in&#8208;situ annealing technique could save the energy cost by up to 99.6% during device fabrication, which will grant its low&#8208;coast implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Containing Foldamer&#8208;Based Artificial Lithium Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike many other biologically relevant ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl&#8208;, etc) and protons, whose cellular concentrations are closely regulated by highly selective channel proteins, Li+ ion is unusual in that its concentration is well tolerated over many orders of magnitude and that no lithium&#8208;specific channel proteins have so far been identified. While one naturally evolved primary pathway for lithium ions to traverse across the cell membrane is through sodium channels by competing with sodium ions, highly sought&#8208;after artificial lithium&#8208;transporting channels remain a major challenge to develop. Here we show that sulfur&#8208;containing organic nanotubes derived from intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded helically folded aromatic foldamers of 3.6 &#197; in hollow cavity diameter could facilitate highly selective and efficient transmembrane transport of Li+ ions, with high transport selectivity factors of 14.9 and 18.4 over Na+ and K+ ions, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing the Magnetic Blocking Temperature of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), magnetic complexes capable of retaining magnetization blocking for a long time at elevated temperatures, has been a major concern for magnetochemists over the last three decades. In this review, we describe basic SMMs and the different approaches that allow high magnetization&#8208;blocking temperatures to be reached. We focus on the basic factors affecting magnetization blocking, magnetic axiality and the height of the blocking barrier, which can be used to group different families of complexes in terms of their SMM efficiency. Finally, we discuss several practical routes for the design of mono&#8208; and polynuclear complexes that could be applied in memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating&#160;the Sequence Structure of Conjugated Block Copolymers&#160;Enables Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) based on conjugated block copolymers (CBCs) by covalently bonding polymer donor and polymer acceptor become more and more appealing, due to the formation of favorable and stable morphology. Unfortunately, deeply understanding the effect of the assembly behavior caused by sequence structure of CBCs on the device performance is still ambiguous. Herein, from the aspect of manipulating the sequence length and distribution regularity of CBCs, we synthesized a series of new CBCs, namely D18(20)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT, D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT and D18(60)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT by two&#8208;pot polymerization, and D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT(r) by traditional one&#8208;pot method. It is observed that precise manipulation of sequence length and distribution regularity of the polymer blocks fine&#8208;tunes the self&#8208;assembly of the CBCs, optimizes film morphology, improves optoelectronic properties and reduces energy loss, leading to simultaneously improved efficiency and stability. Among these CBCs, the D18(40)&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based device achieves a champion efficiency of 13.4% with enhanced stability, which is the outstanding performance of SCOSCs. Importantly, the regular sequence distribution and suitable sequence length of the CBCs enable a facile film&#8208;forming process of the printed device. For the first time, the blade&#8208;coated large&#8208;area rigid/flexible SCOSCs are fabricated, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.62%/10.73%, much higher than their corresponding binary devices.</dc:description>

For the first time, the blade-coated large-area rigid/flexible SCOSCs are fabricated, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.62%/10.73%, much higher than their corresponding binary devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tris&#8208;benzo[cd]indole Cyanine Enables the NIR&#8208;photosensitized Radical and Thiol&#8208;ene Polymerizations at 940 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing heptamethine (HM+) incorporating three bulky benzo[cd]indole heterocycles was designed to efficiently prevent self&#8208;aggregation of the dye, which results in a strong enhancement of its photoinitiating reactivity as compared to a parent bis&#8208;benzo[cd]indole heptamethine (HMCl+) used as a reference system. In this context, we highlight an efficient free&#8208;radical NIR&#8208;polymerization up to a 100% acrylates C=C bonds conversion even under air conditions. Such an important initiating performance was obtained by incorporating our NIR&#8208;sensitizer into a three&#8208;component system leading to its self&#8208;regeneration. This original photoredox cycle was thoroughly investigated through the identification of each intermediary species using EPR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>High Throughput Multidimensional Kinetic Screening in Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An automated high throughput multidimensional reaction screening platform based on an inline Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR) is presented. By combining flow chemistry, machine automation and inline analysis, the platform is able to screen reactions in multidimensions (residence time, monomer concentration, degree of polymerization, reaction temperature and monomer conversion) rapidly and efficiently way. Kinetic data libraries associated with high data precision (absolute error &lt; 4 %), high reproducibility and high data density are built with ease from the platform. To test the method, we screened the RAFT polymerization of methyl acrylate in unmatched detail, and the ring opening metathesis polymerization of methyl&#8208;5&#8208;norbornene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate. The method we introduce is a key step in providing &#8216;big data&#8217; for data driven research in the future, and already at present allows for precise prediction of reaction outcomes within the high&#8208;dimensional chemical parameter space that is screened.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiroptical Amplification of Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Nucleotide&#8208;Templated Supramolecular Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from purely organic molecules holds great promise for applications in displays, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving high dissymmetry values (glum) from organic chromophores remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a bioinspired approach using adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;triggered supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene diimide&#8208;derived monomer (ANSG) to induce CPL with a remarkable glum value of 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2. The ANSG molecules undergo a templated, chiral self&#8208;assembly through a cooperative growth mechanism in the presence of ATP, resulting in scrolled nanotubes with aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) and induced CPL. Furthermore, we demonstrate the concept of chiroptical amplification of induced CPL by efficiently amplifying asymmetry using a mixture of chiral ATP and achiral pyrophosphate. This innovative approach opens numerous opportunities in the emerging field of circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling New Approaches:&#160;Recent Advances in Processing Aliphatic Polycarbonate&#8208;Based Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic polycarbonates (aPCs) have become increasingly popular as functional materials due to their biocompatibility and capacity for on&#8208;demand degradation. Advances in polymerization techniques and the introduction of new functional monomers have expanded the library of aPCs available, offering a diverse range of chemical compositions and structures. To accommodate the emerging requirements of new applications in biomedical and energy&#8208;related fields, various manufacturing techniques have been adopted for processing aPC&#8208;based materials. However, a summary of these techniques has yet to be conducted. The aim of this paper is to enrich the toolbox available to researchers, enabling them to select the most suitable technique for their materials. In this paper, a concise review of the recent progress in processing techniques, including controlled self&#8208;assembly, electrospinning, additive manufacturing, and other techniques, is presented. We also highlight the specific challenges and opportunities for the sustainable growth of this research area and the successful integration of aPCs in industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>H2&#8208;free Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Butadiene by the Atomic Sieving Effect of Pd Membrane with Tree&#8208;like Pd Dendrites Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2&#8208;free semi&#8208;hydrogenation at room temperature shows great advantage for replacing the thermocatalytic process in industry owing to the high energy and resource saving, however, remains great challenges. Herein, a tree&#8208;like Pd dendrites array decorated Pd membrane was constructed as the core device in an electrochemistry assisted gas&#8208;fed membrane reactor for butadiene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. It reveals that hydrogen atomic sieving effect of this Pd&#8208;based membrane under electrochemical condition was the key for semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The configuration study of Pd nanostructured membrane demonstrates that the penetration of hydrogen atoms through Pd membrane from electrochemical side to chemical side is affected by the consumption of hydrogen atom in semi&#8208;hydrogenation step. Such atomic sieving property of nanostructured Pd membrane with 5.1 times increase in catalytic active surface area brings above 14 times higher in butadiene conversion than that of bare Pd foil, with ~90% of butenes selectivity at butadiene conversion ~98% over 300h of H2&#8208;free reaction under 15 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Trifluoromethylketones from Alkyl Bromides and Trifluoroacetic Anhydride by Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones are a type of unique fluorine&#8208;containing subunit which plays a significant role in altering the physical and biological properties of molecules. However, catalytic methods to provide direct access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones is highly desirable yet remains underdeveloped, partially due to the high reactivity and instability of trifluoroacetyl radical. Herein, we report a photocatalytic synthesis of trifluoromethyl ketones from alkyl bromides with trifluoroacetic anhydride. The reaction features a dual catalysis of visible&#8208;light and XAT reaction, followed by an enabling radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl radical with a stabilized trifluoromethyl radical. The reaction provides the first straightforward access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones from easily&#8208;available and cost&#8208;effective alkyl halides and TFAA.</dc:description>

         <title>An Ultrathin Inorganic Molecular Crystal Interfacial Layer for Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn metal anode suffers from dendrite growth and side reactions during cycling, significantly deteriorating the lifespan of aqueous Zn metal batteries. Herein, we introduced an ultrathin and ultra&#8208;flat Sb2O3 molecular crystal layer to stabilize Zn anode. The in&#8208;situ optical and atomic force microscopes observations show that such a 10nm Sb2O3 thin layer could ensure uniform under&#8208;layer Zn deposition with suppressed tip growth effect, while the traditional WO3 layer undergoes an uncontrolled up&#8208;layer Zn deposition. The superior regulation capability is attributed to the good electronic&#8208;blocking ability and low Zn affinity of the molecular crystal layer, free of dangling bonds. Electrochemical tests exhibit Sb2O3 layer can significantly improve the cycle life of Zn anode from 72 h to 2800 h, in contrast to the 900 h of much thicker WO3 even in 100 nm. This research opens up the application of inorganic molecular crystals as the interfacial layer of Zn anode.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Inhibition of Ice Growth by Biomimetic Crowding Coacervates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The freezing of biological fluids is intensively studied but remains elusive as it is affected not only by the various components but also by the crowding nature of the biological fluids. Herein, we constructed spherical crowders, fibrous crowders, and coacervates by various components ranging from surfactants to polymer and proteins to mimic three typical crowders in biological fluids, i.e., globular proteins, fibrous networks, and condensates of biomolecules. It is elucidated that the three crowders exhibit low, moderate, and strong ice growth inhibition activity, respectively, resulting from their different abilities in slowing down water dynamics. Intriguingly, the coacervate consisting of molecules without obvious ice growth inhibition activity strongly inhibits ice growth, which is firstly employed as a highly&#8208;potent cryoprotectant. This work provides new insights into the survival of freezing&#8208;tolerant organisms and opens an avenue for the design of ice&#8208;controlling materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Crossover Sorption of C2H2/CO2 and C2H6/C2H4 in Soft Porous Coordination Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous sorbents are materials&#160;utilized&#160;for various applications, including storage and separation. Typically, the uptake of a single gas by a sorbent decreases with temperature, but the relative affinity for two similar gases does not change. However, herein, we report a rare example of "crossover sorption," in which the uptake capacity and apparent affinity for two similar gases reverse at different temperatures. We synthesized two&#160;soft porous coordination polymers, [Zn2(L1)(L2/L3)2]n&#160;(PCP&#8208;1/2) (L1 = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)phenyl; L2 = 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene; L3 = 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene). These PCPs&#160;exhibits structural changes upon gas sorption and show the crossover sorption for both C2H2/CO2&#160;and C2H6/C2H4, where the apparent affinity reverse with temperature. We used in&#8208;situ gas&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analyses to reveal the guest&#8208;inclusion structures of PCP&#8208;1 at various temperatures.&#160;Interestingly, we observed three&#8208;step single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations with the different loading phases under these gases, providing insight into guest&#8208;binding positions, nature of host&#8208;guest or guest&#8208;guest interactions. Combining with theoretical investigation, we have fully elucidated the crossover sorption in the flexible coordination networks, which involves a reversal of apparent affinity and uptake of similar gases at different temperatures. We discovered that this behaviour can be explained by the delicate balance between guest binding and host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible Theory for Catalysis: Learning Alkaline Oxygen Reduction on Complex Solid Solutions within the Ag&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru Composition Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compositionally complex materials such as high&#8208;entropy alloys and oxides have the potential to be efficient platforms for catalyst discovery because of the vast chemical space spanned by these novel materials. Identifying the composition of the most active catalyst materials, however, requires unraveling the descriptor&#8208;activity relationship, as experimental screening the multitude of possible element ratios quickly becomes a daunting task. In this work, we show that inferred adsorption energy distributions of *OH and *O on complex solid solution surfaces within the space spanned by the system Ag&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru are coupled to the experimentally observed electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction. In total, the catalytic activity of 1582 alloy compositions is predicted with a cross&#8208;validated mean absolute error of 0.042 mA/cm2 by applying a theory&#8208;derived model with only two adjustable parameters. Trends in the discrepancies between predicted electrochemical performance values of the model and the measured values on thin film surfaces subsequently provide insight into the alloys&#8217; surface compositions during reaction conditions. Bridging this gap between computationally modeled and experimentally observed catalytic activities, not only reveals insight into the underlying theory of catalysis but also takes a step closer to realizing exploration and exploitation of high&#8208;entropy materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrodeoxygenation of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Aromatic Plastic Wastes to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address the global plastic pollution issues and the challenges of hydrogen storage and transportation, we report a new class of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) system based on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes. We developed a catalytic system comprised of Ru&#8208;ReOx/SiO2 + HZSM&#8208;5 for direct HDO of polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyphenylene oxide (PPO), and their mixtures to cycloalkanes as LOHCs, with high yield up to 99% under mild reaction conditions. The theoretical hydrogen storage capacity can reach to ~5.74 wt%. The reaction pathway involves depolymerization of PC into C15 aromatics and C15 monophenols by direct hydrogenolysis of the C&#8208;O bond between the benzene ring and ester group, and subsequent parallel hydrogenation of C15 aromatics and HDO of C15 monophenols. HDO of cyclic alcohol is the rate determining step. The active site is Ru metallic nanoparticles with partially covered ReOx species. The excellent performance is attributed to the synergetic effect of oxophilic ReOx species and Ru metallic sites for C&#8208;O hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation and the promotion effect of HZSM&#8208;5 for dehydration of cyclic alcohol. The highly efficient and stably dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes over Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 confirms that HDO products can act as LOHCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Melleolides from Basidiomycota Fungi: Mechanistic Analysis of the Multi&#8208;Functional GMC Oxidase Mld7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mushroom terpenoids are biologically and chemically diverse fungal metabolites. Among them, melleolides are representative sesquiterpenoids with a characteristic protoilludane skeleton. In this study, we applied a recently established hot spot knock&#8208;in method to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway leading to 1a&#8208;hydroxymelleolide. The biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene core involves the cytochrome P450 catalyzing stepwise hydroxylation on the D6&#8208;protoilludene framework and a stereochemical inversion process at the C5 position catalyzed by short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins. The highlight on the biosynthesis is that the flavoprotein Mld7 catalyzes an oxidation triggered double bond shift accompanying dehydration and acyl group assisted substitution with two different nucleophiles at the C6 position to afford the D7&#8208;protoilludene derivatives such as melleolide and armillarivin. The complex reaction mechanism was proposed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Of particularly importance is that product distribution is regulated by the interaction with cell membrane. This proposed biosynthetic pathway provides an opportunity to understand the structural diversification mechanisms of melleolides and protoilludane sesquiterpenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Design of Unprecedented Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Featuring Multiple Anion Functionalities and Hierarchical Porosity for Benchmark Acetylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented robust metal organic framework ZNU&#8208;9 with a new wly topology and featuring multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity was reported for simultaneous efficient C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 separation with both high capacity and high selectivity.







Abstract
Separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) or ethylene (C2H4) is industrially important but still challenging so far. Herein, we developed two novel robust metal organic frameworks AlFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;8) with znv topology and SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;9) with wly topology for efficient capture of C2H2 from CO2 and C2H4. Both ZNU&#8208;8 and ZNU&#8208;9 feature multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity. Notably, ZNU&#8208;9 with more anionic binding sites and three distinct cages displays both an extremely large C2H2 capacity (7.94&#8197;mmol/g) and a high C2H2/CO2 (10.3) or C2H2/C2H4 (11.6) selectivity. The calculated capacity of C2H2 per anion (4.94&#8197;mol/mol at 1&#8197;bar) is the highest among all the anion pillared metal organic frameworks. Theoretical calculation indicated that the strong cooperative hydrogen bonds exist between acetylene and the pillared SiF62&#8722; anions in the confined cavity, which is further confirmed by in situ IR spectra. The practical separation performance was explicitly demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments with equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixtures and 1/99&#8197;C2H2/C2H4 mixtures under various conditions with excellent recyclability and benchmark productivity of pure C2H2 (5.13&#8197;mmol/g) or C2H4 (48.57&#8197;mmol/g).

&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented robust metal organic framework ZNU-9 with a new wly topology and featuring multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity was reported for simultaneous efficient C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation with both high capacity and high selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separation of acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is industrially important but still challenging so far. Herein, we developed two novel robust metal organic frameworks AlFSIX-Cu-TPBDA (ZNU-8) with &lt;b&gt;znv&lt;/b&gt; topology and SIFSIX-Cu-TPBDA (ZNU-9) with &lt;b&gt;wly&lt;/b&gt; topology for efficient capture of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Both ZNU-8 and ZNU-9 feature multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity. Notably, ZNU-9 with more anionic binding sites and three distinct cages displays both an extremely large C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity (7.94&#8197;mmol/g) and a high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (10.3) or C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (11.6) selectivity. The calculated capacity of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per anion (4.94&#8197;mol/mol at 1&#8197;bar) is the highest among all the anion pillared metal organic frameworks. Theoretical calculation indicated that the strong cooperative hydrogen bonds exist between acetylene and the pillared SiF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions in the confined cavity, which is further confirmed by in situ IR spectra. The practical separation performance was explicitly demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments with equimolar C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures and 1/99&#8197;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures under various conditions with excellent recyclability and benchmark productivity of pure C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (5.13&#8197;mmol/g) or C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (48.57&#8197;mmol/g).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This article provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of various carbon&#8208;based electrode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries, focusing on recent advanced and mechanistic understanding of carbon&#8208;based electrode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

Abstract
Tremendous progress has been made in the field of electrochemical energy storage devices that rely on potassium&#8208;ions as charge carriers due to their abundant resources and excellent ion transport properties. Nevertheless, future practical developments not only count on advanced electrode materials with superior electrochemical performance, but also on competitive costs of electrodes for scalable production. In the past few decades, advanced carbon materials have attracted great interest due to their low cost, high selectivity, and structural suitability and have been widely investigated as functional materials for potassium&#8208;ion storage. This article provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of this rapidly developing field, focusing on recent advanced and mechanistic understanding of carbon&#8208;based electrode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, we also discuss recent achievements of dual&#8208;ion batteries and conversion&#8208;type K&#8722;X (X=O2, CO2, S, Se, I2) batteries towards potential practical applications as high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;power devices, and summarize carbon&#8208;based materials as the host for K&#8208;metal protection and possible directions for the development of potassium energy&#8208;related devices as well. Based on this, we bridge the gaps between various carbon&#8208;based functional materials structure and the related potassium&#8208;ion storage performance, especially provide guidance on carbon material design principles for next&#8208;generation potassium&#8208;ion storage devices.

         <title>Balancing the Crystallinity and Film Formation of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes through In Situ Modulation for Efficient Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The balance between crystallinity and film&#8208;formation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is demonstrated for the first time using a facile in situ modulation strategy. Through competitive complexation with a ligand, acetic acid systematically reduces the crystallinity and optimizes the film formation of the MOF membrane, influencing their gas separation properties.







Abstract
Polycrystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layers hold great promise as molecular sieve membranes for efficient gas separation. Nevertheless, the high crystallinity tends to cause inter&#8208;crystalline defects/cracks in the nearby crystals, which makes crystalline porous materials face a great challenge in the fabrication of defect&#8208;free membranes. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the balance between crystallinity and film formation of MOF membrane through a facile in situ modulation strategy. Monocarboxylic acid was introduced as a modulator to regulate the crystallinity via competitive complexation and thus concomitantly control the film&#8208;forming state during membrane growth. Through adjusting the ratio of modulator acid/linker acid, an appropriate balance between this structural &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; was achieved. The resulting MOF membrane with moderate crystallinity and coherent morphology exhibits molecular sieving for H2/CO2 separation with selectivity up to 82.5.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkylation of Internal Olefin with Cycloalkanone to Directly Access Polycyclic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel SPD&#8208;NH2 organocatalyst that works cooperatively with a PdII complex to catalyze the asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation. It demonstrates great reactivity, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Moreover, bridged or fused bicyclic systems can conveniently transformed into diverse di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetracyclic scaffolds for further conversion into biologically important compounds.







Abstract
An asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkylation of unactivated internal olefins with tethered cyclic ketones was realized by the cooperative catalysis of a newly designed chiral amine (SPD&#8208;NH2) and PdII complex, providing straightforward access to either bridged or fused bicyclic systems containing three stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Notably, the bicyclic products could be conveniently transformed into a diverse range of key structures frequently found in bioactive terpenes, such as &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene, cracroson D, and vulgarisins. The steric hindrance between the Ar group of the SPD&#8208;NH2 catalyst and the branched chain of the substrate, hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the N&#8722;H of the enamine motif and the C=O of the directing group MQ, and the counterion of the PdII complex were identified as key factors for excellent stereoinduction in this dual catalytic process by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Insights into the Diffusion Behaviors of Water over Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Catalysts During Syngas to High&#8208;Quality Gasoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst composed of hydrophobic FeNa@Si&#8208;c and HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite converts syngas to gasoline with high selectivity. The diffusion of water molecules through a hydrophilic catalyst is bidirectional, while the diffusion through a hydrophobic catalyst is unidirectional, thereby allowing control of syngas&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline side reactions related to water.







Abstract
Although considerable efforts towards directly converting syngas to liquid fuels through Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis have been made, developing catalysts with low CO2 selectivity for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality gasoline remains a big challenge. Herein, we designed a bifunctional catalyst composed of hydrophobic FeNa@Si&#8208;c and HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite, which exhibited a low CO2 selectivity of 14.3&#8201;% at 49.8&#8201;% CO conversion, with a high selectivity of 62.5&#8201;% for gasoline in total products. Molecular dynamic simulations and model experiments revealed that the diffusion of water molecules through hydrophilic catalyst was bidirectional, while the diffusion through hydrophobic catalyst was unidirectional, which were crucial to tune the water&#8208;gas shift reaction and control CO2 formation. This work provides a new fundamental understanding about the function of hydrophobic modification of catalysts in syngas conversion.

         <title>Accelerated Surface Reconstruction through Regulating the Solid&#8208;Liquid Interface by Oxyanions in Perovskite Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To promote the spontaneous chemical reaction process of LaNiO3&#8722;&#948;, the oxyanions were added into electrolytes to regulate the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The oxyanions would adsorb onto the solid&#8211;liquid interface, disrupting the dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed OH&#8722; ions and the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction. It could be an effective way to accelerate surface reconstruction process.







Abstract
A comprehensive understanding of surface reconstruction was critical to developing high performance lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based perovskite electrocatalysts. Traditionally, the primary determining factor of the surface reconstruction process was believed to be the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Hence, most previous studies focused on optimizing composition to reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy, which in turn facilitated the surface reconstruction process. Here, for the first time, we found that adding oxyanions (SO42&#8722;, CO32&#8722;, NO3&#8722;) into the electrolyte could effectively regulate the solid&#8211;liquid interface, significantly accelerating the surface reconstruction process and enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. Further studies indicated that the added oxyanions would adsorb onto the solid&#8211;liquid interface layer, disrupting the dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed OH&#8722; ions and the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction process. As such, the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction process could be more readily released into the electrolyte, thereby leading to an acceleration of the surface reconstruction. Thus, it was expected that our finding would provide a new layer of understanding to the surface reconstruction process in LOM&#8208;based perovskite electrocatalysts.

         <title>Cooperative and Orthogonal Switching in the Solid State Enabled by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Confinement Leading to a Thermo&#8208;Photochromic Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like two color&#8208;changing chameleons coming face to face, integration of two distinct stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties within the same platform results in their synergistic behavior. Perturbation of the chameleons&#8217; environment upon a different external stimulus breaks the synergy, promoting their orthogonal behavior, a concept highlighted for a novel hierarchical photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework.







Abstract
Cooperative behavior and orthogonal responses of two classes of coordinatively integrated photochromic molecules towards distinct external stimuli were demonstrated on the first example of a photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive hierarchical platform. Synergetic and orthogonal responses to temperature and excitation wavelength are achieved by confining the stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties within a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), leading to the preparation of a novel photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive spiropyran&#8208;diarylethene based material. Synergistic behavior of two photoswitches enables the study of stimuli&#8208;responsive resonance energy transfer as well as control of the photoinduced charge transfer processes, milestones required to advance optoelectronics development. Spectroscopic studies in combination with theoretical modeling revealed a nonlinear effect on the material electronic structure arising from the coordinative integration of photoresponsive molecules with distinct photoisomerization mechanisms. Thus, the reported work covers multivariable facets of not only fundamental aspects of photoswitch cooperativity, but also provides a pathway to modulate photophysics and electronics of multidimensional functional materials exhibiting thermo&#8208;photochromism.

         <title>Insights into the Correlation of Cross&#8208;linking Modes with Mechanical Properties for Dynamic Polymeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on comprehensive comparison on mechanical properties between dually cross&#8208;linked network and individual covalent or supramolecular cross&#8208;linked network, we reveal that the dual cross&#8208;linking mode can combine the advantages of covalent cross&#8208;links and supramolecular cross&#8208;links, exhibiting not only quick deformation recovery, outstanding breaking stress and puncture resistance, but also excellent toughness and energy dissipation ability.







Abstract
Simultaneously introducing covalent and supramolecular cross&#8208;links into one system to construct dually cross&#8208;linked networks, has been proved an effective approach to prepare high&#8208;performance materials. However, so far, features and advantages of dually cross&#8208;linked networks compared with those possessing individual covalent or supramolecular cross&#8208;linking points are rarely investigated. Herein, on the basis of comparison between supramolecular polymer network (SPN), covalent polymer network (CPN) and dually cross&#8208;linked polymer network (DPN), we reveal that the dual cross&#8208;linking strategy can endow the DPN with integrated advantages of CPN and SPN. Benefiting from the energy dissipative ability along with the dissociation of host&#8211;guest complexes, the DPN shows excellent toughness and ductility similar to the SPN. Meanwhile, the elasticity of covalent cross&#8208;links in the DPN could rise the structural stability to a level comparable to the CPN, exhibiting quick deformation recovery capacity. Moreover, the DPN has the strongest breaking stress and puncture resistance among the three, proving the unique property advantages of dual cross&#8208;linking method. These findings gained from our study further deepen the understanding of dynamic polymeric networks and facilitate the preparation of high&#8208;performance elastomeric materials.

         <title>An Endogenous Prompting Mechanism for Sulfur Conversions Via Coupling with Polysulfides in Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional sulfur conversion reactions suffer from severe shuttle effects as well as sluggish redox kinetics. Here, We achieved an endogenous facilitation mechanism for sulfur conversion which constructing a fast &#8220;internal cycle&#8221; of the promotors to promote the slow &#8220;external cycle&#8221; of sulfur conversions by coupling lithium polysulfides with functional molecules. By regulating the intermediates solubility and mediating the reaction kinetics, organophosphorus polysulfides as endogenous promotors can simultaneously eliminate the shuttle effect and improve the sulfur electrode process.







Abstract
The sluggish kinetics process and shuttling of soluble intermediates present in complex conversion between sulfur and lithium sulfide severely limit the practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Herein, by introducing a designated functional organic molecule to couple with polysulfide intermediators, an endogenous prompting mechanism of sulfur conversions has thus been created leading to an alternative sulfur&#8208;electrode process, in another words, to build a fast &#8220;internal cycle&#8221; of promotors that can promote the slow &#8220;external cycle&#8221; of sulfur conversions. The coupling&#8208;intermediators between the functional organic molecule and polysulfides, organophosphorus polysulfides, to be the &#8220;promotors&#8221; for sulfur conversions, are not only insoluble in the electrolyte but also with higher redox&#8208;activity. So the sulfur&#8208;electrode process kinetics is greatly improved and the shuttle effect is eliminated simultaneously by this strategy. Meanwhile, with the endogenous prompting mechanism, the morphology of the final discharge product can be modified into a uniform covering film, which is more conducive to its decomposition when charging. Benefiting from the effective mediation of reaction kinetics and control of intermediates solubility, the lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries can act out excellent rate performance and cycling stability.

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Difluorocarbene Transfer via Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles via palladium catalysis has been developed. This reaction overcomes the intrinsic limitations of electrophilic difluorocarbene and allows difluoromethylation of various aryl bromides and aryl triflates. Experimental mechanistic studies revealed that a palladium(0/II) pathway is responsible for this reductive reaction.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles has been developed, representing a new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction. The approach uses low&#8208;cost and bulk industrial chemical chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H) as the difluorocarbene precursor. It produces a variety of difluoromethylated (hetero)arenes from widely available aryl halides/triflates and proton sources, featuring high functional group tolerance and synthetic convenience without preparing organometallic reagents. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that an unexpected Pd0/II catalytic cycle is involved in this reductive reaction, wherein the oxidative addition of palladium(0) difluorocarbene ([Pd0(Ln)]=CF2) with aryl electrophile to generate the key intermediate aryldifluoromethylpalladium [ArCF2Pd(Ln)X], followed by reaction with hydroquinone, is responsible for the reductive difluorocarbene transfer.

         <title>Isostructural Nanocluster Manipulation Reveals Pivotal Role of One Surface Atom in Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom modifications are typically accompanied by appreciable changes to the overall particle's structure. Herein, we demonstrate surface single&#8208;atom manipulation based on [Cu58H20PET36(PPh3)4]2+ (Cu58; PET: phenylethanethiolate; PPh3: triphenylphosphine), leading to the isostructural analogue [Cu57H20PET36(PPh3)4]+ (Cu57). Remarkably, this single surface atom drastically alters the catalytic reactivity of the nanoclusters.







Abstract
Elucidating single&#8208;atom effects on the fundamental properties of nanoparticles is challenging because single&#8208;atom modifications are typically accompanied by appreciable changes to the overall particle's structure. Herein, we report the synthesis of a [Cu58H20PET36(PPh3)4]2+ (Cu58; PET: phenylethanethiolate; PPh3: triphenylphosphine) nanocluster&#8212;an atomically precise nanoparticle&#8212;that can be transformed into the surface&#8208;defective analog [Cu57H20PET36(PPh3)4]+ (Cu57). Both nanoclusters are virtually identical, with five concentric metal shells, save for one missing surface copper atom in Cu57. Remarkably, the loss of this single surface atom drastically alters the reactivity of the nanocluster. In contrast to Cu58, Cu57 shows promising activity for click chemistry, particularly photoinduced [3+2] azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AAC), which is attributed to the active catalytic site in Cu57 after the removal of one surface copper atom. Our study not only presents a unique system for uncovering the effect of a single&#8208;surface atom modification on nanoparticle properties but also showcases single&#8208;atom surface modification as a powerful means for designing nanoparticle catalysts.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Reaction&#8208;Mediated Tumor&#8208;Selective Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 System for Dual&#8208;Targeted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor&#8208;targeted CRISPR/Cas delivery strategy was developed to switch on antitumor immunity via bioorthogonal reaction. Selectively labeling tumor sites and the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway was achieved first, turning &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221;. The targeted accumulation of the CRISPR/Cas system within tumors via click chemistry then further enhanced cancer immunotherapy, substantially boosting antitumor effectiveness.







Abstract
CRISPR system&#8208;assisted immunotherapy is an attractive option in cancer therapy. However, its efficacy is still less than expected due to the limitations in delivering the CRISPR system to target cancer cells. Here, we report a new CRISPR/Cas9 tumor&#8208;targeting delivery strategy based on bioorthogonal reactions for dual&#8208;targeted cancer immunotherapy. First, selective in vivo metabolic labeling of cancer and activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway was achieved simultaneously through tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;biodegradable hollow manganese dioxide (H&#8208;MnO2) nano&#8208;platform. Subsequently, CRISPR/Cas9 system&#8208;loaded liposome was accumulated within the modified tumor tissue through in vivo click chemistry, resulting in the loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase N2 (PTPN2) and further sensitizing tumors to immunotherapy. Overall, our strategy provides a modular platform for precise gene editing in vivo and exhibits potent antitumor response by boosting innate and adaptive antitumor immunity.

         <title>Reactivity Umpolung of Tertiary Amide Enabled by Catalytic Reductive Stannylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide carbonyl group usually serves as the electrophile, which can react with various nucleophiles. The current work shows a process to achieve the umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide carbonyl group. By leveraging this strategy, tertiary amide can react with a wide range of electrophiles to produce complex amines.







Abstract
Reactivity umpolung is an important concept in organic chemistry. Established reactivity umpolung mainly focuses on the aldehyde and umpolung of amide carbonyl group is not known. In this report, we describe a process to obtain the umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide. This process hinges on the efficient reductive stannylation catalyzed by Ir/silane and facile Sn&#8722;Li exchange. By leveraging this umpolung reactivity, drug Fluoxetine was derivatized to 12 different analogues via reacting with various electrophiles and four biologically active molecules were prepared concisely. This unlocked umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide is expected to find applications to synthesize complex amines from amides.

         <title>An Interfacial View of Cation Effects on Electrocatalysis Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identity of alkali metal cations plays a paramount role in tuning the activity and selectivity of hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and electrochemical reduction of CO2. From the chemical and/or electrostatic interactions with adsorbed intermediates to the redistribution of interfacial water layer and buffering the interfacial pH, cations greatly influence the crucial steps of electrocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte of electrocatalysis systems has been recently introduced as a crucial factor to tailor the kinetics and Faradaic efficiency of many electrocatalytic reactions. In this Minireview, we have summarized the recent advances in the molecular&#8208;level understanding of cation effects on relevant electrocatalytic processes such as hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), and CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) reactions. The discussion covers the effects of electrolyte cations on interfacial electric fields, structural organization of interfacial water molecules, blocking the catalytic active sites, stabilization or destabilization of intermediates, and interfacial pHs. These cation&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena have been reported to impact the performance (activity, selectivity, and stability) of electrochemical reactions collaboratively or independently. We describe that although there is almost a general agreement on the relationship between the size of alkali cations and the activities of HER, OER, and CO2RR, however, the mechanism by which the performance of these electrocatalytic reactions is influenced by alkali metal cations is still in debate.

         <title>Secretion&#8208;Catalyzed Assembly of Protein Biomaterials on a Bacterial Membrane Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacillus subtilis can be programmed to autonomously assemble recombinant silk peptides on its own membrane, and then release them as fibers into the extracellular milieu. The process, called secretion&#8208;catalyzed assembly, enables coupled synthesis, assembly, and processing of biomaterials by microbes.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;based biomaterials have played a key role in tissue engineering, and additional exciting applications as self&#8208;healing materials and sustainable polymers are emerging. Over the past few decades, recombinant expression and production of various fibrous proteins from microbes have been demonstrated; however, the resulting proteins typically must then be purified and processed by humans to form usable fibers and materials. Here, we show that the Gram&#8208;positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis can be programmed to secrete silk through its translocon via an orthogonal signal peptide/peptidase pair. Surprisingly, we discover that this translocation mechanism drives the silk proteins to assemble into fibers spontaneously on the cell surface, in a process we call secretion&#8208;catalyzed assembly (SCA). Secreted silk fibers form self&#8208;healing hydrogels with minimal processing. Alternatively, the fibers retained on the membrane provide a facile route to create engineered living materials from Bacillus cells. This work provides a blueprint to achieve autonomous assembly of protein biomaterials in useful morphologies directly from microbial factories.

         <title>Coordination Defect&#8208;Induced Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Polyoxo&#8208;metalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Catalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination defect&#8208;induced strategy gives frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) sites in a polyoxometalate (POM) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), where the Lewis acid (LA) sites are linker&#8208;defective metal nodes and the Lewis base (LB) sites are derived from surface oxygen atoms of the POM. This FLP catalyst achieved heterolytic dissociation of H2 into highly active H&#948;&#8722;, thus exhibiting excellent activity in acetylene hydrogenation.







Abstract
Precise control of the structure and spatial distance of Lewis acid (LA) and Lewis base (LB) sites in a porous system to construct efficient solid frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst is vital for industrial application but remains challenging. Herein, we constructed FLP sites in a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) by introducing coordination&#8208;defect metal nodes (LA) and surface&#8208;basic POM with abundant oxygen (LB). The well&#8208;defined and unique spatial conformation of the defective POM&#8208;based MOF ensure that the distance between LA and LB is at ~4.3&#8197;&#197;, a suitable distance to activate H2. This FLP catalyst can heterolytically dissociate H2 into active H&#948;&#8722;, thus exhibiting high activity in hydrogenation, which is 55 and 2.7&#8197;times as high as that of defect&#8208;free POM&#8208;based MOF and defective MOF without POM, respectively. This work provides a new avenue toward precise design multi&#8208;site catalyst to achieve specific activation of target substrate for synergistic catalysis.

         <title>Coordination and Activation of N2 at Low&#8208;Valent Magnesium using a Heterobimetallic Approach: Synthesis and Reactivity of a Masked Dimagnesium Diradical
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduction of a bulky magnesium(II) diamide with 5&#8201;% w/w K/KI under an N2 atmosphere has given a complex between magnesium and doubly reduced dinitrogen, N22&#8722;. The reaction has been calculated to proceed via an anionic magnesium(I) radical, and the final product shown to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reactions with CO, H2 and C2H4.







Abstract
The activation of dinitrogen (N2) by transition metals is central to the highly energy intensive, heterogeneous Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Considerable progress has been made towards more sustainable homogeneous activations of N2 with d&#8208; and f&#8208;block metals, though little success has been had with main group metals. Here we report that the reduction of a bulky magnesium(II) amide [(TCHPNON)Mg] (TCHPNON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene) with 5&#8201;% w/w K/KI yields the magnesium&#8208;N2 complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]. DFT calculations and experimental data show that the dinitrogen unit in the complex has been reduced to the N22&#8722; dianion, via a transient anionic magnesium(I) radical. The compound readily reductively activates CO, H2 and C2H4, in reactions in which it acts as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical.

         <title>Stereoselective Plasmonic Interaction in Peptide&#8208;tethered Photopolymerizable Diacetylenes Doped with Chiral Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;tethered diacetylene monomers exhibit efficient topochemical photopolymerization and allow control over the chiroptical properties of the resulting chiral polydiacetylenes. Achiral and chiral gold nanoparticles were incorporated in the chiral polymers and the stereoselective plasmonic interactions investigated, with the ultimate goal of designing next&#8208;generation organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials with large chiroptic effects.







Abstract
Designing polymeric systems with ultra&#8208;high optical activity is instrumental in the pursuit of smart artificial chiroptical materials, including the fundamental understanding of structure/property relations. Herein, we report a diacetylene (DA) moiety flanked by chiral D&#8208; and L&#8208;FF dipeptide methyl esters that exhibits efficient topochemical photopolymerization in the solid phase to furnish polydiacetylene (PDA) with desired control over the chiroptical properties. The doping of the achiral gold nanoparticles provides plasmonic interaction with the PDAs to render asymmetric shape to the circular dichroism bands. With the judicious design of the chiral amino acid ligand appended to the AuNPs, we demonstrate the first example of selective chiral amplification mediated by stereo&#8208;structural matching of the polymer&#8208;plasmonic AuNP hybrid pairs. Such ordered self&#8208;assembly aided by topochemical polymerization in peptide&#8208;tethered PDA provides a smart strategy to produce soft responsive materials for applications in chiral photonics.

         <title>Accelerated Multi&#8208;step Sulfur Redox Reactions in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by Dual Defects in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides are recognized as the main obstacles to the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In their Research Article (e202306901), Dan Luo, Zhongwei Chen et&#8197;al. report a novel dual&#8208;defect metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a new catalyst type to achieve synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of lithium polysulfides. The missing linker defect and missing cluster defect significantly catalyze the sulfur reduction reaction. As a result, dual&#8208;defect MOF&#8208;based separators lead to a strongly improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Directed Site&#8208;Selective Csp3&#8208;H Borylation of Saturated Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borylation of Csp3&#8208;H bonds is a challenging transformation that is typically restricted to transition metal catalysis. Herein, we report the site&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free Csp3&#8211;H borylation of saturated cyclic amines. It is possible to selectively borylate piperidine derivatives at the &#945; or &#946; positions according to the reaction conditions. The mechanism was supported by NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations. It suggests that the piperidine is dehydrogenated by complexation with BBr3 to produce an enamine intermediate, which is in turn borylated at either the &#945; or &#946; position according to the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Acidic Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis at High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Correlates with its Composition&#8208;Dependent Potential of Zero Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast possibilities in the elemental combinations of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) make it essential to discover activity descriptors for establishing rational electrocatalyst design principles. Despite the increasing attention on the potential of zero charge (PZC) of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst, neither the PZC of HEAs nor the impact of the PZC on the HER activity at HEAs has been des&#173;cribed.   Here, we use scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) to determine the PZC and the HER activities of various elemental compositions of a Pt&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ru&#8208;Ir&#8208;Ag thin&#8208;film HEA materials library (HEA&#8208;ML) with high statis&#173;tical reliability. Interestingly, the PZC of Pt&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ru&#8208;Ir&#8208;Ag is linearly correlated with its composition&#8208;weighted average work function. The HER current density in acidic media positively correlates with the PZC, which can be explained by the preconcentration of H+ in the electrical double layer at potentials negative of the PZC.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Crystal Monomer to Single Crystal Polymer Reaction Activated by a Triplet Excimer in a Zipper Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined experimental and theoretical study focused on the elucidation of the polymerization mechanism of crystal monomer to crystal polymer reaction of a bisindacene compound in the solid state has been carried out. The experimental description and characterization of the polymer product have been reported elsewhere and, in this article, we address the first detailed description of the polymerization process. This reaction pathway consists in the initial formation of a triplet excimer state that relaxes to a intermolecular bonded triplet state that is the starting point of the propagation step of the polymerization. The overall process can be visualized in the monomer starting state as an open zipper in which a cursor or slider is formed by light absorption and the whole zipper is then closed by propagation of the double cursor. To this end, variable&#8208;temperature electron spin resonance, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and vibrational Raman spectroscopic data have been implemented in combination with quantum chemical calculations. The presented mechanistic insight is of great value to understand the intricacies of such important reaction, and to envisage and diversify the products produced by it.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Radius&#8208;Controlled Sn&#8208;O Bond Length Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the intriguing potential shown by Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides in CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), the rational optimization of their CO2RR properties is still lacking. Here we report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8208;O bond lengths. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples of Ba1&#8208;xSrxSnO3, as the A&#8208;site cation average radii decrease from 1.61 to 1.44 &#197;, their Sn&#8208;O bonds are precisely shortened from 2.06 to 2.02 &#197;. Our CO2RR measurements show that the activity and selectivity of these samples for HCOOH production exhibit volcano&#8208;type trends with the Sn&#8208;O bond lengths. Among these samples, the Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3 features the optimal activity (753.6 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2) and selectivity (90.9%) for HCOOH, better than those of the reported Sn&#8208;based oxides. Such optimized CO2RR properties could be attributed to favorable merits conferred by the precisely controlled Sn&#8208;O bond lengths, e.g., the regulated band center, modulated adsorption/activation of intermediates, and reduced energy barrier for *OCHO formation. This work brings a new avenue for rational design of advanced Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides toward CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Zn Anode Utilization by Trace Iodine Ions in Organic&#8211;Water Hybrid Electrolytes through Formation of Anion&#8208;rich Adsorbing Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn batteries are attracting extensive attentions, but their application is still hindered by H2O&#8208;induced Zn&#8208;corrosion and hydrogen evolution reactions. Addition of organic solvents into aqueous electrolytes to limit the H2O activity is a promising solution, but at the cost of greatly reduced Zn anode kinetics. Here we propose a simple strategy for this challenge by adding 50 mM iodine ions into an organic&#8208;water (1, 2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) + water) hybrid electrolyte, which enables the electrolyte simultaneously owns the advantages of low H2O activity and accelerated Zn kinetics. We demonstrate that the DME breaks the H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond network and exclude H2O from Zn2+ solvation shell. And the I&#8208; is firmly adsorbed on the Zn anode, reducing the Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation barrier from 74.33 kJ mol&#8208;1 to 32.26 kJ mol&#8208;1 and inducing homogeneous nucleation behavior. With such electrolyte, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell exhibits a record high cycling lifetime (14.5 months) and achieves high Zn anode utilization (75.5%). In particular, the Zn//VS2@SS full cell with the optimized electrolyte stably cycles for 170 cycles at a low N:P ratio (3.64). Even with the cathode mass&#8208;loading of 16.7 mg cm&#8208;2, the full cell maintains the areal capacity of 0.96 mAh cm&#8208;2 after 1600 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple&#8208;Bidentate Nitrate&#8208;Ligated A2Hg(NO3)4 (A = K, Rb): Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Sufficient Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal continues to pose significant challenges due to the difficulty of assembling polar NLO&#8208;active modules in an optimal additive fashion. We report herein the first NLO&#8208;active mercuric nitrates A2Hg(NO3)4 (A = K (KHNO), Rb (RHNO)), for which assembly is induced by ionic polarization of the d10 cations. The two new crystalline compounds are isostructural, featuring interesting pseudo&#8208;diamond&#8208;like structures with parallel [Hg(NO3)4] modules, and leading to strong powder second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses of 9.2 (KHNO) and 8.8 (RHNO) times that of KH2PO4. In combination with the simple solution preparation of centimeter&#8208;scale crystals, sufficient birefringence, and short UV cutoff edges, these attributes make KHNO and RHNO promising candidates for ultraviolet NLO materials. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure analysis reveal that the newly&#8208;developed highly condensed and distorted [Hg(NO3)4] module, with an Hg2+ cation that is quadruply bidentate nitrate&#8208;ligated, is crucial for the significant SHG responses. This work highlights the potential importance of modules with multiple bidentate ligands for the development of high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Additive&#8208;Induced Interphases Enable Highly Stable 4.6 V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2||graphite Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted great attention due to their promising high energy density. However, severe capacity degradation is witnessed, which originated from the incompatible and unstable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase at high voltage. Herein, a robust additive&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;rich interphase is constructed by introducing an ultrahigh S&#8208;content of 34.04% additive (methylene methyl disulfonate, MMDS) in 4.6 V LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523)||graphite pouch cell. The MMDS does not directly participate the inner Li+ sheath, but the strong interactions between MMDS and PF6&#8208; anions promote the preferential decomposition of MMDS and broaden the oxidation stability, and facilitate the formation of an ultrathin but robust sulfur&#8208;rich interfacial layer. The electrolyte consumption, gas production, phase transformation and dissolution of transition metal ions were effectively inhibited. As expected, the 4.6 V NCM523||graphite pouch cell delivers a high capacity retention of 87.99% even after 800 cycles. This work shares new insight into the sulfur&#8208;rich additive&#8208;induced electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase for stable high&#8208;voltage LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Key Strategies for Enhancing H2 Production in Transition Metal Oxide Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxides (TMOs) were one of the first photocatalysts used to produce hydrogen from water using solar energy. Despite the emergence of many other genres of photocatalysts over the years, TMO photocatalysts remain dominant due to their easy synthesis and unique physicochemical properties. Various strategies have been developed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TMOs, but the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of TMO photocatalysts is still very low (&lt; 2%), which is far below the targeted STH of 10% for commercial viability. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of several widely used strategies, including oxygen defects control, doping, establishing interfacial junctions, and phase&#8208;facet&#8208;morphology engineering, that have been adopted to improve TMO photocatalysts. By critically evaluating these strategies and providing a roadmap for future research directions, this article serves as a valuable resource for researchers, students, and professionals seeking to develop efficient energy materials for green energy solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Way Catalysis in Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction Limits Inhibition Induced by External Electric Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oriented external electric fields (EEFs) act as catalysts that can induce selectivity in chemical reactions. The responses of the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and ethylene (BDE&#8208;DA) as well as cyclopentadiene and ethylene (CPDE&#8208;DA) towards EEF stimuli are investigated here using density functional theory (B3LYP) calculations. EEF is a vector that catalyzes the reaction in one direction while inhibiting it in the opposite direction. Here we report that the inhibitive direction becomes rate&#8208;enhancing after some increase in the EEF. The EEF value that brings about the maximum possible inhibition for the reaction is defined as the electrostatic resistance point (ERP). The possibility of both normal and inverse electron&#8208;demand DA reactions causes catalytic activity in both directions of the EEF starting at a unique ERP value. The C5 substituents of cyclopentadiene control the ERP values depending upon the resistance power that the functional group provides against the EEF. The endo and exo diastereomeric transition states of the DA reaction have distinct ERP values and the difference (&#916;ERP) provides the through&#8208;space electrostatic contribution to the stereoselectivity on a relative scale. Thus, the ERP values can be used as a gauge for the electrostatic interactions between substituent groups and external stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Forging Medium Rings via I(I)/I(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Diene Carbofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A main&#8208;group catalysis&#8208;based strategy to access 8&#8208;membered carbocycles via the direct carbofunctionalization of 2&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes is disclosed. Through the intervention of an I(I)/I(III) catalysis cycle, the synthesis of densely functionalized, fluorinated benzocyclooctenes can be achieved in an operationally simple manner. Modulating the oxidation / activation regime, and the external nucleophile, the process has been extended to unify the challenging cyclization with formation of allylic C&#8208;O, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;C bonds (&gt;30 examples). Derivatization of the product benzocyclooctenes is demonstrated together with X&#8208;ray conformational analysis, preliminary validation of enantioselective catalysis and a scalable resolution protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Stereoselective Glycosylation via Rh(II) and Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Cocatalyzed Carbenoid Insertion to Anomeric OH Bond for the Synthesis of Glycoconjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical synthesis of glycoconjugates is essential for studying the biological functions of carbohydrates. We herein report an efficient approach for the stereoselective synthesis of challenging &#945;&#8208;linked glycoconjugates via a Rh(II)/chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;cocatalyzed dynamic kinetic anomeric O&#8208;alkylation of sugar&#8208;derived lactols via carbenoid insertion to the anomeric OH bond. Notably, we observed excellent anomeric selectivity, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and high efficiency for this glycosylation reaction by exploring various parameters of the cocatalytic system. DFT calculations suggested that the anomeric selectivity was mainly determined by steric interactions between the C2&#8208;carbon of the carbohydrate and the phenyl group of the metal carbenoid, while &#960;/&#960; interactions with the C2&#8208;OBn substituent on the carbohydrate substrate play a significant role for diastereoselectivity at the newly generated stereogenic center.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;metal Ionothermal Synthesis of Metallophthalocyanine Covalent Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phthalocyanines (PCs) are intriguing building blocks owing to their stability, physicochemical and catalytic properties. Although PC&#8208;based polymers have been reported before, many suffer from relatively low stability, crystallinity, and low surface areas. Utilizing a mixed metal salt ionothermal approach, we report the synthesis of a series of metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) starting from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene and 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetracyanoanthracene to form the corresponding COFs named M&#8208;pPPCs and M&#8208;anPPCs, respectively. The obtained COFs followed the Irving&#8208;Williams series in their metal contents, surface areas, and pore volume and featured excellent CO2 uptake capacities up to 7.6 mmol g&#8208;1 at 273 K, 1.1 bar. We also investigated the growth of the Co&#8208;pPPC and Co&#8208;anPPC on a highly conductive carbon nanofiber and demonstrated their high catalytic activity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction, which showed Faradaic efficiencies towards CO up to 74% at &#8208;0.64 V vs. RHE.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis with Gaseous Molecular Ions: Harvesting [B12Br11N2]&#8722; From a Mass Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mass spectrometry frequently reveals the existence of transient gas phase ions that have not been synthesized in solution or in bulk. These elusive ions are, therefore, often considered to be primarily of analytical value in fundamental gas phase studies. Here, we provide proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the products of ion&#8208;molecule reactions in mass spectrometers may be collected on surfaces to generate condensed matter and thus serve as building blocks to synthesize new compounds. The highly reactive fragment anion [B12Br11]&#8722; was generated in a mass spectrometer and converted to [B12Br11N2]&#8722; in the presence of molecular nitrogen followed by its mass&#8208;selection and soft&#8208;landing on surfaces. The molecular structure of [B12Br11N2]&#8722;, which has not been synthetically obtained before, was confirmed by conventional methods of molecular analysis, including nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The [B12Br11N2]&#8722; ion is stable on surfaces and in solution at room temperature, but thermal annealing induces elimination of N2 and provides access to the highly reactive intermediate [B12Br11]&#8722; in the condensed phase, which can be further used as a reagent, for example, for electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Thus, isolation of [B12Br11N2]&#8722; expands the repertoire of the available diazo ions that can be employed as versatile intermediates in various chemical transformations.</dc:description>

The highly reactive fragment anion [B12Br11]&#8722; was generated in a mass spectrometer and converted to [B12Br11N2]&#8722; in the presence of molecular nitrogen followed by its mass-selection and soft-landing on surfaces. The molecular structure of [B12Br11N2]&#8722;, which has not been synthetically obtained before, was confirmed by conventional methods of molecular analysis, including nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The [B12Br11N2]&#8722; ion is stable on surfaces and in solution at room temperature, but thermal annealing induces elimination of N2 and provides access to the highly reactive intermediate [B12Br11]&#8722; in the condensed phase, which can be further used as a reagent, for example, for electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Thus, isolation of [B12Br11N2]&#8722; expands the repertoire of the available diazo ions that can be employed as versatile intermediates in various chemical transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Framework&#8208;Hotspot Enhanced Trans Cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a for Clinical Samples Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We generate framework&#8208;hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities and investigate their impact on trans cleavage activity of Cas12a. Further, a modular platform with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based target recognition and FHR&#8208;based signal transduction is developed, which enables sensitive (100&#8197;fM) and rapid (&lt;15&#8197;min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre&#8208;amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples.







Abstract
The trans&#8208;cleavage property of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a system makes it an excellent tool for disease diagnosis. Nevertheless, most methods based on CRISPR&#8208;Cas system still require pre&#8208;amplification of the target to achieve the desired detection sensitivity. Here we generate Framework&#8208;Hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities to investigate their effect on trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a. We find that the cleavage efficiency increases and the cleavage rate accelerates with increasing reporter density. We further construct a modular sensing platform with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based target recognition and FHR&#8208;based signal transduction. Encouragingly, this modular platform enables sensitive (100&#8197;fM) and rapid (&lt;15&#8197;min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre&#8208;amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples. The design provides a facile strategy for enhanced trans cleavage of Cas12a, which accelerates and broadens its applications in biosensing.

         <title>A Thiazole&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework for Lithium&#8208;Sulphur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are crystalline and porous materials, which offer a platform for integrating functional moieties in their backbone. Also, these materials can be post&#8208;synthetically modified for targeted applications. Herein, using molecular sulphur (S8), a post&#8208;synthetic topochemical conversion of an imine&#8208;linked COF into a thiazole&#8208;linked COF was performed for enhancing energy storage performance in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulphur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are a promising alternative power source, as they can provide a higher energy density than current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Porous materials are often used as cathode materials as they can act as a host for sulphur in such batteries. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have also been used, however they typically suffer from stability issues, resulting in limited and thus insufficient durability under practical conditions and applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based dimethoxybenzo&#8208;dithiophene functionalized COF (TTT&#8208;DMTD) incorporating high&#8208;density redox sites. The imine linkages were further post&#8208;synthetically transformed to yield a robust thiazole&#8208;linked COF (THZ&#8208;DMTD) by utilizing a sulphur&#8208;assisted chemical conversion method, while maintaining the crystallinity. As a synergistic effect of its high crystallinity, porosity and the presence of redox&#8208;active moieties, the thiazole&#8208;linked THZ&#8208;DMTD exhibited a high capacity and long&#8208;term stability (642&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;C; 78.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles) when applied as a cathode material in a Li&#8722;S battery.

         <title>Fucose Binding Motifs on Mucin Core Glycopeptides Impact Bacterial Lectin Recognition
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable studies of fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins, a library of fucosylated mucin glycopeptides carrying Lewis&#8208; and H&#8208;antigen structures on mucin core glycans was prepared using a chemoenzymatic approach. This library was applied to evaluate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecB and the Clostridium difficile toxin A binding preferences to explore the importance of the glycan core and peptide backbone presentation for lectin recognition.







Abstract
Mucin glycoproteins are essential components of the mucosal barrier, which protects the host from pathogens. Throughout evolution, bacteria have developed strategies to modulate and penetrate this barrier, and cause virulence by interacting with mucin O&#8208;glycans at the epithelial cell&#8208;surface. O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes on mucins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. Here, a chemoenzymatic synthesis strategy is described to prepare a library of fucosylated mucin core glycopeptides to enable studies of mucin&#8208;interacting and fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins. Glycan cores with biologically important Lewis and H&#8208;antigens were prepared decorating the peptide backbone at different sites and densities. The fucosylated mucin glycopeptides were applied in microarray binding studies to explore the importance of glycan core and peptide backbone presentation of these antigens in binding interactions with the P.&#8197;aeruginosa lectin LecB and the C.&#8197;difficile toxin&#8197;A.

         <title>Identifying the Role of Lewis&#8208;base Sites for the Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis&#8208;base site of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 is capable of capturing Li+ during the discharge process, which can optimize the adsorption strength of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 towards LiO2 intermediates, thereby leading to the solution&#8208;mediated growth of Li2O2 and ultimately improving the discharge capacity of the lithium&#8208;oxygen battery. In addition, Lewis&#8208;base site can promote the activation of O2 and Li2O2 to reduce the overpotential of the lithium&#8208;oxygen battery.







Abstract
Lewis&#8208;base sites have been widely applied to regulate the properties of Lewis&#8208;acid sites in electrocatalysts for achieving a drastic technological leap of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Whereas, the direct role and underlying mechanism of Lewis&#8208;base in the chemistry for LOBs are still rarely elucidated. Herein, we comprehensively shed light on the pivotal mechanism of Lewis&#8208;base sites in promoting the electrocatalytic reaction processes of LOBs by constructing the metal&#8211;organic framework containing Lewis&#8208;base sites (named as UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the Lewis&#8208;base sites can act as electron donors that boost the activation of O2/Li2O2 during the discharged&#8208;charged process, resulting in the accelerated reaction kinetics of LOBs. More importantly, the in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra and DFT calculations firstly demonstrate the Lewis&#8208;base sites can convert Li2O2 growth mechanism from surface&#8208;adsorption growth to solvation&#8208;mediated growth due to the capture of Li+ by Lewis&#8208;base sites upon discharged process, which weakens the adsorption energy of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 towards LiO2. As a proof of concept, LOB based on UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can achieve a high discharge specific capacity (12&#8201;661&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), low discharged&#8208;charged overpotential (0.87&#8197;V) and long cycling life (169&#8197;cycles). This work reveals the direct role of Lewis&#8208;base sites, which can guide the design of electrocatalysts featuring Lewis&#8208;acid/base dual centers for LOBs.

         <title>Facile Tuned TSCT&#8208;TADF in Donor&#8208;Acceptor MOF for Highly Adjustable Photonic Modules based on Heterostructures Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8208;A MOF) featuring highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) were realized. Furthermore, heterostructures crystals featuring highly adjustable emissions in wide wavelength range was fabricated, illustrating its potential as photonic modules for photonic integrated circuit applications.







Abstract
Highly adjustable photonic modules were constructed based on the heterostructures crystals of a new series of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8208;A MOF) featuring highly tunable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By introducing N&#8208;phenylcarbazole and derivatives as donor guests into the acceptor host NKU&#8208;111, highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer based TADF could be achieved through the engineering of heavy atom effect, which result in modulatable emission wavelength (540 to 600&#8197;nm) and enhanced quantum yield (up to 30.86&#8201;%). Furthermore, by rationally integrating the D&#8208;A MOFs with distinctive emissions, rod&#8208;like heterostructures crystals featuring excitation position dependent tip emissions in wide wavelength range (495 to 598&#8197;nm) could be fabricated, which could serve as highly potential photonic modules for photonic circuit applications.

         <title>Developing Insoluble Polyoxometalate Clusters to Bridge Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Water Oxidation Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cobalt(II)&#8208;containing polyoxometalate (POM) cluster&#8208;based solid catalysts were synthesized with different counter&#8208;cations and applied to photocatalytic water oxidation. Candidates in the series bridge homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts by offering activity comparable to the parent homogeneous catalyst and good recyclability.







Abstract
Cluster catalysts are attractive for their atomically precise structures, defined compositions, tunable coordination environments, uniform active sites, and their ability to transfer multiple electrons, but they suffer from poor stability and recyclability. Here, we report a general approach to the direct insolubilization of a water soluble polyoxometalate (POM) [{(B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PW9O34)Co3(OH)(H2O)2(O3PC(O)&#8208;(C3H6NH3)PO3)}2Co]14&#8722; (Co7) and formation of a series of POM&#8208;based solid catalysts with the counter&#8208;cations Ag+, Cs+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Y3+, and Ce3+. They exhibit improved catalytic activities for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation following the trend CsCo7&gt;SrCo7&gt;AgCo7&gt;CeIIICo7&gt;BaCo7&gt;YCo7&gt;PbCo7. While CsCo7 exhibits mainly homogeneous catalysis, the others are predominantly heterogeneous catalysts. An optimal oxygen yield of 41.3&#8201;% and a high apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 30.6&#8201;% for SrCo7 is obtained, which is comparable to that of the parent homogeneous POM. Band gap structures, UV/Vis spectra, and real&#8208;time laser flash photolysis experiments collectively suggest that easier electron transfer from the solid POM catalyst to the photosensitizer promotes photocatalytic water oxidation performance. These solid POM catalysts exhibit good stability, which is directly confirmed by a combination of Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, five cycles of tests, and poisoning experiments.

         <title>A Pro&#8208;Fluorescent Ubiquitin&#8208;Based Probe to Monitor Cysteine&#8208;Based E3 Ligase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is an increased interest in E3 ligases as drug targets. Here we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye Rhodol triggering a strong fluorescence signal. Our platform allows detection of changes in E3 transthiolation activity in real time for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract ligases, as well as the discovery of new ligands for E3 ligases.







Abstract
Protein post&#8208;translational modification with ubiquitin (Ub) is a versatile signal regulating almost all aspects of cell biology, and an increasing range of diseases is associated with impaired Ub modification. In this light, the Ub system offers an attractive, yet underexplored route to the development of novel targeted treatments. A promising strategy for small molecule intervention is posed by the final components of the enzymatic ubiquitination cascade, E3 ligases, as they determine the specificity of the protein ubiquitination pathway. Here, we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe, which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye, amenable to profile the E3 transthiolation activity for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract E3 ligases. UbSRhodol enabled detection of changes in transthiolation efficacy evoked by enzyme key point mutations or conformational changes, and offers an excellent assay reagent amenable to a high&#8208;throughput screening setup allowing the identification of small molecules modulating E3 activity.

         <title>Noncovalent Modulation of Chemoselectivity in the Gas Phase Leads to a Switchover in Reaction Type from Heterolytic to Homolytic to Electrocyclic Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different reaction types (homolytic, heterolytic, and electrocyclic cleavage) can be selectively activated in the gas phase through a modulation of noncovalent interactions for a multifunctional amino&#8208;azoalkane, as shown by mass spectrometry, transition&#8208;state modeling, and DFT calculations. Three different &#963; bonds are being broken, demonstrating a supramolecular control of chemoselectivity that is reminiscent of mode&#8208;selective chemistry.







Abstract
In the gas phase, thermal activation of supramolecular assemblies such as host&#8211;guest complexes leads commonly to noncovalent dissociation into the individual components. Chemical reactions, for example of encapsulated guest molecules, are only found in exceptional cases. As observed by mass spectrometry, when 1&#8208;amino&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;2&#8208;ene (DBOA) is complexed by the macrocycle &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin, its protonated complex undergoes collision&#8208;induced dissociation into its components, the conventional reaction pathway. Inside the macrocyclic cavity of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7), a competitive chemical reaction of monoprotonated DBOA takes place upon thermal activation, namely a stepwise homolytic covalent bond cleavage with the elimination of N2, while the doubly protonated CB7&#8901;DBOA complex undergoes an inner&#8208;phase elimination of ethylene, a concerted, electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction. These chemical reaction pathways stand in contrast to the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of uncomplexed monoprotonated DBOA, for which an elimination of NH3 predominates upon collision&#8208;induced activation, as a heterolytic bond cleavage reaction. The combined results, which can be rationalized in terms of organic&#8208;chemical reaction mechanisms and density&#8208;function theoretical calculations, demonstrate that chemical reactions in the gas phase can be steered chemoselectively through noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of cis&#8208;Decalins by Merging the Birch Reduction and Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized chiral cis&#8208;decalins was realized by merging Birch reduction and a tandem olefin migration/asymmetric IEDDA reaction. Up to six contiguous and two quaternary stereocenters could be formed in one step by efficient kinetic resolution. The synthetic value of the approach is illustrated by the concise total synthesis of (+)&#8208;occidentalol and the synthesis of a key intermediate for seven triterpenes.







Abstract
Herein, we show that the combination of the Birch reduction of readily available anisole derivatives and the catalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones can serve as a powerful platform for the diverse synthesis of synthetically important cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds. Enabled by a well&#8208;modified chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand/CuII complex, a wide range of polysubstituted cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds with up to six contiguous stereocenters were generated efficiently. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by the concise synthesis of the sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;occidentalol and a key intermediate for seven triterpenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes formed in situ are the key intermediates, and efficient kinetic resolution occurs when C2&#8208; and/or C3&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes are utilized as substrates. DFT calculations elucidated that the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction proceeds in a stepwise fashion and revealed the origins of the stereoselectivities.

         <title>A Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Pathologically Activated Assay for Efficient Bioorthogonal Catalytic Selective Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A representative acid/H2S&#8208;responsive molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based POM doped with Cu (Cu&#8208;POM NCs) has been constructed for selective antibiofilm therapy. The Cu&#8208;POM NCs not only self&#8208;assemble into larger aggregates for biofilm&#8208;responsive and efficient alkyne&#8208;azide click (CuAAC) reactions to generate antibacterial molecules, but also produce a NIR&#8208;II photothermal effect, switchable by H2S in pathogens for selective therapy.







Abstract
Since polyoxometalates (POMs) can undergo reversible multi&#8208;electron redox transformations, they have been used to modulate the electronic environment of metal nanoparticles for catalysis. Besides, POMs possess unique electronic structures and acid&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly ability. These properties inspired us to tackle the drawbacks of the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction in biomedical applications, such as low catalytic efficiency and unsatisfactory disease selectivity. Herein, we construct molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based POM nanoclusters doped with Cu (Cu&#8208;POM NCs) as a highly efficient bioorthogonal catalyst, which is responsive to pathologicallyacid and H2S for selective antibiofilm therapy. Leveraging the merits of POMs, the Cu&#8208;POM NCs exhibit biofilm&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior, efficient CuAAC&#8208;mediated in situ synthesis of antibacterial molecules, and a NIR&#8208;II photothermal effect selectively triggered by H2S in pathogens. The consumption of bacterial H2S at the pathological site by Cu&#8208;POM NCs extremely decreases the number of persisterbacteria, which is conducive to the inhibition of bacterial tolerance and elimination of biofilms. Unlocked at pathological sites and endowed with NIR&#8208;II photothermal property, the constructed POM&#8208;based bioorthogonal catalytic platform provides new insights into the design of efficient and selective bioorthogonal catalysts for disease therapy.

         <title>Direct Comparison of Lysine versus Site&#8208;Specific Protein Surface Immobilization in Single&#8208;Molecule Mechanical Assays
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface immobilization technique for atomic force microscopy/single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy is crucial for experimental yield, accuracy and resolution. Reported herein is that a commonly used lysine&#8208;based immobilization can result in significant signal deterioration, including lowering of rupture forces, effective shortening of linkers, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway polyprotein system.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is powerful for studying folding states and mechanical properties of proteins, however, it requires protein immobilization onto force&#8208;transducing probes such as cantilevers or microbeads. A common immobilization method relies on coupling lysine residues to carboxylated surfaces using 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Because proteins typically contain many lysine groups, this strategy results in a heterogeneous distribution of tether positions. Genetically encoded peptide tags (e.g., ybbR) provide alternative chemistries for achieving site&#8208;specific immobilization, but thus far a direct comparison of site&#8208;specific vs. lysine&#8208;based immobilization strategies to assess effects on the observed mechanical properties was lacking. Here, we compared lysine&#8208; vs. ybbR&#8208;based protein immobilization in SMFS assays using several model polyprotein systems. Our results show that lysine&#8208;based immobilization results in significant signal deterioration for monomeric streptavidin&#8208;biotin interactions, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway Cohesin&#8208;Dockerin system. We developed a mixed immobilization approach where a site&#8208;specifically tethered ligand was used to probe surface&#8208;bound proteins immobilized through lysine groups, and found partial recovery of specific signals. The mixed immobilization approach represents a viable alternative for mechanical assays on in vivo&#8208;derived samples or other proteins of interest where genetically encoded tags are not feasible.

         <title>Programmed Pore&#8208;Shape Fixing in a Soft Porous Molecular Crystal&#8212;Navigating the Phase Interconversion Landscape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;known organic soft porous crystal is shown to undergo pore&#8208;shape fixing in response to high&#8208;pressure uptake of CO2 gas. Despite two decades of studies of this material, this work formulates, for the first time, an unambiguous phase interconversion Scheme to facilitate navigation of the metastable phase landscape, which now includes a 4th guest&#8208;free polymorph with enhanced porosity.







Abstract
Pore&#8208;shape fixing effects (PSFEs) in soft porous crystals are a relatively unexplored area of materials chemistry. We report the PSFE in the prototypical dynamic van der Waals solid p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (TBC4). Starting with the high&#8208;density guest&#8208;free phase, two porous shape&#8208;fixed phases were programmed using the stimuli of CO2 pressure and temperature. A suite of complementary in situ techniques, including variable&#8208;pressure (VP) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP differential scanning calorimetry, volumetric sorption analysis, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy was used to track dynamic guest&#8208;induced transformations, providing molecular&#8208;level insight into the PSFE. The interconversion between the two metastable phases is particle size dependent, making this the second example of the PSFE by crystal downsizing, and the first example involving a porous molecular crystal: larger particles undergo reversible transitions while smaller particles remain fixed in the metastable phase. A complete phase interconversion scheme was constructed for the material, thus allowing navigation of the phase interconversion landscape of TBC4 using the easily applied stimuli of CO2 pressure and thermal treatment.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective Heteronuclear Polarization Transfer Method for Unambiguous Complex Structure Assignment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;scan ultraselective heteronuclear polarization transfer (UHPT) NMR method is presented. When applied to chromopeptide pharmaceuticals and a diastereomeric mixture of a fungicide with highly complex NMR signals in both the 1H and 13C dimension, this method provided accurate 1H&#8208;13C correlation and 13C&#8197;NMR spectra of individual subunits, which enabled unambiguous structure assignment.







Abstract
Complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals of organic compounds containing multiple analogous substructures or mixtures pose a significant challenge to structural identification, thus resulting in frequent misassignment of structures. The GEMSTONE method, a single&#8208;scan technique that selectively excites a specific proton signal among the crowded NMR signals, was recently proposed as a solution. However, its extension to the polarization transfer method for heteronuclear spin systems was unsuccessful. Herein, we present an extension method that addresses the altered heteronuclear polarization transfer efficiency and enables the acquisition of ultraselective 13C and 1H&#8208;13C correlation NMR subspectra with hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in the structural analysis of a chromopeptide pharmaceutical and a diastereomeric mixture of a fungicide.

         <title>Unraveling the Oxidation Behaviors of MXenes in Aqueous Systems by Active&#8208;Learning&#8208;Potential Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation kinetics of MXenes were studied using active&#8208;learning&#8208;potential molecular dynamics. MXenes spontaneously oxidize to transition&#8208;metal oxides in water, which form oxide protection layers on the surface to further inhibit the oxidation process. The free protons in water also impair the water's motility, inhibiting its attack on the MXene surface.







Abstract
MXenes are 2D materials with great potential in various applications. However, the degradation of MXenes in humid environments has become a main obstacle in their practical use. Here we combine deep neural networks and an active learning scheme to develop a neural network potential (NNP) for aqueous MXene systems with ab initio precision but low cost. The oxidation behaviors of super large aqueous MXene systems are investigated systematically at nanosecond timescales for the first time. The oxidation process of MXenes is clearly displayed at the atomic level. Free protons and oxides greatly inhibit subsequent oxidation reactions, leading to the degree of oxidation of MXenes to exponentially decay with time, which is consistent with the oxidation rate of MXenes measured experimentally. Importantly, this computational study represents the first exploration of the kinetic process of oxidation of super&#8208;sized aqueous MXene systems. It opens a promising avenue for the future development of effective protection strategies aimed at controlling the stability of MXenes.

         <title>Rational Design and Expedient Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Mimetics from Natural Aminoglycosides for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 27 oligosaccharides as heparan sulfate mimetics were efficiently synthesized from the natural aminoglycoside tobramycin in 7&#8211;12 steps. Rapid generation of these sulfated aminoglycans will provide a tool to decipher HS&#8208;protein interactions and develop HS therapeutic potential.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) contains variably repeating disaccharide units organized into high&#8208; and low&#8208;sulfated domains. This rich structural diversity enables HS to interact with many proteins and regulate key signaling pathways. Efforts to understand structure&#8208;function relationships and harness the therapeutic potential of HS are hindered by the inability to synthesize an extensive library of well&#8208;defined HS structures. We herein report a rational and expedient approach to access a library of 27 oligosaccharides from natural aminoglycosides as HS mimetics in 7&#8211;12 steps. This strategy significantly reduces the number of steps as compared to the traditional synthesis of HS oligosaccharides from monosaccharide building blocks. Combined with computational insight, we identify a new class of four trisaccharide compounds derived from the aminoglycoside tobramycin that mimic natural HS and have a strong binding to heparanase but a low affinity for off&#8208;target platelet factor&#8208;4 protein.

         <title>Illustrating the Fate of Methyl Radical in Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO by in situ Synchrotron Radiation Photoionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fleeting intermediates such as methyl radical (&#8901;CH3), methoxy radical and formaldehyde, were captured during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO by in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry, which sheds light on the overoxidation and self&#8208;coupling reaction mechanism of &#8901;CH3.







Abstract
Photocatalysis has emerged as an ideal method for the direct activation and conversion of methane under mild conditions. In this reaction, methyl radical (&#8901;CH3) was deemed a key intermediate that affected the yields and selectivity of the products. However, direct observation of &#8901;CH3 and other intermediates is still challenging. Here, a rectangular photocatalytic reactor coupled with in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry (SR&#8208;PIMS) was developed to detect reactive intermediates within several hundred microseconds during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO. Gas phase &#8901;CH3 generated by photogenerated holes (O&#8722;) was directly observed, and its formation was demonstrated to be significantly enhanced by coadsorbed oxygen molecules. Methoxy radical (CH3O&#8901;) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were confirmed to be key C1 intermediates in photocatalytic methane overoxidation to CO2. The gas&#8208;phase self&#8208;coupling reaction of &#8901;CH3 contributes to the formation of ethane, which indicates the key role of &#8901;CH3 desorption in the highly selective synthesis of ethane. Based on the observed intermediates, the reaction network initiated from &#8901;CH3 of photocatalytic methane oxidation could be clearly illustrated, which is helpful for studying the photocatalytic methane conversion processes.

         <title>New Anderson&#8208;Based Polyoxometalate Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrodes for Energy Storage Boosted Through Keto&#8208;Enol Tautomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The engineering of novel nanostructured electrode materials represents a viable strategy to obtain devices with high energy and power density. We present the synthesis of two novel polyoxometalate&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (POCOF) with superior electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance (125&#8197;F/g), energy and power density (56.2&#8197;Wh/kg and 3.7&#8197;kW/kg, respectively) and high cyclability (5000 cycles).







Abstract
The unique electrochemical properties of polyoxometalates (POMs) render them ideal components for the fabrication of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance energy storage systems. However, their practical applications have been hindered by their high solubility in common electrolytes. This problem can be overcome by the effective hybridization of POMs with other materials. Here we present the design and synthesis of two novel polyoxometalate&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (POCOF) via one&#8208;pot solvothermal strategy between an amino&#8208;functionalized Anderson&#8208;type POM and a trialdehyde&#8208;based building unit. We show that structural and functional complexity can be enriched by adding hydroxyl groups in the 2,4,6 position to the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde allowing to exploit for the first time in POCOFs the keto&#8208;enol tautomerization as additional feature to impart greater chemical stability to the COFs and enhanced properties leading to large specific surface area (347&#8197;m2/g) and superior electrochemical performance of the POCOF&#8208;1 electrodes, when compared with POCOF&#8208;2 electrodes that possess only imine&#8208;type linkage and with pristine POM electrodes. Specifically, POCOF&#8208;1 electrodes display remarkable specific, areal, and volumetric capacitance (125&#8197;F/g, 248&#8197;mF/cm2 and 41.9&#8197;mF/cm3, respectively) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A/g, a maximum energy density (56.2&#8197;Wh/kg), a maximum power density (3.7&#8197;kW/kg) and an outstanding cyclability (90&#8201;% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).

Specifically, POCOF-1 electrodes display remarkable specific, areal, and volumetric capacitance (125&#8197;F/g, 248&#8197;mF/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 41.9&#8197;mF/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A/g, a maximum energy density (56.2&#8197;Wh/kg), a maximum power density (3.7&#8197;kW/kg) and an outstanding cyclability (90&#8201;% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying Degradation Parameters of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

In this work, we demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The cycling stability shows an inverse relationship with the thickness of the NiO surface layer. Simulation analysis further indicates that the slower Li+ diffusivity of NiO mainly accounts for the performance decay of the cathode.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal LiNixCoyMnzO2 (SC&#8208;NCM, x+y+z=1) cathodes are renowned for their high structural stability and reduced accumulation of adverse side products during long&#8208;term cycling. While advances have been made using SC&#8208;NCM cathode materials, careful studies of cathode degradation mechanisms are scarce. Herein, we employed quasi single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.20O2 (SC&#8208;NCM65) to test the relationship between cycling performance and material degradation for different charge cutoff potentials. The Li/SC&#8208;NCM65 cells showed &gt;77&#8201;% capacity retention below 4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li after 400 cycles and revealed a significant decay to 56&#8201;% for 4.7&#8197;V cutoff. We demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The NiO&#8208;type layer formation is also responsible for the strongly increased impedance and transition&#8208;metal dissolution. Notably, the capacity loss is found to have a linear relationship with the thickness of the rock&#8208;salt surface layer. Density functional theory and COMSOL Multiphysics modeling analysis further indicate that the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics is decisive, as the lower lithium diffusivity of the NiO phase hinders charge transport from the surface to the bulk.

         <title>Stepwise O2&#8208;Induced Rearrangement and Disassembly of the [NiFe4(OH)(&#956;3&#8208;S)4] Active Site Cluster of CO Dehydrogenase</title>

Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) are inactivated by dioxygen. High&#8208;resolution crystallography was used to show how O2 induces a stepwise rearrangement of the Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster in the active site, with evidence for a reversible and an irreversible phase of cluster destruction. The open coordination site on Ni renders the cluster vulnerable, and its protection offers strategies to prevent inactivation.







Abstract
Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. CODHs are found in anaerobic microorganisms and can rapidly lose their activity when exposed to air. What causes the loss of activity is unclear. In this study, we analyzed the time&#8208;dependent structural changes induced by the presence of air on the metal centers of CODH&#8208;II. We show that inactivation is a multistep process. In a reversible step, the open coordination site on the Ni ion is blocked by a Ni,Fe&#8208;bridging &#956;&#8208;sulfido or chlorido ligand. Blocking this open coordination site with a cyanide ligand stabilizes the cluster against O2&#8208;induced decomposition, indicating that O2 attacks at the Ni ion. In the subsequent irreversible phase, nickel is lost, the Fe ions rearrange and the sulfido ligands disappear. Our data are consistent with a reversible reductive reactivation mechanism to protect CODHs from transient over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of a Giant [Mn86] Nanocage&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Specific CO2 Binding Pockets for Highly Selective CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a bioinspired design strategy, a CO2&#8208;selective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), NKMOF&#8208;9&#8201;a, is fabricated, which possesses unprecedented [Mn86] nanocage&#8208;based structure and high structure robustness. Attributed to the unique enzyme&#8208;like CO2&#8208;binding pockets, NKMOF&#8208;9&#8201;a can selectively remove CO2 from CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures with high selectivities.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas mixtures has demonstrated great potential for solving energy security and environmental sustainability challenges. However, due to similar physicochemical properties between CO2 and other gases as well as the co&#8208;adsorption behavior, the selectivity of CO2 is severely limited in currently reported CO2&#8208;selective sorbents. To address the challenge, we create a bioinspired design strategy and report a robust, microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with unprecedented [Mn86] nanocages. Attributed to the existence of unique enzyme&#8208;like confined pockets, strong coordination interactions and dipole&#8208;dipole interactions are generated for CO2 molecules, resulting in only CO2 molecules fitting in the pocket while other gas molecules are prohibited. Thus, this MOF can selectively remove CO2 from various gas mixtures and show record&#8208;high selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures. Highly efficient CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 separations are achieved, as verified by experimental breakthrough tests. This work paves a new avenue for the fabrication of adsorbents with high CO2 selectivity and provides important guidance for designing highly effective adsorbents for gas separation.

A one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation process applied to 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones under borane catalysis with PhSiH3 for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines is presented. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations were conducted to explore the reaction mechanism. The diastereoselectivity was found to originate from a C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed marked progress in the efficient synthesis of various enantioenriched 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines.

Herein we report that a frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;based catalyst generated via in situ hydroboration of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene with HB(C6F5)2 allows for the one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones with commercially available PhSiH3 to exclusively afford trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr).

     alt="Borane-Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization/Hydrosilylation Towards Enantio- and Diastereoselective Construction of trans-2,3-Disubstituted-1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroquinoxalines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation process applied to 1,2-diaminobenzenes and 1,2-diketones under borane catalysis with PhSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for the enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines is presented. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations were conducted to explore the reaction mechanism. The diastereoselectivity was found to originate from a C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have witnessed marked progress in the efficient synthesis of various enantioenriched 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines. However, enantio- and diastereoselective access to &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines remains much less explored. Herein we report that a frustrated Lewis pair-based catalyst generated via in situ hydroboration of 2-vinylnaphthalene with HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allows for the one-pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2-diaminobenzenes and 1,2-diketones with commercially available PhSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively afford &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr).

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanodots Can Act as Molecular Catalysts in Chemical and Photochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chiral carbon nanodots (CNDs) is synthesized through a hydrothermal treatment of molecular precursors. The surface amino functionalities along with the photophysical and redox properties of the material allowed its exploitation as a multifunctional catalytic platform. The CNDs promote enantioselective organocatalytic reactions, photochemical processes and organophotoredox transformations.







Abstract
In this work, a microwave synthesis followed by a simple purification process produces a new type of chiral Carbon Nanodots (CNDs). These CNDs are soluble in organic solvents, exhibit amino groups on their surface and display interesting absorption and emission properties along with mirror image profiles in the electronic circular dichroism spectrum. All these features set the stage for CNDs to act as multifunctional catalytic platforms, able to promote diverse chemical transformations. In particular, the outer shell composition of CNDs was instrumental to carry out organocatalytic reactions in an enantioselective fashion. In addition, the redox and light&#8208;absorbing properties of the material are suitable to drive photochemical processes. Finally, the photoredox and organocatalytic activations of CNDs were exploited at the same time to promote a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. This work demonstrates that CNDs can be used as catalysts to promote multiple reactivities, previously considered exclusive domain of molecular catalysts.

         <title>Electrolyte Design for Improving Mechanical Stability of Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emerging electrolyte design, which can construct high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes, is proposed for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. High&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI effectively restricts its fracture and ongoing reactions of electrolytes on lithium metal anodes, which notably improves the stability of practical lithium&#8211;sulfur coin and pouch cells.







Abstract
Practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are severely plagued by the instability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed in routine ether electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte with 1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (TO) and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) as co&#8208;solvents is proposed to construct a high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI by enriching organic components in Li&#8722;S batteries. The high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI works compatibly in Li&#8722;S batteries. TO with high polymerization capability can preferentially decompose and form organic&#8208;rich SEI, strengthening mechanical stability of SEI, which mitigates crack and regeneration of SEI and reduces the consumption rate of active Li, Li polysulfides, and electrolytes. Meanwhile, DME ensures high specific capacity of S cathodes. Accordingly, the lifespan of Li&#8722;S batteries increases from 75&#8197;cycles in routine ether electrolyte to 216&#8197;cycles in TO&#8208;based electrolyte. Furthermore, a 417&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Li&#8722;S pouch cell undergoes 20&#8197;cycles. This work provides an emerging electrolyte design for practical Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Synthesis and Optoelectronic Applications of d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; Conjugated Polymers with a Di&#8208;metallaaromatic Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a di&#8208;metallaaromatic acceptor with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, and introduced it to a series of d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugated metallopolymers using a double&#8208;monomer polymerization methodology. These metallopolymers can be applied as electron transport layer materials of an organic solar cell, improving the power conversion efficiency considerably.







Abstract
The development of conjugated polymers especially n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks. Herein, a strong acceptor building block with di&#8208;metallaaromatic structure was designed and synthesized by connecting two electron&#8208;deficient metallaaromatic units through a &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridge. Then, a double&#8208;monomer polymerization methodology was developed for inserting it into conjugated polymer scaffolds to yield metallopolymers. The isolated well&#8208;defined model oligomers indicated polymer structures. Kinetic studies based on nuclear magnetic resonance and ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopies shed light on the polymerization process. Interestingly, the resulted metallopolymers with d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugations are very promising electron transport layer materials which can boost photovoltaic performance of an organic solar cell, with power conversion efficiency up to 18.28&#8201;% based on the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;EH&#8208;HD&#8208;4F non&#8208;fullerene system. This work not only provides a facile route to construct metallaaromatic conjugated polymers with various functional groups, but also discovers their potential applications for the first time.

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents is reported wherein two alkyl&#8208;alkyl bonds are generated in one step.







Abstract
We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;&#8208;halocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents. The reaction produces &#947;&#8208;arylated alkanecarbonyl compounds with the generation of two new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds at the vicinal carbons of alkenes. This reaction is effective for the use of primary, secondary and tertiary &#945;&#8208;halocarboxylic esters, amides and ketones in conjunction with primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents as the sources of two C(sp3) carbons for the dialkylation of terminal and cyclic internal alkenes.

&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;-bromocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents is reported wherein two alkyl-alkyl bonds are generated in one step.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disclose a Ni-catalyzed regioselective dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;-halocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents. The reaction produces &#947;-arylated alkanecarbonyl compounds with the generation of two new C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds at the vicinal carbons of alkenes. This reaction is effective for the use of primary, secondary and tertiary &#945;-halocarboxylic esters, amides and ketones in conjunction with primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents as the sources of two C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) carbons for the dialkylation of terminal and cyclic internal alkenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimerization of a Reactive Azaacene Diradical: Synthesis of a Covalent Azaacene Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization of two reactive dicyanomethyl diradicals forms a covalent azaacene cage. In this cascade, four new, elongated &#963;&#8208;CC&#8208;bonds (marked in red) are formed and the internal alkynes transformed into cumulenes. The cage was investigated via several spectroscopy methods at different temperatures, suggesting the reformation of its constituting diradical.







Abstract
Two series of regioisomeric dicyanomethylene substituted dithienodiazatetracenes with formal para&#8208; or ortho&#8208;quinodimethane subunits were synthesized and characterized. Whereas the para&#8208;isomers (p&#8208;n, diradical index y0=0.01) are stable and isolable, the ortho&#8208;isomer (y0=0.98) dimerizes into a covalent azaacene cage. Four elongated &#963;&#8208;CC bonds are formed and the former triisopropylsilyl(TIPS) &#8208;ethynylene groups transformed into cumulene units. The azaacene cage dimer (o&#8208;1)2 was characterized by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis and temperature&#8208;dependent infrared (IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR, solid&#8208;state), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopies (solution) indicating reformation of o&#8208;1.

         <title>Directly Imaging and Regulating the Nanoscale Inhomogeneity of S&#8208;Vacancies in Molybdenum Disulfide Monolayer during Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change of activity of molybdenum disulfide monolayer with potential during hydrogen evolution is observed by opto&#8208;electrochemical imaging. The inhomogeneous spatial distribution of local active sites and uncharged impurities is identified with high sensitivity. The WE, RE and CE represent the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.







Abstract
The study of electron transfer event on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides has attracted tremendous attentions attributing to their promising applications in electrochemical devices. Herein, we demonstrate an opto&#8208;electrochemical strategy to directly map and regulate electron transfer event on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer by combining bright field (BF) imaging technique with electrochemical modulation. The heterogeneity of electrochemical activity on MoS2 monolayer down to nanoscale is resolved spatiotemporally. The thermodynamics of MoS2 monolayer is measured during electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and the Arrhenius correlations are obtained. We validate that the defect generation engineered by oxygen plasma bombardment dramatically enhances the local electrochemical activity of MoS2 monolayer, which can be attributed to point defects of S&#8208;vacancies as evidenced. Furthermore, by comparing the difference of electron transfer event on MoS2 with various layers, the interlayer coupling effect is uncovered. This study represents a facile method to image the heterogeneity of electrochemical properties for nanomaterials with atomic thickness and regulate the local activity within the plane by extrinsic factors. It also has potential applications in the design and evaluation of high&#8208;performance layered electrochemical systems down to nanoscale.

         <title>Bright Free&#8208;Radical Emission in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole ionic liquids have been used to protect photoinduced radical emissions from carbonyl through electrostatic interactions and spin delocalization effects, with a highest emission efficiency of 53.3&#8201;% achieved. The radical system could be used to build multi&#8208;color and heat&#8208;responsive luminescence materials. They could also be used to detect different amine compounds based on the change in the emission and photoactivation times.







Abstract
It is challenging to achieve stable and efficient radical emissions under ambient conditions. Herein, we present a rational design strategy to protect photoinduced carbonyl free radical emission through electrostatic interaction and spin delocalization effects. The host&#8208;guest system is constructed from tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules and a series of imidazolium ionic liquids as the guest and host, respectively, whereby the carbonyl anion radical emission can be in situ generated under the light irradiation and further stabilized by electrostatic interaction. More importantly, the anion species and the alkyl chain length of imidazolium ionic liquids show a noticeable effect on luminescence efficiency, with the highest radical emission efficiency is as high as 53.3&#8201;% after optimizing the imidazole ionic liquid's structure, which is about four times higher than the polymer&#8208;protected radical system. Theoretical calculations confirm the synergistic effect of strong electrostatic interactions and that the spin delocalization effect significantly stabilizes the radical emission. Moreover, such a radical emission system also could be integrated with a fluorescent dye to induce multi&#8208;color or even white light emission with reversible temperature&#8208;responsive characteristics. The radical emission system can also be used to detect different amine compounds on the basis of the emission changes and photoactivation time.

         <title>T&#8208;shaped Ni0 Systems Featuring Cationic Tetrylenes: Direct Observation of L/Z&#8208;type Ligand Duality, and Alkene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic low&#8208;coordinate tetrylenes are shown to behave as Z&#8208;type ligands towards Ni0, forming rare T&#8208;shaped Ni0 complexes. These selectively bind classical N&#8208;bases at EII (E=Ge, Sn), which switches the nature of this ligand centre from Z&#8208; to L&#8208;type, concomitant with a geometry switch at Ni to trigonal planar. T&#8208;shaped systems are active catalysts for alkene hydrogenation, establishing a new class of catalyst for this challenging transformation.







Abstract
We report a facile synthetic method for accessing rare T&#8208;shaped Ni0 species, stabilised by low&#8208;coordinate cationic germylene and stannylene ligands which behave as Z&#8208;type ligands toward Ni0. An in&#8208;depth computational analysis indicates significant Nid&#8594;Ep donation (E=Ge, Sn), with essentially no E&#8594;Ni donation. The tetrylene ligand's Lewis acidity can be modulated in situ through the addition of a donor ligand, which selectively binds at the Lewis acidic tetrylene site. This switches this binding centre from a Z&#8208;type to a classical L&#8208;type ligand, with a concomitant geometry switch at Ni0 from T&#8208;shaped to trigonal planar. Exploring the effects of this geometry switch in catalysis, isolated T&#8208;shaped complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;c and 4&#8201;a&#8211;c are capable of the hydrogenation of alkenes under mild conditions, whilst the closely related trigonal planar and tetrahedral Ni0 complexes 5, D, and E, which feature L&#8208;type chloro&#8208; or cationic&#8208;tetrylene ligands, are inactive under these conditions. Further, addition of small amounts of N&#8208;bases to the catalytic systems involving T&#8208;shaped complexes significantly reduces turnover rates, giving evidence for the in situ modulation of ligand electronics for catalytic switching.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones via Tandem Allylboration/Lactonization: a Kinetic Resolution Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones via a tandem allylboration/lactonization approach was achieved using a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex. The kinetic resolution of the allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization was found to be a key aspect responsible for the success of this transformation. Stereodivergent syntheses and total syntheses of eupomatilones 2, 5 and 6 proved its synthetic utility.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone motif is a widely encountered unit in many natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, a practical and efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones from readily available allylic boronates and benzaldehyde derivatives was developed with chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex as the catalyst. The key success of this transformation was the kinetic resolution of allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization. This protocol enabled to assemble all of four stereoisomers from the same set of starting materials upon variable lactonization. Taking advantage of the current method as the key step, catalytic asymmetric total synthesis of eupomatilones 2, 5, and 6 was accomplished. Control experiments were carried out to probe into the tandem reaction as well as the origin of stereoselectivities.

         <title>Low&#8208;silica Cu&#8208;CHA Zeolite Enriched with Al Pairs Transcribed from Silicoaluminophosphate Seed: Synthesis and Ammonia Selective Catalytic Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>

The strict &#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promoted the Al pairs with the &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; sequence via a transcription process and thus results in a low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite with enriched Al pairs.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;exchanged low&#8208;silica CHA zeolites (Si/Al&#8804;4) synthesized without organic templates are promising candidate catalysts for ammonia selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NH3&#8208;SCR), but their practical application is restricted due to the low hydrothermal stability. Here, inspired by the transcription from duplex DNA to RNA, we synthesized Al pairs enriched low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite (CHA&#8208;SPAEI, Si/Al=3.7) by using silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) featured by strict alternation of &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; tetrahedra as seed. The proportion of Al pairs in CHA&#8722;SPAEI is 78&#8201;%, which is much higher than that in the conventional low&#8208;silica CHA (CHA&#8208;LS, 52&#8201;%). After hydrothermal ageing at 800&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h, Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;SPAEI shows NO conversion above 90&#8201;% within 225&#8211;500&#8201;&#176;C under a gas hourly space velocity of 200,000&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is much better than that of Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;LS. The spatial close proximity of Al pairs in CHA&#8208;SPAEI is confirmed by the 27Al double&#8208;quantum single&#8208;quantum two&#8208;dimensional NMR analyses. The strict &#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8208; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promotes the Al pairs with the &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; sequence via a transcription process. The utilization of aluminophosphate&#8208;based zeolites as seeds opens up a new avenue for the regulation of the Al distribution in zeolites.

         <title>Expedient Access to Enantioenriched 1&#8208;Azaspiro Cyclobutanones Enabled by Modified Heyns Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a unified strategy for the asymmetric construction of [3,4]&#8208;azaspirocycles by employing the Heyns reactivity upon its electrophilic modification. The chiral phosphoric acid is an efficient catalyst for this transformation and allows to access a wide range of cyclobutanone containing 1&#8208;azaspirocycles with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Leveraging the unexplored regions of chemical space, the integration of spirocyclic cyclobutane in a molecular scaffold opens up a new vista in modern drug discovery. Despite recent advancements in achieving the synthesis of such motifs, strategies for their asymmetric construction have not been well&#8208;recognized and remain a formidable challenge. Herein, for the first time, we have demonstrated a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;azaspiro cyclobutanone enabled by an unusual reactivity of enamine that explore the potentiality of Heyns rearrangement upon electrophilic modification. This design strategy offers viable access to a wide range of cyclobutanone containing spiroindoline and spiropyrrolidine derivatives in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Furthermore, the practicality of this methodology has been shown by a scale&#8208;up synthesis of spirocyclic products and their facile post&#8208;synthetic modifications.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer from Xanthates to Acyl Azoliums: Divergent Ketone Synthesis via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile NHC&#8208;catalyzed method has been developed for synthesizing ketones from alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives through SET (single electron transfer) between photoexcited xanthates and acyl azoliums. This approach further facilitates the generation of structurally diverse cross&#8208;coupled ketones by incorporating alkenes and enynes.







Abstract
Considering the prevalence of alcohols and carboxylic acids, their fragment cross&#8208;coupling reactions could hold significant implications in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a versatile method for synthesizing a diverse range of ketones from alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that photoexcited xanthates and acyl azoliums undergo single electron transfer (SET) under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions, generating NHC&#8208;derived ketyl radicals and alkyl radicals. These open&#8208;shell intermediates subsequently undergo the radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction, yielding valuable ketones. Furthermore, this approach can be employed in three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and enynes, resulting in structurally diverse cross&#8208;coupled ketones. The unified strategy offers a unique opportunity for the fragment coupling of a diverse range of alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives, accommodating diverse functional groups even in complex settings.

         <title>Revealing Active Sites and Reaction Pathways in Methane Non&#8208;Oxidative Coupling over Iron&#8208;Containing Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siliceous iron&#8208;containing zeolites were synthesized for methane non&#8208;oxidative coupling. Advanced spectroscopic investigations elucidated the active sites including Fe2+ species and Fe (oxy)carbides dispersed in zeolite pores, and revealed the gas&#8208;phase reaction pathways starting from methyl radicals towards (poly)aromatic species.







Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative coupling of methane is a promising route to obtain ethylene directly from natural gas. We synthesized siliceous [Fe]zeolites with MFI and CHA topologies and found that they display high selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;% for MFI and &gt;99&#8201;% for CHA) to ethylene and ethane among gas&#8208;phase products. Deactivated [Fe]zeolites can be regenerated by burning coke in air. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Fe3+ centers in zeolite framework of fresh catalysts are reduced during the reaction to the active sites, including Fe2+ species and Fe (oxy)carbides dispersed in zeolite pores. Photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy results show that methyl radicals are the reaction intermediates formed upon methane activation. Ethane is formed by methyl radical coupling, followed by its dehydrogenation to ethylene. Based on the observation of intermediates including allene, vinylacetylene, 1,3&#8208;butadiene, 2&#8208;butyne, and cyclopentadiene over [Fe]MFI, a reaction network is proposed leading to polyaromatic species. Such reaction intermediates are not observed over the small&#8208;pore [Fe]CHA, where ethylene and ethane are the only gas&#8208;phase products.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Gated and Self&#8208;Protected Bioorthogonal Catalyst for Nanozyme&#8208;Assisted Safe Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described a self&#8208;protected and responsive bioorthogonal catalyst to achieve efficient and precise intracellular drug synthesis for safe cancer combination therapy. This appealing strategy will promote the development of bioorthogonal catalyst&#8208;mediated novel antineoplastic platforms.







Abstract
Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal uncaging catalysis has sparked increasing interest in prodrug activation. However, due to their &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; catalytic activity as well as the complex and catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment, the biosafety and therapeutic efficiency of TMCs are unsatisfactory. Herein, a DNA&#8208;gated and self&#8208;protected bioorthogonal catalyst has been designed by modifying nanozyme&#8208;Pd0 with highly programmable nucleic acid (DNA) molecules to achieve efficient intracellular drug synthesis for cancer therapy. Monolayer DNA molecules could endow the catalyst with targeting and perform as a gatekeeper to achieve selective prodrug activation within cancer cells. Meanwhile, the prepared graphitic nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanozyme with glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activities could improve the catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment to prevent the catalyst from being inactivated and sensitize the subsequent chemotherapy. Overall, we believe that our work will promote the development of secure and efficient bioorthogonal catalytic systems and provide new insights into novel antineoplastic platforms.

         <title>Combining Carbazole Building Blocks and &#957;&#8208;DABNA Heteroatom Alignment for a Double Boron&#8208;Embedded MR&#8208;TADF Emitter with Improved Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collocating carbazole building blocks with &#957;&#8208;DABNA heteroatom alignment, a novel double boron&#8208;embedded multiple resonance emitter &#928;&#8208;CzBN is obtained and exhibits superior photophysical properties. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on &#928;&#8208;CzBN achieve an exceptional efficiency of 39.3&#8201;% with a mild roll&#8208;off and a narrow full width at half maximum of 21&#8197;nm/106&#8197;meV in the bluish&#8208;green region.







Abstract
Building blocks and heteroatom alignments are two determining factors in designing multiple resonance (MR)&#8208;type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. Carbazole&#8208;fused MR emitters, represented by CzBN derivatives, and the heteroatom alignments of &#957;&#8208;DABNA are two star series of MR&#8208;TADF emitters that show impressive performances from the aspects of building blocks and heteroatom alignments, respectively. Herein, a novel CzBN analog, &#928;&#8208;CzBN, featuring &#957;&#8208;DABNA heteroatom alignment is developed via facile one&#8208;shot lithium&#8208;free borylation. &#928;&#8208;CzBN exhibits superior photophysical properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield close to 100&#8201;% and narrowband sky blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16&#8197;nm/85&#8197;meV. It also gives efficient TADF properties with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy offset of 40&#8197;meV and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 2.9&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. The optimized OLED using &#928;&#8208;CzBN as the emitter achieves an exceptional external quantum efficiency of 39.3&#8201;% with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 20&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and a narrowband emission at 495&#8197;nm with FWHM of 21&#8197;nm/106&#8197;meV, making it one of the best reported devices based on MR emitters with comprehensive performance.

         <dc:description>
The advancement of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts bears practical significance for improving photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. A MOF glass catalyst was synthesized via a melting glass&#8208;forming cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62). Introducing the MOF glass catalyst on various metal oxide semiconductor substrates coupled with NiO hole transport layer constructs the integrated Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes. From experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62 can effectively promote charge transfer and separation, improve carrier mobility, accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction, and thus improve PEC performance.







Abstract
Sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics and serious charge recombination restrict the development of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The advancement of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts bears practical significance for improving PEC water splitting performance. Herein, a MOF glass catalyst through melting glass&#8208;forming cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62) was introduced on various metal oxide (MO: Fe2O3, WO3 and BiVO4) semiconductor substrates coupled with NiO hole transport layer, constructing the integrated Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes. Owing to the excellent conductivity, stability and open active sites of MOF glass, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes exhibit a significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation activity and stability in comparison to pristine MO photoanodes. From experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62 can effectively promote charge transfer and separation, improve carrier mobility, accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and thus improve PEC performance. This MOF glass not only serves as an excellent OER cocatalyst on tunable photoelectrodes, but also enables promising opportunities for PEC devices for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Tandem Guest&#8208;Host&#8208;Receptor Recognitions Precisely Guide Ciprofloxacin to Eliminate Intracellular Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>

A strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions was proposed to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to effectively eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus. Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M was obtained through guest&#8208;host recognition. After targeting S.&#8197;aureus&#8208;infected macrophages via ligand&#8208;receptor recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M underwent intracellular caspase&#8208;1&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form ciprofloxacin nanoparticle, leading to enhanced antibacterial efficiency.







Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#8197;aureus) is able to hide within host cells to escape immune clearance and antibiotic action, causing life&#8208;threatening infections. To boost the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics, new intracellular delivery approaches are urgently needed. Herein, by rational design of an adamantane (Ada)&#8208;containing antibiotic&#8208;peptide precursor Ada&#8208;Gly&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Asp&#8208;Cys(StBu)&#8208;Lys(Ciprofloxacin)&#8208;CBT (Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada), we propose a strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus. Via guest&#8208;host recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada is decorated with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;heptamannoside (CD&#8208;M) derivative to yield Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M, which is able to target mannose receptor&#8208;overexpressing macrophages via multivalent ligand&#8208;receptor recognition. After uptake, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M undergoes caspase&#8208;1 (an overexpressed enzyme during S.&#8197;aureus infection)&#8208;initiated CBT&#8208;Cys click reaction to self&#8208;assemble into ciprofloxacin nanoparticle Nano&#8208;Cip. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that, compared with ciprofloxacin or Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M shows superior intracellular bacteria elimination and inflammation alleviation efficiency in S.&#8197;aureus&#8208;infected RAW264.7 cells and mouse infection models, respectively. This work provides a supramolecular platform of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide antibiotics to eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus infection efficiently.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights into the Interlayer Characteristics and Oxygen Reactivity of Bilayer Borophene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) was used to study the local chemical properties of bilayer synthetic two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) with atomic&#8208;scale spatial resolution. TERS established the chemical fingerprint of bilayer borophene that is correlated with the vibration of interlayer B&#8722;B bonds and revealed its chemical stability with single&#8208;bond (B&#8722;O) sensitivity by exposure to controlled oxidizing conditions in ultrahigh vacuum.







Abstract
Bilayer (BL) two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) has recently been synthesized and computationally predicted to have promising physical properties for a variety of electronic and energy technologies. However, the fundamental chemical properties of BL borophene that form the foundation of practical applications remain unexplored. Here, we present atomic&#8208;level chemical characterization of BL borophene using ultrahigh vacuum tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (UHV&#8208;TERS). UHV&#8208;TERS identifies the vibrational fingerprint of BL borophene with angstrom&#8208;scale spatial resolution. The observed Raman spectra are directly correlated with the vibrations of interlayer boron&#8211;boron bonds, validating the three&#8208;dimensional lattice geometry of BL borophene. By virtue of the single&#8208;bond sensitivity of UHV&#8208;TERS to oxygen adatoms, we demonstrate the enhanced chemical stability of BL borophene compared to its monolayer counterpart by exposure to controlled oxidizing atmospheres in UHV. In addition to providing fundamental chemical insight into BL borophene, this work establishes UHV&#8208;TERS as a powerful tool to probe interlayer bonding and surface reactivity of low&#8208;dimensional materials at the atomic scale.

         <title>Activation of Bulk Li2S as Cathode Material for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries through Organochalcogenide&#8208;Based Redox Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of oxidation reaction kinetics of bulk Li2S was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators. Among them, phenyl ditelluride can significantly lower the charge overpotential, accelerate the redox reaction kinetics, and alleviate the shuttle effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides. Consequently, the Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.







Abstract
Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is considered as a promising cathode material for sulfur&#8208;based batteries. However, its activation remains to be one of the key challenges against its commercialization. The extraction of Li+ from bulk Li2S has a high activation energy (Ea) barrier, which is fundamentally responsible for the initial large overpotential. Herein, a systematic investigation of accelerated bulk Li2S oxidation reaction kinetics was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators, in which phenyl ditelluride (PDTe) can significantly reduce the Ea of Li2S and lower the initial charge potential. Simultaneously, it can alleviate the polysulfides shuttling effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides and converting them into insoluble lithium phenyl tellusulfides (PhTe&#8208;SxLi, x&gt;1). This alters the redox pathway and accelerates the reaction kinetics of Li2S cathode. Consequently, the Li||Li2S&#8208;PDTe cell shows excellent rate capability and enhanced cycling stability. The Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.

         <title>Tailoring Extremely Narrow FWHM in Hypsochromic and Bathochromic Shift of Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin MR&#8208;TADF Materials for High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycyclic heteraborin multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent scaffolds (NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR) based on role&#8208;play with HOMO energy to achieve the extremely narrow FWHM of 14&#8197;nm were proposed and synthesized via lithium free one&#8208;shot double borylation. The organic light emitting diode employing the NO&#8208;DBMR/Cz&#8208;DBMR manifested state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with high color purity and external quantum efficiency of 29.8/33.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Developing double boron&#8208;based emitters with extremely narrow band spectrum and high efficiency in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is crucial and challenging. Herein, we report two materials, NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, hinge on polycyclic heteraborin skeletons based on role&#8208;play of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. The NO&#8208;DBMR contains an oxygen atom, whereas the Cz&#8208;DBMR has a carbazole core in the double boron&#8208;embedded &#957;&#8208;DABNA structure. The synthesized materials resulted in an unsymmetrical pattern for NO&#8208;DBMR and surprisingly a symmetrical pattern for Cz&#8208;DBMR. Consequently, both materials showed extremely narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 14&#8197;nm in hypsochromic (pure blue) and bathochromic (Bluish green) shifted emission without losing their high color fidelity. Furthermore, both materials show high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of over 82&#8201;%, and an extremely small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.04&#8197;eV, resulting in high reverse intersystem crossing process (kRISC) of 105&#8197;s&#8722;1. Due to the efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, the fabricated OLEDs based on these heteraborins manifested maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 33.7 and 29.8&#8201;% for NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, respectively. This is the first work reported with this type of strategy for achieving an extremely narrow emission spectrum in hypsochromic and bathochromic shifted emissions with a similar molecular skeleton.

Due to the efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, the fabricated OLEDs based on these heteraborins manifested maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 33.7 and 29.8&#8201;% for &lt;b&gt;NO-DBMR&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Cz-DBMR&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. This is the first work reported with this type of strategy for achieving an extremely narrow emission spectrum in hypsochromic and bathochromic shifted emissions with a similar molecular skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural&#8208;transformation&#8208;induced Drastic Luminescence Changes in an Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid [ReN(CN)4]2&#8722; Salt Triggered by Chemical Stimuli</title>

The large shift in luminescent properties between near&#8208;infrared and visible emissions without any loss in quantum yield was achieved by massive structural changes of an organic&#8211;inorganic luminescent hybrid.







Abstract
We synthesized a (1&#8208;propylpyridinium)2[ReN(CN)4]&#8208;type organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid exhibiting water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced drastic structural changes of the [ReN(CN)4]2&#8722; assemblies. Specifically, upon exposure to water vapor, dehydrated nitrido&#8208;bridged chains were converted to hydrated cyanido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear clusters via rearrangements of large molecular building units in the crystals. These switchable assembly forms display substantially different photo&#8208;physical properties, although in both cases the emission is caused by a metal&#8208;centered d&#8211;d transition. The nitrido&#8208;bridged chain exhibited a near&#8208;infrared (749&#8197;nm) emission, which blue&#8208;shifted as the temperature increased, while a visible (561&#8197;nm) emission and its red shift was demonstrated by the cyanido&#8208;bridged cluster.

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;Fused Sterically Shielded Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Deep Blue OLEDs with Reduced Dexter Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically shielded yet extremely rigid multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitter (Tp&#8208;DABNA), based on a triptycene&#8208;fused B,N core, has been developed. The bulky fins of the triptycene moieties enable Tp&#8208;DABNA to achieve narrowed emission and reduced Dexter energy transfer while maintaining efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. The corresponding deep blue OLEDs demonstrate a high EQE of 28.7&#8201;% and mitigated efficiency roll&#8208;offs.







Abstract
Designing multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters that can simultaneously achieve narrowband emission and suppressed intermolecular interactions is challenging for realizing high color purity and stable blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a sterically shielded yet extremely rigid emitter based on a triptycene&#8208;fused B,N core (Tp&#8208;DABNA) is proposed to address the issue. Tp&#8208;DABNA exhibits intense deep blue emissions with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a high horizontal transition dipole ratio, superior to the well&#8208;known bulky emitter, t&#8208;DABNA. The rigid MR skeleton of Tp&#8208;DABNA suppresses structural relaxation in the excited state, with reduced contributions from the medium&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency vibrational modes to spectral broadening. The hyperfluorescence (HF) film composed of a sensitizer and Tp&#8208;DABNA shows reduced Dexter energy transfer compared to those of t&#8208;DABNA and DABNA&#8208;1. Notably, deep blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs with the Tp&#8208;DABNA emitter display higher external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax=24.8&#8201;%) and narrower FWHMs (&#8804;26&#8197;nm) than t&#8208;DABNA&#8208;based OLEDs (EQEmax=19.8&#8201;%). The HF&#8208;OLEDs based on the Tp&#8208;DABNA emitter further demonstrate improved performance with an EQEmax of 28.7&#8201;% and mitigated efficiency roll&#8208;offs.

         <title>Photonic Modulation Enabled by Controlling the Edge Structures of Boron&#8208;Doped Molecular Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report control over the edge structures of boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs) that were achieved by sequential cyclization. Three as&#8208;synthesized BMCs, featuring the C56B2 or C84B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeletons with controlled edges, display well&#8208;tunable aromatic structures, decreased band gaps and intriguing photonic properties. Notably, the C56B2 molecule exhibits unprecedented stimulated emission behavior and amplified spontaneous emission property.







Abstract
Control over topological edges of molecular carbons (MCs) is of importance for achieving diverse molecular topologies and desirable physical properties. However, it remains very challenging for heteroatom&#8208;doped MCs due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, we report control over the edge structures of boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs) via the sequential cyclization strategy. Three BMC molecules that feature the C56B2 or C84B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeletons with selective cove/fjord or cove/bay edges, respectively, were synthesized through the rational combination of Mallory photoreaction and Scholl reaction. We not only obtain the largest boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system reported so far, but also disclose that fine control of their edges and length greatly affects electronic structures and thereby photonic properties of BMCs, such as tunable aromaticity, decreased band gaps, as well as redshifted absorptions and fluorescence. Remarkably, the C56B2 molecule exhibits stimulated emission behavior and amplified spontaneous emission property, both of which have never been reported for pristine boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems, thus demonstrating the potential of BMCs as optical gain materials for laser cavities.

         <title>Ruptenes: A Family of Terpene Analogs Give Insight into Cyclisation Mechanisms by Cascade Disruption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two terpenoid substrate analogs with a saturated C6&#8722;C7 bond were converted with terpene synthases. Their blocked reactivity caused interruption of the cyclisation cascade leading to ruptenes that represent cationic intermediates of the natural cyclisation reaction. Such intermediates are difficult to observe directly and thus the ruptenes deepen our understanding of terpene synthase catalysis.







Abstract
The terpenoid substrate analogs (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrogeranylgeranyl diphosphate (6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GGPP) and (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrogeranylfarnesyl diphosphate (6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP) were synthesised from (S)&#8208;citronellol and enzymatically converted with nine diterpene and two sesterterpene synthases, respectively. In two cases the substrate analogs were converted into diterpenes in cyclisation reactions corresponding to those observed for the native substrate GGPP, while the cyclisation cascade was disrupted or redirected in the other nine cases, leading to products that were named ruptenes. Several of the isolated ruptenes represent deprotonation products of cationic intermediates that are analogs of the intermediates proposed along the cyclisation cascades for the native substrates GGPP or GFPP, thus giving insights into the complex reaction mechanisms of terpene synthase mediated biosynthesis.

         <title>Highly Efficient FeIII&#8208;initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System in Piezo&#8208;catalytic Process for Organic Pollutants Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient FeIII&#8208;initiated piezo&#8208;catalytic self&#8208;cycled Fenton (PSF) system has been constructed. The rapid FeIII/FeII cycle couple with the greatly improved two&#8208;electron water oxidative H2O2 production kinetics, providing an exceptional Fenton degradation efficiency far exceeding that of the classical FeII PSF system.







Abstract
Piezo&#8208;catalytic self&#8208;Fenton (PSF) system has been emerging as a promising technique for wastewater treatment, while the competing O2 reductive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and FeIII reduction seriously limited the reaction kinetics. Here, we develop a two&#8208;electron water oxidative H2O2 production (WOR&#8722;H2O2) coupled with FeIII reduction over a FeIII/BiOIO3 piezo&#8208;catalyst for highly efficient PSF. It is found that the presence of FeIII can simultaneously initiate the WOR&#8722;H2O2 and reduction of FeIII to FeII, thereby enabling a rapid reaction kinetics towards subsequent Fenton reaction of H2O2/FeII. The FeIII initiating PSF system offers exceptional self&#8208;recyclable degradation of pollutants with a degradation rate constant for sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) over 3.5 times as that of the classic FeII&#8208;PSF system. This study offers a new perspective for constructing efficient PSF systems and shatters the preconceived notion of FeIII in the Fenton reaction.

         <title>Unprecedented Chiral Three&#8208;dimensional Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskitoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (R/S&#8208;BPEA)EA6Pb4Cl15 (1&#8208;R/S) (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BPEA=(R/S)&#8208;1&#8208;4&#8208;Bromophenylethylamine, EA=Ethylamine) have been constructed by introducing chiral and achiral cations into the 3D &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic framework. The realization of 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provides a new route for developing chiral materials toward spintronics and chiroptoelectronics applications.







Abstract
Chiral three&#8208;dimensional hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (3D HOIPs) would show unique chiroptoelectronic performance due to the combination of chirality and 3D structure. However, the synthesis of 3D chiral HOIPs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we constructed a pair of unprecedented 3D chiral halide perovskitoids (R/S&#8208;BPEA)EA6Pb4Cl15 (1&#8208;R/S) (R/S&#8208;BPEA=(R/S)&#8208;1&#8208;4&#8208;Bromophenylethylammonium, EA=ethylammonium), in which the large chiral cations can be contained in the big &#8220;hollow&#8221; inorganic frameworks induced by mixing cations. Notably, 3D 1&#8208;R/S shows natural chiroptical activity, as evidenced by its significant mirror circular dichroism spectra and the ability to distinguish circularly polarized light. Moreover, based on the unique 3D structure, 1&#8208;S presents sensitive X&#8208;ray detection performance with a low detection limit of 398&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is 14&#8197;times lower than the regular medical diagnosis of 5.5&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. In this work, 3D chiral halide perovskitoids provide a new route to develop chiral material in spintronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Tailoring Ion Ordering in Perovskite Oxide for High&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the ion ordering of perovskite and high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity was investigated in PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948;. It was found that high&#8208;temperature OER activity was enhanced by the A&#8208;site cation ordering but suppressed by the oxygen vacancy ordering.







Abstract
Perovskites exhibit excellent high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities as the anodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the relationship between ion ordering and OER performances is rarely investigated. Herein, a series of PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948; perovskites with tailored ion orderings are constructed. Physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the oxygen bulk migration and surface transport capacities as well as the OER activities are promoted by the A&#8208;site cation ordering, but weakened by the oxygen vacancy ordering. Hence, SOEC with the A&#8208;site&#8208;ordered and oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;disordered PrBaCo2O5+&#948; anode exhibits the highest performance of 3.40&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 800&#8201;&#176;C and 2.0&#8197;V. This work sheds light on the critical role of ion orderings in the high&#8208;temperature OER performance and paves a new way for screening novel anode materials of SOECs.

         <title>Conformational Kinetics in Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: A Dynamic P/M Memory Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination between the conformational control of the pendant group in a chiral poly(diphenylacetylene) with the steric hindrance at the poly(diphenylacetylene) main chain results in the selective memorization of either P or M helical senses in the polymer.







Abstract
Dynamic P/M (plus/minus) helical memory in chiral dissymmetric poly(diphenylacetylene)s (PDPA) is shown using a PDPA that bears the benzamide of (L)&#8208;alanine methyl ester as pendant. For a single chiral polymer, it is possible to obtain either P or M helical structures in a specific solvent without the presence of any chiral external stimuli. To do that, it is necessary to combine the conformational control at the pendant group with a high steric hindrance at the backbone. In this case, by thermal annealing in low&#8208;polar solvents, an anti&#8208;conformer is stabilized at the pendant which commands a P helix in the PDPA. Next, solvent removal followed by addition of a polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), results in the kinetic conformationally trapped P helix. However, in this medium, the preferred handedness and the thermodynamic macromolecular helix for poly&#8208;(L)&#8208;1 is M. This process also occurs in the opposite way. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) studies show that the dynamic memory effect is present both in ground and excited states.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Transfer Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose: High Monomeric Yield with Switchable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a hydrogen&#8208;transfer reductive catalytic fractionation of lignocellulose. By incorporating a hydrogen bond acceptor of choline chloride, high yields of aromatic monomers with switchable selectivity are achieved. Choline chloride greatly improves lignin dissolution and tailors the hydrogenolysis of lignin. The proposed strategy promotes the development of targeted lignin valorization and lignin&#8208;first biorefinery.







Abstract
Lignin solubilization and in situ hydrogenolysis are crucial for reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of lignocellulose to aromatic monomers. In this study, we reported a typical hydrogen bond acceptor of choline chloride (ChCl) to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;donating environment of the Ru/C&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose. The ChCl&#8208;tailored hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose was conducted under mild temperature and low&#8208;pressure (&lt;1&#8197;bar) conditions, which was applicable to other lignocellulosic biomass sources. We obtained an approximate theoretical yield of propylphenol monomer of 59.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and selectivity of 97.3&#8201;% using an optimal content of ChCl (10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) in ethylene glycol at 190&#8201;&#176;C for 8&#8197;h. When the content of ChCl in ethylene glycol was increased to 110&#8197;wt&#8201;%, the selectivity of propylphenol switched toward propylenephenol (yield of 36.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and selectivity of 87.6&#8201;%). The findings in this work provide valuable information for transforming lignin from lignocellulose into value&#8208;added products.

         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening dihydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes with pinacolborane is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;diboronates. The catalysts are generated in situ from Co(acac)2/dpephos and Co(acac)2/xantphos, respectively. The ring&#8208;opening of arylidenecyclopropanes to form single homoallylic cobalt intermediates via &#946;&#8208;C elimination is crucial for the obtained high regioselectivity.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening dihydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes is developed to access synthetically versatile skipped diboronates with catalysts generated in situ from Co(acac)2 and dpephos or xantphos. A variety of arylidenecyclopropanes reacted with pinacolborane (HBpin) to form the corresponding 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;diboronates in high isolated yields and with high regioselectivity. Skipped diboronate products from these reactions can undergo various transformations to allow selective installation of two different functional groups along alkyl chains. Mechanistic studies suggest that these reactions combine cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes and hydroboration of homoallylic or allylic boronate intermediates.

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [1,2]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of ammonium ylides, generated in situ from 3&#8208;methyleneazetidines and &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoamides was described. A series of chiral quaternary prolineamide derivatives were obtained in excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) under mild reaction condition.







Abstract
We realized a highly efficient formal [1,2]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of ammonium ylides generated from 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;azetidines and &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoamides. The employ of readily available chiral cobalt(II) complex of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide enabled the ring&#8208;expansion of azetidines, affording a variety of quaternary prolineamide derivatives with excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) under mild reaction condition. For the rearrangement of ammonium ylides, the installation of a pyrazoamide group as a masked brick to build chiral scaffolds proved successful. The enantioselective ring expansion process was elucidated by DFT calculations.

Polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME), were developed for precision cancer immunotherapy with minimized side effects.







Abstract
The efficacy of combination immunotherapy has been limited by tumor specificity and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs). Herein, we report the development of polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME). PSPA is composed of sonosensitizers (semiconducting polymer) and STING agonists (MSA&#8208;2) via the GSH&#8208;activatable linkers. Under sono&#8208;irradiation, PSPA serves as a sonosensitizer to generate 1O2 and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of malignant tumor cells. Furthermore, MSA&#8208;2 is released specifically in tumor microenvironment with highly expressed GSH, minimizing off&#8208;target side effects. The activation of the STING pathway elevates the interferon&#8208;&#946; level and synergizes with SDT to enhance the anti&#8208;tumor response. Therefore, this work proposes a universal approach for spatiotemporal regulation of cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes Enabled by 1,2&#8208;Boron Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation via 1,2&#8208;boron shift to access enantioenriched gem&#8208;diborylalkenes. In this reaction, excellent enantioselectivities were obtained by simply improving the reaction temperature via an impressive DKR process. DFT calculations and extensive mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Asymmetric cross&#8208;couplings based on 1,2&#8208;carbon migration from B&#8208;ate complexes have been developed efficiently to access valuable organoboronates. However, enantioselective reactions triggered by 1,2&#8208;boron shift have remained to be unaddressed synthetic challenge. Here, Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation enabled by 1,2&#8208;boron shift was developed. In this reaction, we disclosed that excellent enantioselectivities were achieved through an interesting dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process of allylic carbonates at the elevated temperature. Notably, the highly valuable (bis&#8208;boryl)alkenes have enabled an array of diversifications to access versatile molecules. Extensive experimental and computational studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism of DKR process and clarify the origin of excellent enantioselectivities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric cross-couplings based on 1,2-carbon migration from B-ate complexes have been developed efficiently to access valuable organoboronates. However, enantioselective reactions triggered by 1,2-boron shift have remained to be unaddressed synthetic challenge. Here, Ir-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation enabled by 1,2-boron shift was developed. In this reaction, we disclosed that excellent enantioselectivities were achieved through an interesting dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process of allylic carbonates at the elevated temperature. Notably, the highly valuable (bis-boryl)alkenes have enabled an array of diversifications to access versatile molecules. Extensive experimental and computational studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism of DKR process and clarify the origin of excellent enantioselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Stable Hydrogen Production from Water and Lactic Acid via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis in a Porous Microreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term stable H2 production from H2O via visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis using lactic acid as a sacrificial reagent and Pt/CdS as a photocatalyst is achieved in a porous microreactor (PP12), with a H2 production rate as high as 602.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. PP12 can be scaled up to a flat&#8208;plate reactor with an area as large as 1&#8197;m2, without a decrease in H2 production efficiency, offering great potential for commercialization.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is significant to overcome challenges like fossil fuel depletion and carbon dioxide emission, but its efficiency is still far below that which is needed for commercialization. Herein, we achieve long&#8208;term stable H2 bubbling production from water (H2O) and lactic acid via visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis in a porous microreactor (PP12); the catalytic system benefits from photocatalyst dispersion, charge separation, mass transfer, and dissociation of O&#8722;H bonds associated with H2O. With the widely used platinum/cadmium&#8208;sulfide (Pt/CdS) photocatalyst, PP12 leads to a H2 bubbling production rate of 602.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is 1000&#8197;times higher than that in a traditional reactor. Even when amplifying PP12 into a flat&#8208;plate reactor with an area as large as 1&#8197;m2 and extending the reaction time to 100&#8197;h, the H2 bubbling production rate still remains at around 600.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, offering great potential for commercialization.

         <title>Substituent Effect to Fine&#8208;Tune Energy Levels of Atom&#8208;Precise [MoOS3]2&#8722; Modified Copper(I) Thiolate Clusters Boosting Recyclable Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [MoOS3]2&#8722; unit is introduced into copper clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise MoVI&#8722;CuI bimetallic clusters, which show high photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance.







Abstract
The propulsion of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is limited by the rational design and regulation of catalysts with precise structures and excellent activities. In this work, the [MoOS3]2&#8722; unit is introduced into the CuI clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise MoVI&#8722;CuI bimetallic clusters of [Cu6(MoOS3)2(C6H5(CH2)S)2(P(C6H4&#8722;R)3)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xCH3CN (R=H, CH3, or F), which show high photocatalytic H2 evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects of the surface ligand, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the resultant visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance. Furthermore, MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters loaded onto the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 carriers significantly reduced the loss of catalysts in the collection process, efficiently addressing the recycling issues of such small cluster&#8208;based catalyst. This work not only highlights a competitively universal approach on the design of high&#8208;efficiency cluster photocatalysts for energy conversion, but also makes it feasible to manipulate the catalytic performance of clusters through a rational substituent strategy.

         <title>Blending Low&#8208;Frequency Vibrations and Push&#8211;Pull Effects Affords Superior Photoacoustic Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering photoacoustic imaging (PAI) agents by amplifying intramolecular low&#8208;frequency vibrations and enhancing the push&#8208;pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1&#8208;NEt2) based on the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold, which met key requirements of high&#8208;quality PAI.







Abstract
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noninvasive in vivo imaging technique, has been widely used in clinical disease diagnosis. However, the design of high&#8208;performance PAI agents with three key characteristics, i.e., near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (&#955;abs&gt;800&#8197;nm), intense PA signals, and excellent photostability, remains a challenging goal. Herein, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering PAI agents by amplifying intramolecular low&#8208;frequency vibrations and enhancing the push&#8208;pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1&#8208;NEt2) based on the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold. Compared with indocyanine green (ICG, an FDA&#8208;approved organic dye widely utilized in PAI studies; &#955;abs=788&#8197;nm), BDP1&#8208;NEt2 exhibited a UV/Vis&#8208;NIR spectrum peaked at 825&#8197;nm, superior in vivo PA signal intensity and outstanding stability to offer improved tumor diagnostics. We believe this work provides a promising strategy to develop the next generation of PAI agents.

         <dc:description>
The 15&#8208;membered&#8208;macrocycle oxa&#8208;TriQuinoline (o&#8208;TQ) has been synthesized which features a semi&#8208;rigid N3O3 aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;crown architecture and is structurally chimeric to crown ethers and porphyrins. o&#8208;TQ has been shown to act as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand and adopt a bowl shape to capture a CuI cation. The copper complex exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission and can be used for supramolecular complexation and catalysis.







Abstract
A new 15&#8208;membered&#8208;macrocyclic molecular entity, oxa&#8208;TriQuinoline (o&#8208;TQ), was designed and synthesized. In o&#8208;TQ, three oxygen atoms were joined onto three quinoline units at the 2&#8208; and 8&#8208;positions in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion by three&#8208;fold SNAr reactions, giving rise to the characteristic N3O3 aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;crown architecture. o&#8208;TQ can serve as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand to capture a CuI cation and adopt a bowl shape, before supramolecular complexation with corannulene and [12]cycloparaphenylene (CPP) occurs through &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions. In the presence of the CuI cation, the non&#8208;emissive o&#8208;TQ becomes a highly emissive material in the solid state, whereby the emission wavelengths depend on the ancillary ligand on the CuI cation. The o&#8208;TQ/CuI complex is able to promote carbene catalysis to provide a range of enamines with a gem&#8208;difluorinated terminus.

&lt;p&gt;The 15-membered-macrocycle oxa-TriQuinoline (o-TQ) has been synthesized which features a semi-rigid N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; aza-oxa-crown architecture and is structurally chimeric to crown ethers and porphyrins. o-TQ has been shown to act as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand and adopt a bowl shape to capture a Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; cation. The copper complex exhibits aggregation-induced emission and can be used for supramolecular complexation and catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;A new 15-membered-macrocyclic molecular entity, oxa-TriQuinoline (o-TQ), was designed and synthesized. In o-TQ, three oxygen atoms were joined onto three quinoline units at the 2- and 8-positions in a head-to-tail fashion by three-fold S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar reactions, giving rise to the characteristic N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; aza-oxa-crown architecture. o-TQ can serve as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand to capture a Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; cation and adopt a bowl shape, before supramolecular complexation with corannulene and [12]cycloparaphenylene (CPP) occurs through &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions. In the presence of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; cation, the non-emissive o-TQ becomes a highly emissive material in the solid state, whereby the emission wavelengths depend on the ancillary ligand on the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; cation. The o-TQ/Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex is able to promote carbene catalysis to provide a range of enamines with a &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluorinated terminus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Diversity in chemical reactivity unfolds even in the gas phase when noncovalent tools such as macrocyclic encapsulation are being used. Two distinct reaction pathways of a&#160;multifunctional bicyclic&#160;azoalkane (bottom) can be chemoselectively activated inside the cavity of a macrocycle (in gold), leading either to ejection of molecular dinitrogen (top) or ethylene (right),&#160;depending on its protonation state. In sharp contrast, the free substrate prefers to eject ammonia upon thermal activation (left), as reported by Werner&#8197;M. Nau, Elina Kalenius, Tung&#8208;Chun Lee et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202303491).

The unambiguous assignment of NMR signals to complex organic molecules or mixtures is a challenge. In their Research Article (e202304196), Jin&#8197;Wook Cha, Min&#8208;Seon Kim, and Jin&#8208;Soo Park suggest an ultrahigh&#8208;resolution single&#8208;scan NMR method that enables to acquire a hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both 1H, 13C and their correlation spectra. The method was applied to compounds with high NMR signal complexity, such as chromopeptide and diastereomeric mixtures, and resulted in complete 1H and 13C NMR signal assignment of individual subunits and epimers.

O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes of membrane&#8208;bound mucin glycoproteins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. In their Research Article (e202302437), Ulrika Westerlind and co&#8208;workers describe the synthesis of fucosylated mucin glycopeptides using a chemoenzymatic approach. Starting from simple building blocks, Fmoc&#8208;protected glycosylated amino acids were prepared and incorporated into peptides and enzymatically diversified. Bacteria lectin interactions were then elucidated on glycopeptide microarrays.

A novel method based on in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry has been developed to capture the nascent intermediates&#160;during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8208;ZnO. The results shed light on the overoxidation and self&#8208;coupling reaction mechanism of &#8901;CH3, as described by Chengyuan Liu, Yang Pan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202304352).

         <title>The Chemistry of the Cyaphide Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
128&#8197;years after the erroneously assumed synthesis of sodium cyaphide, Na(CP), and 51&#8197;years after the definitive proof of the existence of HCP, the chemistry of the cyaphide anion has finally gained momentum. This review summarizes the chemistry of the cyaphide anion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;, from its beginnings to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art.







Abstract
We review the known chemistry of the cyaphide ion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;. This remarkable diatomic anion has been the subject of study since the late nineteenth century, however its isolation and characterization eluded chemists for almost a hundred years. In this mini&#8208;review, we explore the pioneering synthetic experiments that first allowed for its isolation, as well as more recent developments demonstrating that cyaphide transfer is viable in well&#8208;established salt&#8208;metathesis protocols. The physical properties of the cyaphide ion are also explored in depth, allowing us to compare and contrast the chemistry of this ion with that of its lighter congener cyanide (an archetypal strong field ligand and important organic functional group). Recent studies show that the cyaphide ion has the potential to be used as a versatile chemical regent for the synthesis of novel molecules and materials, hinting at many interesting future avenues of investigation.

         <title>Smart Materials Based on Synthetic Host Molecules: The Role of Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry in the Fabrication and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart materials that can respond to stimuli have the potential to revolutionize many fields such as the chemical and medical industries. This Minireview summarizes the recent development in smart materials based on synthetic host molecules (SHMs) and their associated host&#8211;guest chemistry. The role of the host&#8211;guest recognition in the material's fabrication and application is highlighted. Understanding the responsiveness of smart materials at the molecular level should empower researchers to design and prepare extremely intelligent systems that can complement the rising demands on automation and robotics.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive or smart materials have recently shown a significant impact on the frontier of material science and engineering. The exponential development of synthetic host molecules (SHMs) over the last decades and their corresponding host&#8211;guest chemistry, have empowered researchers with new opportunities to design and construct tailored or guest&#8208;specific smart materials. In this Minireview, we present the recent advancements in synthetic host based smart materials, ranging from the fabrication strategies to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications including adsorption, separation, luminescence, self&#8208;healing and actuation. The role that the host&#8211;guest chemistry plays in these systems is highlighted throughout to give a better prospective of the available possibilities for emerging materials of future economies.

         <title>Technological Pathways to Produce Compressed and Highly Pure Hydrogen from Solar Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review gives an overview of the technological pathways for direct and indirect production of H2 from solar power within the frame of the Innovation Pool project &#8220; Solar H2: Highly Pure and Compressed &#8221;. Technologies such as water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and thermochemical water splitting, liquid metal and plasma reactors are described in terms of their principle of operation and specifics regarding to the quality (purity, pressure) of produced H2.







Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) produced from renewables will have a growing impact on the global energy dynamics towards sustainable and carbon&#8208;neutral standards. The share of green H2 is still too low to meet the net&#8208;zero target, while the demand for high&#8208;quality hydrogen continues to rise. These factors amplify the need for economically viable H2 generation technologies. The present article aims at evaluating the existing technologies for high&#8208;quality H2 production based on solar energy. Technologies such as water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and solar thermochemical water splitting, liquid metal reactors and plasma conversion utilize solar power directly or indirectly (as carbon&#8208;neutral electrons) and are reviewed from the perspective of their current development level, technical limitations and future potential.

         <title>Achieving White&#8208;Light Emission Using Organic Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission can be realized by purely organic phosphorescent emitters using either single&#8208;component or host&#8208;guest systems by mixing two fundamental colors (blue and yellow) or three primary colors (blue, green and red). Here we describe current strategies for achieving white phosphorescence at room&#8208;temperature using organic emitters.







Abstract
Artificial lighting currently consumes approximately one&#8208;fifth of global electricity production. Organic emitters with white persistent RTP have potential for applications in energy&#8208;efficient lighting technologies, due to their ability to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons. Compared to heavy metal phosphorescent materials, they have significant advantages in cost, processability, and reduced toxicity. Phosphorescence efficiency can be improved by introducing heteroatoms, heavy atoms, or by incorporating luminophores within a rigid matrix. White&#8208;light emission can be achieved by tuning the ratio of fluorescence to phosphorescence intensity or by pure phosphorescence with a broad emission spectrum. This review summarizes recent advances in the design of purely organic RTP materials with white&#8208;light emission, describing single&#8208;component and host&#8208;guest systems. White phosphorescent carbon dots and representative applications of white&#8208;light RTP materials are also introduced.

         <title>Copper (I)&#8208;BOX Catalyzed Asymmetric 3&#8208;Component Reaction for the Synthesis of Trifluoromethylated Propargylic Ethers and Anilines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of trifluoromethylated propargylic ethers and amines is described. The reaction proceeds with high enantioselectivity using a simple chiral CuI&#8208;BOX system and tolerates a broad range of alcohol, aniline and alkyne substitution. With chiral alcohols, a high diastereoselectivity is observed, indicating good catalyst stereocontrol.







Abstract
An asymmetric 3&#8208;component reaction between EthynylBenziodoXoles (EBXs), 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane and nucleophiles catalyzed by a CuI&#8208;BOX (Bisoxazoline) catalyst is described. This protocol gives access to chiral trifluoromethylated propargyl ethers and anilines, which are valuable building blocks in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. The reaction proceeds with high enantioselectivity and yield with different nucleophiles such as primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols, as well as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor anilines. Aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted alkynes can be successfully introduced as electrophiles. In case of chiral substrates, high catalyst control was observed, leading to good diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Dihydrogen and Ethylene Activation by a Sterically Distorted Distibene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a hindered and highly distorted distibene complex capable of reacting with H2 and ethylene. NMR studies point to a feasible dissociation of the dimeric species into a fleeting stibinidene intermediate, which rapidly engages in reactivity. Such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity for SbI compounds provides crucial understanding towards the putative Sb redox catalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a sterically distorted distibene ([4]2) and its transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity towards two fundamental feedstock chemicals: H2 and ethylene. Although [4]2 exhibits an unusually long Sb=Sb distance and noticeable backbone distortion in the solid state, NMR data suggest that [4]2 remains predominantly as a dimer in solution, even at high temperatures. However, it was proposed that the elusive reactivity of [4]2 toward H2 and ethylene results from reversible dissociation of [4]2 into the transient stibinidene ([4]), which could be observed by NMR spectroscopic techniques.

         <title>Electrochemical Activation of Nitromethane to Construct Isoxazoline Aldoximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented approach to isoxazoline aldoximes via the reactions of nitromethane and olefins is achieved. Nitromethane is electrochemically activated to serve as both the heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes.







Abstract
Activation of nitromethane to endow new reactivity is an interesting and meaningful but also challenging topic. Herein, we report an electrochemical activation of nitromethane to serve as both the heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes. The isoxazoline aldoximes that are prepared by four steps with the reported strategy are synthesized in a single step from low&#8208;cost and readily available nitromethane and olefins with moderate to excellent yields under our electrochemical conditions. The reaction also takes advantage of high atom&#8208;economy and E&#8208;selectivity. Moreover, the mechanism is studied by control experiments, a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study, cyclic voltammogram (CV) experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanistic results reveal that nitromethane may be activated under electrochemical conditions to deliver a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole 2&#8208;oxide intermediate, which undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with olefins to yield isoxazoline aldoximes.

         <title>Synthetic Modulation of an Unstable Dehydrosecodine&#8208;type Intermediate and Its Encapsulation into a Confined Cavity Enable Its X&#8208;ray Crystallographic Observation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of a labile dehydrosecodine&#8208;type intermediate was achieved by designing a functionally modulated analogue, enabling its inclusion within a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage. The unique folded conformation of this intermediate, stabilized inside the hydrophobic cavity, was supported by DFT calculations and supports the postulation of its involvement in divergent metabolic pathways to various monoterpene indole alkaloids.







Abstract
Numerous indole alkaloids such as the iboga&#8208; and aspidosperma&#8208;type are believed to be biosynthesized via a common hypothetical intermediate, dehydrosecodine. The highly reactive nature of dehydrosecodine&#8208;type compounds has hampered their isolation and structural elucidation. In this study, we achieved the first X&#8208;ray structural determination of a dehydrosecodine&#8208;type compound by integrating synthetic optimization of the reactivity and stabilizing the fragile molecule by encapsulation into a supramolecular host. Formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex of the dehydrosecodine&#8208;type labile guest bearing both vinyl indole and dihydropyridine units with the host was observed. This integrated approach not only provides insights into the biosynthetic conversions but also allows stabilization and storage of the reactive and otherwise short&#8208;lived intermediate within the confined hydrophobic cavity.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Thiamyxins A&#8211;C and Thiamyxin E, a Potent Class of RNA&#8208;Virus&#8208;Inhibiting (Cyclo)depsipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first total synthesis of thiamyxins&#8197;A&#8211;C and E, an interesting group of natural products with antiviral activity and an acid&#8208;labile C2 exomethine position, is described. Overcoming the problem of inseparable diastereomers of the open&#8208;chain variants, thiamyxin&#8197;C and E were obtained by opening the cyclic thiamyxins&#8197;A and B.







Abstract
We present the first total synthesis of the thiamyxins&#8197;A&#8211;C and the now fully characterized thiamyxin&#8197;E, an interesting class of thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich depsipeptides with diverse antiviral activity. The synthesis features a parallel closing of two methyl thiazoline units, with low epimerization of the very labile adjacent stereocenter. It also includes the three&#8208;step synthesis of an uncommon hydroxy acid and the oxidation&#8208;free elimination of a phenylselenide to form a dehydroalanine moiety. The exploitation of the acid&#8208;labile stereocenter at the isoleucine moiety and the reopening of the macrolactones gave access to the four thiamyxins with good yields and diastereomeric purities from a single precursor. The modular total synthesis allows further testing of the biological activity and gives opportunities to explore the pharmacophore and antiviral target through derivatization.

         <title>Observation of Confinement&#8208;Free Neutral Group Three Transition Metal Carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl Sc(CO)7 and octacarbonyl TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) complexes have been prepared using a laser vaporization&#8208;supersonic expansion source and characterized by size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy. Theoretical analyses show that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase.







Abstract
Spectroscopic characterization of neutral highly&#8208;coordinated compounds is essential in fundamental and applied research, but has been proven to be a challenging experimental target because of the difficulty in mass selection. Here, we report the preparation and size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet (IR&#8208;VUV) spectroscopic identification of group&#8208;3 transition metal carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) in the gas phase, which are the first confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl and octacarbonyl complexes. The results indicate that Sc(CO)7 has a C2v structure and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) have a D4h structure. Theoretical calculations predict that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase. These highly&#8208;coordinated carbonyls are 17&#8208;electron complexes when only those valence electrons that occupy metal&#8722;CO bonding orbitals are considered, in which the ligand&#8208;only 4b1u molecular orbital is ignored. This work opens new avenues toward the design and chemical control of a large variety of compounds with unique structures and properties.

         <title>Photosensitized [4+2]&#8208; and [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions of N&#8208;Sulfonylimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions and azetidine&#8208;forming [2+2] cycloadditions (aza&#8208;Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions) of sulfonylimines are presented. The divergent reactivity was achieved though substrate modulation. In both cases, the reactions lead to the synthesis of complex polycyclic scaffolds from simple components. The mechanistic details and the utility of the products are described.







Abstract
The synthesis of polycyclic compounds is of high interest due to the prevalence of these motifs in drugs and natural products. Herein, we report on the stereoselective construction of 3D bicyclic scaffolds and azetidine derivatives by modulation of N&#8208;sulfonylimines to achieve either [4+2]&#8208; or [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions. The utility of the method was established by further modulation of the product. Mechanistic studies are also included, which support reaction via Dexter energy transfer.

         <title>Direct Observation of the Ethyl Radical in the Pyrolysis of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We directly detect the ethyl radical intermediate in ethane pyrolysis for the first time, and reveal new insights into the reaction mechanism based upon our observations. This advance was enabled by a combination of isotopic microreactor studies, master equation based kinetics calculations, and threshold photoelectron&#8208;photoion coincidence spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report the first direct detection of ethyl radical in the pyrolysis of ethane. Observation of this vital intermediate was made possible in this extremely reactive environment by the use of a microreactor coupled with synchrotron radiation and photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy, despite its short lifetime and low concentration. Together with ab&#8208;initio master equation&#8208;calculated rates and fully coupled computational fluid dynamics simulations, our measurements show that even under the low pressures and short residence times in our experiment, ethyl formation can only be explained by bimolecular reactions; the most important is the catalytic attack of ethane by H atoms, which are then regenerated by decomposition of the nascent ethyl radicals. Our results complete the observation of all hypothesized intermediates in this industrially important process and highlight the need for further studies under additional conditions using similar methods to improve existing models and optimize process chemistries.

         <title>Elusive Double Perovskite Iodides: Structural, Optical, and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unicorn double perovskite iodides [A2MIMIIII6] are elusive, but with the help of rational design rules, can indeed be synthesized. The Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy) family demonstrate optical properties that are red shifted compared to related halide materials and their magnetic properties show weak interaction parameters.







Abstract
Halide double perovskites [A2MIMIIIX6] are an important class of materials that have garnered substantial interest as non&#8208;toxic alternatives to conventional lead iodide perovskites for optoelectronic applications. While numerous studies have examined chloride and bromide double perovskites, reports of iodide double perovskites are rare, and their definitive structural characterization has not been reported. Predictive models have aided us here in the synthesis and characterization of five iodide double perovskites of general formula Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy). The complete crystal structures, structural phase transitions, optical, photoluminescent, and magnetic properties of these compounds are reported.

         <title>Preparation and Reactivity Study of a Versatile Trifluoromethylthiolating Agent: S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Trifluoromethanesulfonothioate (TTST)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel CF3S reagent named TTST has been prepared in one step using commercially inexpensive materials. TTST is easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, highly reactive, and can be used to prepare many CF3S reagents. TTST can generate one CF3S+, two CF3S&#8722;, or both CF3S&#8901;/CF3&#8901; species. TTST exhibits high atom economy&#8211;all atoms except the oxygens can be used. TTST enabled to reach a new type of molecule, ArOSCF3, and revealed a novel catalytic CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement.







Abstract
A novel, air and thermally stable, yet highly reactive trifluoromethylthiolating reagent, CF3SO2SCF3 (1), was prepared easily in one step from commercially inexpensive CF3SO2Na and Tf2O. 1 is a highly versatile and atom&#8208;efficient reagent that can generate one equivalent of CF3S+, two equivalents of CF3S&#8722;, or a combination of CF3S&#8901;/CF3&#8901; species. Many high&#8208;yielding CF3S reactions of C, O, S, and N&#8208;nucleophiles were achieved, including the simple&#8208;step preparations of many reported CF3S reagents. 1 delivered a hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize ArOSCF3 that was followed by a novel CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement. Through Cu or TDAE/Ph3P combinations, 1 generated two equivalents of CF3S anion species, and the photo&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenes with 1 provided CF3/CF3S&#8208;containing products in high atom&#8208;efficiency.

TTST is easy-to-handle, highly reactive, and can be used to prepare many CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S reagents. TTST can generate one CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, two CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, or both CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8901;/CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901; species. TTST exhibits high atom economy&#8211;all atoms except the oxygens can be used. TTST enabled to reach a new type of molecule, ArOSCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and revealed a novel catalytic CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-rearrangement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel, air and thermally stable, yet highly reactive trifluoromethylthiolating reagent, CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), was prepared easily in one step from commercially inexpensive CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na and Tf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is a highly versatile and atom-efficient reagent that can generate one equivalent of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, two equivalents of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, or a combination of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8901;/CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901; species. Many high-yielding CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S reactions of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophiles were achieved, including the simple-step preparations of many reported CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S reagents. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; delivered a hitherto hard-to-synthesize ArOSCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that was followed by a novel CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-rearrangement. Through Cu or TDAE/Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P combinations, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; generated two equivalents of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S anion species, and the photo-catalyzed reactions of alkenes with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; provided CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S-containing products in high atom-efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalytic Platform for the Activation of Inert Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a readily available indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon excitation with light, can activate via single electron reduction a wide variety of typically inert electron&#8208;rich substrates, including strong C&#8722;F, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The protocol is also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates, exhibiting high functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Due to their strong covalent bonds and low reduction potentials, activating inert substrates is challenging. Recent advances in photoredox catalysis offered a number of solutions, each of which useful for activating specific inert bonds. Developing a general catalytic platform that can consistently target a broad range of inert substrates would be synthetically useful. Herein, we report a readily available indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon excitation with 405&#8197;nm light, acquires a strongly reducing power. This excited&#8208;state reactivity served to activate, by single&#8208;electron reduction, strong C&#8722;F, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic platform was versatile enough to promote the reduction of generally recalcitrant electron&#8208;rich substrates (Ered&lt;&#8722;3.0&#8197;V vs SCE), including arenes that afforded 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. The protocol was also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates with a high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies identified an excited&#8208;state thiolate anion as responsible of the highly reducing reactivity.

         <title>Bismuth&#8208;Catalyzed Amide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a protocol for the reduction of amides to amines using a cationic BiIII catalyst with a tridentate ligand framework in combination with a simple and cheap silane as the reducing agent. Various amides can be reduced and a variety of functional groups can be tolerated. Kinetic analyses and modelling were used to elucidate the orders of each component and to generate a kinetic model that is in agreement with the observed experimental data.







Abstract
In this article we report that a cationic version of Akiba's BiIII complex catalyzes the reduction of amides to amines using silane as hydride donor. The catalytic system features low catalyst loadings and mild conditions, en route to secondary and tertiary aryl&#8208; and alkylamines. The system tolerates functional groups such as alkene, ester, nitrile, furan and thiophene. Kinetic studies on the reaction mechanism result in the identification of a reaction network with an important product inhibition that is in agreement with the experimental reaction profiles.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclopropanes with Internal Olefins</title>

         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes and internal olefins has been developed, providing a wide range of multisubstituted gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes. This reaction shows an example where the &#8220;CF2&#8221; motif can be kept upon ring extension. The process is atom&#8208;economic and allows to reach numerous gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes with good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbocyclic molecules represents a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry. Herein, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes (gem&#8208;DFCPs) and internal olefins has been developed, enabling the efficient synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes with good functional group compatibility, excellent regioselectivity and good diastereoselectivity. The resulting gem&#8208;difluorinated products can undergo downstream transformations to access various mono&#8208;fluorinated cyclopentenes and cyclopentanes. This reaction demonstrates the use of gem&#8208;DFCPs as a type of &#8220;CF2&#8221; C3 synthon for cycloaddition under transition metal catalysis, which provides potential strategy for synthesizing other gem&#8208;difluorinated carbocyclic molecules.

         <title>A Divergent Polyene Cyclization for the Total Synthesis of Greenwayodendrines, Greenwaylactams, Polysin and Polyveoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 32, August 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of nine alkaloid sesquiterpenoids has been accomplished in only 5&#8211;8&#8197;steps in excellent overall yield (3&#8211;21&#8201;%). The dual nucleophilicity of the indole enabled two divergent termination pathways to be unlocked: an unprecedented N&#8208;termination and a previously challenging C&#8208;termination step. Furthermore, a bioinspired late&#8208;stage Witkop oxidation enabled the first total synthesis of greenwaylactams A&#8722;C.







Abstract
We present a concise asymmetric total synthesis (5&#8211;8&#8197;steps) of nine sesquiterpenoid alkaloids featuring four different tetra&#8208;/pentacyclic scaffolds. To this end, a novel, bioinspired indole N&#8208;terminated cationic tricyclization has been developed, enabling the divergent synthesis of greenwayodendrines and polysin. Subtle variation of the C2&#8208;substituted indole cyclization precursor allowed switching between indole N&#8208; and C&#8208;termination. For the latter, a subsequent Witkop oxidation enabled conversion of the cyclopentene&#8208;fused indole into the eight&#8208;membered benzolactam to directly furnish the family of greenwaylactams. In addition, a diastereomeric C&#8208;termination product has been elaborated to provide access to polyveoline.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the scientists in the Highly Operational Team (HOT) led by the Shustova group from the University of South Carolina (USA). HOT researchers are located at four universities (the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, the University of Florida, and Chulalongkorn University) and one national laboratory (Savannah River National Laboratory) from two different countries, USA and Thailand. The team recently published an article using the synergy among the HOT participants to reveal the synthetic pathways toward preparation of transuranic heterometallic extended metal&#8211;organic materials, providing mechanistic details for their formation, and establishing a structure&#8211;property relationship: &#8220;f&#8208;block MOFs: A Pathway to Heterometallic Transuranics&#8221;, K.&#8197;C.

         <title>A Radical Pathway and Stabilized Li Anode Enabled by Halide Quaternary Ammonium Electrolyte Additives for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivation of the sulfur cathode by insulating lithium sulfide restricts the reversibility and sulfur utilization of Li&#8208;S batteries. 3D nucleation of Li2S enabled by radical conversion may significantly boost the redox kinetics. Electrolytes with high donor number (DN) solvents allow for tri&#8208;sulfur (S3&#8226;&#8722;) radicals as intermediates, however, the catastrophic reactivity of such solvents with Li anodes pose a great challenge for their practical application. Here, we propose the use of quaternary ammonium salts as electrolyte additives, which can preserve the partial high&#8208;DN characteristics that trigger the S3&#8226;&#8722; radical pathway, and inhibit the growth of Li dendrites. Li&#8208;S batteries with tetrapropylammonium bromide (T3Br) electrolyte additive deliver the outstanding cycling stability (700 cycles at 1 C with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle), and high capacity under a lean electrolyte of 5 &#956;Lelectrolyte mgsulfur&#8722;1. This work opens a new avenue for the development of electrolyte additives for Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Steric Hindrance of Porous Organic Polymers in Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes to Induce the Formation of LiF&#8208;Rich SEI in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium fluoride (LiF) at the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) contributes to the stable operation of polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Currently, most of the methods for constructing lithium fluoride SEI are based on the design of polar groups of fillers. However, the mechanism behind how steric hindrance of fillers impacts LiF formation remains unclear. This study synthesizes three kinds of porous polyacetal amides (PAN&#8208;X, X=NH2, NH&#8208;CH3, N&#8208;(CH3)2) with varying steric hindrances by regulating the number of methyl substitutions of nitrogen atoms on the reaction monomer, which are incorporated into polymer composite solid electrolytes, to investigate the regulation mechanism of steric hindrance on the content of lithium fluoride in SEI. The results show that bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8208;) will compete for the charge without steric effect, while excessive steric hindrance hinders the interaction between TFSI&#8208; and polar groups, reducing charge acquisition. Only when one hydrogen atom on the amino group is replaced by a methyl group, steric hindrance from the methyl group prevents TFSI&#8208; from capturing charge in that direction, thereby facilitating the transfer of charge from the polar group to a separate TFSI&#8208; and promoting maximum LiF formation. This work provides a novel perspective on constructing LiF&#8208;rich SEI.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Non&#8208;equilibrium Uptake of Hydrogen by Pd Icosahedral Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report for the first time that Pd nanocrystals can absorb H via a &#8220;single&#8208;phase pathway&#8221; when particles with a proper combination of shape and size are used. Specifically, when Pd icosahedral nanocrystals of 7&#8208; and 12&#8208;nm in size are exposed to H atoms, the H&#8208;saturated twin boundaries can divide each particle into 20 smaller single&#8208;crystal units in which the formation of phase boundaries is no longer favored. As such, absorption of H atoms is dominated by the single&#8208;phase pathway and one can readily obtain PdHx with any x in the range of 0&#8722;0.7. When switched to Pd octahedral nanocrystals, the single&#8208;phase pathway is only observed for particles of 7 nm in size. We also establish that the H&#8208;absorption kinetics will be accelerated if there is a tensile strain in the nanocrystals due to the increase in lattice spacing. Besides the unique H&#8208;absorption behaviors, the PdHx (x = 0&#8211;0.7) icosahedral nanocrystals show remarkable thermal and catalytic stability toward the formic acid oxidation because of the decrease in chemical potential for H atoms in a Pd lattice under tensile strain.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Photochromic&#8208;Photothermal Processes for Catalytic Plastic Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating high&#8208;energy ultraviolet (UV) photons into photothermal catalytic processes may enable photothermal&#8208;photochemical synergistic catalysis, which represents a transformative technology for waste plastic recycling. The major challenge is avoiding side reactions and by&#8208;products caused by these energetic photons. Here, we break through the limitation of the existing photothermal conversion mechanism and propose a photochromic&#8208;photothermal catalytic system based on polyol&#8208;ligated TiO2 nanocrystals. Upon UV or sunlight irradiation, the chemically bonded polyols can rapidly capture holes generated by TiO2, enabling photogenerated electrons to reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ and produce oxygen vacancies. The resulting abundant defect energy levels boost sunlight&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency, and simultaneously the oxygen vacancies facilitate polyester glycolysis by activating the nucleophilic addition&#8208;elimination process. As a result, compared to commercial TiO2 (P25), we achieve 6&#8208;fold and 12.2&#8208;fold performance enhancements under thermal and photothermal conditions, respectively, while maintaining high selectivity to high&#8208;valued monomers. This paradigm&#8208;shift strategy directs energetic UV photons for activating catalysts and avoids their interaction with reactants, opening the possibility of substantially elevating the efficiency of more solar&#8208;driven catalysis.</dc:description>

Upon UV or sunlight irradiation, the chemically bonded polyols can rapidly capture holes generated by TiO2, enabling photogenerated electrons to reduce Ti4+ to Ti3+ and produce oxygen vacancies. The resulting abundant defect energy levels boost sunlight-to-heat conversion efficiency, and simultaneously the oxygen vacancies facilitate polyester glycolysis by activating the nucleophilic addition-elimination process. As a result, compared to commercial TiO2 (P25), we achieve 6-fold and 12.2-fold performance enhancements under thermal and photothermal conditions, respectively, while maintaining high selectivity to high-valued monomers. This paradigm-shift strategy directs energetic UV photons for activating catalysts and avoids their interaction with reactants, opening the possibility of substantially elevating the efficiency of more solar-driven catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A series of exo&#8208;olefin compounds ((CH3)2C(PhY)&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)PhY) were prepared by selective cationic dimerization of &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene (&#945;MS) derivatives (CH2=C(CH3)PhY) with p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) via &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H scision. They were subsequently used as reversible chain transfer agents for sulfur&#8208;free cationic RAFT polymerization of &#945;MS via &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;C scission in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts such as SnCl4. In particular, exo&#8208;olefin compounds with electron&#8208;donating substituents, such as a 4&#8208;MeO group (Y) on the aromatic ring, worked as efficient cationic RAFT agents for &#945;MS to produce poly(&#945;MS) with controlled molecular weights and exo&#8208;olefin terminals. Other exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)(4&#8208;MeOPh)) with various R groups were prepared by different methods to examine the effects of R groups on the cationic RAFT polymerization. A sulfur&#8208;free cationic RAFT polymerization also proceeded for isobutylene (IB) with the exo&#8208;olefin &#945;MS dimer ((CH3)2C(Ph)&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)Ph). Furthermore, telechelic poly(IB) with exo&#8208;olefins at both terminals was obtained with a bifunctional RAFT agent containing two exo&#8208;olefins. Finally, block copolymers of &#945;MS and MMA were prepared via mechanistic transformation from cationic to radical RAFT polymerization using exo&#8208;olefin terminals containing 4&#8208;MeOPh groups as common sulfur&#8208;free RAFT groups for both cationic and radical polymerizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Metal&#8208;Nitrogen Coupling in Anti&#8208;Perovskite Nitride via Cation Doping for Efficient Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complexes of metal center and nitrogen ligands are the most representative systems for catalyzing hydrogenation reactions in small molecule conversion. Developing heterogenous catalysts with similar active metal&#8208;nitrogen functional centers, nevertheless, still remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that the metal&#8208;nitrogen coupling in anti&#8208;perovskite Co4N can be effective modulated by Cu doping to form Co3CuN, leading to strongly promoted hydrogenation process during electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8208;RR) to ammonia. The combination of advanced spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that Cu dopants strengthen the Co&#8208;N bond and upshifted the metal d&#8208;band towards the Fermi level, promoting the adsorption of NO3&#8208; and *H and facilitating the transition from *NO2/*NO to *NO2H/*NOH. Consequently, the Co3CuN delivers noticeably better NO3&#8208;RR activity than the pristine Co4N, with optimal Faradaic efficiency of 97% and ammonia yield of 455.3 mmol h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.3 V vs. RHE. This work provides an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance heterogenous catalyst for electrochemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis in Water and Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2O2 is a significant chemical widely utilized in the environmental and industrial fields, with growing global demand. Without sacrificial agents, simultaneously photocatalyzing H2O2 synthesis through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels from seawater is green and sustainable but still challenging. Herein, two novel thiophene&#8208;containing covalent organic frameworks (TD&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF) were first constructed and served as catalysts for H2O2 synthesis via indirect 2e&#8208; ORR and direct 2e&#8208; WOR channels. The photocatalytic H2O2 production performance can be regulated by adjusting the N&#8208;heterocycle modules (pyridine and triazine) in COFs. Notably, with no sacrificial agents, just using air and water as raw materials, TD&#8208;COF exhibited high H2O2 production yields of 4060 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, and 3364 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 in deionized water and natural seawater, respectively. Further computational mechanism studies revealed that the thiophene was the primary photoreduction unit for ORR, while the benzene ring (linked to the thiophene by the imine bond) was the central photooxidation unit for WOR. The current work exploits thiophene&#8208;containing COFs for overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis via ORR and WOR dual channels and provides fresh insight into creating innovative catalysts for photocatalyzing H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Microbial Corrosion by Magnetite and Electrically Conductive Pili through Direct Fe0&#8208;to&#8208;Microbe Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrobiocorrosion, the process in which microbes extract electrons from metallic iron (Fe0) through direct Fe0&#8208;microbe electrical connections, is thought to contribute to the costly corrosion of iron&#8208;containing metals that impacts many industries. However, electrobiocorrosion mechanisms are poorly understood. We report here that electrically conductive pili (e&#8208;pili) and the conductive mineral magnetite play an important role in the electron transfer between Fe0 and Geobacter sulfurreducens, the first microbe in which electrobiocorrosion has been rigorously documented. Genetic modification to express poorly conductive pili substantially diminished corrosive pitting and rates of Fe0&#8208;to&#8208;microbe electron flux. Magnetite reduced resistance to electron transfer, increasing corrosion currents and intensifying pitting. Studies with mutants suggested that the magnetite promoted electron transfer in a manner similar to the outer&#8208;surface c&#8208;type cytochrome OmcS. These findings, and the fact that magnetite is a common product of iron corrosion, suggest a potential positive feedback loop of magnetite produced during corrosion further accelerating electrobiocorrosion. The interactions of e&#8208;pili, cytochromes, and magnetite demonstrate mechanistic complexities of electrobiocorrosion, but also provide insights into detecting and possibly mitigating this economically damaging process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Borylcyclopropanation of Alkenes with a (Diborylmethyl)iodide Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropane skeletons play a prominent role in the development of organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a stable, multifunctional (diborylmethyl)iodide reagent (CHI(Bpin)2) for the photoinduced cyclopropanation of alkenes, providing an array of 1,2&#8208;substituted cyclopropylboronates in good yields. This &#945;&#8208;haloboronic ester can be readily synthesized on a multigram scale from commercially available starting materials. Furthermore, this protocol displays high chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, excellent functional group tolerance, and allows for late&#8208;stage borylcyclopropanation of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that the borylcyclopropanation proceeds via a radical addition/polar cyclization pathway mediated by the photocatalyst fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 and visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Oxidation of Tin&#8208;based Perovskite Solar Cells and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskites as the most promising absorber materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved the record efficiency of over 14%. Although suppressing the oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites is a frequently concerned topic for Sn&#8208;based PSCs, many studies have given vague explanations and the mechanisms are still under debate. This is in principal due to the lack of the in&#8208;depth understanding of various and complex intrinsic and extrinsic factors causing the oxidation process. In this context, we critically review the chemical mechanism of facile oxidation of Sn&#8208;based perovskites and differentiate its detrimental effects at material&#8208; and device&#8208;level. More importantly, we classify and introduce the intrinsic factors (raw materials and solvent of perovskite precursors) and extrinsic factors (exposure to neutral oxygen and superoxide) causing the oxidation with their corresponding anti&#8208;oxidation improvement methods. The presented comprehensive understanding and prospect of the oxidation provide insightful guidance for suppressing the oxidation in Sn&#8208;based PSCs &#8220;from the beginning to the end&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Semiconducting Polymers Based on Simple Electron&#8208;Deficient Cyanated trans&#8208;1, 3&#8208;Butadienes for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing high&#8208;performance but low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers remains a significant challenge in the commercialization of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). To achieve this objective, it is essential to design the key electron&#8208;deficient units with simple molecular structure and facile preparation process, which can directly facilitate the production of low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers. Herein, by sequentially introducing fluorine and cyano functionalities onto trans&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene &#960;&#8208;skeleton, we developed a series of structurally simple but highly electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, namely 1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadienes (CNDE), 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadienes (CNFDE), and 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicyano&#8208;butadienes (CNDFDE), featuring highly coplanar backbone and deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (&#8208;3.03&#8208;4.33 eV), which render them highly attractive building blocks for developing n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers. Notably, all these electron&#8208;deficient units can be easily accessed via a two&#8208;step high&#8208;yield synthetic protocol from low&#8208;cost raw materials, thus rendering them highly promising candidates for commercial applications. Upon polymerized with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units, three copolymers are developed and demonstrated unipolar n&#8208;type transport characteristics in OFETs with the highest electron mobility &gt; 1 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. Hence, CNDE, CNFDE, and CNDFDE represent a class of novel, simple, and efficient electron&#8208;deficient units for constructing low&#8208;cost n&#8208;type polymers, providing valuable insights for the OFET applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(Ethylene Piperidinium)s for Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) that possess both high hydroxide conductivity and stable mechanical and chemical properties poses a major challenge to the development of high&#8208;performance fuel cells. Improving one side of the balance between conductivity and stability usually means sacrificing the other. Herein, we used facile, high&#8208;yield chemical reactions to design and synthesize a piperidinium polymer with a polyethylene backbone for AEM fuel cell applications. To improve the performance, we introduced ionic crosslinking into high&#8208;cationic&#8208;ratio AEMs to suppress high water uptake and swelling while further improving the hydroxide conductivity. Remarkably, PEP80&#8208;20PS achieved a hydroxide conductivity of 354.3 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80 &#176;C while remaining mechanically stable. Compared with the base polymer PEP80, the water uptake of PEP80&#8208;20PS decreased by 69% from 813% to 350%, and the swelling decreased substantially by 85% from 350.0% to 50.2% at 80 &#176;C. PEP80&#8208;20PS also showed excellent alkaline stability, 84.7% remained after 35 days of treatment with an aqueous KOH solution. The chemical design in this study represents a significant advancement toward the development of simultaneously highly stable and conductive AEMs for fuel cell applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet Generation Through Singlet Fission in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: An Alternative Route to Inefficient Singlet&#8208;Triplet Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High quantum yield triplets, populated by initially prepared excited singlets, are desired for various energy conversion schemes in solid working compositions like porous MOFs. However, a large disparity in the distribution of the excitonic center of mass, singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) in such assemblies is inhibited, so much so that a carboxy&#8208;coordinated zirconium heavy metal ion cannot effectively facilitate the ISC through spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Circumventing this sluggish ISC, singlet fission (SF) is explored as a viable route to generating triplets in solution&#8208;stable MOFs. Efficient SF is achieved through a high degree of interchromophoric coupling that facilitates electron super&#8208;exchange to generate triplet pairs. Here we show that a predesigned chromophoric linker with extremely poor ISC efficiency (kISC) but  &#160;form triplets in MOF in contrast to the frameworks that are built from linkers with sizable kISC but . This work opens a new photophysical and photochemical avenue in MOF chemistry and utility in energy conversion schemes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Aryl Fluorides by Using Ball Milling and a Piezoelectric Material as the Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl fluorides are important structural motifs in many pharmaceuticals. Although the Balz&#8208;Schiemann reaction provides an entry to aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates, it suffers from drawbacks such as long reaction time, high temperature, toxic solvent, toxic gas release, and low functional group tolerance. Here, we describe a general method for the synthesis of aryl fluorides from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates using a piezoelectric material as redox catalyst under ball milling conditions in the presence of Selectfluor. This approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations. Furthermore, the piezoelectric material can be recycled multiple times. Mechanistic investigations indicate that this fluorination reaction may proceed via a radical pathway, and Selectfluor plays a dual role as both a source of fluorine &#160;and a terminal reductant.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Catalytic Reactivity of Borocarbonitride in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borocarbonitride (BCN) materials are newly developed oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts that can efficiently convert alkanes to alkenes. However, BCN materials tend to form bulky B2O3 due to over&#8208;oxidation at the high reaction temperature, resulting in significant deactivation. Here, we report a series of super stable BCN nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The catalytic performance of the BCN nanosheets can be easily regulated by changing the guanine dosage. The control experiment and structural characterization indicate that the introduction of a suitable amount of carbon could prevent the formation of excessive B2O3 from BCN materials and maintain the 2D skeleton at a high temperature of 520 oC. The best&#8208;performing catalyst BCN exhibits 81.9% selectivity towards olefins with a stable propane conversion of 35.8%, and the propene productivity reaches 16.2 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, much better than commercial BN catalysts. Density functional theory calculation results show&#160;that the presence of dispersed rather than aggregated carbon atoms can significantly affect the electronic microenvironment of hexagonal BN (h&#8208;BN), thereby boosting the catalytic activity of BCN.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Interactions on Platinum/(Metal&#8208;Oxide)&#8208;Based Photocatalysts Boost Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By supporting platinum (Pt) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticles on indium oxide (In2O3), we fabricate a CdS/Pt/In2O3 photocatalyst. Selective photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) is achieved on CdS/Pt/In2O3 having electronic Pt&#8208;In2O3 interactions, with CH4 selectivity reaching to 100%, which is higher than that on CdS/Pt/In2O3 without electronic Pt&#8208;In2O3 interactions (71.7%). Moreover, enhancement effect of electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions on selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 also occurs by using other common metal oxides as photocatalyst supports, including titanium oxide, gallium oxide, zinc oxide and tungsten oxide. The electronic Pt&#8208;(metal&#8208;oxide) interactions separate photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and convert CO2 into CO2&#948;&#8208; which can be easily hydrogenated into CH4 via a CO2&#948;&#8208; &#8594; HCOO* &#8594; HCO* &#8594; CH* &#8594; CH4 path, thus boosting selective photoreduction of CO2 to CH4. This offers a new way to achieve selective photoreduction of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Modulation Enhances Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Deep Cycling of Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable Zn anodes with a high utilization efficiency pose a challenge due to notorious dendrite growth and severe side reactions. Therefore, electrolyte additives are developed to address these issues. However, the additives are always consumed by the electrochemical reactions over cycling, affecting the cycling stability. Here, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) is reported as an electrolyte additive for achieving stable cycling of Zn anodes. HMPA reshapes the solvation structures and promotes anion decomposition, leading to the in&#8208;situ formation of inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. More interestingly, this anion decomposition does not involve HMPA, preserving its long&#8208;term impact on the electrolyte. Thus, the symmetric cells with HMPA in the electrolyte survive ~500 h at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for 10 mAh cm&#8208;2 or ~200 h at 40 mA cm&#8208;2 for 10 mAh cm&#8208;2 with a Zn utilization rate of 85.6%. The full cells of Zn||V2O5 exhibit a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity even under a lean electrolyte condition (E/C ratio = 12 &#956;L mAh&#8208;1), a limited Zn supply (N/P ratio = 1.8) and a high areal capacity (6.6 mAh cm&#8208;2).</dc:description>

         <title>Diboriranide &#963;&#8208;complexes of d&#8208; and p&#8208;block metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diboriranides are the smallest conceivable monoanionic aromatic cycles, yet only limited examples have been reported and their reactivity and complexation behavior remain completely unexplored. We report a straightforward synthesis of the first peraryl diboriranide c&#8208;(DurB)2CPh&#8722; as its lithium salt via the corresponding non&#8208;classical diborirane from a readily available 1,2&#8208;dichlorodiborane(4) (Dur = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl). With the preparation and complete characterization of representative complexes with tin, copper, gold and zinc, we demonstrate the strong preference of the diboriranide for &#963;&#8208;type coordination modes towards main group and transition metal centers under unperturbed retention of the three&#8208;membered B2C&#8208;ring&#8217;s 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Controlled CdS/Ti3C2 MXene Schottky Junction for Highly Selective and Active Photocatalytic Dehydrogenation&#8208;Reductive Amination&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic valorization and selective transformation of biomass&#8208;derived platform compounds offer great opportunities for efficient utilization of renewable resources under mild conditions. Here, the novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical flower&#8208;like CdS/Ti3C2 Schottky junction (MCdS) composed of surface&#8208;controlled CdS and pretreated Ti3C2 MXene is created for photocatalytic dehydrogenation&#8208;reductive amination of biomass&#8208;derived amino acid production under ambient temperature with unprecedented activity and selectivity. Schottky junction efficiently promotes photoexcited charge migration and separation and inhibits photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination, which results in a super&#8208;high activity. Meanwhile, CdS with the reduced surface energy supplies sufficient hydrogen sources for imine reduction and induces the preferential orientation of alanine, thus contributing superior selectivity. Moreover, a wide range of hydroxyl acids are successfully converted into corresponding amino acids and even one&#8208;pot conversion of glucose to alanine is easily achieved over MCdS. This work illustrates the mechanism of crystal orientation control and heterojunction construction in controlling catalytic behavior of photocatalytic nanoreactor, providing a paradigm for construction of MXene&#8208;based heterostructure.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing Chiral Interactions in Carbohydrates Adsorbed on Au(111) by High&#8208;Resolution STM Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic material on Earth and the structural &#8216;material of choice&#8217; in many living systems. Nevertheless, design and engineering of synthetic carbohydrate materials presently lag behind that for protein and nucleic acids. Bottom&#8208;up engineering of carbohydrate materials demands an atomic&#8208;level understanding of their molecular structures and interactions in condensed phases. Here, high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to visualize at submolecular resolution the three&#8208;dimensional structure of cellulose oligomers assembled on Au(1111) and the interactions that drive their assembly. The STM imaging, supported by ab initio calculations, reveals the orientation of all glycosidic bonds and pyranose rings in the oligomers, as well as details of intermolecular interactions between the oligomers. By comparing the assembly of D&#8208; and L&#8208;oligomers, these interactions are shown to be enantioselective, capable of driving spontaneous enantioseparation of cellulose chains from its unnatural enantiomer and promoting the formation of engineered carbohydrate assemblies in the condensed phases.</dc:description>

         <title>Managing Excess Lead Iodide with Functionalized Oxo&#8208;graphene Nanosheets for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stability issues could refrain from commercializing lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) despite having comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to silicon solar cells. Overcoming drawbacks affecting their long&#8208;term stability is gaining incremental importance. Excess lead iodide (PbI2) causes perovskite degradation, although it aids in crystal growth and defect passivation. Herein, we synthesized functionalized oxo&#8208;graphene nanosheets (Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs) to effectively manage the excess PbI2. Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs provide anchoring sites to bind the excess PbI2 and passivate perovskite grain boundaries, thereby reducing charge recombination loss and significantly boosting the extraction of free electrons. The inclusion of Dec&#8208;oxoG NSs leads to a PCE of 23.7% in inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) PSCs. Devices retain 93.8% of their initial efficiency after 1,000 hours of tracking at maximum power points under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination, and exhibit high stability under thermal and ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fragment Screening and Fast Micromolar Detection on a Benchtop NMR Spectrometer Boosted by Photoinduced Hyperpolarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fragment&#8208;based drug design is a well&#8208;established strategy for rational drug design, with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on high&#8208;field spectrometers as the method of reference for screening and hit validation. However, high&#8208;field NMR spectrometers are not only expensive, but require specialized maintenance, dedicated space, and depend on liquid helium cooling which became critical over the recurring global helium shortages. We propose an alternative to high&#8208;field NMR screening by applying the recently developed approach of fragment screening by photoinduced hyperpolarized NMR on a cryogen&#8208;free 80 MHz benchtop NMR spectrometer yielding signal enhancements of up to three orders in magnitude. It is demonstrated that it is possible to discover new hits and kick&#8208;off drug design using a benchtop NMR spectrometer at low micromolar concentrations of both protein and ligand. The approach presented performs at higher speed than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;field NMR approaches while exhibiting a limit of detection in the nanomolar range. Photoinduced hyperpolarization is known to be inexpensive and simple to be implemented, which aligns greatly with the philosophy of benchtop NMR spectrometers. These findings open the way for the use of benchtop NMR in near&#8208;physiological conditions for drug design and further life science applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Chemical Recycling of Polymethacrylates made by ATRP and RAFT Polymerization: High&#8208;Yielding Depolymerization at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although controlled radical polymerization is an excellent tool to make precision polymeric materials, reversal of the process to retrieve the starting monomer is far less explored despite the significance of chemical recycling. Here, we investigate the bulk depolymerization of RAFT and ATRP&#8208;synthesized polymers under identical conditions. RAFT&#8208;synthesized polymers undergo a relatively low&#8208;temperature solvent&#8208;free depolymerization back to monomer thanks to the partial in&#8208;situ transformation of the RAFT end&#8208;group to macromonomer. Instead, ATRP&#8208;synthesized polymers can only depolymerize at significantly higher temperatures (&gt;350 &#730;C) through random backbone scission. To aid a more complete depolymerization at even lower temperatures, we performed a facile and quantitative end&#8208;group modification strategy in which both ATRP and RAFT end&#8208;groups were successfully converted to macromonomers. The macromonomers triggered a lower temperature bulk depolymerization with an onset at 150 &#730;C yielding up to 90% of monomer regeneration. The versatility of the methodology was demonstrated by a scalable depolymerization (~10 g of starting polymer) retrieving 84% of the starting monomer intact which could be subsequently used for further polymerization. This work presents a new low&#8208;energy approach for depolymerizing controlled radical polymers and creates many future opportunities as high&#8208;yielding, solvent&#8208;free and scalable depolymerization methods are sought.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing In Situ Active Repair in Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysis via Non&#8208;Invasive Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, most photosensitizers and catalysts used in the field of artificial photosynthesis are still based on rare earth metals and should thus be utilized as efficiently and economically as possible. While repair of an inactivated catalyst is a potential mitigation strategy, this remains a challenge. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods are crucial for characterizing reaction products during photocatalysis and repair, and are currently based on invasive analysis techniques limiting real&#8208;time access to the involved mechanisms. Herein, we use an innovative in situ technique for detecting both initially evolved hydrogen and after active repair via advanced non&#8208;invasive rotational Raman spectroscopy. This facilitates unprecedently accurate monitoring of gaseous reaction products and insight into the mechanism of active repair during light&#8208;driven catalysts enabling the identification of relevant mechanistic details along with innovative repair strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Hydrolytically Degradable Block Copolymer Nanoparticles via Reverse Sequence Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrolytically degradable block copolymer nanoparticles are prepared via reverse sequence polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in aqueous media. This efficient one&#8208;pot protocol involves the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylacrylamide (DMAC) using a monofunctional or bifunctional trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) precursor. DMAC monomer is employed as a co&#8208;solvent to solubilize the hydrophobic PCL chains. At an intermediate DMAC conversion of 20&#8208;60%, the homogeneous reaction mixture is diluted with water to 10&#8208;25% w/w solids. The growing amphiphilic block copolymer chains undergo nucleation to form sterically&#8208;stabilized PCL&#8208;core nanoparticles with PDMAC coronas. 1H NMR studies confirm &gt;99% DMAC conversion while gel permeation chromatography (GPC) studies indicate well&#8208;controlled RAFT polymerizations (Mw/Mn &#8804; 1.30). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicate spheres of 20&#8208;120 nm diameter. As expected, hydrolytic degradation occurs within days at 37 &#186;C in either acidic or alkaline solution. Degradation is also observed in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) at 37 &#186;C. However, no degradation can be detected over a three&#8208;month period when these nanoparticles are stored at 20 &#186;C in deionized water (pH 6.7). Finally, PDMAC30&#8208;PCL16&#8208;PDMAC30 nanoparticles are briefly evaluated as a dispersant for an agrochemical formulation based on a broad&#8208;spectrum fungicide (azoxystrobin).</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Bromination, Chlorination and Thiocyanation Using Inorganic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarboxylative halogenations of alkyl carboxylic acids are highly valuable reactions for the synthesis of stucturally diverse alkyl halides. However, many reported protocols rely on stoichiometric strong oxidants or highly electrophilic halogenating agents. Herein, we describe visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative halogenations of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide&#8208;activated carboxylic acids that avoid stiochiometric oxidants and use inexpensive inorganic halide salts as the halogenating agents. Brominations with lithium bromide proceed under simple, transition metal&#8208;free conditions using an organic photoredox catalyst and no other additives, whereas dual photoredox&#8211;copper&#8208;catalysis is required for chlorinations with lithium chloride. The mild conditions display excellent functional group tolerance, which is demonstrated through the transformation of a diverse range of structurally complex carboxylic acid&#8208;containing natural products into the corresponding alkyl bromides and chlorides. In addition, we show the generality of the dual photoredox&#8211;copper&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative functionalizations with inorganic salts by extension to a thiocyanation with potasium thiocyanide, which was applied to the synthesis of complex alkyl thiocyanates.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: Access to a Bowl&#8208;Type Macrocycle and a Barrel&#8208;Type Heptanuclear Complex Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) is a powerful and widely applied tool in modern synthetic chemistry, which is based on the reversible cleavage and formation of covalent bonds. One of the inherent strengths of this approach is the perspective to reversibly generate novel structural motifs in an operationally simple approach, which are difficult or impossible to access with more traditional methods and require multiple bond cleaving and bond forming steps. To date, these fundamentally important synthetic and conceptual challenges in the context of DCvC have predominantly been tackled by exploiting compounds of lighter p&#8208;block elements, albeit heavier p&#8208;block elements show low bond dissociation energies and appear to be ideally suited for this approach. Here we show that a dinuclear organometallic bismuth compound, containing BiMe2 groups that are connected by a thioxanthene linker, readily undergoes selective and reversible cleavage of its Bi&#8211;C bonds upon exposure to external stimuli. The exploitation of DCvC in the field of organometallic heavy p&#8208;block chemistry grants access to unprecedented macrocyclic and barrel&#8208;type oligonuclear compounds.</dc:description>
