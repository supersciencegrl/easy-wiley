      <title>Atomic&#8208;level modulation of electronic density of metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#8208;derived Co single&#8208;atom sites to enhance oxygen reduction performance</title>
      <dc:description>Tuning the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom active sites via engineering atomic configuration is an effective strategy to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but still remains challenging because of the lack of rational guidance and effective methods. Here, we demonstrate the correlation between atomic configuration induced electronic density of single&#8208;atom Co active sites and ORR performance by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical analysis. Guided by DFT calculations, we designed and synthesized a MOFs&#8208;derived Co single&#8208;atom catalyst with the optimal Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS active moiety incorporated in hollow carbon polyhedron (Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS/HC). As predicted, Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS/HC exhibits outstanding alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.920 V and superior ORR kinetics with record&#8208;level kinetic current and ultralow Tafel slope of 31 mV dec &#8208;1  , exceeding the Pt/C and almost all non&#8208;precious ORR electrocatalysts. Even in more challenging acidic media, the ORR kinetics of Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS/HC still surpasses that of Pt/C. This work offers an atomic&#8208;level insight into the relationship between electronic density of active site and catalytic property, promoting rational design of highly efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Bunsen the Geochemist: Icelandic Volcanism, Geyser Theory, and Gas, Rock and Mineral Analyses</title>
      <dc:description>
Bunsen classified volcanic rocks in two types, trachytic and pyroxenic (today felsic and mafic) based on their chemical analyses. He explained the mechanism of geyser action. He refuted the widespread idea that volcanoes and geysers were connected with the sea, and that masses of common salt were produced in eruptions. He pioneered gas analysis by means of the eudiometer. He was a vehement inductive empiricist, vigorously rejecting hypotheses.







Abstract
Following the eruption of Hekla in 1845&#8211;1846 Bunsen was invited by King Christian VIII of Denmark and Iceland to participate in a geochemical expedition to Iceland together with the geologist Sartorius von Waltershausen and the physiologist Carl Bergmann from G&#246;ttingen. The French mineralogist Des Cloizeaux went to Iceland separately and joined the expedition. The eudiometer invented by Bunsen was crucial for his accurate characterization of volcanic gases and determination of the composition of mixtures. His analyses of the chemical compositions of numerous rocks and minerals led him to the classification of two fundamental rock types, the more silica rich (nowadays called felsic) and the less silica rich, more basic (mafic) in agreement with Des Cloizeaux and the Danish scientist J.&#8197;C. Schythe. Bunsen also formulated the correct mechanism of geyser action and helped disband the theory of connections between geysers, volcanoes and the sea. He disagreed vehemently with Waltershausen over the mechanisms of formation of sal ammoniac and of volcanic rocks and their chemical compositions. He revealed himself as an ardent experimentalist vigorously opposed to hypotheses of any kind, which also made him dismiss the new chemical theories, for example, those of Dumas and Kekul&#233;.

      <title>Synthesis of a pentasaccharide repeating unit of lipopolysaccharide derived from virulent E. coli O1 and identification of a glycotope candidate of avian pathogenetic E. coli O1</title>
      <dc:description>Avian pathogenic  Escherichia coli  (APEC) is a common bacterial pathogen infecting chickens, resulting in economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. In particular, APEC O1, one of the most common serotypes of APEC, is considered problematic due to its zoonotic potential. Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop an effective vaccine against APEC O1.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Avian pathogenic  Escherichia coli  (APEC) is a common bacterial pathogen infecting chickens, resulting in economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. In particular, APEC O1, one of the most common serotypes of APEC, is considered problematic due to its zoonotic potential. Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop an effective vaccine against APEC O1. In fact, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O&#8208;antigen of APEC O1 has been shown to be a potent antigen for inducing specific protective immune responses. However, the detailed structure of the O&#8208;antigen of APEC O1 is not clear.

      <title>Boosting the Energy Density of Aqueous Batteries via Facile Grotthuss Proton Transport</title>
      <dc:description>The recent developments in rechargeable aqueous batteries have witnessed a burgeoning interest in the mechanism of proton transport in the cathode materials. Herein, for the first time, we report the Grotthuss proton transport mechanism in &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  which features wide [2&#215;2] tunnels. Exemplified by the substitution doping of Ni (~5 at.%) in &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  that increases the energy density of the electrode by ~25%, we reveal a close link between the tetragonal&#8208;orthorhombic (TO) distortion of the lattice and the diffusion kinetics of protons in the tunnels. Experimental and theoretical results verify that Ni dopants can exacerbate the TO distortion during discharge, thereby facilitating the hydrogen bond formation in bulk &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  . The isolated direct hopping mode of proton transport is switched to a facile concerted mode, which involves the formation and concomitant cleavage of O&#8208;H bonds in a proton array, namely via Grotthuss proton transport mechanism. Our study provides important insight towards the understanding of proton transport in MnO  2  and can serve as a model for the compositional design of cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of Particle Wettability and Particle Concentration on the Enzymatic Dehydration of n&#8208;Octanaloxime in Pickering Emulsions</title>
      <dc:description>Pickering emulsion systems have emerged as platforms for the synthesis of organic molecules in biphasic biocatalysis. Herein, the catalytic performance was evaluated for biotransformation using whole cells exemplified for the dehydration of  n  &#8208;octanaloxime to  n  &#8208;octanenitrile catalysed by an aldoxime dehydratase (OxdB) overexpressed in  E. coli  . This study was carried out in Pickering emulsions stabilised solely with silica particles of different hydrophobicity. We correlate, for the first time, the properties of the emulsions with the conversion of the reaction, thus gaining an insight into the impact of the particle wettability and particle concentration. When comparing two emulsions of different type with similar stability and droplet diameter, the oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (o/w) system displayed a higher conversion than the water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (w/o) system, despite the conversion in both cases being higher than that in a &#8220;classic&#8221; two&#8208;phase system. Furthermore, an increase in particle concentration prior to emulsification resulted in an increase of the interfacial area and hence a higher conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>An Unexpected Split&#8208;Merge Pathway to the Symmetric Nonribosomal Peptide Antibiotic Closthioamide</title>
      <dc:description>Closthioamide (CTA) is a symmetric nonribosomal peptide (NRP) comprised of two diaminopropane&#8208;linked polythioamidated monomers. CTA is biosynthesized by Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum via an atypical NRP synthetase (NRPS)&#8208;independent biosynthetic pathway. Although the logic for monomer assembly was recently elucidated, the strategy for the biosynthesis and incorporation of the diamine linker remained a mystery. By means of genome editing, synthesis, and in vitro biochemical assays, we demonstrate that the final steps in CTA maturation proceed through a surprising split&#8208;merge pathway involving the dual use of a thiotemplated intermediate. This pathway includes the first examples of an aldo&#8208;keto reductase catalyzing the reductive release of a thiotemplated product, and of a transthioamidating transglutaminase. In addition to clarifying the remaining steps in CTA assembly, our data shed light on largely unexplored pathways for NRPS&#8208;independent peptide biosynthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling Ultra&#8208;Large Optical Asymmetry in Amorphous Molecular Aggregations</title>
      <dc:description>Although ultra&#8208;large optical asymmetry appears in crystalline materials, distractions from the mesoscopic ordering often causes inauthenticity in chiropticity. In addition, the formation and maintenance of crystalline states require complicated technical efforts. In amorphous materials, however, it remained challenging and elusive to achieve large chiropticity, not to mention the control of the degree of asymmetry. Herein, we report the quantitative control of chiral amplification, on amorphous supramolecular structures of cholesteryl&#8208;linked bis(dipyrrinato)zinc(II), to an exceptionally high level. The amorphous molecular aggregations of these complex building blocks exhibit mirror&#8208;image chiropticity. A proper chiral packing of the building block at several molecular scale contributes considerably to the absorptive dissymmetry factor g  abs  , although the system is overall disordered. The intense and tunable aggregation strength renders a variable g  abs  value up to +0.10 and +0.31 in the solution and in film state, higher than those observed in most previously reported cases. On this basis, a superior ON&#8208;OFF switching of chiropticity is realized under external stimuli. By eliminating the demand on material crystallinity, this work establishes a general design principle to control over ultra&#8208;large optical asymmetry on a wider scope of chiral materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Multi&#8208;photocatalyst Cascade Sequences: Merging Singlet Oxygen Photooxygenations with Photoredox Catalysis for the Synthesis of Key Alkaloid Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>The development of photocascades that rapidly transform simple and readily accessible furan substrates into polycyclic alkaloid frameworks or erythrina natural products is described. Each of the sequences developed makes use of photocatalyzed energy transfer processes, which generate singlet oxygen, to set up the substrates for the second photocatalyzed reaction, wherein electron transfer generates carbon&#8208;centered radicals for the cyclizations that give the final complex frameworks. A chemical switch has been developed that can &#8220;switch off&#8221; one photocatalyst; thus, allowing a second photocatalyst to take over control of the sequence. As a corollary, this strategy represents the first time it has been possible to use multiple photocatalysts in photocascades, and, as such, it expands significantly the reactions that can be included in such cascades and the order in which they can be initiated.</dc:description>

      <title>Sublimable Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes: From Spin&#8208;State Switching to Molecular Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
This review provides a complete account of the on&#8208;surface spin&#8208;state switching behavior of films of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes of molecular to multilayer thickness. SCO&#8208;based molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures fabricated employing vacuum sublimation are also described.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) active transition metal complexes are an important class of switchable molecular materials due to their bistable spin&#8208;state switching characteristics at or around room temperature. Vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes are a subclass of SCO complexes suitable for fabricating ultraclean spin&#8208;switchable films desirable for applications, especially in molecular electronics/spintronics. Consequently, on&#8208;surface SCO of thin&#8208;films of sublimable SCO complexes have been studied employing spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, and results of fundamental and technological importance have been obtained. This Review provides complete coverage of advances made in the field of vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes: progress made in the design and synthesis of sublimable functional SCO complexes, on&#8208;surface SCO of molecular and multilayer thick films, and various molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures based on the sublimable SCO complexes.

      <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis Induced by Platinum(II) Tweezers with Excellent Environmental Tolerance</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular chirogenesis has emerged as an effective strategy to access symmetry breaking in artificial systems. However, the chirogenic signals suffer from high susceptibility toward environmental variations, which are disadvantageous for their applications in asymmetric catalysis, chiroptical devices etc. Herein an effective strategy has been developed to address this issue, by constructing non&#8208;covalent tweezer/guest complexes stabilized by two&#8208;fold donor&#8211;acceptor and Pt(II)&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Pt(II) metal&#8211;metal interactions. Upon guest encapsulation, the two pincers on achiral Pt(II) tweezer undergo stereospecific twist to minimize steric repulsion, thus locking the tweezer/guest complexes into preferred chiral conformations. The induced chiroptical effects display outstanding solvent&#8208; and temperature&#8208; tolerance, ascribed to strong tweezer/guest binding strength via the balance between electrostatic and desolvation effects for the involved non&#8208;covalent interactions. Moreover, hierarchical and multi&#8208;component supramolecular assembly of tweezer/guest complexes provide a convenient way to modulate chirogeneic signals for their intensities. Overall, the current study opens up new avenues toward artificial supramolecular chirogenesis with excellent environmental tolerability.</dc:description>

      <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Extraction of Adjacent Metals&#8212;A Disruptive Economic Window for In&#8197;Situ Resource Utilization of Asteroids?</title>
      <dc:description>
For in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, which will necessitate the development of new technologies from first principals. This Review unveils how chemical process intensification in the development of disruptive technologies and business matters.

Abstract
For the in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, and technologies may need to be conceptualised from first principals. By using this approach, this Review seeks to illustrate how chemical process intensification can help with the development of disruptive technologies and business matters, how this might influence space&#8208;industry start&#8208;ups, and even industrial transformations on Earth. The disruptive technology considered is continuous microflow solvent extraction and, as another disruptive element therein, the use of ionic liquids. The space business considered is asteroid mining, as it is probably the most challenging resource site, and the focus is on its last step: the purification of adjacent metals (cobalt versus nickel). The key economic barrier is defined as the reduction in the amount of water used in the asteroid mining process. This Review suggests a pathway toward water savings up to the technological limit of the best Earth&#8208;based processes and their physical limits.

      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have sparked increasing interest in mimicking the structure and function of natural enzymes. However, their catalytic and therapeutic efficiency are unsatisfactory due to the relatively lower catalytic activity. Herein, inspired by nature, a MOF@COF nanozyme has been designed as a high&#8208;efficiency peroxidase mimic, with the metallic nodes of MOFs as active centres, the hierarchical nanocavities produced by the growth of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as binding pockets to form tailored pore microenvironment around active sites for enriching and activating substrate molecules, to perform enhanced bacterial inhibition. Furthermore, the pseudopodia&#8208;like surface of the COFs &#8220;skin&#8221; enabled the system to catch the bacteria effectively for further amplifying the therapeutic efficiency of MOF&#8208;based nanozyme.

Abstract
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed oxidative kinetic resolution of cyclic benzylic ethers through asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation is reported. The practical approach is applicable to a wide range of 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofurans bearing diverse functional groups and substituent patterns at the &#945;&#8197;position with extremely efficient enantiodiscrimination. The generality of the strategy was further demonstrated by efficient oxidative kinetic resolution of another type of five&#8208;membered cyclic benzylic ether, 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans, and six&#8208;membered 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromenes. Direct late&#8208;stage oxidative kinetic resolution of bioactive molecules that are otherwise difficult to access was further explored.

      <title>Reversing Titanium Oligomers Formation towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Green Synthesis of Titanium&#8208;containing Molecular Sieves</title>
      <dc:description>Green and efficient synthesis of titanium&#8208;containing molecular sieves is limited by large amount of environmentally unfriendly additives and complicated synthesis procedures necessarily required to avoid the oligomerization of Ti monomers to anatase TiO  2  , due to a mismatch between hydrolysis rates of Si and Ti precursors. Here, we report a simple and generic additive&#8208;free route for the synthesis of Ti&#8208;containing molecular sieves (MFI, MEL, and BEA). This approach successfully reverses the Ti oligomers formation to match hydrolysis rates of Ti and Si species with the assistance of hydroxyl free radicals generated  in&#8208;situ  from ultraviolet irradiation. Moreover, fantastic catalytic performance for propene epoxidation with H  2  and O  2  is observed. Compared with the conventional hydrothermal method, this approach opens up new opportunities for high&#8208;efficiency, environmentally&#8208;benign, and easy&#8208;operating production of pure titanium&#8208;containing molecular sieves.</dc:description>

      <title>Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties of an Iron(II) Coordination Nanohoop</title>

      <title>Surfactant&#8208;induced interfacial aggregation of porphyrins for structuring the color&#8208;tunable liquids</title>
      <dc:description>Locking&#8208;in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids into targeted architectures by the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles, i.e. structuring liquids, is an emerging area in material science. Here, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (H6TPPS) shows three different aggregation states that present an absorption imaging platform to monitor the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants at the liquid/liquid interface. The interfacial interconversion of H6TPPS, specifically H4TPPS2&#8208; dissolved in water, from a J to an H&#8208;aggregation state was induced by strong electrostatic interactions with amine terminated polystyrene (PS&#8208;NH2) dissolved in toluene at the water/toluene interface. This resulted in color&#8208;tunable liquids due to interfacial jamming of the nanoparticulate surfactants formed between H4TPPS2&#8208; and PS&#8208;NH2. However, the nanoparticulate surfactants formed cannot lock&#8208;in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids. In addition, a self&#8208;wrinkling behavior was observed when amphiphilic triblock copolymers of PS&#8208;block&#8208;poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) were used to interact with H4TPPS2&#8208;.

      <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons via 1,4&#8208;Boron Migration</title>

      <title>Backbone&#8208;Bridging Promotes Diversity in Heteroleptic Cages</title>
      <dc:description>The combination of shape&#8208;complementary bis&#8208;monodentate ligands  L  A  and  L  B  with Pd(II) cations yields heteroleptic cages  cis  &#8208;[Pd  2  L  A  2  L  B  2  ] by non&#8208;statistical self&#8208;assembly. Here we report how such assemblies can be diversified by introduction of covalent backbone bridges between two  L  A  units. Together with solvent&#8208; and guest&#8208;effects, the flexibility of these linkers is shown to modulate the nuclearity, topology and number of distinguishable cavities in a family of four structurally highly diverse supramolecular assemblies. Ligand&#8208;dimer  L  A1  , with flexibly connected backbones, reacts in acetonitrile with its  L  B  counterpart to a tetranuclear back&#8208;to&#8208;back dimer of heteroleptic cages  D1  . In DMSO, however, a trinuclear pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral structure  T1  is formed. The product of  L  A2  , with rigidly connected backbones, looks similar to  D1  , but with a rotated ligand arrangement. In presence of an anionic guest, this dimer  D2  transforms and a hexanuclear prismatic barrel  P2  crystallizes. We demonstrate how controlling a ligand&#8217;s coordination mode can trigger structural differentiation and increase complexity in metallo&#8208;supramolecular assembly.</dc:description>

Herein, we first describe an unprecedented MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal, which is composed of tetrahedral Ti4L6 (L = embonate) cages and in&#8208;situ generated [(NH3)4(TIPA)4] (TIPA = tris(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)amine) cages. Chiral transfer phenomenon is observed from enantiopure Ti4L6 cage to enantiopure [(NH3)4(TIPA)4] cage. Accordingly, two homochiral supramolecular frameworks with opposite handedness (PTC&#8208;235(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;235(&#923;)) are formed. Such MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal features high stability in water and other solvents, affording single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation to trap CH3CN molecules and identify disordered NH4+ cations. Moreover, a tablet pressing method is firstly developed to test the third&#8208;order nonlinear optical property of KBr&#8208;based PTC&#8208;235 thin film.

(Phthalocyanine)Fe(III)Cl was found to catalyze this cyclization with extremely high turnover numbers up to 47,000 under mild and aerobic conditions.

Plausible origin of extremely high turnover numbers along with air&#8208;compatibility was also rationalized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Reduction of &#960;&#8208;Expanded Cyclooctatetraene with Lithium: Stabilization of the Tetraanion through Internal Li+ Coordination</title>
      <dc:description>The chemical reduction of a &#960;&#8208;expanded polycyclic framework comprising a cyclooctatetraene moiety, octaphenyltetrabenzocyclooctatetraene, with lithium metal readily affords the corresponding tetraanion instead of the expected aromatic dianion. As revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the highly contorted tetraanion is stabilized by coordination of two internally bound Li  +  cations, while two external cations remain solvent&#8208;separated. The variable&#8208;temperature  7  Li NMR spectra in THF confirm the presence of three types of Li  +  ions and clearly differentiate internal binding, consistently with the crystal structure. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the formation of the highly charged tetrareduced carbanion is stabilized through Li  +  coordination under the applied experimental conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Z&#8208;Scheme Photocatalytic Systems for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Where Are We Now?</title>
      <dc:description>
Mimicking natural photosynthesis: The latest progress on Z&#8208;scheme photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction is comprehensively discussed in this Review. Particular attention is given to modification strategies that improve photocatalytic performance as well as confirmation methods to assess the Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism.







Abstract
Transforming CO2 into fuels by utilizing sunlight is promising to synchronously overcome global warming and energy&#8208;supply issues. It is crucial to design efficient photocatalysts with intriguing features such as robust light&#8208;harvesting ability, strong redox potential, high charge&#8208;separation, and excellent durability. Hitherto, a single&#8208;component photocatalyst is incapable to simultaneously meet all these criteria. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing artificial Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts provides a facile way to conquer these bottlenecks. In this review, we firstly introduce the fundamentals of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and Z&#8208;scheme systems. Thereafter we discuss state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Z&#8208;scheme photocatalytic CO2 reduction, whereby special attention is placed on the predominant factors that affect photoactivity. Additionally, further modifications that are important for efficient photocatalysis are reviewed.

      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as the leading contenders in energy storage devices. However, the batteries with routine carbonate electrolytes cannot exhibit satisfactory fast&#8208;charging performance and lithium plating is widely observed at low temperatures. Herein we demonstrate that a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte consisting of 1.5 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in dimethoxyethane with bis(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) ether as the diluent, enables fast&#8208;charging of working batteries. A uniform and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be achieved on graphite surface through the preferential decomposition of anions. The established SEI can significantly inhibit solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite and achieve highly reversible Li+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. The graphite | Li cells exhibit fast&#8208;charging potential (340 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and 220 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4 C), excellent cycling stability (~85.5% initial capacity retention for 200 cycles at 4 C), and impressive low temperature performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Adsorption Site Selective Occupation Strategy within a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Sieving Acetylene from Carbon Dioxide</title>
      <dc:description>The separation of C  2  H  2  /CO  2  is an essential but challenging process owing to their similar molecular sizes and physical properties. However, it is noteworthy that these two molecules usually exhibit different orientations in the pore channel. Herein, we report an adsorption site selective occupation strategy by taking advantage of differences in orientation to sieving the C  2  H  2  from CO  2  in a judiciously designed amine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework, termed as CPL&#8208;1&#8208;NH  2  . In this material, the incorporation of amino groups not only occupies the adsorption sites of CO  2  molecules and shields the interaction of uncoordinated oxygen atom and CO  2  molecules resulting in a negligible adsorption amount and a decrease in enthalpy of adsorption but also strengthened the binding affinity toward C  2  H  2  molecules. This material thus shows an extremely high amount of C  2  H  2  at low pressure and a remarkable high C  2  H  2  /CO  2  IAST selectivity (119) at 1 bar and 298 K. The experimental breakthrough studies show complete separation of C  2  H  2  from C  2  H  2  /CO  2  mixtures&#65292;further confirmed this adsorption site selective occupation strategy promising and practicability.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Alcohols by Enantioselective Silylation Enabled by Two Orthogonal Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
The combination of a chiral copper catalyst and a bifunctional ruthenium pincer complex enables the nonenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of acyclic and cyclic benzylic alcohols. The enantioselective Cu&#8208;H&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative Si&#8208;O coupling and the rapid transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alcohol racemization are perfectly orthogonal. By this, high yields and good levels of enantioselection are achieved.







Abstract
A nonenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of acyclic and cyclic benzylic alcohols is reported. The approach merges rapid transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alcohol racemization and enantioselective Cu&#8208;H&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative Si&#8208;O coupling of alcohols and hydrosilanes. The catalytic processes are orthogonal, and the racemization catalyst does not promote any background reactions such as the racemization of the silyl ether and its unselective formation. Often&#8208;used ruthenium half&#8208;sandwich complexes are not suitable but a bifunctional ruthenium pincer complex perfectly fulfills this purpose. By this, enantioselective silylation of racemic alcohol mixtures is achieved in high yields and with good levels of enantioselection.

     alt="Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Alcohols by Enantioselective Silylation Enabled by Two Orthogonal Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of a chiral copper catalyst and a bifunctional ruthenium pincer complex enables the nonenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of acyclic and cyclic benzylic alcohols. The enantioselective Cu&#8208;H&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative Si&#8208;O coupling and the rapid transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alcohol racemization are perfectly orthogonal. By this, high yields and good levels of enantioselection are achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nonenzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution of acyclic and cyclic benzylic alcohols is reported. The approach merges rapid transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alcohol racemization and enantioselective Cu&#8208;H&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative Si&#8208;O coupling of alcohols and hydrosilanes. The catalytic processes are orthogonal, and the racemization catalyst does not promote any background reactions such as the racemization of the silyl ether and its unselective formation. Often&#8208;used ruthenium half&#8208;sandwich complexes are not suitable but a bifunctional ruthenium pincer complex perfectly fulfills this purpose. By this, enantioselective silylation of racemic alcohol mixtures is achieved in high yields and with good levels of enantioselection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Directed evolution of a halide methyltransferase enables biocatalytic synthesis of diverse SAM analogues</title>
      <dc:description>Biocatalytic alkylations are important reactions to obtain&#160;chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselectively&#160;alkylated compounds. This can be achieved using&#160;S&#8208;adenosyl&#160;l&#8208;methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and SAM analogues. It was recently shown that a halide methyltransferase (HMT) from&#160;Chloracidobacterium thermophilum&#160;can synthesize SAM from SAH and methyl iodide. We developed an iodide&#8208;based assay for the directed evolution of an HMT from&#160;Arabidopsis thalianaand used it to identify a V140T variant that can also accept ethyl&#8208;, propyl&#8208;, and allyl iodide to produce the corresponding SAM&#8208;analogues (90%, 50%, and 70% conversion of 15 mg SAH). The V140T&#8208;AtHMT was used in one&#8208;pot cascades with&#160;O&#8209;methyltransferases (IeOMT or COMT)&#160;to achieve the regio&#8208;selective&#160;ethylation&#160;of luteolin and allylation of&#160;3,4&#8208;dihydroxybenzaldehyde.

      <title>Synergy between Metallic and Oxidized Pt Sites Unravelled during Room Temperature CO Oxidation on Pt/Ceria</title>
      <dc:description>Pt&#8208;based materials are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, in particular for pollutant removal applications. The nature of the active Pt phase responsible for CO oxidation has long been investigated with a view at designing more efficient formulations. The state of Pt has often been proposed to differ depending on experimental conditions, e.g. metallic Pt poisoned with CO being present at lower temperature before light&#8208;off, while an oxidized Pt surface prevails above light&#8208;off temperature. In stark contrast with all previous reports, we show here that both metallic and oxidized Pt are present in similar proportions under reaction conditions at the surface of ca. 1 nm nanoparticles showing high activity at 30 &#176;C. The simultaneous presence of metallic and oxidized Pt enables a synergy between these phases. The main role of metallic Pt phase is to provide strong adsorption sites for CO, while that of oxidized Pt supposedly supplies reactive oxygen. Our results emphasize the complex dual oxidic&#8208;metallic nature of supported Pt catalysts and its evolving nature under reaction conditions, warranting a whole rethink of the mechanism of other reaction and metals, particularly redox and electrochemical reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploiting Ru&#8208;induced Lattice Strain in CoRu Nanoalloys for Robust Bifunctional Hydrogen Production</title>
      <dc:description>Designing bifunctional catalysts capable of driving the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and also H  2  evolution via the hydrolysis of hydrogen storage materials such as ammonia borane (AB) is of considerable practical importance for future hydrogen economies. Herein, we systematically examined the effect of tensile lattice strain in CoRu nanoalloys supported on carbon quantum dots (CoRu/CQDs) on hydrogen generation by HER and AB hydrolysis. By varying the Ru content, the lattice parameters and Ru&#8208;induced lattice strain in the CoRu nanoalloys could be tuned. The CoRu  0.5  /CQDs catalyst with an ultra&#8208;low Ru content (1.33 wt.%) exhibited excellent catalytic activity for HER (&#951; = 18 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  in 1 M KOH) and extraordinary activity for the hydrolysis of AB with a turnover frequency of 3255.4 mol  (H2)  mol  &#8722;1  (Ru)  min  &#8722;1  or 814.7 mol  (H2)  mol  &#8722;1  (cat)  min  &#8722;1  at 298 K, respectively, representing one of the best activities yet reported for AB hydrolysis over a ruthenium alloy catalyst. Moreover, the CoRu  0.5  /CQDs catalyst displayed excellent stability during each reaction, including seven alternating cycles of HER and AB hydrolysis. Theoretical calculations revealed that the remarkable catalytic performance of CoRu  0.5  /CQDs resulted from the optimal alloy electronic structure realized by incorporating small amounts of Ru, which enabled fast interfacial electron transfer to intermediates, thus benefitting H  2  evolution kinetics.

      <title>New Insight into Transition Metal Hydroxide Cover Layer for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Depositing transition metal hydroxide (TMH) layer on photoanode has been demonstrated as a promising approach for enhancing photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation, however, the controversial understanding for the improvement origin remains a key challenge to unlock the PEC performance. Herein, by taking BiVO4/iron&#8208;nickel hydroxide (BVO/FxN4&#8208;x&#8208;H) as a prototype, we decoupled the PEC process into two processes including charge transfer and surface catalytic reaction. The kinetic information at the BVO/FxN4&#8208;x&#8208;H and FxN4&#8208;x&#8208;H/electrolyte interfaces was systematically evaluated by employing scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM), intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) model. It was found that FxN4&#8208;x&#8208;H acts as a charge transporter rather than a sole electrocatalyst. And PEC performance improvement is mainly ascribed to the efficient suppression of charge recombination by fast hole transfer kinetics at BVO/FxN4&#8208;x&#8208;H interface.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling Optical and Catalytic Activity of Genetically Engineered Proteins by Ultrasound</title>
      <dc:description>Ultrasound (US) produces cavitation&#8208;induced mechanical forces stretching and breaking polymer chains in solution. This type of polymer mechanochemistry is widely used for synthetic polymers, but not biomacromolecules, even though US is biocompatible and commonly used for medical therapy as well as  in vivo  imaging. The ability to control protein activity by US would thus be a major stepping&#8208;stone for these disciplines. Here, we provide the first examples of selective protein activation and deactivation by means of US. Using GFP as a model system, we engineer US sensitivity into proteins by design. The incorporation of long and highly charged domains enables the efficient transfer of force to the protein structure. We then use this principle to activate the catalytic activity of trypsin by inducing the release of its inhibitor. We expect that this concept to switch &#8216;on&#8217; and &#8216;off&#8217; protein activity by US will serve as a blueprint to remote control other bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface Coordination of Multiple Ligands Endows N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Gold Nanoclusters with High Robustness and Surface Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>Deciphering the molecular pictures of the multi&#8208;component and non&#8208;periodic organic&#8208;inorganic interlayer is a grand technical challenge. Here we show that the atomic arrangement of hybrid surface ligands on metal nanoparticles can be precisely quantified through comprehensive characterization of a novel gold cluster, Au  44  (  i  Pr  2  &#8208;bimy)  9  (PA)  6  Br  8  , which features three types of ligands, namely, carbene (1,3&#8208;diisopropylbenzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene,  i  Pr  2  &#8208;bimy), alkynyl (phenylacetylide, PA), and halide (Br), respectively. The delicately balanced stereochemical effects and bonding capabilities of the three ligands give rise to peculiar geometrical and electronic structures. Remarkably, despite its complex and highly distorted surface structure, Au  44  (  i  Pr  2  &#8208;bimy)  9  (PA)  6  Br  8  exhibits unusual catalytic properties and yet it is highly stable, both chemically and thermally.

      <title>Total Synthesis of the Diterpene Waihoensene</title>
      <dc:description>A racemic and scalable enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;waihoensene was accomplished. (+)&#8208;Waihoensene belongs to the diterpene natural product family, and features an angular triquinane substructure motif. Its tetracyclic [6.5.5.5]backbone is all&#8208;  cis&#8208;  fused, containing six contiguous stereocenters, four of which are quaternary. These structural features were efficiently installed by means of a diastereoselective radical cyclization, followed by an intramolecular Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction, a diastereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation, and a diastereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition reaction. Enantioselectivity was introduced at an early stage, by asymmetric palladium catalyzed decarboxylative allylation reaction on gram&#8208;scale.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Emission of a Free&#8208;Base 5&#8208;Oxaporphyrinium Cation from its&#160;cis&#8208; and&#160;trans&#8208;NH Tautomers</title>
      <dc:description>Replacement of the&#160;  meso  &#160;methine carbon atoms of porphyrins with heteroatoms represents a powerful strategy for tuning their optical and electronic properties. In particular, 5&#8208;oxaporphyrin is an attractive target due to its importance as an intermediate in heme catabolism. In this work, we describe the synthesis and properties of a free&#8208;base 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation, which was prepared by the ring&#8208;closure of a bilindione with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride. This free&#8208;base 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation exhibits dual fluorescence originating from its unique NH tautomerism. In contrast to normal porphyrins, the&#160;  cis  &#160;form of the 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation is more stable than the&#160;  trans  &#160;form due to the effective delocalization of its positive charge. We thus demonstrate here that&#160;  meso  &#8208;modified &#160;heteroporphyrins enable the manipulation of NH tautomerism in porphyrinic macrocycles.</dc:description>

      <title>A Design Principle for Polar Assemblies with C3&#8208;Sym Bowl&#8208;Shaped &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>Polar materials attract wide research interest due to their&#160;unique properties, such as ferroelectricity and the bulk photovoltaic&#160;effect (BPVE), which are not accessible with nonpolar&#160;materials.&#160;However, in general, rationally designing polar materials is difficult&#160;because nonpolar materials are more favorable in terms of dipoledipole&#160;interactions. Here, we report a rational strategy to form polar&#160;assemblies with bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and a&#160;molecular design principle for this strategy. We synthesized and&#160;thoroughly characterized 12 single&#160;crystals with the help of various&#160;theoretical calculations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that it can be&#160;possible to predict whether polar assemblies become more favorable&#160;or not by estimating their lattice energies.

      <title>Tuning Redox Reactions via Defects on CoS2&#8208;x for Sustainable Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
      <dc:description>Compared with adding a large amount of H  2  O  2&#160;  artificially to the traditional advanced oxidation system, it is particularly important to develop self&#8208;producing reactive oxygen species (ROSs) system and maintain the continuous and effective degradation of organic pollutants. Herein, for the first time, a system of ultrasound&#8208;treated CoS  2&#8208;x  mixed with Fe  2+  is constructed to sustainably release singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) for the effective degradation of various organic pollutants, including dyes, phenols and antibiotics. Ultrasonic treatment can produce a large number of defects on the surface of CoS  2  , which promote the production of ROSs and the circulation of Fe  3+  /Fe  2+  . With the help of Co  4+  /Co  3+&#160;  exposed on the surface of CoS  2&#8208;x  , the directional conversion of superoxide radical (  &#183;  O  2  &#8208;  ) to  1  O  2  is realized. The CoS  2&#8208;x  /Fe  2+&#160;  system can degrade organic pollutants efficiently for up to 30 days, which is significantly better than the currently recognized CuP  x  system (&lt;3 days). Therefore, CoS  2&#8208;x&#160;  provides a new choice for the long&#8208;term remediation of organic pollutants in controlling large area river pollution.</dc:description>

      <title>Oxidation Control of Bottlebrush Molecular Conformation for Producing Libraries of Photonic Structures</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly is important for creating photonic structures, and structural color is tunable typically relying on size&#8208;varied building blocks obtained by time&#8208;consuming chemical synthesis. Herein, molecular conformation of bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) in solution is successfully manipulated  to create libraries of photonic structures  . Amphiphilic BBCPs bearing oxidation&#8208;responsive ferrocene groups on the hydrophilic block are used to fabricate porous particles via evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W/O) double emulsions stabilized by the BBCP surfactant. In&#8208;situ oxidation of the ferrocene groups by hydrogen peroxide at the W/O interface leads to enhanced hydrophilicity, more hydration, and chain extension of the hydrophilic block. Consequently, larger internal water droplets are spontaneously formed, yielding larger pores within the microparticles. The pore diameter is readily tunable from 144 to 301 nm with a single BBCP, generating full&#8208;spectrum structural colors. This work provides a straightforward method for fabrication of libraries of photonic pigments in an easy and scalable manner.</dc:description>

      <title>&#947;&#8208;Glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT)&#8208;Activatable Fluorescence Probe for Durable Tumor Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>&#933;&#8208;Glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) is overexpressed in several types of cancer. Existing GGT&#8208;targeting fluorescence probes can image these cancers, but the fluorescent hydrolysis product leaks from the target cancer cells during prolonged incubation or fixation. Here, we present a functionalized fluorescence probe for GGT, 4&#8208;CH  2  F&#8208;HMDiEtR&#8208;gGlu, which is designed to &#160;generate an azaquinone methide intermediate during activation by GGT; this intermediate reacts with intracellular nucleophiles to generate a fluorescent adduct that is trapped inside the cells, without loss of the target enzyme activity. Application of the probe to patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) mice enabled in vivo cancer imaging for a prolonged period, and was also compatible with fixation and immunostaining of the cancer tissue.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&#933;&#8208;Glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) is overexpressed in several types of cancer. Existing GGT&#8208;targeting fluorescence probes can image these cancers, but the fluorescent hydrolysis product leaks from the target cancer cells during prolonged incubation or fixation. Here, we present a functionalized fluorescence probe for GGT, 4&#8208;CH  2  F&#8208;HMDiEtR&#8208;gGlu, which is designed to &#160;generate an azaquinone methide intermediate during activation by GGT; this intermediate reacts with intracellular nucleophiles to generate a fluorescent adduct that is trapped inside the cells, without loss of the target enzyme activity. Application of the probe to patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) mice enabled in vivo cancer imaging for a prolonged period, and was also compatible with fixation and immunostaining of the cancer tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>17.1%&#8208;Efficient Eco&#8208;Compatible Organic Solar Cells from a
Dissymmetric 3D Network Acceptor</title>
      <dc:description>To elevate the perf&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;ormance of polymer solar cells (PSC) processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents, a dissymmetric fused&#8208;ring acceptor BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 with chlorine and trifluoromethyl end groups has been designed and synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallographic data suggests that BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 has a 3D network packing structure as a result of synergistic H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregations between adjacent molecules, which will strengthen its charge transport as an acceptor material. When PBDB&#8208;TF was used as a donor, the toluene&#8208;processed binary device realized a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.31%, which was further improved to 17.12% when PC71ThBM was added as the third component. An efficiency of over 17% is currently the highest record among polymer solar cells processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents. Compared to its symmetric counterparts BTIC&#8208;4Cl and BTIC&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#947;, the dissymmetric BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 integrates their merits, having further optimized the molecular aggregations with excellent storage and photo&#8208;stability, and also extending the maximum absorption peak in film to 852 nm. As a low band&#8208;gap acceptor with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption, the BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3&#8208;based semitransparent PSCs (ST&#8208;PSCs) with 24.45% average transmittance (AVT) yields a high PCE of 13.06% from same halogen&#8208;free solvent. The devices exhibit good transparency from the outdoor image through the ST&#8208;PSCs, indicating a promising utilization potential of semitransparent building integrated photovoltaics (ST&#8208;BIPV). This study demonstrates that the collaborative application of chlorination and trifluoromethylation is a practical approach to promote evolution of a low band&#8208;gap acceptor for eco&#8208;compatible processed and efficient photovoltaic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrosulfonylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes with Sulfonyl Hydrazides</title>
      <dc:description>A highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective hydrosulfonylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with sulfonyl hydrazides has been realized by using palladium catalyst containing monodentate chiral spiro phosphoramidite ligand. The reaction provided efficient approach to the synthetically useful chiral allylic sulfones. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a formation of allyl hydrazine intermediate and subsequent rearrangement to the chiral allylic sulfone product. The transformation of the allyl hydrazine intermediate to the product is enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

      <title>Evidence of phenolic pool as a key intermediate for zeolite&#8208;catalyzed lignin pyrolysis</title>
      <dc:description>Phenolic pool is considered to be an important intermediate during&#160;catalytic conversion of biomass. However, no direct evidence has been reported on its full picture in molecular level, due to the huge challenges in probing the reactive and low volatile phenolic oligomers with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies. Herein, we reported online detection and structural identification of phenolic pool by utilizing an in situ atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry, demonstrating that the phenolic pool is formed through monomers' repolymerization with an equidistant grouped pattern, and acts as a key mechanistic step for both valuable aromatic products and undesired coke. The exploration of the real reactive species is also of great importance for the rational design and synthesis of advanced catalysts with high activity.</dc:description>
