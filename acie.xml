         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized DNA Circuit to Establish an Artificial Interaction between T Cells and Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nongenetic strategies that enable control over the cell&#8208;cell interaction network would be highly desired, particularly in T cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. In this work, we developed an aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA circuit to modulate the interaction between T cells and cancer cells. This DNA circuit was composed of recognition&#8208;then&#8208;triggering and aggregation&#8208;then&#8208;activation modules. Upon recognizing target cancer cells, the triggering strand was released to induce aggregation of immune receptors on the T cell surface, leading to an enhancement of T cell activity for effective cancer eradication. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of this DNA circuit for promoting target cancer cell&#8208;directed stimulation of T cells, which, consequently, enhanced their killing effect on cancer cells. This DNA circuit, as a modular strategy to modulate intercellular interactions, could lead to a new paradigm for the development of nongenetic T cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrochemical Activation of Hydroxyl Polymer Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The slow reaction kinetics and structural instability of organic electrode materials limit the further performance improvement of aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries. Herein, we have synthesized a Z&#8208;folded hydroxyl polymer polytetrafluorohydroquinone (PTFHQ) with inert hydroxyl groups that could be partially oxidized to the active carbonyl groups through the in&#8208;situ activation process and then undertake the storage/release of Zn2+. In the activated PTFHQ, the hydroxyl groups and S atoms enlarge the electronegativity region near the electrochemically active carbonyl groups, enhancing their electrochemical activity. Simultaneously, the residual hydroxyl groups could act as hydrophilic groups to enhance the electrolyte wettability while ensuring the stability of the polymer chain in the electrolyte. Also, the Z&#8208;folded structure of PTFHQ plays an important role in reversible binding with Zn2+ and fast ion diffusion. All these benefits make the activated PTFHQ exhibit a high specific capacity of 215 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1, over 3400 stable cycles with a capacity retention of 92%, and an outstanding rate capability of 196 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 A g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Aided Thermoelectric Energy Conversion and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;grade heat is ubiquitous in the environment and its thermoelectric conversion by the ionic conductors remains a challenge because of the low efficiency and poor sustainability. Here we demonstrate that the thermoelectric performances can be boosted by combining the Soret effect of protons and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction of benzoquinone and hydroquinone in hydrogels. An overall enhancement of thermopower (25.9 mV K&#8208;1), power factor (5 mW m&#8208;1 K&#8208;2), figure of merit (&gt;2.4) and continuity of power output is achieved. Moreover, an energy&#8208;storage function can be achieved by the redox couple, and a retained power output of 27.7%, or 14 mW m&#8208;2 for more than 3 hours is obtained by the re&#8208;balance of PCET reactants in the hydrogel after the removal of the temperature gradient.</dc:description>

         <title>Extension of Nonalternant Nanographenes Containing Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Stone&#8208;Thrower&#8208;Wales Defect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonalternant topologies have attracted considerable attention due to their unique physiochemical characteristics in recent years. Here, three novel topological nanographenes molecular models of nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped Stone&#8208;Thrower&#8208;Wales (S&#8210;T&#8210;W) defect were achieved through direct arylation. Their chemical structures were unambiguously elucidated by single crystal analysis. Among them, threefold intramolecular direct arylation compound (C42H21N) is the largest nanographene bearing a N&#8208;doped nonalternant topology to date, in which the non&#8208;benzenoid rings account for 83% of the total molecular skeleton. The absorption maxima of this compound was located in the near&#8208;infrared region with a long tail up to 900 nm, which was much longer than those reported for similarly sized N&#8208;doped nanographene with six&#8208;membered rings (C40H15N). In addition, the electronic energy gaps of these series compounds obviously decreased with the introduction of nonalternant topologies (from 2.27 eV to 1.50 eV). It is noteworthy that C42H21N possesses such a low energy gap (Egopt = 1.40 eV; Egcv = 1.50 eV), yet is highly stable under ambient conditions. Our work reported herein demonstrates that the nonalternant topology could significantly influence the electronic configurations of nanocarbons, where the introduction of a nonalternanting topology may be an effective way to narrow the energy gap without extending the molecular &#960;&#8208;conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding and Acidity of the Formal Hydride in the Prototypical Au9(PPh3)82+&#160;Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of hydrogen atoms as surface ligands on metal nanoclusters is of profound importance but remains difficult to directly study.&#160; While hydrogen atoms often appear to be incorporated formally as hydrides, evidence suggests that they donate electrons to the cluster's delocalized superatomic orbitals and may consequently behave as acidic protons that play key roles in synthetic or catalytic mechanisms.&#160; Here we directly test this assertion for the prototypical Au9(PPh3)8H2+&#160;nanocluster, formed by addition of a hydride to the well&#8208;characterized Au9(PPh3)83+.&#160; Using gas&#8208;phase infrared spectroscopy, we were able to unambiguously isolate Au9(PPh3)8H2+ and Au9(PPh3)8D2+, revealing an Au&#8208;H stretching mode at 1528 cm&#8208;1&#160;that shifts to 1038 cm&#8208;1&#160;upon deuteration. This shift is greater than the maximum expected for a typical harmonic potential, suggesting a potential governing cluster&#8208;H bonding that has square&#8208;well character consistent with the hydrogen nucleus behaving as a metal atom in the cluster core.&#160; Complexing this cluster with very weak bases reveals a redshift of 39 cm&#8208;1&#160;in the Au&#8208;H vibration, consistent with those typically seen for moderately acidic groups in gas phase molecules and providing an estimate of the acidity of Au9(PPh3)8H2+, at least with regard to its surface reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and Stabilization of a Dinickel Catalyst in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although many monometallic active sties have been installed in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for catalytic reactions, there are no effective strategies to generate bimetallic catalysts in MOFs. Here we report the synthesis of a robust, efficient, and reusable MOF catalyst, MOF&#8208;NiH, by adaptively generating and stabilizing dinickel active sites using the bipyridine groups in MOF&#8208;253 with the formula of Al(OH)(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) for Z&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes and selective hydrogenation of C=C bonds in &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. Spectroscopic studies established the dinickel complex (bpy&#8729;&#8208;)NiII(&#956;2&#8208;H)2NiII(bpy&#8729;&#8208;) as the active catalyst. MOF&#8208;NiH efficiently catalyzed selective hydrogenation reactions with turnover numbers of up to 192 and could be used in five cycles of hydrogenation reactions without catalyst leaching or significant decrease of catalytic activities. The present work uncovers a synthetic strategy toward solution&#8208;inaccessible Earth&#8208;abundant bimetallic MOF catalysts for sustainable catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Amine Synthesis via Iterative Boron Homologation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The value of Matteson&#8208;type reactions has been increasingly recognized for developing automated organic synthesis. However, the typical Matteson reactions almost exclusively focus on homologation of carbon units. Here, we report the detailed development of sequential insertion of nitrogen and carbon atoms into boronate C&#8722;B bonds, which provides a modular and iterative approach to access functionalized tertiary amines. A new class of nitrenoid reagents is uncovered to allow direct formation of aminoboranes from aryl or alkyl boronates via N&#8208;insertion. The one&#8208;pot N&#8208;insertion followed by controlled mono&#8208; or double&#8208;carbenoid insertion has been realized with widely available aryl boronates. The resulting aminoalkyl boronate products can undergo further homologation and various other transformations. Preliminary success on homologation of N,N&#8208;dialkylaminoboranes and sequential N&#8208; and C&#8208;insertions with alkyl boronates have also been achieved. To broaden the synthetic utility, selective removal of a benzyl or aryl substituent permits access to secondary or primary amine products. The application of this method has been demonstrated in the modular synthesis of bioactive compounds&#160;and the programmable construction of diamines and aminoethers. A plausible reaction mechanism, supported by preliminary NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and computational studies, is also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Superiority of Nonbenzenoid Acepleiadylene as a Building Block for Organic Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acepleiadylene (APD), a nonbenzenoid isomer of pyrene, exhibits a unique charge&#8208;separated character with a large molecular dipole and a small optical gap. However, APD has never been explored in optoelectronic materials to take advantage of these appealing properties. Here, we employ APD as a building block in organic semiconducting materials for the first time, and unravel the superiority of nonbenzenoid APD in electronic applications. We have synthesized an APD derivative (APD&#8208;IID) with APD as the terminal donor moieties and isoindigo (IID) as the acceptor core. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that APD&#8208;IID has an obvious charge&#8208;separated structure and enhanced intermolecular interactions as compared with its pyrene&#8208;based isomers. As a result, APD&#8208;IID displays significantly higher hole mobilities than that of the pyrene&#8208;based counterparts. These results imply the advantages of employing APD in semiconducting materials and great potential of nonbenzenoid polycyclic arenes for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Hypervalent Iodine Reagent Chimeras: Enabling Peptide Functionalization and Macrocyclization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of highly reactive hypervalent iodine reagents&#8212;ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs)&#8212;onto peptides is described. These peptide&#8208;EBX chimeras can be used as versatile handles for peptide/protein modifications and peptide macrocyclization under mild photocatalytic conditions. The method was used to access new inhibitors of the Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 interaction.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel strategy for the modification of peptides based on the introduction of highly reactive hypervalent iodine reagents&#8212;ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs)&#8212;onto peptides. These peptide&#8208;EBXs can be readily accessed, by both solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). They can be used to couple the peptide to other peptides or a protein through reaction with Cys, leading to thioalkynes in organic solvents and hypervalent iodine adducts in water buffer. Furthermore, a photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling to the C&#8208;terminus of peptides was developed using an organic dye and was also successful in an intramolecular fashion, leading to macrocyclic peptides with unprecedented crosslinking. A rigid linear aryl alkyne linker was essential to achieve high affinity for Keap1 at the Nrf2 binding site with potential protein&#8208;protein interaction inhibition.

         <title>Ru&#8722;FeNi Alloy Heterojunctions on Lignin&#8208;derived Carbon as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a nove lignin&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;supported Ru&#8722;FeNi@NLC heterojunction catalyst for water electrolysis was proposed. The synergistic interaction between the heterogeneous structure and the lignin&#8208;derived carbon layer produced a total water decomposition interface adjustment of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.48&#8197;V, which reduced the energy barrier and improved the reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
Rational design of efficient, stable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is a key challenge to realize green hydrogen production via electrolytic water splitting. Herein, Ru nanoparticles and FeNi alloy heterojunction catalyst (Ru&#8722;FeNi@NLC) encapsulated via lignin&#8208;derived carbon was prepared by self&#8208;assembly precipitation and in situ pyrolysis. The designed catalyst displays excellent performance at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with low overpotentials of 36&#8197;mV for HER and 198&#8197;mV for OER, and only needs 1.48&#8197;V for overall water splitting. Results and DFT calculations show the unique N&#8208;doped lignin&#8208;derived carbon layer and Ru&#8722;FeNi heterojunction contribute to optimized electronic structure for enhancing electron transfer, balanced free energy of reactants and intermediates in the sorption/desorption process, and significantly reduced reaction energy barrier for the HER and OER rate&#8208;determining steps, thus improved reaction kinetics. This work provides a new in situ pyrolysis doping strategy based on renewable biomass for the construction of highly active, stable and cost&#8208;effective catalysts.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Driven Assembly of a Penta&#8208;Shell Keplerate Cuprofullerene for Metallofullerene Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Icosahedral penta&#8208;shell Keplerate cuprofullerene chloride, C60@Cu24@Cl44@Cu12@Cl12, have been successfully assembled, templated by a C60 molecule through [&#951;2&#8208;(C=C)]&#8722;CuI and CuI&#8722;Cl coordination bonds canopied with 24 Cu, 44 Cl, 12 Cu and 12 Cl atoms layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer.

Abstract
Two metallofullerene frameworks (MFFs) constructed from a penta&#8208;shell Keplerate cuprofullerene chloride, C60@Cu24@Cl44@Cu12@Cl12, have been successfully prepared via a C60&#8208;templated symmetry&#8208;driven strategy. The icosahedral cuprofullerene chloride is assembled on a C60 molecule through [&#951;2&#8208;(C=C)]&#8722;CuI and CuI&#8722;Cl coordination bonds, resulting in the penta&#8208;shell Keplerate with the C60 core canopied by 24 Cu, 44 Cl, 12 Cu and 12 Cl atoms that fulfill the tic@rco@oae@ico@ico penta&#8208;shell polyhedral configuration. By sharing the outmost&#8208;shell Cl atoms, the cuprofullerene chlorides are connected into 2D or 3D (snf net) frameworks. TD&#8208;DFT calculations reveal that the charge transfer from the outmost CuI and Cl to C60 core is responsible for their light absorption expansion to near&#8208;infrared region, implying anionic halogenation may be an effective strategy to tune the light absorption properties of metallofullerene materials.

         <title>An Efficient Direct Arylation Polycondensation via C&#8722;S Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pd and Cu co&#8208;catalyzed DArP was developed via inert C&#8722;S bond cleavage of aryl thioethers. Moreover, the mechanism studies highlighted the important role of palladium (Pd) and copper (Cu) co&#8208;catalysis. Of note, CPs synthesized in this method possessed low trap densities, high Mns and charge transport mobility, signifying an excellent choice for synthesizing high performance CPs.







Abstract
The direct arylation polycondensation (DArP) has become one of the most important methods to construct conjugated polymers (CPs). However, the homocoupling side&#8208;reactions of aryl halides and the low regioseletive reactivities of unfunctionalized aryls hinder the development of DArP. Here, an efficient Pd and Cu co&#8208;catalyzed DArP was developed via inert C&#8722;S bond cleavage of aryl thioethers, of which robustness was exemplified by over twenty conjugated polymers (CPs), including copolymers, homopolymers, and random polymers. The capture of oxidative addition intermediate together with experimental and theoretic results suggested the important role of palladium (Pd) and copper (Cu) co&#8208;catalysis with a bicyclic mechanism. The studies of NMR, molecular weights, trap densities, two&#8208;dimensional grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (2D&#8208;GIWAXS), and the charge transport mobilities revealed that the homocoupling reactions were significantly suppressed with high regioselectivity of unfunctionalized aryls, suggesting this method is an excellent choice for synthesizing high performance CPs.

         <title>Fast Modulation of d&#8208;Band Holes Quantity in the Early Reaction Stages for Boosting Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of high&#8208;loading iridium single atom catalysts with tunable d&#8208;band holes character during the reaction process was designed as an efficient OER catalyst in acidic solutions. The in situ modulated d&#8208;band holes and near&#8208;steady XO*&#8722;Ir&#8722;N4 moieties at early working voltages are responsible for the observed high activity and stability.







Abstract
Synthesis of highly active and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts applied in acidic water electrolysis remains a grand challenge. Here, we construct a type of high&#8208;loading iridium single atom catalysts with tunable d&#8208;band holes character (h&#8208;HL&#8722;Ir SACs, &#8764;17.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% Ir) realized in the early OER operation stages. The in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that the quantity of the d&#8208;band holes of Ir active sites can be fast increased by 0.56 unit from the open circuit to a low working potential of 1.35&#8197;V. More remarkably, in situ synchrotron infrared and Raman spectroscopies demonstrate the quick accumulation of *OOH and *OH intermediates over holes&#8208;modulated Ir sites in the early reaction voltages, achieving a rapid OER kinetics. As a result, this well&#8208;designed h&#8208;HL&#8722;Ir SACs exhibits superior performance for acidic OER with overpotentials of 216&#8197;mV @10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 259&#8197;mV @100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, corresponding to a small Tafel slope of 43&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The activity of catalyst shows no evident attenuation after 60&#8197;h operation in acidic environment. This work provides some useful hints for the design of superior acidic OER catalysts.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis with 63.5&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and 100&#8201;% N&#8208;Selectivity via One&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrogen is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the one&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling via direct insertion of CO into N2 molecules is the internal cause for the &#8764;100&#8201;% N&#8208;selectivity to urea.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic urea synthesis via coupling N2 and CO2 provides an effective route to mitigate energy crisis and close carbon footprint. However, the difficulty on breaking N&#8801;N is the main reason that caused low efficiencies for both electrocatalytic NH3 and urea synthesis, which is the bottleneck restricting their industrial applications. Herein, a new mechanism to overcome the inert of the nitrogen molecule was proposed by elongating N&#8801;N instead of breaking N&#8801;N to realize one&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling in the process for urea production. We constructed a Zn&#8722;Mn diatomic catalyst with axial chloride coordination, Zn&#8722;Mn sites display high tolerance to CO poisoning and the Faradaic efficiency can even be increased to 63.5&#8201;%, which is the highest value that has ever been reported. More importantly, negligible N&#8801;N bond breakage effectively avoids the generation of ammonia as intermediates, therefore, the N&#8208;selectivity in the co&#8208;electrocatalytic system reaches100&#8201;% for urea synthesis. The previous cognition that electrocatalysts for urea synthesis must possess ammonia synthesis activity has been broken. Isotope&#8208;labelled measurements and Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validate that activation of N&#8722;N triple bond and nitrogen fixation activity arise from the one&#8208;step C&#8722;N coupling process of CO species with adsorbed N2 molecules.

         <title>Do Corroles Stabilize Tetravalent Antimony?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable ligand radical instead of an antimony(IV) species forms upon the oxidation of antimony(III)corroles in the absence of hard donor ligands. EPR investigations reveal a strong coupling of the unpaired electron to the 121Sb and 123Sb nuclei due to a small 5&#8197;s orbital contribution of the SOMO. The compound undergoes a redox disproportionation in the presence of water which can be applied to prepare the elusive hydroxo antimony(V)corrole.







Abstract
Antimony corrole cations have been prepared by one&#8208;electron oxidation of antimony(III) congeners with silver(I) and copper(II) salts. Isolation and crystallization was successful for the first time, and the X&#8208;ray crystallographic investigation unraveled structural similarities with antimony(III)corroles. EPR experiments showed strong hyperfine interactions of the unpaired electron with the 121Sb (I=5/2) and 123Sb nuclei (I=7/2). A DFT analysis supports the description of the oxidized form as a SbIII corrole radical with less than 2&#8201;% SbIV character. In the presence of water or a fluoride source like PF6&#8722;, the compounds undergo a redox disproportionation to yield known antimony(III)corroles and either difluorido&#8208;antimony(V)corroles, or bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxido&#8208;di[antimony(V)corroles] via novel cationic hydroxo&#8208;antimony(V) derivatives.

         <title>Photosynthesis&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Biomineralization of Gold Nanoparticles inside Chlorella Cells towards Hydrogen Boosting under Green Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosynthesis&#8208;mediated biomineralization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inside Chlorella cells preferentially around the thylakoid membrane domain was achieved. The electrons generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance of the biomineralized AuNPs could augment hypoxic photosynthesis, which gives rise to an 8.3&#8208;fold enhancement of hydrogen production under 560&#8197;nm light irradiation.







Abstract
Engineering living microorganisms to enhance green biomanufacturing for the development of sustainable and carbon&#8208;neutral energy strategies has attracted the interest of researchers from a wide range of scientific communities. In this study, we develop a method to achieve photosynthesis&#8208;mediated biomineralization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inside Chlorella cells, where the photosynthesis&#8208;dominated reduction of Au3+ to Au0 allows the formed AuNPs to locate preferentially around the thylakoid membrane domain.

&lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis-mediated biomineralization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inside &lt;i&gt;Chlorella&lt;/i&gt; cells preferentially around the thylakoid membrane domain was achieved. The electrons generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance of the biomineralized AuNPs could augment hypoxic photosynthesis, which gives rise to an 8.3-fold enhancement of hydrogen production under 560&#8197;nm light irradiation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering living microorganisms to enhance green biomanufacturing for the development of sustainable and carbon-neutral energy strategies has attracted the interest of researchers from a wide range of scientific communities. In this study, we develop a method to achieve photosynthesis-mediated biomineralization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) inside &lt;i&gt;Chlorella&lt;/i&gt; cells, where the photosynthesis-dominated reduction of Au&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Au&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; allows the formed AuNPs to locate preferentially around the thylakoid membrane domain. In particular, we reveal that the electrons generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs could greatly augment hypoxic photosynthesis, which then promotes the generation and transferring of photoelectrons throughout the photosynthetic chain for augmented hydrogen production under sunlight. We demonstrate that the electrons from AuNPs could be directly transferred to hydrogenase, giving rise to an 8.3-fold enhancement of &lt;i&gt;Chlorella&lt;/i&gt; cells hydrogen production independent of the cellular photosynthetic process under monochromatic 560&#8197;nm light irradiation. Overall, the photosynthesis-mediated intracellular biomineralization of AuNPs could contribute to a novel paradigm for functionalizing &lt;i&gt;Chlorella&lt;/i&gt; cells to augment biomanufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Enhanced Chemical&#8208;Vapor&#8208;Deposition Synthesis of Photoredox&#8208;Active Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon from NH3 and CH4 Gases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NH3 and CH4 gases were applied as precursors to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC) photocatalysts. Without any co&#8208;catalysts, the NDC was demonstrated to drive photoredox reactions, and active sites on the NDC have been investigated. Because in the Archean era, the atmosphere of Earth was filled with NH3 and CH4 gases, this study is important to understand the evolution of biomolecules in the Earth by photochemistry.







Abstract
Earth's primordial atmosphere was rich in ammonia and methane. To understand the evolution of the atmosphere, these two gases were used to make photoredox&#8208;active nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). Photocatalysts such as NDC might play an important role in the development of geological and atmospheric chemistry during the Archean era. This study describes the synthesis of NDC directly from NH3 and CH4 gases. The photocatalyst product can be used to selectively synthesize imines by photo&#8208;oxidization of amines, producing H2O2 simultaneously in the photoreduction reaction. Our findings shed light on the chemical evolution of the Earth.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalysis in Living Cells: Progress, Challenges, and Novel Supramolecular Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal catalysis is a powerful tool in synthetic chemistry; however, it has yet to reach its full potential in living cells. The hostile environment of cells towards metal complexes means that new strategies need to be developed to overcome poor reactivity.







Abstract
The importance of transition metal catalysis is exemplified by its wide range of applications, for example in the synthesis of chemicals, natural products, and pharmaceuticals. However, one relatively new application is for carrying out new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions inside living cells. The complex environment of a living cell is not welcoming to transition metal catalysts, as a diverse range of biological components have the potential to inhibit or deactivate the catalyst. Here we review the current progress in the field of transition metal catalysis, and evaluation of catalysis efficiency in living cells and under biological (relevant) conditions. Catalyst poisoning is a ubiquitous problem in this field, and we propose that future research into the development of physical and kinetic protection strategies may provide a route to improve the reactivity of catalysts in cells.

         <title>Circumpentacene with Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Diradical Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable circumpentacene derivative was successfully synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. X&#8208;ray analysis, NMR and theoretical calculations revealed that it shows an open&#8208;shell diradical character and a dominant local aromatic character. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion were also studied.







Abstract
Circumacenes (CAs) are a distinctive type of benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons where an acene unit is completely enclosed by a layer of outer fused benzene rings. Despite their unique structures, the synthesis of CAs is challenging, and until recently, the largest CA molecule synthesized was circumanthracene. In this study, we report the successful synthesis of an extended circumpentacene derivative 1, which represents the largest CA molecule synthesized to date. Its structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and its electronic properties were systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. It shows a unique open&#8208;shell diradical character due to the existence of extended zigzag edges, with a moderate diradical character index (y0=39.7&#8201;%) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;ES&#8208;T=&#8722;4.47&#8197;kcal/mol). It exhibits a dominant local aromatic character with &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalized in the individual aromatic sextet rings. It has a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and displays amphoteric redox behavior. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion can be considered as doubly charged structures in which two coronene units are fused with a central aromatic benzene ring. This study provides a new route toward stable multizigzag&#8208;edged graphene&#8208;like molecules with open&#8208;shell di/polyradical character.

         <title>Cu Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Selectivity Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;Atom catalysts are used as selective catalysts for acetylene hydrogenation. The adsorption of acetylene and ethylene intermediates on the active site can be weakened by separating the continuous active sites into single sites, thereby increasing the energy barrier of overhydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling, and inhibiting side reactions.







Abstract
The site isolation strategy has been employed in thermal catalytic acetylene semihydrogenation to inhibit overhydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling. However, there is a dearth of analogous investigations in electrocatalytic systems. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) simulations demonstrate that isolated Cu metal sites have higher energy barriers on overhydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling. Following this result, we develop Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts highly dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix, which exhibit high ethylene selectivity (&gt;80&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for ethylene, &lt;1&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for C4, and no ethane) at high concentrations of acetylene. The superior performance observed in the electrocatalytic selective hydrogenation of acetylene can be attributed to the weak adsorption of ethylene intermediates and highly energy barriers on C&#8722;C coupling at isolated sites, as confirmed by both DFT calculations and experimental results. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the isolated sites inhibiting the side reactions of electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation.

         <title>Palladium and Ruthenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Sites on Porous Ionic Polymers for Acetylene Dialkoxycarbonylation: Synergetic Effects Stabilize the Active Site and Increase CO Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous Pd1&#8722;Ru1 dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms catalyst supported on porous ionic polymers was fabricated via a wet impregnation method and applied in acetylene dialkoxycarbonylation. The molecular structure of the Pd1&#8722;Ru1 catalyst was determined to be [P]+&#8722;[PdI3&#8722;I&#8722;RuCl2(CO)3]&#8722;, with a synergetic effect between the neighboring Pd1 and Ru1 single sites elevating the overall activity and stabilizing the active site.







Abstract
Heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts usually suffer from poor stability, thereby limiting industrial applications. Dual Pd1&#8722;Ru1 single&#8208;atom&#8208;sites supported on porous ionic polymers (Pd1&#8722;Ru1/PIPs) were constructed using a wetness impregnation method. The two isolated metal species in the form of a binuclear complex were immobilized on the cationic framework of PIPs through ionic bonds. Compared to the single Pd&#8208; or Ru&#8208;site catalyst, the dual single&#8208;atom system exhibits higher activity with 98&#8201;% acetylene conversion and near 100&#8201;% selectivity to dialkoxycarbonylation products, as well as better cycling stability for ten cycles without obvious decay. Based on DFT calculations, it was found that the single&#8208;Ru site exhibited a strong CO adsorption energy of &#8722;1.6&#8197;eV, leading to an increase in the local CO concentration of the catalyst. Notably, the Pd1&#8722;Ru1/PIPs catalyst had a much lower energy barrier of 2.49&#8197;eV compared to 3.87&#8197;eV of Pd1/PIPs for the rate&#8208;determining step. The synergetic effect between neighboring single sites Pd1 and Ru1 not only enhanced the overall activity, but also stabilized PdII active sites. The discovery of synergetic effects between single sites can deepen our understanding of single&#8208;site catalysts at the molecular level.

&lt;p&gt;A heterogeneous Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dual-single-atoms catalyst supported on porous ionic polymers was fabricated via a wet impregnation method and applied in acetylene dialkoxycarbonylation. The molecular structure of the Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst was determined to be [P]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;[PdI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;I&#8722;RuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, with a synergetic effect between the neighboring Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; single sites elevating the overall activity and stabilizing the active site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous single-metal-site catalysts usually suffer from poor stability, thereby limiting industrial applications. Dual Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom-sites supported on porous ionic polymers (Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/PIPs) were constructed using a wetness impregnation method. The two isolated metal species in the form of a binuclear complex were immobilized on the cationic framework of PIPs through ionic bonds. Compared to the single Pd- or Ru-site catalyst, the dual single-atom system exhibits higher activity with 98&#8201;% acetylene conversion and near 100&#8201;% selectivity to dialkoxycarbonylation products, as well as better cycling stability for ten cycles without obvious decay. Based on DFT calculations, it was found that the single-Ru site exhibited a strong CO adsorption energy of &#8722;1.6&#8197;eV, leading to an increase in the local CO concentration of the catalyst. Notably, the Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/PIPs catalyst had a much lower energy barrier of 2.49&#8197;eV compared to 3.87&#8197;eV of Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/PIPs for the rate-determining step. The synergetic effect between neighboring single sites Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; not only enhanced the overall activity, but also stabilized Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; active sites. The discovery of synergetic effects between single sites can deepen our understanding of single-site catalysts at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights into Anion&#8208;Solvent Interactions to Boost Stable Operation of Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes in Pure&#8208;SiOx||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 Full Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion&#8208;solvent interactions in Li&#8208;ion batteries were promoted in ether&#8208;based electrolyte by applying the small&#8208;anion&#8208;size LiNO3 and tetrahydrofuran with high dipole moment to dielectric constant ratio. The designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte showed optimized interphasial stability on the pure&#8208;SiOx anode and NMC811 cathode, thus enabling stable cycling performance of the pure&#8208;SiOx||NMC811 full cell over 500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Ether solvents with superior reductive stability promise excellent interphasial stability with high&#8208;capacity anodes while the limited oxidative resistance hinders their high&#8208;voltage operation. Extending the intrinsic electrochemical stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes to construct stable&#8208;cycling high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries is challenging but rewarding. Herein, the anion&#8208;solvent interactions were concerned as the key point to optimize the anodic stability of the ether&#8208;based electrolytes and an optimized interphase was realized on both pure&#8208;SiOx anodes and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes. Specifically, the small&#8208;anion&#8208;size LiNO3 and tetrahydrofuran with high dipole moment to dielectric constant ratio realized strengthened anion&#8208;solvent interactions, which enhance the oxidative stability of the electrolyte. The designed ether&#8208;based electrolyte enabled a stable cycling performance over 500&#8197;cycles in pure&#8208;SiOx||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell, demonstrating its superior practical prospects. This work provides new insight into the design of new electrolytes for emerging high&#8208;energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries through the regulation of interactions between species in electrolytes.

         <title>Tinkering with Mechanochemical Tools for Scale Up</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry is an environmentally benign approach to chemical processes, which has steadily gained momentum at both laboratory and preparative scales. However, mechanochemical methods are still in their infancy compared to conventional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Our Minireview highlights a series of scaled&#8208;up mechanochemical processes that aim to encourage further developments in implementing mechanochemistry for commercial and industrial use.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry provides an environmentally benign platform to develop more sustainable chemical processes by limiting raw materials, energy use, and waste generation while using physically smaller equipment. A continuously growing research community has steadily showcased examples of beneficial mechanochemistry applications at both the laboratory and the preparative scale. In contrast to solution&#8208;based chemistry, mechanochemical processes have not yet been standardized, and thus scaling up is still a nascent discipline. The purpose of this Minireview is to highlight similarities, differences and challenges of the various approaches that have been successfully applied for a range of chemical applications at various scales. We hope to provide a discussion starting point for those interested in further developing mechanochemical processes for commercial use and/or industrialisation.

         <title>Sustainable and High&#8208;Rate Electrosynthesis of Nitrogen Fertilizer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrosynthesis emerges as an appealing sustainable route to converting greenhouse gas (CO2) and waste nitrates by renewable energies into value&#8208;added fertilizers. We demonstrate an organic Cu&#8208;based salphen complex as an economic catalyst for efficient production of urea and ammonia. The improved performance by tuning functionalization of molecules provides an efficient and simple strategy for design of future electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The conventional industrial production of nitrogen&#8208;containing fertilizers, such as urea and ammonia, relies heavily on energy&#8208;intensive processes, accounting for approximately 3&#8201;% of global annual CO2 emissions. Herein, we report a sustainable electrocatalytic approach that realizes direct and selective synthesis of urea and ammonia from co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and nitrates under ambient conditions. With the assistance of a copper (Cu)&#8208;based salphen organic catalyst, outstanding urea (3.64&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1) and ammonia (9.73&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1) yield rates are achieved, in addition to a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 57.9&#177;3&#8201;% for the former. This work proposes an appealing sustainable route to converting greenhouse gas and waste nitrates by renewable energies into value&#8208;added fertilizers.

         <title>Size&#8208; and Emission&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Full&#8208;Color Luminescent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Tryptophan Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nanoscaled luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (nano&#8208;LMOFs) with organic linker&#8208;based emission to explore their applications in sensing, bioimaging and photocatalysis is of great interest as material size and emission wavelength both have remarkable influence on their performances. However, there is lack of platforms that can systematically tune the emission and size of nano&#8208;LMOFs with customized linker design. Herein two series of fcu&#8208; and csq&#8208;type nano&#8208;LMOFs, with precise size control in a broad range and emission colors from blue to near&#8208;infrared, were prepared using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative based ditopic&#8208; and tetratopic carboxylic acids as the emission sources. The modification of tetratopic carboxylic acids using OH and NH2 as the substituent groups not only induces significant emission bathochromic shift of the resultant MOFs, but also endows interesting features for their potential applications. As one example, we show that the non&#8208;substituted and NH2&#8208;substituted nano&#8208;LMOFs exhibit turn&#8208;off and turn&#8208;on responses for highly selective and sensitive detection of tryptophan over other nineteen natural amino acids. This work sheds light on the rational construction of nano&#8208;LMOFs with specific emission behaviours and sizes, which will undoubtedly facilitate their applications in related areas.</dc:description>

Complementary approaches to measuring the temperature aiming to enhance the thermal sensitivity would however represent a decisive step forward. For the first time, we demonstrate the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that luminescence thermometry could be associated with a complementary temperature readout related to a different property. Namely, we propose to take advantage of the temperature dependence of both magnetic (canonical susceptibility and relaxation time) and luminescence features (emission intensity) found in Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets (SMM) to develop original dual magneto&#8208;optical molecular thermometers allowing to overcome the contradiction between high&#8208;performance SMM and Boltzmann&#8208;type luminescence thermometry. We highlight this integrative approach to concurrent luminescent and magnetic thermometry using an air&#8208;stable benchmark SMM [Dy(bbpen)Cl] (H2bbpen = N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxybenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)ethyl&#8208;enediamine)) exhibiting Dy3+ luminescence. The synergy between multiparametric magneto&#8208;optical readouts and multiple linear regression makes possible a 10&#8208;fold improvement in the relative thermal sensitivity of the thermometers over the whole temperature range, compared with the values obtained with the single optical or magnetic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Enhancement of Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Catalyzed by Cobalt Porphyrin Organic Cages for Ammonia Electrosynthesis in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#713;) reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia (NH3) represents a sustainable approach for denitrification to balance global nitrogen cycles and an alternative to traditional thermal Haber&#8208;Bosch processes. Here, we present a supramolecular strategy for promoting NH3 production in water from NO3RR by integrating two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular cobalt porphyrin (CoTPP) units into a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous organic cage architecture. The porphyrin box CoPB&#8208;C8 enhances electrochemical active site exposure, facilitates substrate&#8208;catalyst interactions, and improves catalyst stability, leading to turnover numbers and frequencies for NH3 production exceeding 200,000 and 56 s&#8208;1, respectively. These values represent a 15&#8208;fold increase in NO3RR activity and 200&#8208;mV improvement in overpotential for the 3D CoPB&#8208;C8 box structure compared to its 2D CoTPP counterpart. Synthetic tuning of peripheral alkyl substituents highlights the importance of supramolecular porosity and cavity size on electrochemical NO3RR activity. These findings establish the incorporation of 2D molecular units into 3D confined space microenvironments as an effective supramolecular design strategy for enhancing electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions Enforce Conformation in Switchable and Water&#8208;Soluble Diketopiperazine&#8208;Pyridine Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To reach their potential as mimics of the dynamic molecules present in biological systems, foldamers must be designed to display stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior. Here we report such a foldamer architecture based on alternating pyridine&#8208;diketopiperazine linkers. Epimerization is conveniently prevented through a copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling protocol. The compounds&#8217; native unswitched conformation is first discovered in the solid and solution state. The foldamers can be solubilized in DMSO and pH 9.5 buffer, retaining conformational control to a large degree. Lastly, dynamic switching is demonstrated through treatment with acid, leading to behaviour we describe as stimulus&#8208;responsive sidechain reconfiguration.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions Catalyzed by Diboronate Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of easily synthesized, air and moisture stable compounds called bispyrrolidine diboronates (BPDB) is reported. Under Lewis acid activation, they can catalyze highly exo&#8208;selective and enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. For diactivated dienophiles, BPDB can also selectively activate one of the two carbonyl groups based on steric effect, resulting in highly regioselective asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective catalytic system for exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions was developed based on the newly discovered bispyrrolidine diboronates (BPDB). Activated by various Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids, BPDB can catalyze highly stereoselective asymmetric exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of monocarbonyl&#8208;based dienophiles. When 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl&#8208;based dienophiles are used, the catalyst can sterically distinguish between the two binding sites, which leads to highly regioselective asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. BPDB can be prepared as crystalline solids on a large scale and are stable under ambient condition. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the structure for acid&#8208;activated BPDB indicated that its activation involves cleavage of a labile B&#8592;N bond.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Phase Reconstruction Enables Robust Zinc Metal Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are inherently safe, but the severe dendrite growth and corrosion reaction on zinc anodes greatly hinder their practical applications. Most of the strategies for zinc anode modification refer to the research of lithium metal anodes on surface regulation without considering the intrinsic mechanisms of zinc anode. Herein, we first point out that surface modification cannot permanently protect zinc anodes due to the unavoidable surface damage during the stripping process by solid&#8208;liquid conversion. A bulk&#8208;phase reconstruction strategy is proposed to introduce abundant zincophilic sites both on the surface and inside the commercial zinc foils. The bulk&#8208;phase reconstructed zinc foil anodes exhibit uniform surfaces with high zincophilicity even after deep stripping, significantly improving the resistance to dendrite growth and side reactions. Our proposed strategy suggests a promising direction for the development of dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes for practical rechargeable batteries with high sustainability.</dc:description>

         <title>Emodin&#8208;Based Nanoarchitectonics with Giant Two&#8208;Photon Absorption for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emodin&#8208;based nanoparticles (E/H NPs) are fabricated by the co&#8208;assembly of Emo and HSA. E/H NPs possess a super&#8208;large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section (TPAC) and ideal singlet oxygen (1O2) generation capability. They can be easily internalized by tumors and exhibit outstanding anti&#8208;cancer efficacy at ultra&#8208;low dosages.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited photodynamic therapy (TPE&#8208;PDT) has significant advantages over conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, obtaining easily accessible TPE photosensitizers (PSs) with high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that emodin (Emo), a natural anthraquinone (NA) derivative, is a promising TPE PS with a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section (TPAC: 380.9&#8197;GM) and high singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield (31.9&#8201;%). When co&#8208;assembled with human serum albumin (HSA), the formed Emo/HSA nanoparticles (E/H NPs) possess a giant TPAC (4.02&#215;107&#8197;GM) and desirable 1O2 generation capability, thus showing outstanding TPE&#8208;PDT properties against cancer cells. In vivo experiments reveal that E/H NPs exhibit improved retention time in tumors and can ablate tumors at an ultra&#8208;low dosage (0.2&#8197;mg/kg) under an 800&#8197;nm femtosecond pulsed laser irradiation. This work is beneficial for the use of natural extracts NAs for high&#8208;efficiency TPE&#8208;PDT.

         <title>Monodisperse Adducts&#8208;Induced Homogeneous Nucleation Towards High&#8208;Quality Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) changes the solvation structure of SnI2 from edge&#8208;sharing cluster to monodisperse adduct and constructs a well&#8208;dispersed Sn&#8208;based precursor solution, which facilitates uniform distribution of nucleation sites and delays crystallization process, resulting in dense and uniform Sn&#8208;based perovskite films over large area. Ultimately, HMPA&#8208;incorporated device delivers a superior efficiency of 13.46&#8201;%.







Abstract
The classic solvent system can't sufficiently separate one&#8208;dimensional edge&#8208;sharing SnI2 crystals in solution, which severely restricts the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tin&#8208;based perovskite film. Herein, a strong Lewis base (hexamethylphosphoramide, HMPA) has been introduced to coordinate Sn2+ to modulate solvation behaviours on perovskite precursor and regulate crystallization kinetics. The large molecular volume of HMPA and stronger bind energy of SnI2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2HMPA (&#8722;0.595&#8197;eV vs &#8722;0.118&#8197;eV for SnI2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMSO) change the solvation structure of SnI2 from edge&#8208;sharing cluster to monodisperse adduct, which contributes to uniform nucleation sites and prolongs crystal growth process. Delightfully, a fully&#8208;covered perovskite film is formed on the large&#8208;area substrate and tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells processed with HMPA exhibit an excellent efficiency of 13.46&#8201;%. This research provides novel insights and directions for the solution preparation of smooth and uniform large&#8208;area tin&#8208;based perovskite film.

         <title>Cross Relaxation Channel Tailored Temperature Response in Er3+&#8208;rich Upconversion Nanophosphor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An over 100 folds enhancement of upconversion emission is achieved in cryogenic Er3+&#8208;rich nanosystems. The temperature role in such increment is quantitatively revealed, which obeys an exponential relationship.







Abstract
Recently high doping of lanthanide ions (till 100&#8201;%) is realized unprecedentedly in nanostructured upconversion (UC) phosphors. However, oddly enough, this significant breakthrough did not result in a corresponding UC enhancement at ambient temperature, which hinders the otherwise very interesting applications of these materials in various fields. In this work, taking the Er3+&#8208;rich UC nanosystem as an example, we confirm unambiguously that the phonon&#8208;assisted cross relaxation (CR) is the culprit. More importantly, combining the theoretical modeling and experiments, the precise roles of different CR channels on UC energy loss are quantitatively revealed. As a result, lowering the temperature can exponentially enhance the relevant UC luminescence by more than two orders of magnitude. Our comprehension will play an important role in promoting the UC performance and further application of high doping rare earth materials. As a proof of concept, an Er3+&#8208;rich core/multi&#8208;shell nanophosphor is exploited which demonstrates the great potential of our finding in the field of ultra&#8208;sensitive temperature sensing.

Two bcu Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), named ZrMOF&#8208;1 and ZrMOF&#8208;2, have been built from 8&#8208;connected (8&#8208;c) cubic Zr6O4(OH)4(H2O)8 clusters and 8&#8208;c peripherally extended pentiptycene ligands. Impressively, ZrMOF&#8208;1 exhibits promising application in water harvesting from air with a high water uptake capacity of 0.83&#8197;gH2O&#8201;gMOF&#8722;1 at P/P0=0.90 and 25&#8201;&#176;C, a steep uptake at a low P/P0 of 0.30, and excellent durability over 500 water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles.







Abstract
Utilization of rigid, highly connected organic linkers is critical for the reticular synthesis of functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, highly&#8208;stable MOFs (e.g. Al/Cr/Zr&#8208;based MOFs) based on rigid ligands with more than 6 coordinating functions have been rarely achieved thus far. Herein, we describe the construction of two bcu Zr&#8208;based MOFs (named ZrMOF&#8208;1 and ZrMOF&#8208;2) from peripherally extended pentiptycene ligands (H8PEP&#8208;1 and H8PEP&#8208;2) with rigid quadrangular prism shape possessing 8 carboxylic groups at the prism vertices. Particularly, ZrMOF&#8208;1 exhibits microporous structure with large Bruno&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface area and high water stability, endowing it a promising water harvesting material with a high water uptake capacity of 0.83&#8197;gH2O&#8201;gMOF&#8722;1 at P/P0=0.90 and 25&#8201;&#176;C, a steep uptake at a low P/P0 of 0.30, and excellent durability over 500 water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Moreover, self&#8208;consistent charge density functional tight&#8208;binding calculations were carried out, rationalizing the water adsorbing process and amount in ZrMOF&#8208;1.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Cyclic Peptide Assembly to Form Higher&#8208;Order Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality correction, asymmetry, ring&#8208;chain tautomerism and hierarchical assemblies are fundamental phenomena in nature. They are geometrically related and may impact the biological roles of a protein or other supermolecules. It is challenging to study those behaviors within an artificial system due to the complexity of displaying these features. Herein, we design an alternating D,L peptide to recreate and validate the naturally occurring chirality inversion prior to cyclization in water. The resulted asymmetrical cyclic peptide containing a 4&#8208;imidazolidinone ring provides an excellent platform to study the ring&#8208;chain tautomerism, thermostability and dynamic assembly of the nanostructures. Different from traditional cyclic D,L peptides, the formation of 4&#8208;imidazolidinone promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. Analysis of the nanostructures confirmed the left&#8208;handedness, representing chirality induced self&#8208;assembly. These prove that a rationally designed peptide can mimic multiple natural phenomena and could promote the development of functional biomaterials, catalysts, antibiotics, and supermolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Metal Redox Potentials to Co(III)K(I) Catalyst Performances in Carbon Dioxide and Propene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide copolymerization is a front&#8208;runner CO2 utilization strategy but its viability depends on improving the catalysis. So far, catalyst structure&#8208;performance correlations have not been straightforward, limiting the ability to predict how to improve both catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, a simple measure of a catalyst ground&#8208;state parameter, metal reduction potential, directly correlates with both polymerization activity and selectivity. It is applied to compare performances of 6 new heterodinuclear Co(III)K(I) catalysts for propene oxide (PO)/CO2 ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) producing poly(propene carbonate) (PPC). The best catalyst shows an excellent turnover frequency of 389 h&#8208;1 and high PPC selectivity of &gt;99% (50 &#176;C, 20 bar, 0.025 mol% catalyst). As demonstration of its utility, neither DFT calculations nor ligand Hammett parameter analyses are viable predictors. It is proposed that the cobalt redox potential informs upon the active site electron density with a more electron rich cobalt centre showing better performances. The method may be widely applicable and is recommended to guide future catalyst discovery for other (co)polymerizations and carbon dioxide utilizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrolysis of Biaryl Oxazepines for the Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryl Amino Phenol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed (dynamic) kinetic ring&#8208;opening of biaryl oxazepines with water has been disclosed. A wide range of biaryl oxazepine substrates underwent this catalytic asymmetric hydrolysis reaction in a highly enantioselective manner. Key parameters for the success of this reaction are the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions.







Abstract
The development of catalytic asymmetric reaction with water as the reactant is challenging due to the reactivity&#8208; and stereoselectivity&#8208;control issues resulted from the low nucleophilicity and the small size of water. We disclose herein a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of biaryl oxazepines with water. A series of biaryl oxazepines undergo the CPA catalyzed asymmetric hydrolysis in a highly enantioselective manner. The key for the success of this reaction is the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via a dynamic kinetic resolution pathway and the CPA catalyzed addition of water to the imine group is both enantio&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining.

Dynamic X&#8208;ray flexible imaging for the real&#8208;time observation of the internal structure of complex materials is the most challenging type of X&#8208;ray imaging technology, which requires high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators with high X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) efficiency as well as excellent processibility and stability. Here, a macrocyclic bridging ligand with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature was introduced for constructing a copper iodide cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) scintillator. This strategy endows the scintillator with high XEL efficiency and excellent chemical stability. Moreover, a regular rod&#8208;like microcrystal was prepared through the addition of polyvinyl pyrrolidone during the in situ synthesis process, which further enhanced the XEL and processibility of the scintillator. The microcrystal was used for the preparation of a scintillator screen with excellent flexibility and stability, which can be used for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray imaging in extremely humid environments. Furthermore, dynamic X&#8208;ray flexible imaging was realized for the first time. The internal structure of flexible objects was observed in real time with an ultrahigh resolution of 20 LP mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Group&#8197;14 Elements Hetero&#8208;Difunctionalizations via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;components reductive protocol for the group&#8197;14 elements hetero&#8208;difunctionalizations via electrochemistry is described. The cascade reaction proceeded smoothly with the diverse chlorosilanes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides. Good chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities were achieved. This protocol could be extended to germanyl&#8208; and stannylalkylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes, showing its generality and versatility.







Abstract
The difunctionalization of unsaturated bonds plays a vital role in the enrichment of molecular complexity. While various catalytic methods for alkene and alkyne difunctionalization have been developed in recent years, hetero&#8208;functionalization the introduction of two different atoms has been less explored. This is mainly due to the challenges associated with achieving high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity, especially when adding two similar atoms from the same group across unsaturated bonds. In this study, we describe a nickel&#8208;catalyzed, three&#8208;component reductive protocol for group&#8197;14 element hetero&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;enynes using electrochemistry. This new method is mild, selective, and general, allowing for the silyl&#8208;, germanyl&#8208;, and stannyl&#8208;alkylation of enynes. Various chlorosilanes as well as chlorogermans, and chlorostannanes can be successfully used in combination with aryl/alkyl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;enynes and primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides in the electroreductive coupling.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergence in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylcyclopropane Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni0&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;vinylcyclopropanes was studied. Either of the two product isomers, 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentenes, was selectively obtained depending on the choice of ligands. Experimental and computational investigations of the reaction revealed a clear insight into the origin of such high product selectivity.







Abstract
A ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergence in Ni&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of vinylcyclopropanes to 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentenes is reported. The 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene is selectively obtained depending on the choice of ligands. Detailed kinetic studies and density functional theory calculations on the catalytic cycle revealed that the product selectivity is determined at the reductive elimination step from the six&#8208;membered &#951;1&#8208;allyl intermediate.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;P Alkenylphosphonamidates through Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;P Coupling of Phosphoramidites and Alkenyl Halides</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantioenriched P&#8208;stereogenic alkenylphosphonamidates can be accessed in high yield and stereoselectivity through a chemo&#8208; and diastereodivergent Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;P coupling of readily available BINOL&#8208;based phosphoramidites and alkenyl halides. The reaction showed a broad scope and the chiral alkenylphosphonamidates proved to be versatile synthetic handles for the divergent synthesis of functionalized chiral&#8208;at&#8208;P organophosphorus compounds.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic compounds are widely used as ligands in asymmetric catalysis and are present in a myriad of bioactive compounds and pharmaceuticals. Yet, their stereocontrolled preparation remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel strategy towards versatile chiral&#8208;at&#8208;P alkenylphosphonamidates through a one&#8208;pot Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;P coupling/diastereoselective hydrolysis of readily available phosphoramidites and alkenyl halides. Remarkably, a chemo&#8208; and diastereodivergent behavior was observed upon subtle changes in the reaction conditions. Additionally, selective derivatizations of chiral alkenylphosphonamidates demonstrate their versatility as building blocks for the synthesis of structurally diverse P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Accelerating Gas Escape in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis by Gas Diffusion Layers with Hierarchical Grid Gradients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the AEMWE's mass transport and performance can be significantly improved by simply manipulating the structure of the GDLs. We use 3D printing to fabricate a series of GDLs with adjustable grid sizes. A suitable GDL grid size can accelerate mass transport by reducing the gas bubble size and the bubble resident time. Then a novel hierarchical GDL was made to highly promote the mass transport of AEMWE at high current densities.







Abstract
At high current densities, gas bubble escape is the critical factor affecting the mass transport and performance of the electrolyzer. For tight assembly water electrolysis technologies, the gas diffusion layer (GDL) between the catalyst layer (CL) and the flow field plate plays a critical role in gas bubble removal. Herein, we demonstrate that the electrolyzer's mass transport and performance can be significantly improved by simply manipulating the structure of the GDL. Combined with 3D printing technology, ordered nickel GDLs with straight&#8208;through pores and adjustable grid sizes are systematically studied. Using an in situ high&#8208;speed camera, the gas bubble releasing size and resident time have been observed and analyzed upon the change of the GDL architecture. The results show that a suitable grid size of the GDL can significantly accelerate mass transport by reducing the gas bubble size and the bubble resident time. An adhesive force measurement has further revealed the underlying mechanism. We then proposed and fabricated a novel hierarchical GDL, reaching a current density of 2&#8197;A/cm2 at a cell voltage of 1.95&#8197;V and 80&#8201;&#176;C, one of the highest single&#8208;cell performances in pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE).

         <title>Visible Light and Microwave&#8208;Mediated Rapid Trapping and Release of Singlet Oxygen Using a Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthracyl coordination polymer is able to self&#8208;sensitize and rapidly trap 1O2 in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photooxidation reaction upon exposure to visible light. 1O2 is efficiently and rapidly released through microwave irradiation. This process is accompanied by reversible enhancement and attenuation of fluorescence. Fluorescent oxygen sensing regulated by visible light and microwave irradiation has been demonstrated for the first time.







Abstract
Due to its high reactivity and oxidative strength, singlet oxygen (1O2) is used in a variety of fields including organic synthesis, biomedicine, photodynamic therapy and materials science. Despite its importance, the controlled trapping and release of 1O2 is extremely challenging. Herein, we describe a one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer, CP1, which upon irradiation with visible light, transforms 3O2 (triplet oxygen) to 1O2. CP1 consists of CdII centers bridged by 9,10&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene ligands which undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with 1O2, resulting in the generation of CP1&#8722;1O2. Using microwave irradiation, CP1&#8722;1O2 displays efficient release of 1O2, over a period of 30&#8197;s. In addition, CP1 exhibits enhanced fluorescence and has an oxygen detection limit of 97.4&#8197;ppm. Theoretical calculations reveal that the fluorescence behaviour is dominated by unique through&#8208;space conjugation. In addition to describing a highly efficient approach for the trapping and controlled release of 1O2, using coordination polymers, this work also provides encouragement for the development of efficient fluorescent oxygen sensors.

     alt="Visible Light and Microwave-Mediated Rapid Trapping and Release of Singlet Oxygen Using a Coordination Polymer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anthracyl coordination polymer is able to self-sensitize and rapidly trap &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a single-crystal-to-single-crystal photooxidation reaction upon exposure to visible light. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is efficiently and rapidly released through microwave irradiation. This process is accompanied by reversible enhancement and attenuation of fluorescence. Fluorescent oxygen sensing regulated by visible light and microwave irradiation has been demonstrated for the first time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its high reactivity and oxidative strength, singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is used in a variety of fields including organic synthesis, biomedicine, photodynamic therapy and materials science. Despite its importance, the controlled trapping and release of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is extremely challenging. Herein, we describe a one-dimensional coordination polymer, &lt;b&gt;CP1&lt;/b&gt;, which upon irradiation with visible light, transforms &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (triplet oxygen) to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;b&gt;CP1&lt;/b&gt; consists of Cd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; centers bridged by 9,10-bis((&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-2-(pyridin-4-yl)vinyl)anthracene ligands which undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in the generation of &lt;b&gt;CP1&#8722;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. Using microwave irradiation, &lt;b&gt;CP1&#8722;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Single&#8208;Nitrogen Atom Incorporation into B=B Bond via the N=N Bond Splitting of Diazo Compound and Diazirine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subsequent ring formation and ring opening strategy starting from diboraazabutenyne allows access to the first triboraazabutenynes with an extremely polarized asymmetrical B=B bond. This compound completely splits the N=N bond of diazo compound and diazirine, whereby one nitrogen atom is incorporated into the B=B moiety leading to a neutral 1,3&#8208;diboraazaallene.







Abstract
Triboraazabutenyne 3 is synthesized by the reaction of diboraazabutenyne 1 with aryl boron dibromide followed by the reduction. The ligand exchange to replace phosphine on the terminal sp2 B atom with carbene furnishes 4. 11B NMR, solid&#8208;state structures, and computational studies disclose that 3 and 4 feature the extremely polarized B=B bond. 4 readily splits the N=N bond of both diazo compound and diazirine under ambient conditions, whereby one nitrogen atom is incorporated into the B=B moiety leading to a neutral diboraazaallene 6. The mechanism of the reaction between 4 and diazo compound is extensively investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, as well as the isolation of an intermediate.

         <title>Cl2&#8226;&#8722; Mediates Direct and Selective Conversion of Inert C(sp3)&#8208;H Bonds into Aldehydes/Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new reactive pathway to activate inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds for valuable oxygenated products remains a great challenge. We prepared a series of covalent triazine polymers to photoactivate C&#8208;H into aldehyde/ketone via O2 &#8594;H2O2 &#8594;&#8226;OH&#8594;&#8226;Cl&#8594;Cl2&#8226;&#8722;. Experiment results showed Cl2&#8226;&#8722; could successively activate C(sp3)&#8208;H more effectively than Cl&#8226; to generate unstable dichlorinated intermediates, increasing the kinetic rate ratio of dichlorination to monochlorination by a factor of 2,000 and thus breaking traditional dichlorination kinetic constraints. These active intermediates were hydrolyzed into aldehydes or ketones easily compared with typical stable dichlorinated complex, avoiding chlorinated by&#8208;products generation. Moreover, an integrated two&#8208;phase system in acid solution strengthened the Cl2&#8226;&#8722; mediated process and inhibited products overoxidation, where the conversion rate of toluene reached 16.94 mmol/g/h and the selectivity of benzaldehyde was 99.5%.

         <title>Recent Advances in Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA) Syntheses in Non&#8208;Polar Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well&#8208;known that polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is a powerful and highly versatile technique for the rational synthesis of colloidal dispersions of diblock copolymer nanoparticles, including spheres, worms or vesicles. PISA can be conducted in water, polar solvents or non&#8208;polar media. In principle, the latter formulations offer a wide range of potential commercial applications. However, there has been just one review focused on PISA syntheses in non&#8208;polar media and this prior article was published in 2016. The purpose of the current review article is to summarize the various advances that have been reported since then. In particular, PISA syntheses conducted using reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization in various n&#8208;alkanes, poly(&#945;&#8208;olefins), mineral oil, low&#8208;viscosity silicone oils or supercritical CO2 are discussed in detail. Selected formulations exhibit thermally&#8208;induced worm&#8208;to&#8208;sphere or vesicle&#8208;to&#8208;worm morphological transitions and the rheological properties of various examples of worm gels in non&#8208;polar media are summarized. Finally, visible absorption spectroscopy and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) enable in situ monitoring of nanoparticle formation while small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) can be used to examine micelle fusion/fission and chain exchange mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Ion Conductor with Weakened Li Ion Solvation Enables Room Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improved durability, enhanced interfacial stability, and room temperature applicability are desirable properties for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs), yet these desired properties are rarely achieved simultaneously. Here, in this work, it is noticed that the huge resistance at Li metal/electrolyte interface dominantly impeded the normal cycling of ASSLMBs especially at around room temperature (&#65308;30 &#8451;). Accordingly, a supramolecular polymer ion conductor (SPC) with &#8220;weak solvation&#8221; of Li+ was prepared. Benefiting from the halogen&#8208;bonding interaction between the electron&#8208;deficient iodine atom (on 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene) and electron&#8208;rich oxygen atoms (on ethylene oxide), the O&#8208;Li+ coordination was significantly weakened. Therefore, the SPC achieves rapid Li+ transport with high Li+ transference number, and importantly, derives a unique Li2O&#8208;rich SEI with low interfacial resistance on lithium metal surface, therefore enabling stable cycling of ASSLMBs even down to 10 &#176;C. This work is a new exploration of halogen&#8208;bonding chemistry in solid polymer electrolyte and highlights the importance of &#8220;weak solvation&#8221; of Li+ in the solid&#8208;state electrolyte for room temperature ASSLMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Fe Cationic Vacancies with Graphdiyne to Enhance Exceptional Pseudocapacitive Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the electronic structure of electrode materials at atomic level is the key to controlling electrodes with outstanding rate capability. On the basis of modulating the electronic structure of materials, we proposed the design idea of graphdiyne/ferroferric oxide heterostructure (IV&#8208;GDY&#8208;FO) and controllable preparation of anode materials containing Fe Cationic vacancies. The goal is to motivate lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) toward ultra&#8208;high capacity, superior cyclic stability, and excellent rate performance. The graphdiyne is used as carriers to disperse Fe3O4 uniformly without agglomeration and induce high valence of Fe with reducing the energy in the system. The presence of Fe vacancy could regulate the charge distribution around vacancies and adjacent atoms, leading to facilitate electronic transportation, enlarge the lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, and decrease Li+ diffusion barriers, and thus displaying significant pseudocapacitive process and advantageous lithium&#8208;ion storage. The optimized electrode IV&#8208;GDY&#8208;FO reveals a capacity of 2084.1mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, superior cycle stability and rate performance with a high specific capacity of 1057.4 mAh g&#8208;1 even at 10C.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Application of Peptide&#8208;Mimic Phosphonium Salt Catalysts in Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral phosphonium salt catalysis, traditionally classified as a type of phase transfer catalysis, has proven to be a powerful strategy for the stereoselective preparation of diverse optically active molecules. However, there still remain numerous forbidding issues of reactivity and selectivity in such well&#8208;known organocatalysis system. Accordingly, the development of new and high&#8208;performance phosphonium salt catalysts with unique chiral backbones is highly desirable, yet challenging. This Minireview describes the prominent endeavours in the development of a new family of chiral peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors and their applications in a plethora of enantioselective synthesis during the past few years. Hopefully, this minireview will pave a way for further developing much more efficient and privileged chiral ligands/catalysts featuring exclusively catalytic ability in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;derived Fluorinated Secondary Interphase for Reversible Zn&#8208;graphite Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The irreversibility of anion intercalation&#8208;deintercalation is a fundamental issue in determining the cycling stability of a dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB). In this work, we demonstrate that using a partially fluorinated carbonate solvent can drive a beneficial fluorinated secondary interphase layer formation. Such layer facilitates reversible anion (de&#8208;)intercalation processes by impeding solvent molecule co&#8208;intercalation and the associated graphite exfoliation. The enhanced reversibility of anion transport contributes to the overall cycling stability for a Zn&#8208;graphite DIB &#8211; a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.5% after 800 cycles, with an attractive discharge capacity of 156 mAh g&#8208;1 and a mid&#8208;point discharge voltage of &#8776;1.7 V (at 0.1 A g&#8208;1). In addition, the formed fluorinated secondary interphase suppresses the self&#8208;discharge behavior by preserving 29 times of the capacity retention rate after standing for 24 hours, compared to the battery with a commonly used carbonate solvent. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for addressing the critical challenges in graphite&#8208;based DIBs and contributes to fundamental understanding to help accelerate their practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Responsive Ferrocene&#8208;based Capsule Displaying Unusual Encapsulation&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transfer&#160;Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A ferrocene&#8208;based capsule is spontaneously and quantitatively formed in water by the assembly of bent amphiphiles carrying two ferrocene units. The disassembly and assembly of the new organometallic capsule, with a well&#8208;defined and highly condensed ferrocene core, are demonstrated by chemical redox stimuli in a fully reversible fashion under ambient conditions. In contrast to previously reported multi&#8208;ferrocene assemblies, only the present capsule efficiently encapsulates typical organic/inorganic dyes as well as electron accepting molecules in water. As a result, unusual host&#8208;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, displaying relatively wide absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region (&#955;&#160;= 650&#8208;1350 nm), are observed upon encapsulation of acceptors (i.e., chloranil and TCNQ). The resultant encapsulation&#8208;induced CT interactions can be released by a redox stimulus through the disassembly of the capsule.</dc:description>

         <title>Strengthening Aqueous Electrolytes without Strengthening Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous electrolytes typically suffer from poor electrochemical stability; however, eutectic aqueous solutions&#8212;25 wt.% and 62 wt.% H3PO4&#8212;cooled to &#8211;78 &#176;C exhibit significantly widened stability window. Integrated experimental and simulation results reveal that, upon cooling, Li+ ions become less hydrated and pair up with Cl&#8211;, ice&#8208;like water clusters form, and H&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8211; bonding strengthens. Surprisingly, this low&#8208;temperature solvation structure does not strengthen water molecules&#8217; O&#8211;H bond, bucking the conventional wisdom that increasing water&#8217;s stability requires stiffening the O&#8211;H covalent bond. We propose a more general mechanism for water&#8217;s low temperature inertness in the electrolyte: less favorable solvation of OH&#8211; and H+, the byproducts of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. To showcase this stability, we demonstrate an aqueous Li&#8208;ion battery using LiMn2O4 cathode and CuSe anode with a high energy density of 109 Wh/kg. These results highlight the potential of aqueous batteries for polar and extraterrestrial missions.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding Protein Dynamics in Cells Using Chemical Cross&#8208;Linking and Hierarchical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein dynamics play a crucial role in their diverse functions. The intracellular environment significantly influences protein dynamics, particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). To comprehensively capture structural information from various proteins wihtin cells and characterize protein dynamics, chemical cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry was employed. In this study, we introduce a hierarchical decoding strategy that enables the investigation of protein dynamics in vivo. Computational analysis based on distance restraints derived from cross&#8208;links is used to infer protein dynamics in cells. To facilitate this analysis, we leverage the prior structure obtained from AlphaFold2. By employing this strategy, we can characterize the full&#8208;length structure of multi&#8208;domain proteins taking into account their distinct dynamic features. Furthermore, by combining restraint sampling with an unbiased sampling and evaluation approach, we can provide a comprehensive description of the intrinsic motion of IDPs. Consequently, the hierarchical strategy we propose holds significant potential in advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that undelie protein functions in cells.</dc:description>

Computational analysis based on distance restraints derived from cross-links is used to infer protein dynamics in cells. To facilitate this analysis, we leverage the prior structure obtained from AlphaFold2. By employing this strategy, we can characterize the full-length structure of multi-domain proteins taking into account their distinct dynamic features. Furthermore, by combining restraint sampling with an unbiased sampling and evaluation approach, we can provide a comprehensive description of the intrinsic motion of IDPs. Consequently, the hierarchical strategy we propose holds significant potential in advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that undelie protein functions in cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 Clusters as Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Selective H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;based material catalysts have shown attractive application prospects in the 2 e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, for the industrial synthesis of H2O2, there is still lack of Co&#8208;based catalysts with high production yield rate. Here, novel cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 cluster catalysts were prepared via a mild and facile method. The catalyst exhibited remarkable H2O2 selectivity (94.2% ~ 98.2%), good stability (99% activity retention after 35 h), and ultra&#8208;high H2O2 production yield rate (5.58 mol gcatalyst&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in the H&#8208;type electrolytic cell), demonstrating its promising industrial application potential. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the cyclodextrin&#8208;mediated Co(OH)2 electronic structure optimizes the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and significantly enhances the activation energy barrier for dissociation, leading to the high reactivity and selectivity for the 2 e&#8208; ORR. This work offers a valuable and practical strategy to design Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Metal&#8208;Oxide Interfaces with Modified Intermediate Configurations Realizing Nearly 100% CO2 Electrocatalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction via renewable electricity provides a sustainable way for producing valued chemicals, while it suffers from low activity and selectivity. Herein, we constructed a novel catalyst with unique Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8208;regulated Ag&#8208;ZnO interfaces, undercoordinated surface sites, as well as mesoporous nanostructures. The designed Ag&#8208;ZnO/Ti3C2Tx catalyst achievesan outstanding CO2 conversion performance of a nearly 100% CO Faraday efficiency with high partial current density of 22.59 mA cm&#8722;2&#160;at &#8722;0.87 V.&#160;The electronic donation of Ag and up&#8208;shifted d&#8208;band center relative to Fermi level within MXene&#8208;regulated Ag&#8208;ZnO interfaces contributes the high selectivity of CO. The CO2 conversion is highly correlated with the dominated linear&#8208;bonded CO intermediate confirmed by in situ infrared spectroscopy. This work enlightens the rational design of unique metal&#8208;oxide interfaces with the regulation of MXene for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis beyond CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrophosphination of Cyclopropenes under Lanthanocene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes with phosphines is of much interest and importance, but has remained hardly explored to date probably because of the lack of suitable catalysts. We report here the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with phosphines by a chiral lanthanocene catalyst bearing the C2&#8208;symmetric 5,6&#8208;dioxy&#8208;4,7&#8208;trans&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydroindenyl ligands. This protocol offers a selective and efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of chiral phosphinocyclopropane derivatives, featuring 100% atom efficiency, good diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and no need for a directing group.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Proton Conduction against Mechanical Stress in Flexible Free&#8208;Standing Membrane Composed of Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of mechanical flexibility into proton&#8208;conducting coordination polymers (CPs) is in high demand for future protonic applications such as fuel cells and hydrogen sensors. Although such mechanical properties have been primarily investigated in one&#8208;dimensional (1D) CPs, in this study, we successfully fabricated highly flexible free&#8208;standing CP membranes with a high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, which is beneficial for enhanced performance in the aforementioned applications. We fabricated a layered CP, Cu2(NiTCPP) (H4(H2TCPP); 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin), in which a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) square grid sheet composed of tetradentate nickel porphyrins and paddlewheel&#8208;type copper dimers was connected to each other by weak van der Waals forces. The mechanical flexibility was evaluated by bending and tensile tests. The flexural and Young&#8217;s moduli of the membrane were significantly higher than those of conventional Nafion membranes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis revealed that the in&#8208;plane proton conductivity of the membrane was maintained even under applied bending stress. Because the X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that the proton&#8208;conducting pathway through the hydrogen bonding network remains intact during the bending operation, our present study provides a promising strategy for the fabrication of new and advanced 2D CPs without using substrates or additional polymers for protonic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Group Transfer Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (GTPISA) in Non&#8208;polar Media: An Organocatalyzed Route to Block Copolymer Nanoparticles at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) enables the synthesis at large scale of a wide variety of functional nanoparticles. However, a large number of works are related to controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods and are generally undertaken at elevated temperatures (&gt; 50 &#176;C). Here is the first report on methacrylate&#8208;based nanoparticles fabricated by group transfer polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (GTPISA) in non&#8208;polar media (n&#8208;heptane). This GTPISA process is achieved at room temperature (RT) using 1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1&#8208;(trimethylsiloxy)&#8208;2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;1&#8208;ene (MTS) and tetrabutylammonium bis&#8208;benzoate (TBABB) as initiator and organic catalyst, respectively. Under these conditions, well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;free and colorless diblock copolymers are produced with efficient crossover from the non&#8208;polar stabilizing poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA) block to the non&#8208;soluble poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) segment. The resulting PLMA&#8208;b&#8208;PBzMA block copolymers simultaneously self&#8208;assemble into nanostructures of various sizes and morphologies. GTPISA in non&#8208;polar solvent proceeds rapidly at RT and avoids the use of sulfur or halogenated compounds or metallic catalysts associated with the implementation of CRP methods, thus expanding the potential of PISA formulations for applications in non&#8208;polar environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;polarization schemes for improved heteronuclear transfers involving labile protons in biomolecular solution NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>INEPT&#8208;based experiments are widely used for 1H&#8208;&gt;15N transfers, but often fail when involving labile protons due to solvent exchanges. J&#8208;based cross polarization (CP) strategies offer a more efficient alternative to perform such transfers, particularly when leveraging the Hwater&#8596;&#65038;HN exchange process to boost the 1H&#8594;15N transfer process. This leveraging, however, demands the simultaneous spin&#8208;locking of both Hwater and HN protons by a strong 1H RF field, while fulfilling the [[EQUATION]]HB1,H=[[EQUATION]]NB1,N Hartmann&#8208;Hahn matching condition. Given the low value of [[EQUATION]]N/[[EQUATION]]H, however, these demands are often incompatible &#8211;particularly when experiments are executed by the power&#8208;limited cryogenic probes used in contemporary high field NMR. The present manuscript discusses CP alternatives that can alleviate this limitation, and evaluates their performance on urea, amino acids, and intrinsically disordered proteins. These alternatives include new CP variants based on frequency&#8208;swept and phase&#8208;modulated pulses, designed to simultaneously fullfil&#160;the aforementioned conflicting conditions. Their performances vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis current options are theoretically analyzed with Liouville&#8208;space simulations, and experimentally tested with double and triple resonance transfer experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorogenic DNAzyme for A Thermally Stable Protein Biomarker from Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Human Bacterial Pathogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusobacterium nucleatum has been correlated to many poor human conditions including oral infections, adverse pregnancies and cancer, and thus molecular tools capable of detecting this human pathogen can be used to develop diagnostic tests for them. Using a new selection method targeting thermally stable proteins without a counter&#8208;selection step, we derived an fluorogenic RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme, named RFD&#8208;FN1, that can be activated by a thermally stable protein target that is unique to F. nucleatum subspecies. High thermal stability of protein targets is a very desirable attribute for DNAzyme&#8208;based biosensing directly with biological samples because nucleases found inherently in these samples can be heat inactivated. We further demonstrate that RFD&#8208;FN1 can function as a fluorescent sensor in both human saliva and human stool samples. The discovery of RFD&#8208;FN1 paired with a highly thermal stable protein target presents opportunities for developing simpler diagnostic tests for this important pathogen.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Rules for Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic Semiconductor&#8208;Incorporated Perovskites (OSiP) Gleaned from Thousands of Simulated Structures
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D halide perovskites can accommodate a vast array of organic semiconducting ligands to potentially augment their functionality. A library of over 104 have been characterized by molecular dynamics and used to train machine learning models.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are an attractive class of hybrid perovskites that have additional optoelectronic tunability due to their accommodation of relatively large organic ligands. Nevertheless, contemporary ligand design depends on either expensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error testing of whether a ligand can be integrated within the lattice or conservative heuristics that unduly limit the scope of ligand chemistries. Here, the structural determinants of stable ligand incorporation within Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) phase perovskites are established by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of over ten&#8208;thousand RP&#8208;phase perovskites and training of machine learning classifiers capable of predicting structural stability based solely on generalizable ligand features. The simulation results show near&#8208;perfect predictions of positive and negative literature examples, predict trade&#8208;offs between several ligand features and stability, and ultimately predict an inexhaustibly large 2D&#8208;compatible ligand design&#8208;space.

         <title>Multicomponent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be designed and built up using multiple building blocks. Multicomponent MOFs employ building blocks that are distinct from one another and therefore occupy specific lattice positions. By maintaining periodicity while circumventing randomness and disorder, these materials enable exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions or clusters and organic linkers. Typical MOFs are rather simple, comprising just one type of joint and linker. An additional degree of structural complexity can be introduced by using multiple different components that are assembled into the same framework In the early days of MOF chemistry, conventional wisdom held that attempting to prepare frameworks starting from such a broad set of components would lead to multiple different phases. However, this review highlights how this view was mistaken and frameworks comprising multiple different components can be deliberately designed and synthesized. When coupled to structural order and periodicity, the presence of multiple components leads to exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.

         <title>Perovskite Films Regulation via Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Polymer Network for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional elastomer with abundant hydrogen bonds and carbonyl groups was designed and successfully incorporated into perovskite film. The multiple chemical bonding interactions between the elastomer and perovskite lead to high&#8208;quality perovskite film and efficient perovskite solar cells with improved stability and reduced lead leakage.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their high efficiency and low cost. However, their long&#8208;term stability, mechanical durability, and environmental risks are still unable to meet practical needs. To overcome these issues, we designed a multifunctional elastomer with abundant hydrogen bonds and carbonyl groups. The chemical bonding between polymer and perovskite could increase the growth activation energy of perovskite film and promote the preferential growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Owing to the low defect density and gradient energy&#8208;level alignment, the corresponding device exhibited a champion efficiency of 23.10&#8201;%. Furthermore, due to the formation of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network in the perovskite film, the target devices demonstrated excellent air stability and enhanced flexibility for the flexible PSCs. More importantly, the polymer network could coordinate with Pb2+ ions, immobilizing lead atoms to reduce their release into the environment. This strategy paves the way for the industrialization of high&#8208;performance flexible PSCs.

         <title>A Click Chemistry&#8208;Based Artificial Metallo&#8208;Nuclease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry was used to prepare TC&#8208;Thio, a new artificial metallo&#8208;nuclease. TC&#8208;Thio coordinates up to three CuII ions and is a potent DNA damaging agent that binds and cleaves from the minor groove. Activity was assessed in primary human cells using single molecule imaging of DNA.







Abstract
Artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) are promising DNA damaging drug candidates. Here, we demonstrate how the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linker produced by the Cu&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction can be directed to build Cu&#8208;binding AMN scaffolds. We selected biologically inert reaction partners tris(azidomethyl)mesitylene and ethynyl&#8208;thiophene to develop TC&#8208;Thio, a bioactive C3&#8208;symmetric ligand in which three thiophene&#8208;triazole moieties are positioned around a central mesitylene core. The ligand was characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and forms multinuclear CuII and CuI complexes identified by mass spectrometry and rationalised by density functional theory (DFT). Upon Cu coordination, CuII&#8208;TC&#8208;Thio becomes a potent DNA binding and cleaving agent. Mechanistic studies reveal DNA recognition occurs exclusively at the minor groove with subsequent oxidative damage promoted through a superoxide&#8208; and peroxide&#8208;dependent pathway. Single molecule imaging of DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells shows that the complex has comparable activity to the clinical drug temozolomide, causing DNA damage that is recognised by a combination of base excision repair (BER) enzymes.

         <title>Tandem Guest&#8208;Host&#8208;Receptor Recognitions Precisely Guide Ciprofloxacin to Eliminate Intracellular Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions was proposed to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to effectively eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus. Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M was obtained through guest&#8208;host recognition. After targeting S.&#8197;aureus&#8208;infected macrophages via ligand&#8208;receptor recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M underwent intracellular caspase&#8208;1&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form ciprofloxacin nanoparticle, leading to enhanced antibacterial efficiency.







Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#8197;aureus) is able to hide within host cells to escape immune clearance and antibiotic action, causing life&#8208;threatening infections. To boost the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics, new intracellular delivery approaches are urgently needed. Herein, by rational design of an adamantane (Ada)&#8208;containing antibiotic&#8208;peptide precursor Ada&#8208;Gly&#8208;Tyr&#8208;Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Asp&#8208;Cys(StBu)&#8208;Lys(Ciprofloxacin)&#8208;CBT (Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada), we propose a strategy of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide ciprofloxacin to eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus. Via guest&#8208;host recognition, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada is decorated with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;heptamannoside (CD&#8208;M) derivative to yield Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M, which is able to target mannose receptor&#8208;overexpressing macrophages via multivalent ligand&#8208;receptor recognition. After uptake, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M undergoes caspase&#8208;1 (an overexpressed enzyme during S.&#8197;aureus infection)&#8208;initiated CBT&#8208;Cys click reaction to self&#8208;assemble into ciprofloxacin nanoparticle Nano&#8208;Cip. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that, compared with ciprofloxacin or Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada, Cip&#8208;CBT&#8208;Ada/CD&#8208;M shows superior intracellular bacteria elimination and inflammation alleviation efficiency in S.&#8197;aureus&#8208;infected RAW264.7 cells and mouse infection models, respectively. This work provides a supramolecular platform of tandem guest&#8208;host&#8208;receptor recognitions to precisely guide antibiotics to eliminate intracellular S.&#8197;aureus infection efficiently.

         <title>Observation of Confinement&#8208;Free Neutral Group Three Transition Metal Carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl Sc(CO)7 and octacarbonyl TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) complexes have been prepared using a laser vaporization&#8208;supersonic expansion source and characterized by size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy. Theoretical analyses show that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase.







Abstract
Spectroscopic characterization of neutral highly&#8208;coordinated compounds is essential in fundamental and applied research, but has been proven to be a challenging experimental target because of the difficulty in mass selection. Here, we report the preparation and size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet (IR&#8208;VUV) spectroscopic identification of group&#8208;3 transition metal carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) in the gas phase, which are the first confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl and octacarbonyl complexes. The results indicate that Sc(CO)7 has a C2v structure and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) have a D4h structure. Theoretical calculations predict that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM=Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase. These highly&#8208;coordinated carbonyls are 17&#8208;electron complexes when only those valence electrons that occupy metal&#8722;CO bonding orbitals are considered, in which the ligand&#8208;only 4b1u molecular orbital is ignored. This work opens new avenues toward the design and chemical control of a large variety of compounds with unique structures and properties.

         <title>Electron Donor Coordinated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For electron donor coordinated metal&#8211;organic frameworks, the photoelectrochemical electron&#8208;transfer mechanism is revealed by density functional theory calculations and experiments, which show a self&#8208;supplying electrons strategy. The matching HOMO levels of the light collector and electron&#8208;donor ligands facilitate electron transfer which efficiently suppresses electron&#8208;hole recombination, greatly enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance.







Abstract
To enhance photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance, additional electron donor/acceptor is generally required to inhibit the electron&#8208;hole recombination. However, the enhancement is limited due to the long&#8208;distance diffusion. Herein a self&#8208;supplying electron strategy is designed for PEC enhancement by coordinating an electron donor 1.4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dabco) in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The intrareticular photoelectron transfer mechanism in mixed&#8208;ligand MOF (m&#8208;MOF) is experimentally revealed and verified by density functional theory calculations. The presence of Dabco efficiently inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination due to the self&#8208;supplying electrons and longer electron lifetime in the framework, and thus leads to 23.2&#8208;fold enhancement of photocurrent. As proof of concept, a simple PEC method is constructed with the designed m&#8208;MOF to demonstrate its application in sensitive bioanalysis. This work provides a new avenue for improving the PEC performance of nanomaterials.

Flexible perovskite solar cells have attracted wide attention because of their unique advantages, such as light weight and high flexibility. This review article discusses the routes toward improvement of the recoverability and environmental stability of flexible perovskite solar cells, and highlights the practical applications. The outlook and challenges of durable flexible perovskite devices in future commercialization are also considered.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) with excellent recoverability show a wide range of potential applications in portable power sources. The recoverability of FPSCs requires outstanding bendability of each functional layer, including the flexible substrates, electrodes, perovskite light absorbers, and charge transport materials. This review highlights the recent progress and practical applications of high&#8208;recoverability FPSCs, and illustrates the routes toward improvement of the recoverability and environmental stability through the choice of flexible substrates and the preparation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films, as well as the optimization of charge&#8208;selective contacts. In addition, we explore the intrinsic properties of each functional layer from the physical perspective and analyze how to select suitable functional layers. Additionally, some effective strategies are summarized, including material modification engineering of selective contacts, additives and interface engineering of interlayers, which can release mechanical stress and increase the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) and recoverability of the FPSCs. The challenges of making high&#8208;performance FPSCs with long&#8208;term stability and high recoverability are discussed. Finally, future applications and perspectives for FPSCs are discussed, aiming to promote more extensive commercialization processes for lightweight and durable FPSCs.

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Glucose Oxidation by the Pt Oxidation State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of Pt oxidation state on the activity and selectivity was elucidated for the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. A new analytical approach was used to quantify all (intermediate) products. Pt0 was found to promote the dehydrogenation of primary alcohol groups (i.e., promote glucose dialdehyde formation), while PtOx was found to promote oxygen transfer reactions (i.e., promote gluconic acid formation).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic glucose oxidation can produce high value chemicals, but selectivity needs to be improved. Here we elucidate the role of the Pt oxidation state on the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose with a new analytical approach, using high&#8208;pressure liquid chromatography and high&#8208;pressure anion exchange chromatography. It was found that the type of oxidation, i.e. dehydrogenation of primary and secondary alcohol groups or oxygen transfer to aldehyde groups, strongly depends on the Pt oxidation state. Pt0 has a 7&#8208;fold higher activity for dehydrogenation reactions than for oxidation reactions, while PtOx is equally active for both reactions. Thus, Pt0 promotes glucose dialdehyde formation, while PtOx favors gluconate formation. The successive dehydrogenation of gluconate is achieved selectively at the primary alcohol group by Pt0, while PtOx also promotes the dehydrogenation of secondary alcohol groups, resulting in more complex reaction mixtures.

         <title>Locating Hydrogen Positions for COF&#8208;300&#160;by Cryo&#8208;3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have wide&#8208;ranging applications, and their host&#8211;guest interactions play an essential role in the achievement of COF functions. To investigate these host&#8211;guest interactions, it is necessary to locate all atoms, especially hydrogen atoms. However, it is difficult to determine the hydrogen atomic positions in COFs because of the complexities in synthesizing high&#8208;quality large single crystals. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) has unique advantages for the structural determination of nanocrystals and identification of light atoms. In this study, it was demonstrated for the first time that the hydrogen atoms of a COF, not only on the framework but also on the guest molecule, can be located by 3D ED using continuous precession electron diffraction tomography (cPEDT) under cryogenic conditions. The host&#8211;guest interactions were clarified with the location of the hydrogen atoms. These findings provide novel insights into the investigation of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly&#8208;Active Chiral Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts with Suppressed Charge Recombination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recombination of free charges in organic semiconductors reduces the available photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;carriers and restricts photovoltaic efficiency. In this work, the chiral organic semiconductors (Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S with enantiopure R&#8208; and S&#8208; chiral alkyl sidechains) are designed and synthesized, which show effective aggregation&#8208;induced chirality through mainchain packing with chiral conformations in non&#8208;centrosymmetric space groups with tilt chirality. Based on the analysis of spin&#8208;injection, magnetic&#8208;hysteresis loop, and thermodynamics and dynamics of the excited state, we suggest that the aggregation&#8208;induced chirality can generate spin&#8208;polarization, which suppresses charge recombination and offers more available charge&#8208;carriers within Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S relative to the achiral counterpart (Y6). Then the chiral Y6&#8208;R and Y6&#8208;S show enhanced catalytic activity with optimal average hydrogen evolution rates of 205 and 217 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, respectively, 60&#8208;70% higher than Y6, when they are employed as nanoparticle photocatalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulated solar light, AM1.5G, 100 mW cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Doped n&#8208;Type Quinoidal Compounds with Good Air Stability and High Electrical Conductivity for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air stable n&#8208;type conductive molecules with high electrical conductivities and excellent device performance have important applications in organic electronics, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report three self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules, designated QnNs, with a closed&#8208;shell quinoidal backbone and alkyl amino chains of different lengths. The QnNs are self&#8208;doped via intermolecular electron transfer from the amino groups to the quinoidal backbone. This process is ascertained unambiguously by experiments and theoretical calculations. The use of quinoidal structure effectively improves the self&#8208;doping level, and thus increases the electrical conductivity of self&#8208;doped n&#8208;type conductive molecules that achieved in a closed&#8208;shell structure from &#706; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 to &gt; 0.03 S cm&#8722;1. Besides, the closed&#8208;shell quinoidal structure enables good air stability of QnNs with half&#8208;lives &gt; 73 days; and Q4N shows an electrical conductivity of 0.019 S cm&#8722;1 even after exposure to air for 120 days. When applying Q6N as the cathode interlayer in organic solar cells (OSCs), an outstanding power conversion efficiency of up to 18.2% was obtained, representing one the best results in binary OSCs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Better control of molecule&#8208;electrode coupling (&#915;) to minimize leakage current&#160;is an effective method to optimize the functionality of molecular diodes.&#160;Herein we embedded 5 isomers of phenypyridyl derivatives, each with an N atom placed at a different position, in two electrodes to fine&#8208;tune &#915; between self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and top electrode of EGaIn (eutectic Ga&#8208;In terminating in Ga2O3). Combined with electrical tunnelling results, characterizations of electronic structures, single&#8208;level model fitting and DFT calculation, we found that the values of &#915; of SAMs formed by these isomers could be regulated by nearly 10 times, contributing to the leakage current changing for about two orders of magnitude and switching isomers from resistors to diodes with rectification ratio (r+ = |J(+1.5 V)/J(&#8722;1.5 V)|) exceeding 200. We demonstrated that the N atom placement can be chemically engineered to tune the resistive and rectifying properties of the molecular junctions, making it possible to convert molecular resistors into rectifiers. Our study provides fundamental insights into the role of isomerism in molecular electronics and offers a new avenue for designing functional molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Vibration&#8208;driven Reduction of CO2 to Acetate with 100&#8201;% Selectivity by SnS Nanobelt Piezocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We substantiate the potential to utilize mechanical energy to piezocatalytic convert CO2 into C2 products, which is unprecedented. Tin(II) monosulfide (SnS) nanobelts were served as piezocatalysts for the first time to convert CO2 into acetate under periodic ultrasonic waves, achieving 100&#8201;% selectivity and a yield up to 2.21&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is the highest among reported studies.







Abstract
Converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 chemicals such as acetate with high selectivity and efficiency is a critical issue in renewable energy storage. Herein, for the first time we present a vibration&#8208;driven piezocatalysis with tin(II) monosulfide (SnS) nanobelts for conversion of CO2 to acetate with 100&#8201;% selectivity, and the highest production rate (2.21&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1) compared with reported catalysts. Mechanism analysis reveal that the polarized charges triggered by periodic mechanical vibration promote the adsorption and activation of CO2. The electron transfer can be facilitated due to built&#8208;in electric field, decreased band gap and work function of SnS under stress. Remarkably, reduced distance between active sites leads to charge enrichment on Sn sites, promoting the C&#8722;C coupling, reducing the energy barriers of the rate determining step. It puts forward a bran&#8208;new strategy for converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 products with efficient, low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly piezocatalysis utilizing mechanical energy.

         <title>Substituent Effect to Fine&#8208;Tune Energy Levels of Atom&#8208;Precise [MoOS3]2&#8722; Modified Copper(I) Thiolate Clusters Boosting Recyclable Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [MoOS3]2&#8722; unit is introduced into copper clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise MoVI&#8722;CuI bimetallic clusters, which show high photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance.







Abstract
The propulsion of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is limited by the rational design and regulation of catalysts with precise structures and excellent activities. In this work, the [MoOS3]2&#8722; unit is introduced into the CuI clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise MoVI&#8722;CuI bimetallic clusters of [Cu6(MoOS3)2(C6H5(CH2)S)2(P(C6H4&#8722;R)3)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xCH3CN (R=H, CH3, or F), which show high photocatalytic H2 evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects of the surface ligand, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the resultant visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance. Furthermore, MoVI&#8722;CuI clusters loaded onto the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 carriers significantly reduced the loss of catalysts in the collection process, efficiently addressing the recycling issues of such small cluster&#8208;based catalyst. This work not only highlights a competitively universal approach on the design of high&#8208;efficiency cluster photocatalysts for energy conversion, but also makes it feasible to manipulate the catalytic performance of clusters through a rational substituent strategy.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Substrate&#8211;Catalyst Halogen&#8211;Halogen Interactions for Boosting Enantioselectivity in Halogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy towards boosted enantioselectivities in primary halogen&#8208;bonding catalysis is presented. Fine&#8208;tuned multiple halogen&#8211;halogen interactions between the substrate and halogen&#8208;bond (XB)&#8208;donor catalyst, through both the electron cloud (Lewis base site) and the sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole site of the incorporated halogen substituents, allows enantioselectivities of up to 90&#8201;% ee in model anion&#8208;binding&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization reactions.







Abstract
A new approach towards highly enantioselective halogen&#8208;bonding catalysis has been developed. To circumvent the intrinsic issues of the nature of the halogen&#8208;bond (XB) and the resultant unresolved limitations in asymmetric catalysis, fine&#8208;tuned halogen&#8211;halogen interactions between the substrate and XB&#8208;donor were designed to preorganize the substrate in the catalyst's cavity and boost enantiocontrol. The present strategy exploits both the electron cloud (Lewis base site) and the sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole site of the halogen substituent of the substrates to form a tight catalyst&#8211;substrate&#8211;counteranion chiral complex, thus enabling a controlled induction of high levels of chirality transfer. Remarkable enantioselectivities of up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 e.r. (90&#8201;% ee) have been achieved in a model dearomatization reaction of halogen&#8208;substituted (iso)quinolines with tetrakis&#8208;iodotriazole multidentate anion&#8208;binding catalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical Activation of Nitromethane to Construct Isoxazoline Aldoximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented approach to isoxazoline aldoximes via the reactions of nitromethane and olefins is achieved. Nitromethane is electrochemically activated to serve as both the heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes.







Abstract
Activation of nitromethane to endow new reactivity is an interesting and meaningful but also challenging topic. Herein, we report an electrochemical activation of nitromethane to serve as both the heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes. The isoxazoline aldoximes that are prepared by four steps with the reported strategy are synthesized in a single step from low&#8208;cost and readily available nitromethane and olefins with moderate to excellent yields under our electrochemical conditions. The reaction also takes advantage of high atom&#8208;economy and E&#8208;selectivity. Moreover, the mechanism is studied by control experiments, a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study, cyclic voltammogram (CV) experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanistic results reveal that nitromethane may be activated under electrochemical conditions to deliver a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole 2&#8208;oxide intermediate, which undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with olefins to yield isoxazoline aldoximes.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stable Zinc Metal Anodes at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C through Eutectic Solvation Sheath in Chlorine&#8208;functionalized Eutectic Electrolytes with 1,3&#8208;Dioxolane</title>

         <dc:description>
A chlorine&#8208;functionalized eutectic electrolyte was proposed by exploiting Cl anion&#8208;induced eutectic interaction with zinc (Zn) acetate solutions. This novel eutectic liquid shows high affinity to collaborate with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane for the construction of a unique eutectic solvation sheath, which contributes to the ideal regulation of Zn&#8208;solvating structure and ultra&#8208;stabilization of Zn anode at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The brain&#8208;storm of designing low&#8208;cost and commercialized eutectic electrolytes for zinc (Zn)&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage (ZEES) remains unresolved and attractive, especially when implementing it at low temperatures. Here, we report an appealing layout of advancing chlorine&#8208;functionalized eutectic (Cl&#8208;FE) electrolytes via exploiting Cl anion&#8208;induced eutectic interaction with Zn acetate solutions. This novel eutectic liquid shows high affinity to collaborate with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) and is prone to constitute Cl&#8208;FE/DOL&#8208;based electrolytes with a unique inner/outer eutectic solvation sheath for the better regulation of Zn&#8208;solvating neighboring and reconstruction of H&#8208;bonding. The side reactions are effectively restricted on Zn anodes and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5&#8201;% can be achieved over 1000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with Zn//Cu setups. By prototyping scale&#8208;up Zn&#8208;ion pouch cells using the optimal eutectic liquid of 3ZnOAc1.2Cl1.8&#8208;DOL, we obtain improved electrochemical properties at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with a high capacitance of 203.9&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.02&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in a range of 0.20&#8211;1.90&#8197;V and long&#8208;term cycling ability with 95.3&#8201;% capacitance retention at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 3,000&#8197;cycles. Overall, the proposal of ideal Cl&#8208;FE/DOL&#8208;based electrolytes guides the design of sub&#8208;zero and endurable aqueous ZEES devices and beyond.

         <title>Versatile Biocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxyfunctionalization for the Site&#8208; Selective and Stereodivergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases (AADs) are repurposed for applications in biocatalytic oxyfunctionalization. Activity profiling of natural AADs enabled the synthesis of four types of &#945;&#8208;and &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids with broad scope, high efficiency, and good selectivity.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;H oxyfunctionalization, the insertion of an O&#8208;atom into C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, streamlines the synthesis of complex molecules from easily accessible precursors and represents one of the most challenging tasks in organic chemistry with regard to site and stereoselectivity. Biocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxyfunctionalization has the potential to overcome limitations inherent to small&#8208;molecule&#8208;mediated approaches by delivering catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity. Through enzyme repurposing and activity profiling of natural variants, we have developed a subfamily of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent iron dioxygenases that catalyze the site&#8208; and stereodivergent oxyfunctionalization of secondary and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, providing concise synthetic routes towards four types of 92 &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids with high efficiency and selectivity. This method provides a biocatalytic approach for the production of valuable but synthetically challenging chiral hydroxy acid building blocks.

         <title>Integrated Cascade Nanozymes with Antisenescence Activities for Atherosclerosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated cascade nanozyme with superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;like activities is proposed. Providing cascade nanozyme MSe1 with antisenescence activities as a therapeutic intervention against oxidative stress in senescent cells provides a new treatment for atherosclerosis.







Abstract
Senescent cells are the critical drivers of atherosclerosis formation and maturation. Mitigating senescent cells holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In an atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment, senescent cells interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting the disease development. Here, we hypothesize that a cascade nanozyme with antisenescence and antioxidant activities can serve as an effective therapeutic for atherosclerosis. An integrated cascade nanozyme with superoxide dismutase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, named MSe1, is developed in this work. The obtained cascade nanozyme can attenuate human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) senescence by protecting DNA from damage. It significantly weakens inflammation in macrophages and HUVECs by eliminating overproduced intracellular ROS. Additionally, the MSe1 nanozyme effectively inhibits foam cell formation in macrophages and HUVECs by decreasing the internalization of oxidized low&#8208;density lipoprotein. After intravenous administration, the MSe1 nanozyme significantly inhibits the formation of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E&#8208;deficient (ApoE&#8722;/&#8722;) mice by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation and then decreases the infiltration of inflammatory cells and senescent cells in atherosclerotic plaques. This study not only provides a cascade nanozyme but also suggests that the combination of antisenescence and antioxidative stress holds considerable promise for treating atherosclerosis.

         <title>Activation of Bulk Li2S as Cathode Material for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries through Organochalcogenide&#8208;Based Redox Mediation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic investigation of oxidation reaction kinetics of bulk Li2S was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators. Among them, phenyl ditelluride can significantly lower the charge overpotential, accelerate the redox reaction kinetics, and alleviate the shuttle effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides. Consequently, the Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.







Abstract
Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is considered as a promising cathode material for sulfur&#8208;based batteries. However, its activation remains to be one of the key challenges against its commercialization. The extraction of Li+ from bulk Li2S has a high activation energy (Ea) barrier, which is fundamentally responsible for the initial large overpotential. Herein, a systematic investigation of accelerated bulk Li2S oxidation reaction kinetics was studied by using organochalcogenide&#8208;based redox mediators, in which phenyl ditelluride (PDTe) can significantly reduce the Ea of Li2S and lower the initial charge potential. Simultaneously, it can alleviate the polysulfides shuttling effect by covalently anchoring the soluble polysulfides and converting them into insoluble lithium phenyl tellusulfides (PhTe&#8208;SxLi, x&gt;1). This alters the redox pathway and accelerates the reaction kinetics of Li2S cathode. Consequently, the Li||Li2S&#8208;PDTe cell shows excellent rate capability and enhanced cycling stability. The Si||Li2S&#8208;PDTe full cell delivers a considerable capacity of 953.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C.

         <title>Oxidation of 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin: Its Generality and Novelty as an Oxaporphyrin Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin (DOP) is a novel meso&#8208;oxaporphyrin analogue and exhibits unique 20&#960;&#8208;antiaromaticity, unlike its mother congener of 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic 5&#8208;oxaporphyrin, commonly known as its cationic iron complex called verdoheme as a key intermediate of the heme catabolism. To reveal reactivities and properties as an oxaporphyrin analogue, the oxidation reaction of tetra&#8208;&#946;&#8208;arylated DOP (DOP&#8208;Ar4) was explored in this study. Stepwise oxidation from the 20&#960;&#8208;electron neutral state was achieved, and the corresponding 19&#960;&#8208;electron radical cation and 18&#960;&#8208;electron dication were characterized. Further oxidation of the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic dication resulted in the formation of a ring&#8208;opened dipyrrindione product via hydrolysis. Considering a similar reaction of verdoheme to ring&#8208;opened biliverdin in the heme degradation in nature, the current result consolidates the generality of ring&#8208;opening reactivity as an oxaporphyrinium cation species.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Insights into Synergistic Nitroarene Hydrogenation over Nanodiamond&#8208;Supported Pt1&#8208;Fe1 Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental understanding of the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts is of extreme significance in heterogeneous catalysis, but great challenge is lying in the precise construction of uniform dual&#8208;metal sites. Here, we develop a novel method for constructing Pt1&#8208;Fe1/ND dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst, by anchoring Pt single atoms on Fe1&#8208;N4 sites decorated nanodiamond (ND) surface. Using this catalyst, the synergy on nitroarenes selective hydrogenation is revealed. In detail, hydrogen is activated on Pt1&#8208;Fe1 dual site and nitro group is strongly adsorbed on Fe1 site via vertical configuration for subsequent hydrogenation. Such synergistic effect decreases the activation energy and results in an unprecedented catalytic performance (3.1 s&#8208;1 turnover frequency, ~100% selectivity, 24 types of substrates adaptability). Our findings not only advance the applications of dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts in selective hydrogenations but open a new way to explore the nature of synergistic catalysis at atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo Responsive Electron and Proton Conductivity within a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of crystalline porous materials with coupled proton&#8208;electron transfer has not yet been reported to date. Herein, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF; HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36) with zwitterionic 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;carboxybenzyl)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium (H2L2+) as acceptor and 2,7&#8208;naphthalene disulfonate (NDS2&#8208;) as donor to form a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layer. Three water molecules were situated in the channels to connect with acidic species through hydrogen bonding interactions to give a 3D framework. The continuous &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions along the a axis and the smooth H&#8208;bonding chain along the b axis provide the electron and proton transfer pathways, respectively. After 405 nm light irradiation, the photogenerated radicals could simultaneously endow HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;36 with photoswitchable electron and proton conductivity due to coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer. By single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analyses, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient absorption spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the mechanism of the switchable conductivity upon irradiation has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Porous [14]Annulene Graphene Nanoribbon and a&#160;Porous [30]Annulene Graphene Nanosheet on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrical and mechanical properties of graphene&#8208;based materials can be tuned by the introduction of nanopores, which are sensitively related to the size, morphology, density, and location of nanopores. The synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional graphene nanostructures containing well&#8208;defined nonplanar nanopores has been challenging due to the intrinsic steric hindrance. Herein, we report the selective synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) containing periodic nonplanar [14]annulene pores on Ag(111) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous graphene nanosheet containing periodic nonplanar [30]annulene pores on Au(111), starting from a same precursor. The formation of distinct products on the two substrates originates from the different thermodynamics and kinetics of coupling reactions. The reaction mechanisms were confirmed by a series of control experiments, and the appropriate thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for optimizing the reaction pathways were proposed. In addition,&#160; the combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the electronic structures of porous graphene structures, demonstrating the impact of nonplanar pores on the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyolefin&#8208;Based Separator with Interfacial Chemistry Regulation for Robust Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium metal batteries (KMBs) are ideal choices for high energy density storage system owing to the low electrochemical potential and low cost of K. However, the practical KMB applications suffer from intrinsically active K anode, which would bring serious safety concerns due to easier generation of dendrites. Herein, to explore a facile approach to tackle this issue, we propose to regulate K plating/stripping via interfacial chemistry engineering of commercial polyolefin&#8208;based separator using multiple functional units integrated in tailored metal organic framework. As a case study, the functional units of MIL&#8208;101(Cr) offer high elastic modulus, facilitate the dissociation of potassium salt, improve the K+ transfer number and homogenize the K+ flux at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Benefiting from these favorable features, uniform and stable K plating/stripping is realized with the regulated separator. Full battery assembled with the regulated separator showed ~19.9% higher discharge capacity than that with glass fiber separator at 20 mA g&#8208;1 and much better cycling stability at high rates. The generality of our approach is validated with KMBs using different cathodes and electrolytes. We envision that the strategy to suppress dendrite formation by commercial separator surface engineering using tailor&#8208;designed functional units can be extended to other metal/metal ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The evaluation of the pentafluorocyclopropyl group as a chemotype in crop protection and medicinal chemistry has been hampered in the past by the lack of suitable methodologies that enable the practical incorporation of this moiety into advanced synthetic intermediates. Herein, we report the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of an unprecedented sulfonium salt, 5&#8208;(pentafluorocyclopropyl)dibenzo&#8208;thiophenium triflate, and its use as a versatile reagent for the photoinduced C&#8208;H pentafluorocyclopropylation of a broad series of non&#8208;previously functionalized (hetero)arenes through a radical mediated mechanism. The potential benefits to medicinal chemistry of the protocol developed are further demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage introduction of the pentafluorocyclopropyl unit into biologically relevant molecules and widely used pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

Herein, we report the gram-scale synthesis of an unprecedented sulfonium salt, 5-(pentafluorocyclopropyl)dibenzo-thiophenium triflate, and its use as a versatile reagent for the photoinduced C-H pentafluorocyclopropylation of a broad series of non-previously functionalized (hetero)arenes through a radical mediated mechanism. The potential benefits to medicinal chemistry of the protocol developed are further demonstrated by the late-stage introduction of the pentafluorocyclopropyl unit into biologically relevant molecules and widely used pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of the Time Scale on the Reaction Mechanism of CO Oxidation over a Au/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) cell for rapid concentration modulation and applied it to study the reaction pathway of CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 at different time scales. We found that the reaction time could influence the reaction pathway. Multiple reaction mechanisms can be present under the same reaction conditions. At long reaction times, electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) play an important role.







Abstract
Knowledge of the reaction mechanism is key for rational catalyst improvement. Traditionally mechanistic studies focus on structure and the reaction conditions like temperature, pH, pressure, etc., whereas the time dimension is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate the influence of time on the mechanism of a catalytic reaction. A dual catalytic mechanism was identified for the CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy coupled with modulation excitation spectroscopy. During the first seconds, CO on the gold particles is the only reactive species. As the reaction proceeds, the redox properties of TiO2 dominate the catalytic activity through electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). CO induces the reduction and reconstruction of TiO2 whereas oxygen leads to its oxidation. The activity of the catalyst follows the spectroscopic signature of the EMSI. These findings demonstrate the power of studying short&#8208;time kinetics for mechanistic studies.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Driven Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a concept for the generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate that is driven by substoichiometric amounts of electrons, introduced electrochemically. This protocol enables access to a variety of nitro&#8208;derived molecules from unsaturated hydrocarbons including alkenes, alkynes, and arenes, in addition to promoting ipso&#8208;nitration reactions and nitrative cyclizations with high levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce an electrochemically assisted generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate under mild reaction conditions using a simple setup with inexpensive graphite and stainless&#8208;steel electrodes. The mechanism of the reaction is supported by detailed spectroscopic and experimental studies. Powered by electricity and driven by electrons, the synthetic diversity of this reaction has been demonstrated through the development of highly efficient nitration protocols of various unsaturated hydrocarbons. In addition to a broad application area, these protocols are easy to scale for decagram quantities, and exhibit exceptional substrate generality and functional&#8208;group compatibility.

         <title>Volatile Dual&#8208;Solvent Assisted Intermediate Phase Regulation for Anti&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature stable perovskite intermediate is constructed with a dual&#8208;component volatile solvent. By suppressing the nucleation rate in volatile precursor, this strategy provides a controllable grain growth rate and wide processing window in scalable film deposition without post&#8208;treatments.







Abstract
The unprecedented development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) makes them one of the most promising candidates for terawatt&#8208;scale green energy production with low cost. However, the high boiling point solvents during the solution&#8208;processed film deposition cause anisotropic crystal growth and toxic solvent vapor during high&#8208;throughput manufacturing. Here, a dual&#8208;component green solvent consisting of isopropyl acetate and acetonitrile is proposed to form a volatile perovskite precursor, which can realize the high&#8208;quality perovskite thin film deposition by intermediate phase regulation. A room&#8208;temperature stable perovskite intermediate phase is constructed with the engagement of isopropyl acetate as co&#8208;solvent, which suppresses the exploding nucleation rate in volatile perovskite precursor, providing a fine grain growth rate and wide processing window in scalable film deposition. The corresponding PSCs fabricated by blade coating without anti&#8208;solvents or gas quenching achieve power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.37&#8201;% and 15.29&#8201;% for the areas of 14.08&#8197;cm2 and 37.83&#8197;cm2, respectively.

         <title>Photocurrent Generation and Polarity Switching in Electrochemical Cells through Light&#8208;induced Excited State Proton Transfer of Photoacids and Photobases
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism for photocurrent generation is introduced utilizing an excited state proton transfer (ESPT) mechanism of photoacids and photobases. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer. Tandem irradiation of the photoacid&#8208;photobase results in polarity switching in an H&#8208;cell photoelectrochemical configuration.







Abstract
Light is a common source of energy in sustainable technologies for photocurrent generation. To date, in such light&#8208;harvesting applications, the excited electrons generate the photocurrent. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for photocurrent generation that is based on excited state proton transfer (ESPT) of photoacids and photobases that can donate or accept a proton, respectively, but only after excitation. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can either serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes, or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer, both resulting in photocurrent generation. We further show that control of the current polarity is obtained by switching the irradiation between the photoacid and the photobase. Our study represents a new approach in photoelectrochemistry by introducing ESPT processes, which can be further utilized in light&#8208;responsive energy production or energy storage.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Dictated Regiodivergent Allylic Functionalizations via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Substitution</title>

         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent allylic C&#8722;H functionalizations were established via remote substitution, which provides a novel model for the seldomly studied migratory Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction. 1,4&#8208;Hydrofunctionalization of a conjugated diene intermediate was demonstrated to be feasible via a newly synthesized bisphosphine ligand.







Abstract
Different from classical allylic substitutions that require a vicinal leaving group, an olefin bearing a remote leaving group is scarcely viewed as a potential allylation substrate. Herein, we describe feasible protocols to achieve regiodivergent allylic C&#8722;H functionalizations via palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote substitution, which provides a novel strategy for the seldomly studied migratory Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction. Dictated by a suitable ligand, a process that involved 4,3&#8208;hydrofunctionalization of the generated conjugated diene intermediate via metal walking is observed in generally &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 regioselectivity. Unexpectedly, a related 1,4&#8208;hydrofunctionalization pathway is found to be a major route with a newly synthesized electron&#8208;rich bisphosphine ligand, which challenges the conventional viewpoint on the potential regioselectivity of hydrofunctionalizations of linear internal conjugated dienes via &#951;3&#8208;substitution. A series of deuterium experiments and kinetic studies provide a preliminary insight into the potential catalytic cycle.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Optimization of Photochemical Reactions using Segmented&#8208;Flow Nanoelectrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Segmented&#8208;flow mass spectrometry was used to enable the rapid screening of nanomole&#8208;scale photoredox reactions for drug discovery. Nanoelectrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry analysis was carried out at throughputs as high as 2.9&#8197;samples/s, allowing for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug scaffolds as well as the subsequent structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) evaluation of prepared analogues.







Abstract
Within the realm of drug discovery, high&#8208;throughput experimentation techniques enable the rapid optimization of reactions and expedited generation of drug compound libraries for biological and pharmacokinetic evaluation. Herein we report the development of a segmented flow mass spectrometry&#8208;based platform to enable the rapid exploration of photoredox reactions for early&#8208;stage drug discovery. Specifically, microwell plate&#8208;based photochemical reaction screens were reformatted to segmented flow format to enable delivery to nanoelectrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry analysis. This approach was demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug scaffolds, as well as the subsequent structure&#8211;activity relationship evaluation of synthesized analogs. This technology is anticipated to expand the robust capabilities of photoredox catalysis in drug discovery by enabling high&#8208;throughput library diversification.

         <title>Controlled Grafting Expansion Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a trifunctional probe to combine covalent binding to the target protein, gel linkage and fluorescent labeling in one small molecule. Addition of the crosslinker AcX further increases the monomer density on the target surface. This results in increased grafting and thus higher retention of the fluorescent signal compared to a commercial dye that lacks the monomer group.







Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) is a recently developed technique that allows for the resolution of structures below the diffraction limit by physically enlarging a hydrogel&#8208;embedded facsimile of the biological sample. The target structure is labeled and this label must be retained in a relative position true to the original, smaller state before expansion by linking it into the gel. However, gel formation and digestion lead to a significant loss in target&#8208;delivered label, resulting in weak signal. To overcome this problem, we have here developed an agent combining targeting, fluorescent labeling and gel linkage in a single small molecule. Similar approaches in the past have still suffered from significant loss of label. Here we show that this loss is due to insufficient surface grafting of fluorophores into the hydrogel and develop a solution by increasing the amount of target&#8208;bound monomers. Overall, we obtain a significant improvement in fluorescence signal retention and our new dye allows the resolution of nuclear pores as ring&#8208;like structures, similar to STED microscopy. We furthermore provide mechanistic insight into dye retention in ExM.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Dendronized Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable luminescent radicals have been achieved by dendronization up to the fourth generation of tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radicals with carbazole groups. The emission blue&#8208;shifts from G2 (691&#8197;nm) to G4 (627&#8197;nm) as a result of reduced electron repulsion in the larger carbazole dendrons. The G4 dendrimer showed the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 63&#8201;% in cyclohexane solution.







Abstract
A series of carbazole&#8208;dendronized tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radicals have been synthesized. The photophysical properties of dendronized radicals up to the fourth generation were compared systematically to understand how structure&#8211;property relationships evolve with generation. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was found to increase with the increasing generation, and the fourth generation (G4TTM) in cyclohexane solution showed a PLQY as high as 63&#8201;% at a wavelength of 627&#8197;nm (in the deep&#8208;red region) from the doublet state. The dendron modification strategy also showed a blue&#8208;shift of the emission on increasing the generation number, and the photostability was also increased compared to the bare TTM radical.

         <title>Supramolecular Copolymers Under Kinetic, Thermodynamic, or Pathway&#8208;Switching Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms and kinetic pathways of IrIII complex monomers has led to their block co&#8208;assembly through kinetic control and pathway&#8208;switching control, respectively. The well&#8208;defined block microstructure has been characterized by TEM and SEM. The present research approach will be an important step forward in the study of the self&#8208;assembly of small molecules that can form crystalline assemblies.







Abstract
Supramolecular copolymers have attracted much attention due to their potential functionalities. However, the co&#8208;assembly strategies to construct co&#8208;assemblies of small molecules with well&#8208;defined sequence structures are still limited, especially for more complex crystalline block co&#8208;assemblies. Herein, we target this challenge by designing IrIII complexes 1 and 2, which possess unique self&#8208;assembly pathways and are capable of forming crystalline assemblies in aqueous systems. Specifically, block and random co&#8208;assemblies of 1 and 2 can be synthesized by kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. Meanwhile, by adjusting the water content to orthogonalize the on&#8208;pathway and the off&#8208;pathway, an unprecedented pathway&#8208;switching approach is realized to synthesize block and random co&#8208;assemblies. By coupling the kinetic pathways, the present co&#8208;assembly strategies are expected to pave the way for the synthesis of crystalline co&#8208;assemblies of small molecules and the construction of organic heterostructures.

         <title>Modulation of Uptake and Reactivity of Nitrogen Dioxide in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of NO2 is modulated in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3, which leads to reaction between NO2 and framework Cl&#8722; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A higher NO2 dynamic uptake (6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) is achieved, compared with the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305 (2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
We report the modulation of reactivity of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 in which unbound N&#8208;centres are methylated and the cationic charge counter&#8208;balanced by Cl&#8722; ions in the pores. Uptake of NO2 into MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 leads to reaction between NO2 and Cl&#8722; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A high dynamic uptake of 6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K is observed for MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 as measured using a flow of 500&#8197;ppm NO2 in He. In contrast, the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305, shows a much lower uptake of 2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The binding domains and reactivity of adsorbed NO2 molecules within MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 and MFM&#8208;305 have been probed using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and by electron paramagnetic resonance, high&#8208;field solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and UV/Vis spectroscopies. The design of charged porous sorbents provides a new platform to control the reactivity of corrosive air pollutants.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions. A higher NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dynamic uptake (6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is achieved, compared with the analogous neutral material, MFM-305 (2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the modulation of reactivity of nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material, MFM-305-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in which unbound N-centres are methylated and the cationic charge counter-balanced by Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the pores. Uptake of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into MFM-305-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; leads to reaction between NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions. A high dynamic uptake of 6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 298&#8197;K is observed for MFM-305-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as measured using a flow of 500&#8197;ppm NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in He. In contrast, the analogous neutral material, MFM-305, shows a much lower uptake of 2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The binding domains and reactivity of adsorbed NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules within MFM-305-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and MFM-305 have been probed using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and by electron paramagnetic resonance, high-field solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and UV/Vis spectroscopies. The design of charged porous sorbents provides a new platform to control the reactivity of corrosive air pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal Formation Mechanism of Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures Dominated by Concentration Waves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal formation mechanism of hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS) via the sequential templating approach (STA) is elucidated, which is dominated by concentration waves of precursors. These significant insights into STA will usher in a new era for this burgeoning field, inspiring the development of precise, novel synthetic methods to uncover more smart dynamic behaviors of HoMS.







Abstract
Hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS), a new family of hierarchical nano/micro&#8208;structured materials, have evoked intensive studies to discover their unique temporal&#8208;spatial ordering features. The theoretical understanding of the general synthetic methods of HoMS, i.e. the sequential templating approach (STA), makes it possible to understand, predict, and control the shell formation process. Herein, a mathematical model is established based on the experiment results, which reveal the appearance of concentration waves in the STA. The numerical simulation results not only correspond well to the experimental observations but also explain the regulation methods. Whereby, the underlying physical essence of STA is elucidated, suggesting that HoMS is the concrete representation of the concentration waves. Thereafter the formation of HoMS is not limited to the solid&#8208;gas reactions through high&#8208;temperature calcination, but could be extended to solution systems under low&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Construction of Boron&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Enriched Nanoporous &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Networks Towards Enhanced Hydrogen Activation</title>

Boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;enriched nanoporous &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks were constructed by an ionothermal procedure. The obtained materials demonstrated profound H2 activation/dissociation capabilities and promising hydrogenation activities.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;enriched scaffolds have demonstrated unique features and promising performance in the field of catalysis towards the activation of small gas molecules. However, there is still a lack of facile approaches capable of achieving high B doping and abundant porous channels in the targeted catalysts. Herein, construction of boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;enriched nanoporous &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks (BN&#8208;NCNs) was achieved via a facile ionothermal polymerization procedure with hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile [HAT(CN)6] sodium borohydride as the starting materials. The as&#8208;produced BN&#8208;NCN scaffolds were featured by high heteroatoms doping (B up to 23&#8197;wt.&#8201;% and N: up to 17&#8197;wt.&#8201;%) and permanent porosity (surface area up to 759&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 mainly contributed by micropores). With the unsaturated bonded B species acting as the active Lewis acid sites and defected N species acting as the active Lewis base sites, those BN&#8208;NCNs delivered attractive catalytic performance towards H2 activation/dissociation in both gaseous and liquid phase, acting as efficient metal&#8208;free heterogeneous frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) catalysts in hydrogenation procedures.

         <title>Colossal Anisotropic Thermal Expansion through Coupling Spin Crossover and Rhombus Deformation in a Hexanuclear {FeIII4FeII2} Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hexanuclear spin crossover compound [(Tp*)FeIII(CN)3]4[FeII(Ppmp)]2&#8901;2&#8201;CH3OH (1) was synthesized by assembling the spin crossover FeII units and asymmetric Ppmp ligands into a rhombic core structure. It showed the colossal positive and negative anisotropic thermal expansion coupled with spin transition.







Abstract
Colossal and anisotropic thermal expansion is a key function for microscale or nanoscale actuators in material science. Herein, we present a hexanuclear compound of [(Tp*)FeIII(CN)3]4[FeII(Ppmp)]2&#8901;2&#8201;CH3OH (1, Tp*=hydrotris(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate and Ppmp=2&#8208;[3&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl]pyridine), which has a rhombic core structure abbreviated as {FeIII2FeII2}. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed that 1 underwent thermally&#8208;induced spin transition with the thermal hysteresis. The FeII site in 1 behaved as a spin crossover (SCO) unit, and significant deformation of its octahedron was observed during the spin transition process. Moreover, the distortion of the FeII centers actuated anisotropic deformation of the rhombic {FeIII2FeII2} core, which was spread over the whole crystal through the subsequent molecular rearrangements, leading to the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion. Our results provide a rational strategy for realizing the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion and shape memory effects by tuning the magnetic bistability.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Rh on High&#8208;Index CeO2 Facet for Highly Enhanced Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new atom&#8208;trapping process in a confined space for anchoring isolated Rh atoms on the high&#8208;Index {210} facets of CeO2. Benefiting from the unique capability of CeO2 {210} in generating oxygen vacancies, the obtained catalysts exhibit outstanding catalytic CO oxidation performance.







Abstract
Reducible oxide&#8208;supported noble metal nanoparticles exhibit high activity in catalyzing many important oxidation reactions. However, atom migration under harsh reaction conditions leads to deactivation of the catalyst. Meanwhile, single&#8208;atom catalysts demonstrate enhanced stability, but often suffer from poor catalytic activity owing to the ionized surface states. In this work, we simultaneously address the poor activity and stability issues by synthesizing highly active and durable rhodium (Rh) single&#8208;atom catalysts through a &#8220;wrap&#8208;bake&#8208;peel&#8221; process. The pre&#8208;coated SiO2 layer during synthesis of catalyst plays a crucial role in not only protecting CeO2 support against sintering, but also donating electron to weaken the Ce&#8722;O bond, producing highly loaded Rh single atoms on the CeO2 support exposed with high&#8208;index {210} facets. Benefiting from the unique electronic structure of CeO2 {210} facets, more oxygen vacancies are generated along with the deposition of more electropositive Rh single atoms, leading to remarkably improved catalytic performance in CO oxidation.

The pre-coated SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer during synthesis of catalyst plays a crucial role in not only protecting CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support against sintering, but also donating electron to weaken the Ce&#8722;O bond, producing highly loaded Rh single atoms on the CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support exposed with high-index {210} facets. Benefiting from the unique electronic structure of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {210} facets, more oxygen vacancies are generated along with the deposition of more electropositive Rh single atoms, leading to remarkably improved catalytic performance in CO oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;Enabled Cell&#8208;Surface Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling toward More Efficient Capture of Physically Interacting Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#8208;1O2&#8208;hydrazide system is a photocatalytic proximity labeling system on the cell surface, which enables a more efficient capture of physically interacting cells. This system can be employed to identify trace cellular interactions and serves as a &#8220;live&#8221; TCR multimer to discriminate dendritic cells presenting different antigens, which paves the way for exploring the heterogeneity of antigen&#8208;presenting cells.







Abstract
Intercellular proximity labeling has emerged as a promising approach to enable the study of cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs), but the efficiency of current platforms is limited. Here, we use Ru(bpy)32+ to construct an efficient photocatalytic proximity labeling (PPL) system on the cell surface that allows the highly discriminative CCI detection with spatiotemporal resolution. Through the mechanism study and quantitative characterization on living cells, we demonstrate that the singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) mechanism is more efficient and specific than the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism in Ru&#8208;mediated PPL. Ru(bpy)32+ catalysts with different cell&#8208;anchoring moieties are prepared to facilitate the catalyst loading on primary cells. Finally, based on this system, we develop a &#8220;live&#8221; T cell receptor (TCR) multimer with TCR&#8208;T cells that could sensitively identify and discriminate cells presenting antigens of different affinity, providing a powerful tool to better understand the heterogeneity of antigen presenting cells.

         <title>Highly Active Hydrogen&#8208;rich Photothermal Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction on Ni/LaInO3 Perovskite Catalysts with Near&#8208;unity Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni/LaInO3 was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal CO2 conversion with a high CO yield rate (1314&#8197;mmol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity. LaInO3 was enriched with extensive oxygen vacancies to adsorb CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway and the photoinduced charge transfer process to reduce the reaction active energy.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is regarded green and promising in controlling the reaction gas ratio in Fischer Tropsch synthesis. But it is inclined to produce more byproducts in high H2 concentration condition. Herein, LaInO3 loaded with Ni&#8208;nanoparticles (Ni NPs) was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal RWGS reaction rate, where LaInO3 was enriched with oxygen vacancies to roundly adsorbing CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni NPs endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. The optimized catalyst performed a large CO yield rate (1314&#8197;mmol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway of the reaction and photoinduced charge transfer process for reducing the RWGS reaction active energy. Our work provides valuable insights on the construction of catalysts concerning products selectivity and photoelectronic activating mechanism on CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>An Implantable Fiber Biosupercapacitor with High Power Density by Multi&#8208;Strand Twisting Functionalized Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable fiber biosupercapacitor with high power density of 22.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is created by design of a multi&#8208;strand twisted structure. It can be successfully operated in vivo and is demonstrated to achieve the electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve.







Abstract
Biosupercapacitors (BSCs) that can harvest and store chemical energy show great promise for power delivery of biological applications. However, low power density still limits their applications, especially as miniaturized implants. Here, we report an implantable fiber BSC with maximal power density of 22.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to the previous reports. The fiber BSC was fabricated by integrating anode and cathode fibers of biofuel cell with supercapacitor fibers through multi&#8208;strand twisting. This twisting structure endowed many channels inside and high electrochemical active area for efficient mass diffusion and charge transfer among different fibers, benefiting high power output. The obtained thin and flexible fiber BSC operated stably under deformations and performed high biocompatibility after implantation. Eventually, the fiber BSC was implanted subcutaneously in rats and successfully realized electrical stimulation of sciatic nerve, showing promise as a power source in vivo.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Deoxidizing Electrolyte Additive Enables Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a major cause of Zn corrosion and by&#8208;product precipitation during battery resting, usually attributed to protons. To tackle DO&#8208;induced issues, a chemical strategy for self&#8208;deoxygenation is proposed. As a proof of concept, sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) is introduced as a self&#8208;deoxidizing additive, effectively improving the stability of Zn in aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
In aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries, the Zn anode suffers from severe corrosion reactions and consequent dendrite growth troubles that cause fast performance decay. Herein, we uncover the corrosion mechanism and confirm that the dissolved oxygen (DO) other than the reputed proton is a principal origin of Zn corrosion and by&#8208;product precipitates, especially during the initial battery resting period. In a break from common physical deoxygenation methods, we propose a chemical self&#8208;deoxygenation strategy to tackle the DO&#8208;induced hazards. As a proof of concept, sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) is introduced to aqueous electrolytes as a self&#8208;deoxidizing additive. As a result, the Zn anode sustains a long&#8208;term cycling of 2500&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and over 1100&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 together with a high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6&#8201;%. The full cells also show a high capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles. Our findings provide a renewed understanding of Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolytes and also a practical solution towards industrializing aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Step Nucleation of a Crystalline Silicate Framework via a Structurally Precise Prenucleation Cluster</title>

In situ characterizations reveal a multi&#8208;step crystallization pathway for cyclosilicate hydrate crystals that starts with the formation of structurally precise prenucleation clusters, which comprise the secondary building units of this framework lattice.







Abstract
Hierarchical nucleation pathways are ubiquitous in the synthesis of minerals and materials. In the case of zeolites and metal&#8211;organic frameworks, pre&#8208;organized multi&#8208;ion &#8220;secondary building units&#8221; (SBUs) have been proposed as fundamental building blocks. However, detailing the progress of multi&#8208;step reaction mechanisms from monomeric species to stable crystals and defining the structures of the SBUs remains an unmet challenge. Combining in situ nuclear magnetic resonance, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy, we show that crystallization of the framework silicate, cyclosilicate hydrate, occurs through an assembly of cubic octameric Q38 polyanions formed through cross&#8208;linking and polymerization of smaller silicate monomers and other oligomers. These Q38 are stabilized by hydrogen bonds with surrounding H2O and tetramethylammonium ions (TMA+). When Q38 levels reach a threshold of &#8776;32&#8201;% of the total silicate species, nucleation occurs. Further growth proceeds through the incorporation of [(TMA)x(Q38)&#8901;n&#8201;H2O](x&#8722;8) clathrate complexes into step edges on the crystals.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Conjugated Dienes with Tertiary Silanes Controlled by Hemilabile Hybrid P,O Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hemilabile P,O&#8208;type ligands, N&#8208;disulfonyl bicyclic bridgehead phosphorus triamides, are developed. The use of P,O ligands has not only significantly improved reactivity for Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation with tertiary silanes but has also achieved an unprecedented regioselectivity for Pd&#8208;catalyzed diene functionalization towards 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation.







Abstract
Novel P,O&#8208;type ligands, N&#8208;disulfonyl bicyclic bridgehead phosphorus triamides, were synthesized and utilized in Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation involving tertiary silanes, unactivated alkenes, and conjugated dienes. The ligand displayed a remarkable level of reactivity for alkene hydrosilylation with tertiary silanes and its use resulted in a significant improvement in the regioselectivity of diene hydrosilylation towards 1,2&#8208;hydrosilylation. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis confirmed the bidentate nature of the ligand, with coordination of phosphorus and oxygen. Control experiments provided evidence for the formation of Pd0 species and the reversibility of Pd&#8722;H insertion in the reaction mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) computations supported the importance of the hemilabile P,O ligand in stabilizing both the rate&#8208;determining transition state of Pd&#8722;H insertion and the transition state of reductive elimination that determines the regioselectivity.

         <title>Optically Controlled Construction of Three&#8208;Dimensional Protein Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible approach for the preparation of photo&#8208;responsive three&#8208;dimensional protein crystals is reported by using a light&#8208;sensitive cationic azobenzene dye. Adjusting the azobenzene dye isomerization kinetics realizes control over the crystal domain size: while direct mixing the two components yields small crystallites, reducing the isomerization rate of the azobenzene eventually leads to the formation of protein single crystals.







Abstract
Protein crystallization is an important tool for structural biology and nanostructure preparation. Here, we report on kinetic pathway&#8208;dependent protein crystals that are controlled by light. Photo&#8208;responsive crystallites are obtained by complexing the model proteins with cationic azobenzene dyes. The crystalline state is readily switched to a dispersed phase under ultraviolet light and restored by subsequent visible&#8208;light illumination. The switching can be reversibly repeated for multiple cycles without noticeable structure deterioration. Importantly, the photo&#8208;treatment not only significantly increases the crystallinity, but creates crystallites at conditions where no ordered lattices are observed upon directly mixing the components. Further control over the azobenzene isomerization kinetics produces protein single crystals of up to &#8776;50&#8197;&#956;m. This approach offers an intriguing method to fabricate metamaterials and study optically controlled crystallization.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Synthesis of Solution&#8208;Processable van der Waals Heterostructures through Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method is demonstrated for the preparation of high&#8208;quality van der Waals heterostructures in solution through an electrochemical strategy. The produced van der Waals heterostructures exhibit strong interlayer coupling, extraordinary structural integrity, large lateral dimension and good optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (2D vdWHs) have recently gained widespread attention because of their abundant and exotic properties, which open up many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. However, practical applications remain challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;throughput techniques for fabricating high&#8208;quality vdWHs. Here, we demonstrate a general electrochemical strategy to prepare solution&#8208;processable high&#8208;quality vdWHs, in which electrostatic forces drive the stacking of electrochemically exfoliated individual assemblies with intact structures and clean interfaces into vdWHs with strong interlayer interactions. Thanks to the excellent combination of strong light absorption, interfacial charge transfer, and decent charge transport properties in individual layers, thin&#8208;film photodetectors based on graphene/In2Se3 vdWHs exhibit great promise for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodetection, owing to a high responsivity (267&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1), fast rise (72&#8197;ms) and decay (426&#8197;ms) times under NIR illumination. This approach enables various hybrid systems, including graphene/In2Se3, graphene/MoS2 and graphene/MoSe2 vdWHs, providing a broad avenue for exploring emerging electronic, photonic, and exotic quantum phenomena.

         <title>Stabilizing Interfaces in High&#8208;Temperature NCM811&#8208;Li Batteries via Tuning Terminal Alkyl Chains of Ether Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose that by extending the terminal groups of glycol diethers from methyl groups to n&#8208;butyl groups, the comprehensive stability of ether electrolytes can be improved. An anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is realized at 1&#8197;M. The electrode&#8208;electrolyte interactions are suppressed, and a thinner, denser, and more inorganic&#8208;rich SEI/CEI is achieved. The surface phase transition and structural degradation of the NCM811 cathode are also alleviated.







Abstract
Ether electrolytes are promising for lithium metal batteries. Despite the intensive research in recent years, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ether electrolytes still cannot form reliable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces in NCM811&#8208;Li batteries at diluted concentrations, especially in those operating at elevated temperatures. We report a simple but effective strategy to break this bottleneck and stabilize interfaces in high&#8208;temperature NCM811&#8208;Li batteries in ether electrolytes. We propose that by gradually extending the terminal groups of glycol diethers from methyl groups to n&#8208;butyl groups, the comprehensive stability of ether electrolytes is improved. An anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is realized at a concentration of 1&#8197;M. Accordingly, the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interactions are suppressed, and a thinner, denser, and more inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208; /cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface is achieved. Additionally, the surface phase transition and structural degradation of NCM811 cathode are alleviated. Consequently, in the ethylene glycol dibutyl ether&#8208;based electrolyte, the Coulombic efficiency for Li&#8722;Cu cells working at 60&#8201;&#176;C is boosted to 99.41&#8201;% with a cycling life of over 200&#8197;cycles. The lifespan of high&#8208;temperature NCM811&#8208;Li cells is prolonged by more than 400&#8201;% with a stable average Coulombic efficiency of 99.77&#8201;% at quasi&#8208;practical conditions of 50&#8197;&#956;m Li, lean electrolyte of 10&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1, and medium&#8208;high cathode loading of &gt;2.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;We propose that by extending the terminal groups of glycol diethers from methyl groups to &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyl groups, the comprehensive stability of ether electrolytes can be improved. An anion-dominated solvation structure is realized at 1&#8197;M. The electrode-electrolyte interactions are suppressed, and a thinner, denser, and more inorganic-rich SEI/CEI is achieved. The surface phase transition and structural degradation of the NCM811 cathode are also alleviated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ether electrolytes are promising for lithium metal batteries. Despite the intensive research in recent years, most state-of-the-art ether electrolytes still cannot form reliable electrode-electrolyte interfaces in NCM811-Li batteries at diluted concentrations, especially in those operating at elevated temperatures. We report a simple but effective strategy to break this bottleneck and stabilize interfaces in high-temperature NCM811-Li batteries in ether electrolytes. We propose that by gradually extending the terminal groups of glycol diethers from methyl groups to &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyl groups, the comprehensive stability of ether electrolytes is improved. An anion-dominated solvation structure is realized at a concentration of 1&#8197;M. Accordingly, the electrode-electrolyte interactions are suppressed, and a thinner, denser, and more inorganic-rich solid- /cathode-electrolyte interface is achieved. Additionally, the surface phase transition and structural degradation of NCM811 cathode are alleviated. Consequently, in the ethylene glycol dibutyl ether-based electrolyte, the Coulombic efficiency for Li&#8722;Cu cells working at 60&#8201;&#176;C is boosted to 99.41&#8201;% with a cycling life of over 200&#8197;cycles. The lifespan of high-temperature NCM811-Li cells is prolonged by more than 400&#8201;% with a stable average Coulombic efficiency of 99.77&#8201;% at quasi-practical conditions of 50&#8197;&#956;m Li, lean electrolyte of 10&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and medium-high cathode loading of &amp;gt;2.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantitative Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS) Imaging of Individual Vesicles to Investigate the Relation between Fraction of Chemical Release and Vesicle Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging were used to measure vesicle size and vesicular isotopic dopamine content in cellular vesicles. Measurements before and after stimulated exocytotic release show the fraction of chemical release is independent of vesicle size.







Abstract
We used correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging to quantify the contents of subvesicular compartments, and to measure the partial release fraction of 13C&#8208;dopamine in cellular nanovesicles as a function of size. Three modes of exocytosis comprise full release, kiss&#8208;and&#8208;run, and partial release. The latter has been subject to scientific debate, despite a growing amount of supporting literature. We tailored culturing procedures to alter vesicle size and definitively show no size correlation with the fraction of partial release. In NanoSIMS images, vesicle content was indicated by the presence of isotopic dopamine, while vesicles which underwent partial release were identified by the presence of an 127I&#8208;labelled drug, to which they were exposed during exocytosis allowing entry into the open vesicle prior to its closing again. Demonstration of similar partial release fractions indicates that this mode of exocytosis is predominant across a wide range of vesicle sizes.

         <title>Regulation of Atomic Fe&#8208;Spin State by Crystal Field and Magnetic Field for Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen electrocatalysis on iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) catalysts is highly correlated to the spin configuration of Fe active sites. A crystal field and magnetic field synergetic strategy is proposed to regulate spin state of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C from low spin (LS) to intermediate spin (MS) and high spin (HS), and the high spin FeIII&#8722;N&#8722;C is the most favorable for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Highly&#8208;active and low&#8208;cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution are essential in rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries, and single atom catalysts with Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C are promising candidates. However, the activity still needs to be boosted, and the origination of spin&#8208;related oxygen catalytic performance is still uncertain. Herein, an effective strategy to regulate local spin state of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C through manipulating crystal field and magnetic field is proposed. The spin state of atomic Fe can be regulated from low spin to intermediate spin and to high spin. The cavitation of dxz and dyz orbitals of high spin FeIII can optimize the O2 adsorption and promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*O2 to *OOH). Benefiting from these merits, the high spin Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst displays the highest oxygen electrocatalytic activities. Furthermore, the high spin Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;based rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery displays a high power density of 170&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good stability.

         <title>An ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Mediates Disulfide Migration in the Biosynthesis of Epidithiodiketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide in pretrichodermamide A involves the formation of an &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by the oxygenase TdaR containing the canonical CXXC motif, followed by disulfide migration by the oxygenase TdaE containing a specialized CXXQ motif, via an ortho&#8208;quinone methide intermediate. The enzymatic cascade reactions can be considered as a general catalytic mechanism for &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide formation in epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs).







Abstract
The transannular disulfide functions as a key structural element imparting diverse biological activities to epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs). Although mechanisms were proposed in previous studies, &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide formation in ETPs is not well&#8208;determined owing to the failure to identify the hypothetical intermediate. Herein, we characterize the key ortho&#8208;quinone methide (o&#8208;QM) intermediate and prove its involvement in the carbon&#8208;sulfur migration from an &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208; to an &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by elucidating pretrichodermamide A biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by a FAD&#8208;dependent thioredoxin oxygenase TdaE harboring a noncanonical CXXQ motif. Biochemical investigations of recombinant TdaE and mutants demonstrated that the construction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide was initiated by Gln140 triggering proton abstraction for generation of the essential o&#8208;QM intermediate, accompanied by &#946;&#8242;&#8208;acetoxy elimination. Subsequent attack on the &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;disulfide by Cys137 led to disulfide migration and spirofuran formation. This study expands the biocatalytic toolbox for transannular disulfide formation and sets the stage for the targeted discovery of bioactive ETPs.

         <title>Robust and Wide Temperature&#8208;Range Zinc Metal Batteries with Unique Electrolyte and Substrate Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical zinc metal battery with high coulombic efficiency and long cycle life over a wide temperature range was constructed by using a weakly solvating &#947;&#8208;valerolactone&#8208;based electrolyte and a nanocarbon&#8208;coated aluminum substrate with chemical stability and good homogenized electron/ion distribution.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc metal batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical application is limited by harsh issues such as uncontrollable dendrite growth, low Coulombic efficiency, and poor temperature tolerance. Herein, a unique design strategy using &#947;&#8208;valerolactone&#8208;based electrolyte and nanocarbon&#8208;coated aluminum substrate was reported to solve the above problems. The electrolyte with extremely low freezing point and high thermal stability enables the symmetric cells with long cycle life over a wide temperature range (&#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C) due to its ability to regulate zinc nucleation and preferential epitaxial growth. Besides, the nanocarbon&#8208;coated aluminum substrate can also promote a higher Coulombic efficiency over a wide temperature range in contrast to the low Coulombic efficiency of copper substrates with significant irreversible alloying reactions because this unique substrate with excellent chemical stabilization can homogenize the interfacial electron/ion distribution. The optimized zinc metal capacitors can operate stably under various temperature conditions (2000&#8197;cycles at 30&#8201;&#176;C with 66&#8201;% depth of discharge and 1200&#8197;cycles at 80&#8201;&#176;C with 50&#8201;% depth of discharge). This unique electrolyte and substrate design strategy achieves a robust zinc metal battery over a wide temperature range.

The electrolyte with extremely low freezing point and high thermal stability enables the symmetric cells with long cycle life over a wide temperature range (&#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C) due to its ability to regulate zinc nucleation and preferential epitaxial growth. Besides, the nanocarbon-coated aluminum substrate can also promote a higher Coulombic efficiency over a wide temperature range in contrast to the low Coulombic efficiency of copper substrates with significant irreversible alloying reactions because this unique substrate with excellent chemical stabilization can homogenize the interfacial electron/ion distribution. The optimized zinc metal capacitors can operate stably under various temperature conditions (2000&#8197;cycles at 30&#8201;&#176;C with 66&#8201;% depth of discharge and 1200&#8197;cycles at 80&#8201;&#176;C with 50&#8201;% depth of discharge). This unique electrolyte and substrate design strategy achieves a robust zinc metal battery over a wide temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct and Indirect Evolution of Photoluminescent Semiconductor CdS Magic&#8208;Size Clusters through Their Precursor Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>

Non&#8208;photoluminescent (PL) CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). The MSCs evolve from their counterpart precursor compounds (PCs), which are relatively transparent in optical absorption. The non&#8208;absorbing PCs assist the transformation of the absorbing MSCs. Monomer substitution is involved in the PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization, and monomer addition in the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation.







Abstract
Colloidal semiconductor II&#8211;VI metal chalcogenide (ME) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) exhibit either an optical absorption singlet or doublet. In the latter case, a sharp photoluminescence (PL) signal is observed. Whether the PL&#8208;inactive MSCs transform to the PL&#8208;active ones is unknown. We show that PL&#8208;inactive CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL&#8208;active CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). MSC&#8208;322 displays a sharp absorption at &#8776;322&#8197;nm, whereas MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 both have broad absorptions respectively around 328 and 373&#8197;nm. In a reaction of cadmium myristate and S powder in 1&#8208;octadecene, MSC&#8208;322 develops; with HOAc, MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 are present. We propose that the MSCs evolve from their relatively transparent precursor compounds (PCs). The PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization involves monomer substitution, while monomer addition occurs for the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation. Our findings suggest that S dominates the precursor self&#8208;assembly quantitatively, and ligand&#8208;bonded Cd mainly controls MSC optical properties.

         <title>A Chemically Bonded Ultraconformal Layer between the Elastic Solid Electrolyte and Lithium Anode for High&#8208;performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a vapor&#8208;phase fluorination approach to build a lithiophilic surface on elastic rubber&#8208;derived electrolytes, which results in a ultraconformal, chemically bonded, mechanically integral LiF&#8208;rich layer after electrochemical operation. Lithium metal batteries containing the novel electrolyte have an ultralong cycling life of 2500&#8197;h and deliver a high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in lithium symmetric cells as well as showing good stability over 300&#8197;cycles in a full cell.







Abstract
Although high ionic conductivities have been achieved in most solid&#8208;state electrolytes used in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), rapid and stable lithium&#8208;ion transport between solid&#8208;state electrolytes and lithium anodes remains a great challenge due to the high interfacial impedances and infinite volume changes of metallic lithium. In this work, a chemical vapor&#8208;phase fluorination approach is developed to establish a lithiophilic surface on rubber&#8208;derived electrolytes, which results in the formation of a resilient, ultrathin, and mechanically integral LiF&#8208;rich layer after electrochemical cycling. The resulting ultraconformal layer chemically connects the electrolyte and lithium anode and maintains dynamic contact during operation, thus facilitating rapid and stable lithium&#8208;ion transport across interfaces, as well as promoting uniform lithium deposition and inhibiting side reactions between electrolyte components and metallic lithium. LMBs containing the novel electrolyte have an ultralong cycling life of 2500&#8197;h and deliver a high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in lithium symmetric cells as well as showing good stability over 300&#8197;cycles in a full cell.

         <title>Covalent Scrambling in Porous Polyarylthioethers through a Stepwise SNAr for Tunable Bandgap and Porosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conventional polycondensation reaction can provide the simplest route to generating porous poly(aryl thioether)s. Controlling the temperature orients the reaction toward the regioselective multi&#8208;substitution of aryl fluorides, demonstrating a stepwise change in the porosity and optical band gap of the poly(aryl thioether)s.







Abstract
Porous poly(aryl thioether)s offer stability and electronic tunability by robust sulfur&#8208;aryl conjugated architecture, but synthetic access is hindered due to limited control over the nucleophilic nature of sulfides and the air sensitivity of aromatic thiols. Here, we report a simple, one&#8208;pot, inexpensive, regioselective synthesis of highly porous poly(aryl thioether)s through polycondensation of perfluoroaromatic compounds with sodium sulfide. The unprecedented temperature&#8208;dependent para&#8208;directing formation of thioether linkages leads to a stepwise transition of the polymer extension into a network, thereby allowing fine control of the porosity and optical band gaps. The obtained porous organic polymers with ultra&#8208;microporosity (&lt;1&#8197;nm) and sulfur as the surface functional groups show size&#8208;dependent separation of organic micropollutants and selective removal of mercury ions from water. Our findings offer easy access to poly(aryl thioether)s with accessible sulfur functionalities and higher complexity, which will help in realizing advanced synthetic designs in applications such as adsorption, (photo)catalysis, and (opto)electronics.

An innovative intramolecular oxidative coupling between a ketone and a Weinreb amide was developed for the assembly of the complex 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane core structure of sarpagine alkaloids. Precise late&#8208;stage functional&#8208;group manipulation of the ketone and the Weinreb amide enabled the divergent synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;trinervine, (+)&#8208;vellosimine, (+)&#8208;normacusine&#8197;B, and (&#8722;)&#8208;alstomutinine&#8197;C.







Abstract
Sarpagine alkaloids are bioactive indole natural products that contain a highly rigid indole&#8208;fused 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, more than 100 members of which have been identified. Herein, a detailed examination of the intramolecular oxidative coupling between a ketone and a Weinreb amide for assembling the complex 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane core structure of sarpagine family alkaloids is described. Precise late&#8208;stage manipulations of the ketone and Weinreb amide enable the divergent syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;trinervine, (+)&#8208;vellosimine, (+)&#8208;normacusine&#8197;B, and (&#8722;)&#8208;alstomutinine&#8197;C. Other notable transformations of the synthesis featured an aza&#8208;Achmatowicz/indole cyclization cascade to generate the azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane structure, a regioselective elimination reaction to form the ethylidene motif embedded in the (+)&#8208;vellosimine and (+)&#8208;normacusine&#8197;B structures, and a diastereoselective indole oxidative rearrangement to form the spirooxindole structure in (&#8722;)&#8208;alstomutinine&#8197;C.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Bio&#8208;Based Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Furanic Platforms as Biomass Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we overcome current limitations of biomass furanic platforms, namely the lack of sustainable nitrogen in cellulose&#8208;based furfurals and the lack of reactivity of chitin&#8208;based ones. To this end, a tandem dehydration/oxidative cleavage of N&#8208;acetylglucosamine delivers a new nitrogen&#8208;rich furfural. We further demonstrate the utility of the new furan as a valuable monomer for synthetic chemistry and as a bioconjugation tool.







Abstract
The demand for new biomass&#8208;derived fine and commodity chemicals propels the discovery of new methodologies and synthons. Whereas furfural and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural are cornerstones of sustainable chemistry, 3&#8208;acetamido&#8208;5&#8208;acetyl furan (3A5AF), an N&#8208;rich furan obtained from chitin biomass, remains unexplored, due to the poor reactivity of the acetyl group relative to previous furanic aldehydes. Here we developed a reactive 3&#8208;acetamido&#8208;5&#8208;furfuryl aldehyde (3A5F) and demonstrated the utility of this synthon as a source of bio&#8208;derived nitrogen&#8208;rich heteroaromatics, carbocycles, and as a bioconjugation reagent.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8211;Glass Composite Membranes with Preferential Permeation of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supported metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8211;glass composite membrane prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler produces a monolithic structure that eliminates non&#8208;selective grain boundaries, resulting in a preferential ultrahigh C2H6 permeance of 41&#8201;569 GPU and C2H6/C2H4 paraffin/olefin selectivity of 7.16.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glass is an easy to process and self&#8208;supported amorphous material that is suitable for fabricating gas separation membranes. However, MOF glasses, such as ZIF&#8208;62 and ZIF&#8208;4 have low porosity, which makes it difficult to obtain membranes with high permeance. Here, a self&#8208;supported MOF crystal&#8211;glass composite (CGC) membrane was prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the membrane matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler. The conversion of ZIF&#8208;62 from crystal to glass and the simultaneous partial melting of ZIF&#8208;8 facilitated by the melt state of ZIF&#8208;62 make the CGC membrane monolithic, eliminating non&#8208;selective grain boundaries and improving selectivity. The thickness of CGC membrane can be adjusted to fabricate a membrane without the need of a support substrate. CGC membranes exhibit a C2H6 permeance of 41&#8201;569&#8197;gas permeation units (GPU) and a C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 7.16. The CGC membrane has abundant pores from the glassy state of ZIF&#8208;62 and the crystalline ZIF&#8208;8, which enables high gas permeance. ZIF&#8208;8 has preferential adsorption for C2H6 and promotes C2H6 transport in the membrane, and thus the GCG membrane exhibits ultrahigh C2H6 permeance and good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity.

         <title>Revealing Excited&#8208;State Trajectories on Potential Energy Surfaces with Atomic Resolution in Real Time</title>

Excited&#8208;state trajectories of a diplatinum complex featuring photo&#8208;activated metal&#8211;metal &#963;&#8208;bond formation and its stretching vibrations were detected in real time by femtosecond wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray solution scattering. Two key coordinates for intersystem crossing were the Pt&#8722;Pt distance and the ligand orientation, along which the excited&#8208;state trajectories can be projected onto the calculated potential energy surfaces of the excited states.







Abstract
Photoexcited molecular trajectories on potential energy surfaces (PESs) prior to thermalization are intimately connected to the photochemical reaction outcome. The excited&#8208;state trajectories of a diplatinum complex featuring photo&#8208;activated metal&#8211;metal &#963;&#8208;bond formation and associated Pt&#8722;Pt stretching motions were detected in real time using femtosecond wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray solution scattering. The observed motions correspond well with coherent vibrational wavepacket motions detected by femtosecond optical transient absorption. Two key coordinates for intersystem crossing have been identified, the Pt&#8722;Pt bond length and the orientation of the ligands coordinated with the platinum centers, along which the excited&#8208;state trajectories can be projected onto the calculated PESs of the excited states. This investigation has gleaned novel insight into electronic transitions occurring on the time scales of vibrational motions measured in real time, revealing ultrafast nonadiabatic or non&#8208;equilibrium processes along excited&#8208;state trajectories involving multiple excited&#8208;state PESs.

         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy combining the cation redox regulation and cation interaction regulation was reported to address the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and phase transition issues existing in layered cathodes. Impressively, our proposed cathode realized excellent cycling stability with an extremely low strain change of 0.53&#8201;%, even under deep sodium extraction/insertion operation conditions.







Abstract
Deep sodium extraction/insertion of sodium cathodes usually causes undesired Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and phase transition, both of which will reduce structural stability and lead to poor long&#8208;cycle reliability. Here we report a zero&#8208;strain P2&#8208; Na2/3Li1/6Co1/6Mn2/3O2 cathode, in which the lithium/cobalt substitution contributes to reinforcing the host structure by reducing the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox, mitigating the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, and minimizing the lattice change. 94.5&#8201;% of Na+ in the unit structure can be reversibly cycled with a charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V (vs. Na+/Na). Impressively, a solid&#8208;solution reaction without phase transitions is realized upon deep sodium (de)intercalation, which poses a minimal volume deviation of 0.53&#8201;%. It attains a high discharge capacity of 178&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, a high energy density of 534&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and excellent capacity retention of 95.8&#8201;% at 1&#8197;C after 250&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Electrodes With Sensing Membranes Covalently Attached to Both the Inert Polymer Substrate and Conductive Carbon Contact</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Physical delamination limits sensor lifetimes and is a major limitation to long&#8208;term monitoring with ion selective electrodes. To address this problem, we developed a photografting polymerization method that simultaneously attaches the sensing membrane covalently to both inert polymeric electrode bodies and carbon conductors. This improves not only the lifetime but also reduces signal drift and reduces the need for recalibration.







Abstract
The use of solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) is of interest to many clinical, environmental, and industrial applications. However, upon extended exposure to samples and under thermal and mechanical stress, adhesion between these membranes and underlying substrates often weakens gradually. Eventually, this results in the formation of a water layer at the interface to the underlying electron conductor and in delamination of the membrane from the electrode body, both major limitations to long&#8208;term monitoring. To prevent these problems without increasing the complexity of design with a mechanical attachment, we use photo&#8208;induced graft polymerization to simultaneously attach ionophore&#8208;doped crosslinked poly(decyl methacrylate) sensing membranes covalently both to a high surface area carbon as ion&#8208;to&#8208;electron transducer and to inert polymeric electrode body materials (i.e., polypropylene and poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;tetrafluoroethylene)). The sensors provide high reproducibility (standard deviation of E0 of 0.2&#8197;mV), long&#8208;term stability (potential drift 7&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 over 260&#8197;h), and resistance to sterilization in an autoclave (121&#8201;&#176;C, 2.0&#8197;atm for 30&#8197;min). For this work, a covalently attached H+ selective ionophore was used to prepare pH sensors with advantages over conventional pH glass electrodes, but similar use of other ionophores makes this approach suitable to the fabrication of ISEs for a variety of analytes.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Diarylmethylamines by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8208;H Alkoxylation</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMAs) via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation was reported. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMA) are important structural motifs widely present in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and chiral ligands. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral DAMAs via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation strategy. The reaction features easy operation, the use of earth&#8208;abundant and cost&#8208;efficient cobalt(II) catalyst, and readily available ligand. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;fueled Mechanical Motions with Dynamic Phosphorescence Induced by Topochemical [2+2] Reactions in Organoboron Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible/sun light enables fast macroscopic photomechanical motions and blue&#8208;shifted phosphorescence emission, owing to quantitative single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions, in stoichiomorphic organoboron crystals. X&#8208;ray photodiffraction structural mapping of photosalient crystals, during rapid topochemical transformation, deciphers an atomic&#8208;level mechanism for the origin of the photomechanical motions.







Abstract
In the quest for essential energy solutions towards an ecological friendly future, the transformation of visible light/solar energy into mechanical motions in metal&#8208;free luminescent crystals offers a sustainable choice of smart materials for lightweight actuating, and all&#8208;organic electronic devices. Such green energy&#8208;triggered photodynamic motions with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in molecular crystals have not been reported yet. Here, we demonstrate three new stoichiometrically different Lewis acid&#8208;base molecular organoboron crystals (PS1, PS2, and PS3), which exhibit rapid photosalient effects (ballistic splitting, moving, and jumping) under both ultraviolet (UV) and visible light associated with quantitative single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) [2+2] cycloaddition of preorganized olefins. Furthermore, these systems respond to sunlight and mobile (white) flashlight with a complete SCSC transformation in a relatively slow fashion. Remarkably, all PS1, PS2, and PS3 crystals display visible light&#8208;promoted dynamic green RTP as their emission peaks promptly blue&#8208;shift, due to instantaneous photomechanical effects. Time&#8208;dependent structural mapping of intermediate photoproducts during fast SCSC [2+2] photoreaction, by X&#8208;ray photodiffraction, reveals a rationale for the origin of these photodynamic motions associated with rapid topochemical transformations. The reported light&#8208;driven behavior (mechanical motions, dynamic phosphorescence, and topochemical reactivity), is considered advantageous for the strategic design of stimuli&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;functional crystalline materials.

         <title>Doubly Strapped Zwitterionic NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II Heptamethine Cyanine Dyes for Bioconjugation and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and efficient synthetic method produces conjugatable sterically shielded heptamethine cyanine dyes for in vivo NIR&#8208;I or NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. The fluorochromes are enclosed by two flanking straps which enhance fluorescence brightness and chemical stability, prevent dye stacking on the surface of an antibody, and enable high performance fluorescence imaging of a mouse tumor.







Abstract
Heptamethine cyanine dyes enable deep tissue fluorescence imaging in the near infrared (NIR) window. Small molecule conjugates of the benchmark dye ZW800&#8208;1 have been tested in humans. However, long&#8208;term imaging protocols using ZW800&#8208;1 conjugates are limited by their instability, primarily because the chemically labile C4&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;aryl linker is susceptible to cleavage by biological nucleophiles. Here, we report a modular synthetic method that produces novel doubly strapped zwitterionic heptamethine cyanine dyes, including a structural analogue of ZW800&#8208;1, with greatly enhanced dye stability. NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II versions of these doubly strapped dyes can be conjugated to proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, without causing undesired fluorophore degradation or dye stacking on the protein surface. The fluorescent antibody conjugates show excellent tumor&#8208;targeting specificity in a xenograft mouse tumor model. The enhanced stability provided by doubly strapped molecular design will enable new classes of in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging experiments with possible translation to humans.

         <title>The Formation of NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+, Yb3+ Nanocrystals Studied by In Situ X&#8208;ray Scattering: Phase Transition and Size Focusing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals from &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles was followed using in situ X&#8208;ray scattering. The experiments reveal the kinetics of particle growth (small&#8208;angle scattering) and phase transformation (wide&#8208;angle scattering). A surprising particle size evolution is observed, where &#945;&#8208;phase particles develop a bimodal size distribution before they transform into &#946;&#8208;phase.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals are a popular class of optical materials. They can be doped with optically active lanthanide ions and shaped into core&#8208;multi&#8208;shell geometries with controlled dopant distributions. Here, we follow the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals from &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles using in situ small&#8208;angle and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ex situ electron microscopy. We observe an evolution from a unimodal particle size distribution to bimodal, and eventually back to unimodal. The final size distribution is narrower in absolute numbers than the initial distribution. These peculiar growth dynamics happen in large part before the &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#946; phase transformation. We propose that the splitting of the size distribution is caused by variations in the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles, potentially due to inter&#8208;particle differences in stoichiometry.

     alt="The Formation of NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+, Yb3+ Nanocrystals Studied by In Situ X-ray Scattering: Phase Transition and Size Focusing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of &#946;-NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals from &#945;-NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; precursor particles was followed using in situ X-ray scattering. The experiments reveal the kinetics of particle growth (small-angle scattering) and phase transformation (wide-angle scattering). A surprising particle size evolution is observed, where &#945;-phase particles develop a bimodal size distribution before they transform into &#946;-phase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#946;-NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals are a popular class of optical materials. They can be doped with optically active lanthanide ions and shaped into core-multi-shell geometries with controlled dopant distributions. Here, we follow the synthesis of &#946;-NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals from &#945;-NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; precursor particles using in situ small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering and ex situ electron microscopy. We observe an evolution from a unimodal particle size distribution to bimodal, and eventually back to unimodal. The final size distribution is narrower in absolute numbers than the initial distribution. These peculiar growth dynamics happen in large part &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the &#945;-to-&#946; phase transformation. We propose that the splitting of the size distribution is caused by variations in the reactivity of &#945;-NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; precursor particles, potentially due to inter-particle differences in stoichiometry. Rate equation modeling confirms that a continuous distribution of reactivities can result in the observed particle growth dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging Boron and Carbonyl based MR&#8208;TADF Emitter Designs to Achieve High Performance Pure Blue OLEDs

The multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, DOBDiKTa merges the motifs of boron&#8208;based and ketone&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters. Using this molecular design, this compound shows deep blue, narrowband emission. The co&#8208;host device with DOBDiKTa achieved a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 17.4&#8201;% and blue emission with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12).







Abstract
Multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds are attractive as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) as they can simultaneously harvest both singlet and triplet excitons to produce light in the device and show very narrow emission spectra, which translates to excellent color purity. Here, we report the first example of an MR&#8208;TADF emitter (DOBDiKTa) that fuses together fragments from the two major classes of MR&#8208;TADF compounds, those containing boron (DOBNA) and those containing carbonyl groups (DiKTa) as acceptor fragments in the MR&#8208;TADF skeleton. The resulting molecular design, this compound shows desirable narrowband pure blue emission and efficient TADF character. The co&#8208;host OLED with DOBDiKTa as the emitter showed a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 17.4&#8201;%, an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 32&#8201;% at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12). Compared to DOBNA and DiKTa, DOBDiKTa shows higher device efficiency with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off while maintaining a high color purity, which demonstrates the promise of the proposed molecular design.

         <title>Cyanine Polymersomes Inbreathe Gas Signaling Molecule: SO2&#8208;Driven Bilayer Tubular Deformation for Transmembrane Traffic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer vesicles deform their shape gradually with every breath they take. SO2 gas reacting with the cyanine species in polymersomes can drive a continuous 1D stretching motion of membranes that transforms them to tubesomes. Such a membrane plastic deformation process can be programmed by SO2 level, which will well regulate the membrane permselectivity to realize transmembrane traffic management towards cargos of different size.







Abstract
Fabricating nanoscale assemblies that can respond to gas signaling molecules has emerged as a field of growing interest owing to their unique biomedical applications in gas&#8208;guided delivery and gas therapeutics. Yet, among a variety of endogenous gaseous biosignals, exploiting sulfur dioxide (SO2) as a cue for controllable self&#8208;assembly remains elusive, despite its crucial two&#8208;sided roles both in physiology and pathology. Here we show a SO2&#8208;responsive polymersome system assembled from a novel class of cyanine&#8208;containing block copolymers. By intake of SO2 gas, the tautomerism of cyanine drives such vesicles to continuously deform, and change into long nanotubes through axial stretching and anisotropic extrusion of the membranes. Unexpectedly, during this order&#8208;to&#8208;order phase transition, their membranes manifest well SO2&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent permselectivity, which allows the cargos of different sizes loaded therein to be selectively transferred across the bilayers. This study would inspire us to better understand and mimic the function of gas signaling molecules in shifting biomembrane shape and managing transmembrane traffic.

         <title>Highly Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Hydrogenation of Cyclic Tetra&#8208;Substituted &#946;&#8208;Enamido Phosphorus Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrogenation of congested tetra&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;enamido phosphorus derivatives was developed by employing commercially available Rh&#8208;Josiphos as the catalyst. This protocol offers a straightforward entry to a broad variety of previously difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access chiral &#946;&#8208;amino phosphonates/phosphine oxides bearing two vicinal stereocenters embedded in various ring structures.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of enamido phosphorus derivatives is one of the most efficient methods for the construction of chiral amino phosphorus products, among which the congested tetra&#8208;substituted substrates remains an unaddressed challenge. In this study, we utilize a commercially available Rh&#8208;Josiphos system for the efficient and stereoselective hydrogenation of a wide set of tetra&#8208;substituted cyclic &#946;&#8208;enamido phosphonates/phosphine oxides, thus enabling access to chiral &#946;&#8208;amino phosphorus compounds featuring two vicinal stereocenters. This protocol was broadly applicable to different ring systems possessing various phosphonate/phosphine oxide groups and further applied in the preparation of amino&#8208;phosphine ligands. DFT mechanistic explorations indicate that the C=C migratory insertion into RhIII&#8722;H bond could be the rate&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step. The origins of stereoselectivity are revealed through distortion/interaction analysis, which is primarily regulated by distinguished dispersion interactions and steric repulsions.

         <title>Light Triggered Pore Size Tuning in Photoswitching Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Low Energy CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>

The UV light triggered CO2 capture and release upon photoisomerization of azobenzene pendants inside the pore channel of PCTF2 is reported.







Abstract
Recently, photo switching porous materials have been widely reported for low energy costed CO2 capture and release via simply remoted light controlling method. However, most reported photo responsive CO2 adsorbents relied on metal organic framework (MOFs) functionalisation with photochromic moieties, and MOF adsorbents still suffered from chemically and thermally unstable issues. Thus, further metal free and highly stable organic photoresponsive adsorbents are necessary to be developed. CTFs, because of their high porosity and stability, have attracted great attention for CO2 capture. Considering the high CO2 uptake capacity and structural tunability of CTFs, it suggests high potential to fabricate the photoswitching CTF materials by the same functionalisation method as MOFs. Herein, the first series of photo switching CTFs were developed for low energy CO2 capture and release. Apart from that, the CO2 switching efficiency could be doubled either through the azobenzene numbers adjusting method or through the previously reported structural alleviation strategy. Furthermore, the pore size distribution of azobenzene functionalised PCTFs also could be tuned under UV exposure, which may contribute to the UV light induced decrease of CO2 uptake capacity. These photoswitching CTFs represented a new kind of porous polymers for low energy costed CO2 capture.

         <title>Hydroxyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic NO Oxidation with Simultaneous Nitrate Storage Using A Flow Photoanode Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;modified NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66(Zr)/nickel foam with abundant mesoporous pores enables the progressive conversion of NO into nitrate without releasing remarkable NO2 by refining the reactive oxygen species to &#8901;OH and can achieve the simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants through a flow photoanode reactor. This study provides a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy for NO removal and sustainable nitrate storage.







Abstract
The selective conversion of dilute NO pollutant into low&#8208;toxic product and simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants remains a great challenge from the perspective of waste management and sustainable chemistry. This study demonstrates that this bottleneck can be well tackled by refining the reactive oxygen species (ROS) on Ni&#8208;modified NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66(Zr) (Ni@NU) using nickel foam (NF) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate through a flow photoanode reactor via the gas&#8208;phase photoelectrocatalysis. By rationally refining the ROS to &#8901;OH, Ni@NU/NF can rapidly eliminate 82&#8201;% of NO without releasing remarkable NO2 under a low bias voltage (0.3&#8197;V) and visible light irradiation. The abundant mesoporous pores on Ni@NU/NF are conducive to the diffusion and storage of the formed nitrate, which enables the progressive conversion NO into nitrate with selectivity over 99&#8201;% for long&#8208;term use. Through calculation, 90&#8201;% of NO could be recovered as the nitrate species, indicating that this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy can capture, enrich and recycle the pollutant N source from the atmosphere. This study offers a new perspective of NO pollutant treatment and sustainable nitrogen exploitation, which may possess great potential to the development of highly efficient air purification systems for industrial and indoor NOx control.

         <title>Covalently Grafting Graphene onto Si Photocathode to Expedite Aqueous Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin graphene film was closely and tightly grafted onto Si semiconductor via a chemical method. The resulting cathode manifested high kinetics and excellent stability for aqueous photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Silicon semiconductor functionalized with molecular catalysts emerges as a promising cathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the limited kinetics and stabilities remains a major hurdle for the development of such composites. We herein report an assembling strategy of silicon photocathodes via chemically grafting a conductive graphene layer onto the surface of n+&#8208;p Si followed by catalyst immobilization. The covalently&#8208;linked graphene layer effectively enhances the photogenerated carriers transfer between the cathode and the reduction catalyst, and improves the operating stability of the electrode. Strikingly, we demonstrate that altering the stacking configuration of the immobilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) catalyst through calcination can further enhance the electron transfer rate and the PEC performance. At the end, the graphene&#8208;coated Si cathode immobilized with CoTPP catalyst managed to sustain a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent of &#8722;1.65&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 16&#8197;h for CO production in water at a near neutral potential of &#8722;0.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. This represents a remarkable improvement of PEC CO2RR performance in contrast to the reported photocathodes functionalized with molecular catalysts.

         <title>Nanostructure&#8208;Driven Indocyanine Green Dimerization Generates Ultra&#8208;Stable Phototheranostics Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Indocyanine Green (ICG) stabilized nanoemulsion enables 100&#8201;% ICG dimerization and J&#8208;aggregation spontaneously on its shell to afford a nanostructure of dimeric ICG (Nano&#8208;dICG) that demonstrates superior photothermal conversion efficiency, photostability, and structure stability over ICG, giving an ultra&#8208;stable phototheranostic platform for photoacoustic imaging and effective photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Indocyanine green (ICG) is the only near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye approved for clinical use. Despite its versatility in photonic applications and potential for photothermal therapy, its photobleaching hinders its application. Here we discovered a nanostructure of dimeric ICG (Nano&#8208;dICG) generated by using ICG to stabilize nanoemulsions, after which ICG enabled complete dimerization on the nanoemulsion shell, followed by J&#8208;aggregation of ICG&#8208;dimer, resulting in a narrow, red&#8208;shifted (780&#8197;nm&#8594;894&#8197;nm) and intense (&#8776;2&#8208;fold) absorbance. Compared to ICG, Nano&#8208;dICG demonstrated superior photothermal conversion (2&#8208;fold higher), significantly reduced photodegradation (&#8722;9.6&#8201;% vs. &#8722;46.3&#8201;%), and undiminished photothermal effect (7 vs. 2&#8197;cycles) under repeated irradiations, in addition to excellent colloidal and structural stabilities. Following intravenous injection, Nano&#8208;dICG enabled real&#8208;time tracking of its delivery to mouse tumors within 24&#8197;h by photoacoustic imaging at NIR wavelength (890&#8197;nm) distinct from the endogenous signal to guide effective photothermal therapy. The unprecedented finding of nanostructure&#8208;driven ICG dimerization leads to an ultra&#8208;stable phototheranostic platform.

         <title>Linking Composition, Structure and Thickness of CoOOH layers to Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity by Correlative Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our correlative multimodal approach can link local activity with atomic&#8208;scale details of structure, morphology and composition of surface species formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We found that a 6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0) layer, grown on [
0]&#8208;oriented Co, contains more hydroxyl ions and easily reducible CoIII&#8722;O sites, exhibiting a higher OER activity than 3&#8197;nm thick &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(10
3) formed on [02
&#8208;oriented Co.







Abstract
The role of &#946;&#8208;CoOOH crystallographic orientations in catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains elusive. We combine correlative electron backscatter diffraction/scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography to establish the structure&#8211;activity relationships of various faceted &#946;&#8208;CoOOH formed on a Co microelectrode under OER conditions. We reveal that &#8776;6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0), grown on [
0]&#8208;oriented Co, exhibits higher OER activity than &#8776;3&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(10
3) or &#8776;6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(0006) formed on [02
&#8208; and [0001]&#8208;oriented Co, respectively. This arises from higher amounts of incorporated hydroxyl ions and more easily reducible CoIII&#8722;O sites present in &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0) than those in the latter two oxyhydroxide facets. Our correlative multimodal approach shows great promise in linking local activity with atomic&#8208;scale details of structure, thickness and composition of active species, which opens opportunities to design pre&#8208;catalysts with preferred defects that promote the formation of the most active OER species.

         <title>Catalytic Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Cyclopropanation of gem&#8208;Dihaloalkanes and Terminal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation of readily available gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes and terminal olefins. Distinct from previous approaches, gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes serve as suitable precursors for non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids, furnishing various functionalized chiral cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies provide insights into the catalytic process, featuring radical&#8208;polar crossover.







Abstract
Chiral cyclopropane derivatives are essential in synthetic chemistry and drug discovery. Their synthesis commonly relies on asymmetric cyclopropanation of diazo compounds, potentially explosive and needing stabilizing substituents. Thus, asymmetric catalytic transformations of non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids remain a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation of readily available gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes and terminal olefins. Distinct from previous approaches, gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes serve as suitable precursors for non&#8208;stabilized carbenes or carbenoids, furnishing various functionalized chiral cyclopropanes. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping, non&#8208;linear effect, and UV/Vis spectroscopy, provide insights into the catalytic process, featuring radical&#8208;polar crossover.

         <title>Macroscopic Assembly of Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Metal&#8208;free Supramolecular Glasses for Enhanced Color&#8208;tunable Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;sized chiral metal&#8208;free supramolecular glasses using L&#8208;histidine and hexamethylenetetramine as the building blocks can be obtained through a facile solution fabrication process. Visible color&#8208;tunable ultralong room temperature phosphorescence emissions are successfully realized in these glasses (namely L&#8208;H&#8208;M and L&#8208;H&#8208;M&#8208;AC). AC: acetonitrile; R.T.: room temperature; UV: Ultra Violet.







Abstract
Glassy materials, with desirable mechanical rigidity, shaping ability, high transparency, are attracting great interest in diverse fields. However, optically bulk molecule&#8208;based glasses are still rare, mainly due to limited monomeric species and harsh preparation conditions. Herein, we report a facile bottom&#8208;up solution fabrication process to obtain metal&#8208;free supramolecular glasses (SMGs) at the macroscopic scale using L&#8208;Histidine and hexamethylenetetramine as building blocks. The chiral SMGs possess color&#8208;tunable ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (decay lifetime up to 141.2&#8197;ms) and circular polarized luminescence (g factor up to 8.7&#215;10&#8722;3). The strong hydrogen bonds effectively drive the formation of SMGs, and provide a rigid microenvironment to boost triplet exciton generation. By virtue of excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent ultralong phosphorescence of the SMGs, applications including multicolored displays, visual UV detection, and persistently luminescent thermometer are demonstrated.

         <title>A Triply [5]Helicene&#8208;Bridged (1,3,5)Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,3,5)cyclophane has been synthesized, in which the triply locked central benzene rings are parallel to each other, perfectly superimposed and rather close. These two benzene rings show abnormally low aromaticity, which is possibly due to the existence of an aromatic 78&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron macrocyclic circuit.







Abstract
A rigid propeller&#8208;shaped conjugated triple macrocycle consisting of two nearly perfectly stacked benzene rings and three linking [5]helicene moieties has been synthesized using a glyoxylic Perkin approach. Analysis of the electron delocalization in this atypical aromatic molecule revealed global aromaticity and a 78&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron circuit along the edge of its triple loop, to the detriment of the two 6&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron circuits in the two stacked benzene rings.

A polycondensation reaction constitutes the simplest route to generating porous poly(aryl thioether)s. Through a multi&#8208;para&#8208;nucleophilic substitution of perfluoroaromatic compounds with sodium sulfide, temperature&#8208;dependent formation of thioether linkages leads to stepwise transition of the polymers into network structures with controllable porosity and bandgap, as reported by Jeehye Byun, Sheng Li, Cafer&#8197;T. Yavuz, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202304378).

The concentration&#8208;wave&#8208;dominated universal formation mechanism of hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS) is revealed by numerical simulations, as reported by Wei Ge, Dan Wang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202302621). The discovery of the physical essence behind the formation of HoMS offers a predictive blueprint for creating dynamic HoMS by concentration waves, thereby establishing a valuable framework for future research in the realm of synthetic chemistry.

Luminescent radicals are gathering constant attention as a new class of luminescent materials due to the ground and excited state doublet character. In their Research Article (e202302550), Ken Albrecht and co&#8208;workers report a carbazole dendronized luminescent tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical. Dendron modification increases the photostability and photoluminescence quantum yield up to 63&#8201;% in cyclohexane. The image shows the red luminescent raspberry (TTM radical) protected from sunshine by the raspberry bush (dendron).

         <title>Who Binds Better? Let Alphafold2 Decide!</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chang and Perez suggest a simple and elegant approach for using AlphaFold2 to determine relative binding preferences of a receptor for two of its peptide substrates: when presented with both peptides, AlphaFold2 models only the stronger binder into the binding site. This easy approach will help many biologists to quickly estimate best binders and accelerate research on peptide substrate&#8208;mediated interactions.







Abstract
Deep learning is revolutionizing structural biology to an unprecedented extent. Spearheaded by DeepMind's Alphafold2, structural models of high quality can be generated, and are now available for most known proteins and many protein interactions. The next challenge will be to leverage this rich structural corpus to learn about binding: which protein can contact which partner(s), and at what affinity? In a recent study, Chang and Perez have presented an elegant approach towards this challenging goal for interactions that involve a short peptide binding to its receptor. The basic idea is straightforward: given a receptor that binds to two peptides, if the receptor sequence is presented with both peptides together at the same time, AlphaFold2 should model the tighter binding peptide into the binding site, while excluding the second. A simple idea that works!

         <title>Glass Formation in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glassy state of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) has recently been identified, exhibiting diverse properties complementary to the crystalline state. This mini review presents an overview of the structural chemistry of both two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional HOIPs, and a comprehensive discussion on their glass formation processes. Current advances in melt&#8208;quenched glasses formed from HOIPs are discussed, and an outlook for the future of this new family of materials is offered.







Abstract
Crystalline materials have governed the development of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), giving rise to a variety of fascinating applications such as solar cells and optoelectronic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystalline materials have governed the development of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), giving rise to a variety of fascinating applications such as solar cells and optoelectronic devices. With increasing interest in non-crystalline systems, the glassy state of HOIPs has recently been identified. Here, the basic building blocks of crystalline HOIPs appear to be retained, though their glasses lack long-range periodic order. The emerging family of glasses formed from HOIPs exhibits diverse properties, complementary to their crystalline state.

         <title>Expanding Linker Dimensionality in Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks for sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom Pore Control for Separation Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>

Increasing linker dimensionality in metal&#8208;organic frameworks limits the effects of linker orientation and structural flexibility on pore size, ultimately enhancing the separation capabilities of these materials.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials with high surface areas, which are acquiring rapid attention on an exponential basis. A significant characteristic of MOFs is their ability to act as adsorbents to selectively separate component mixtures of similar size, thereby addressing the technological need for an alternative approach to conventional distillation methods. Recently, MOFs comprising a 3&#8208;Dimensional (3D) linker have shown outstanding capabilities for difficult separations compared to the parent 2&#8208;Dimensional (2D) analogue. 3D&#8208;linkers with a polycyclic core are underrepresented in the MOF database due to the widespread preferred use of 2D&#8208;linkers and the misconceived high&#8208;cost of 3D linkers. We summarize the recent research of 3D&#8208;linker MOFs and highlight their beneficial employment for selective gas and hydrocarbon adsorption and separation. Furthermore, we outline forecasts in this area to create a platform for widespread adoption of 3D&#8208;linkers in MOF synthesis.

         <title>Micromolar Affinity and Higher: Synthetic Host&#8211;Guest Complexes with High Stabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review collects recent achievements in the design of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complexes with association constants exceeding 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. The relationships between the measured thermodynamic constants and the structural parameters of the interacting species are analyzed. The design features of high&#8208;affinity hosts are discussed in light of their binding properties. Hints are provided for the design of future receptors displaying high affinity and selectivity.







Abstract
The design of high&#8208;affinity synthetic host&#8211;guest complexes is of paramount importance because they are key elements in constructing unprecedented supramolecular assemblies, functional materials, molecular probes, artificial signal transduction events, and interfaces with the biological world. The present review article collects recent achievements in the design of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complexes with outstanding stabilities, i.e., exceeding 106&#8197;M&#8722;1. The relationships between the measured thermodynamic constants and the structural parameters of the interacting species are analyzed. The design features of high&#8208;affinity hosts are discussed in light of their binding properties. Different solvents and different types of noncovalent interactions are considered for the stabilization of the complexes. Finally, some hints are provided for the design of future synthetic receptors displaying high affinity and selectivity.

         <title>Membrane Electrode Assembly for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Principle and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>

Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction are a promising technology to realize carbon neutrality. This review summarizes the principles and core components of the electrolyser and gives an overview of the application of MEAs in the generation of different reduced products.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems is a promising technology. Gaseous CO2 can be directly transported to the cathode catalyst layer, leading to enhanced reaction rate. Meanwhile, there is no liquid electrolyte between the cathode and the anode, which can help to improve the energy efficiency of the whole system. The remarkable progress achieved recently points out the way to realize industrially relevant performance. In this review, we focus on the principles in MEA for CO2RR, focusing on gas diffusion electrodes and ion exchange membranes. Furthermore, anode processes beyond the oxidation of water are considered. Besides, the voltage distribution is scrutinized to identify the specific losses related to the individual components. We also summarize the progress on the generation of different reduced products together with the corresponding catalysts. Finally, the challenges and opportunities are highlighted for future research.

         <title>Enantioselective Effect of Chiral Small Molecules in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Vaccine&#8208;Induced Immune Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via decorating immunostimulatory small&#8208;molecule resiquimod (R848) on the chiral framework R/S&#8208;paracyclophane, we synthesized planar&#8208;chiral enantiomers R/S&#8208;ResP. For SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 vaccine, in comparison to R&#8208;ResP, S&#8208;ResP exhibited a significant enhancement for vaccine&#8208;induced cross&#8208;neutralization against various viral strains. This study revealed the importance of enantioselective effect in the design and construction of chiral small molecule adjuvants.







Abstract
Although numerous chiral small molecules have been discovered and synthesized, the investigation on their enantioselective immunological effects remains limited. In this study, we designed and synthesized a pair of small molecule enantiomers (R/S&#8208;ResP) by covalently bonding two immunostimulators (resiquimod/Res) onto a planar chiral framework (paracyclophane/P). Notably, we found that S&#8208;ResP exhibits a 4.05&#8208;fold higher affinity for toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) than R&#8208;ResP, thereby more effectively enhancing the functions of dendritic cells and macrophages in cytokine secretion and antigen internalization. Furthermore, we observed that S&#8208;ResP significantly enhances RBD antigen&#8208;induced cross&#8208;neutralization against various SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 strains compared to R&#8208;ResP. These findings demonstrate the enantioselective effects of small molecules on regulating vaccine&#8208;induced immune responses and emphasize the significance of chirality in designing small molecular adjuvants.

         <title>Digital Microfluidics and Magnetic Bead&#8208;Based Intact Proteoform Elution for Quantitative Top&#8208;down Nanoproteomics of Single C.&#8197;elegans Nematodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a sensitive microfluidics&#8208;based workflow for quantitative top&#8208;down proteomics of single nematodes of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (containing &lt;1000&#8197;cells). Here, nematodes are lysed on digital microfluidics chips, and proteins aggregated with magnetic beads are eluted off with formic acid. Using differential ion mobility mass spectrometry, we could quantify changes in the proteoform abundances of single nematodes.

While most nanoproteomics approaches for the analysis of low&#8208;input samples are based on bottom&#8208;up proteomics workflows, top&#8208;down approaches enabling proteoform characterization are still underrepresented. Using mammalian cell proteomes, we established a facile one&#8208;pot sample preparation protocol based on protein aggregation on magnetic beads and intact proteoform elution using 40&#8201;% formic acid. Performed on a digital microfluidics device, the workflow enabled sensitive analyses of single Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, thereby increasing the number of proteoform identifications compared to in&#8208;tube sample preparation by 46&#8201;%. Label&#8208;free quantification of single nematodes grown under different conditions allowed to identify changes in the abundance of proteoforms not distinguishable by bottom&#8208;up proteomics. The presented workflow will facilitate proteoform&#8208;directed analysis on samples of limited availability.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a sensitive microfluidics-based workflow for quantitative top-down proteomics of single nematodes of the model organism &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; (containing &amp;lt;1000&#8197;cells). Here, nematodes are lysed on digital microfluidics chips, and proteins aggregated with magnetic beads are eluted off with formic acid. Using differential ion mobility mass spectrometry, we could quantify changes in the proteoform abundances of single nematodes.

         <title>Rearrangements of Internally&#8208;bridged Octaphyrin(1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1)s to Porphyrin Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internally&#8208;bridged octaphyrin underwent skeletal rearrangement to meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrin dimer upon ZnII metalation. This reaction was indeed triggered by hydride&#8208;addition reaction to lead to thermodynamically more stable porphyrin framework. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin rearranged to meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946;, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linked porphyrin dimer via a similar mechanism combined with Pd&#8208;mediated reductive coupling.







Abstract
Internally&#8208;bridged octaphyrin(1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1) underwent a rearrangement to meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrin dimer as a new metamorphosis. Extensive examination suggests that hydride&#8208;addition is a key step for the rearrangements to afford thermodynamically more stable porphyrin framework. Further, &#946;&#8208;tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin was transformed to meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946;, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linked porphyrin dimer via a similar mechanism combined with Pd&#8208;mediated reductive homocoupling.

         <title>Merging Styrene and Diene Structures to a Cyclic Diene: Anionic Polymerization of 1&#8208;Vinylcyclohexene (VCH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic living polymerization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclohexene (VCH) with sec&#8208;BuLi as an initiator in cyclohexane is possible. It is a key question whether the monomer acts as a 1,3&#8208;diene or as a styrenic monomer. The cyclic structure of the 1,2&#8208;substituted monomer shows extraordinary consequences on copolymerization behavior, microstructure and thermal behavior, compared to other conventional linear dienes (e.g. butadiene, isoprene).







Abstract
We report the first anionic polymerization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclohexene (VCH). This structure may be considered as an intermediate between dienes and styrene. The polymerization of this cyclic 1,2&#8208;disubstituted 1,3&#8208;diene proceeded quantitatively in cyclohexane at 25&#8201;&#176;C with sec&#8208;butyllithium as an initiator. The obtained polymers have well&#8208;controlled molecular weights in the range of 5 to 142&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1, controlled by the molar ratio of monomer and initiator, with narrow molecular weight distributions (&#272;&lt;1.07&#8211;1.20). In situ 1H NMR kinetic characterization revealed a weak gradient structure for the copolymers of styrene and VCH, (rSty=2.55, rVCH=0.39). P(VCH) obtained in cyclohexane with sec&#8208;BuLi as an initiator showed both 1,4&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;incorporation mode (ratio: 64&#8201;:&#8201;36). It was demonstrated that the microstructure of the resulting P(VCH) can be altered by the addition of a modifier (THF), resulting in increasing 3,4&#8208;microstructure (up to 78&#8201;%) and elevated glass&#8208;transition temperature up to 89&#8201;&#176;C. Thus, the monomer VCH polymerizes carbanionically like a diene, however leading to rigid polymers with high glass transition temperature, which provides interesting options for combination with other dienes to well&#8208;defined polymer architectures and materials.

         <title>Cyclization of an Achiral Flipping Panel to Homochiral Tubes Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of homochiral macrocycles were facilely constructed by cyclization of a dynamic flipping thianthrene moiety with methylene linkages. Their stable planar chirality facilitates efficient resolution of the enantiomers and leads to luminescent molecular tubes exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence. Regulation of the luminescence could be further achieved through supramolecular binding towards electron&#8208;deficient guests.







Abstract
Macrocyclization of the bendable 2,7&#8208;dimethoxythianthrene with methylene linkages afforded a pair of homochiral macrocycles featuring a hex&#8208;nut&#8208;like geometry. Their structures were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Their stable planar chirality facilitates efficient resolution of the pair of enantiomers which could be readily derivatized. Installing phenylethynyl groups on their rims leads to luminescent tubular macrocycles exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with a large dissymmetry value |glum| of 5&#215;10&#8722;3. Supramolecular binding of electron&#8208;deficient guests by the tube results in fluorescence quenching, which proved its potential for the future development of switchable chiroptical systems.

         <title>Bispalladium(II) Complexes of di&#8208;p&#8208;Pyrirubyrin Derivatives as Promising Near&#8208;Infrared Photoacoustic Dyes</title>

         <dc:description>
We show the synthesis and mutually reversible, fully controlled transformations of bispalladium(II) di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrins. The regioselective conversion of di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin into dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin leads to the incorporation of an unprecedented &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;one unit into the macrocycle skeleton. Significantly, all reported compounds have outstanding spectroscopic properties, including a photoacoustic response in the near&#8208;infrared I&#8211;II range.







Abstract
The insertion of palladium(II) into di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin results in mutually convertible bimetallic complexes. Post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of one of them yielded bispalladium(II) dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin and, after demetallation, dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin, introducing for the first time the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;one unit into the macrocyclic frame. Bispalladium(II) di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 6, bispalladium(II) dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 9, and dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 10 absorb and emit light around 1000&#8197;nm and are characterized by high photostability. Thus, they are promising candidates for near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic dyes, ideally targeting (9) the wavelength of Yb&#8208;based fiber lasers. The incorporation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridine moiety into expanded porphyrins opens a highly interesting area of research due to the attractive optical and coordination properties of the resulting molecules.

Bispalladium(II) di-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-pyrirubyrin &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, bispalladium(II) dioxo-di-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-pyrirubyrin &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, and dioxo-di-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-pyrirubyrin &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; absorb and emit light around 1000&#8197;nm and are characterized by high photostability. Thus, they are promising candidates for near-infrared photoacoustic dyes, ideally targeting (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) the wavelength of Yb-based fiber lasers. The incorporation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8242;-pyridine moiety into expanded porphyrins opens a highly interesting area of research due to the attractive optical and coordination properties of the resulting molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sculpting In&#8208;plane Fractal Porous Patterns in Two&#8208;Dimensional MOF Nanocrystals for Photoelectrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;controlled crystal lattice&#8208;guided anisotropic etching of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOF surfaces gives perforated hierarchical pore patterns that allow high&#8208;loading of molecular catalysts exposed at the pore&#8208;edges for efficient and stable photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Herein, by choosing few&#8208;nm&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals of MOF&#8208;5 containing in&#8208;planner square lattices as a modular platform, a crystal lattice&#8208;guided wet&#8208;chemical etching has been rationally accomplished. As a result, two attractive pore patterns carrying Euclidean curvatures; precisely, plus(+)&#8208;shaped and fractal&#8208;patterned pores via &#10216;100&#10217; and &#10216;110&#10217; directional etching, respectively, are regulated in contrast to habitually formed spherical&#8208;shaped random etches on MOF surface. In agreement with the theoretical calculations, a diffusion&#8208;limited etching process has been optimized to devise high&#8208;yield of size&#8208;tunable fractal&#8208;pores on the MOF surface that tenders for a compatibly high payload of catalytic ReI&#8208;complexes using the existing large edge area once modified into a free amine&#8208;group&#8208;exposed inner pore surface. Finally, on benefiting from the long&#8208;range fractal opening in 2D MOF support structure, while loaded on an electrode surface, a facilitated cross&#8208;interface charge&#8208;transportation and well&#8208;exposure of immobilized ReI&#8208;catalysts are anticipated, thus realizing enhanced activity and stability of the supported catalyst in photoelectrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced intramolecular decarboxylative and desulfonylative sp3 allylation of allyl esters or sulfones enabled by simple, yet available, sulfinate catalysts is described herein. This technique complements classical protocols based on noble Pd catalysts and also facilitates rapid and reliable access to molecular architectures of utmost relevance in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a catalytic intramolecular decarboxylative/desulfonylative sp3 allylation triggered by sulfinate salts under light irradiation. The reaction is likely enabled by a non&#8208;classical, radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, allowing rapid and reliable access to valuable allyl architectures from readily accessible precursors. The protocol is characterized by its operational simplicity and scalability, employing abundant, commercially available catalysts.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation of Polyesters to Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing new upcycling strategies to address the threats from waste plastics can significantly improve global sustainability. An atom economic reaction was demonstrated to convert polyesters into diols with great selectivity over a Zn&#8208;modified Cu catalyst. The reaction could be operated in solvent&#8208;free mode with all atoms in the reactants fixed into the final product, eliminating the need for a separation process.







Abstract
The utilization of carbon resources stored in plastic polymers through chemical recycling and upcycling is a promising approach for mitigating plastic waste. However, most current methods for upcycling suffer from limited selectivity towards a specific valuable product, particularly when attempting full conversion of the plastic. We present a highly selective reaction route for transforming polylactic acid (PLA) into 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilizing a Zn&#8208;modified Cu catalyst. This reaction exhibits excellent reactivity (0.65&#8197;g&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (99.5&#8201;%) towards 1,2&#8208;propanediol, and most importantly, can be performed in a solvent&#8208;free mode. Significantly, the overall solvent&#8208;free reaction is an atom&#8208;economical reaction with all the atoms in reactants (PLA and H2) fixed into the final product (1,2&#8208;propanediol), eliminating the need for a separation process. This method provides an innovative and economically viable solution for upgrading polyesters to produce high&#8208;purity products under mild conditions with optimal atom utilization.

         <title>Birefringence Regulation by Clarifying the Relationship Between Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs and Optical Anisotropy in Tin&#8208;based Ternary Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8208;performance relationship has been teased out between stereochemically active lone pairs and optical anisotropy for analysis and prediction of birefringence in tin(II)&#8208;based ternary halides.







Abstract
It is important to establish and clarify the relationship between stereochemically active lone pairs and birefringence, since it is one of the significantly effective routes to explore birefringent crystals by introducing Sn&#8208;centered polyhedra with stereochemically active lone pairs. Herein, four tin(II)&#8208;based ternary halides A3SnCl5 and ASn2Cl5 (A=NH4 and Rb) have been synthesized successfully. The experimental birefringence of Rb3SnCl5 and RbSn2Cl5 is larger than or equal to 0.046 and 0.123@546&#8197;nm, respectively. Through investigating the alkali or alkaline&#8208;earth metal tin(II)&#8208;based ternary halides, the structure&#8208;performance relationship has been concluded between stereochemically active lone pairs and optical anisotropy. It is beneficial to the analysis and prediction of birefringence in tin&#8208;based halides and provides a guide for exploring tin(II)&#8208;based optoelectronic functional materials.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed radical enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction used for the synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters is reported. This method has the power to not only produce both diastereoisomers with excellent enantioselectivities but can also provide selectively a single diastereoisomer or all four diastereoisomers depending on the conditions.







Abstract
Chiral heterocycles with two or more carbon stereocenters are quite important skeletons in many fields. However, powerful strategies for the construction of such synthetically valuable heterocycles, especially with two or more remote carbon stereocenters, have largely lagged behind. We report here a powerful method for the synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters from readily available chemical feedstocks under mild conditions. Both of the two diastereoisomers can be obtained with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The well&#8208;designed copper/PyBox catalytic system overrides the intrinsic stereoinduction of the close chirality center generated by the previous innocent radical addition step. Nevertheless, this work has the power to selectively provide one single diastereoisomer by taking advantage of the epimerization effect but also to synthesize all four diastereoisomers with the pair of chiral ligands L2 and L2&#8242; having opposite chirality. The obtained useful chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones can be synthetically transformed into acyclic or cyclic molecules with two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical reaction follows a linear relationship and can be well performed with a less loading amount of ligand compared to that of the copper catalyst.

         <title>Aryl&#8208;to&#8208;Vinyl 1,4&#8208;Nickel Migration/Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Multisubstituted Olefins</title>

         <dc:description>
The 1,4&#8208;nickel migration process from aryl to alkenyl groups is now reported for the first time. The alkenyl nickel intermediates generated by this highly stereoselective migration process can be coupled with brominated alkanes to form multisubstituted olefins. The current method provides a new and efficient approach for the synthesis of Z/E olefins with high stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The aryl&#8208;to&#8208;vinyl nickel 1,4&#8208;migration (1,4&#8208;Ni migration) reaction has been reported for the first time. The generated alkenyl Ni species undergo a reductive coupling reaction with unactivated brominated alkanes affording a series of trisubstituted olefins. This tandem reaction exhibits mild conditions, a broad substrate scope, high regioselectivity, and excellent Z/E stereoselectivity. A series of controlled experiments have shown that the critical 1,4&#8208;Ni migration process is reversible. In addition, the alkenyl nickel intermediates obtained after migration are highly Z/E stereoselective and do not undergo Z/E isomerization. The obtained trace isomerization products are caused by the instability of the product.

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanorings: Synthesis, Properties and Hierarchical Self&#8208;assembly of Chiral Ternary Complexes Featuring a Narcissistic Chiral Self&#8208;Recognition for Chiral Amines</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral carbon nanorings with excellent photophysical and chiroptical properties have been synthesized. Importantly, Chiral ternary complexes, consisted of chiral carbon nanorings, 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and protonated chiral amines, display excellent narcissistic chiral self&#8208;recognition for protonated chiral amines.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and chiroptical properties of novel chiral carbon nanorings Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP containing a planar chiral [2.2]PCP unit, and demonstrate that Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP can not only host crown ether 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring complexes with a binding constant 3.35&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1, but also accommodate the complexes of 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and S/R&#8208;protonated amines to form homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; and heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208; ternary complexes, displaying significantly larger binding constants of up to 3.31&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 depending on the chiral guests. Importantly, homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes exhibit an enhanced CD signal, while the heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208; ones have a constant CD signal compared with the chiral carbon nanorings, respectively, which suggests that homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes display a highly narcissistic chiral self&#8208;recognition for S/R&#8208;protonated chiral amines, respectively. Finally, the chiral ternary complexes can be further applied to determine the ee values of chiral guests. The findings highlight a new application of carbon nanorings in supramolecular sensors, beyond the common recognition of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.

         <title>Discovery of the Azaserine Biosynthetic Pathway Uncovers a Biological Route for &#945;&#8208;Diazoester Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the &#945;&#8208;diazoester natural product azaserine is reported. Isotope feeding and biochemical experiments implicate generation of a hydrazonoacetic acid intermediate that is oxidized and transferred to l&#8208;serine. This pathway represents a distinct biosynthetic strategy for diazo formation.







Abstract
Azaserine is a bacterial metabolite containing a biologically unusual and synthetically enabling &#945;&#8208;diazoester functional group. Herein, we report the discovery of the azaserine (aza) biosynthetic gene cluster from Glycomyces harbinensis. Discovery of related gene clusters reveals previously unappreciated azaserine producers, and heterologous expression of the aza gene cluster confirms its role in azaserine assembly. Notably, this gene cluster encodes homologues of hydrazonoacetic acid (HYAA)&#8208;producing enzymes, implicating HYAA in &#945;&#8208;diazoester biosynthesis. Isotope feeding and biochemical experiments support this hypothesis. These discoveries indicate that a 2&#8208;electron oxidation of a hydrazonoacetyl intermediate is required for &#945;&#8208;diazoester formation, constituting a distinct logic for diazo biosynthesis. Uncovering this biological route for &#945;&#8208;diazoester synthesis now enables the production of a highly versatile carbene precursor in cells, facilitating approaches for engineering complete carbene&#8208;mediated biosynthetic transformations in vivo.

         <title>Functionalization of Olefinic C&#8722;H Bonds by an Aryl&#8208;to&#8208;Vinyl 1,4&#8208;Nickel Migration/Reductive Coupling Sequence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented aryl&#8208;to&#8208;vinyl 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift process with further subsequent selective reductive cross&#8208;coupling with a wide variety of electrophiles has been developed. This 1,4&#8208;nickel migration/reductive coupling sequence provides a facile access to diverse alkenyl C&#8722;H&#8208;functionalized products under mild conditions and with overall good selectivity.







Abstract
An attractive approach to selective functionalization of remote C&#8722;H bonds is a metal/hydride shift/cross&#8208;coupling reaction sequence. Complimentary to the heavily exploited 1,2&#8208;nickel/hydride shift along an sp3 chain, a chain&#8208;walking process, the 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift along an sp2 chain is more complex. Here we report an unprecedented aryl&#8208;to&#8208;vinyl 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift reaction, in which the migratory alkenylnickel species generated in situ is selectively trapped by one of various coupling partners, such as isocyanates, alkyl bromides, aryl chlorides or alkynyl bromides, allowing regio&#8208; and stereoselective access to trisubstituted alkenes. In contrast to the well&#8208;reported ipso&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, this strategy provides remote alkenyl C&#8722;H functionalized products with good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E/Z&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement of Diaryliodonium Salts in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel iodonium Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement featuring an aryl transfer from I to C pathway was developed, where no metal&#8208; or photo&#8208;catalysts are needed. The interaction between ionic liquids and diaryliodonium salts largely contributed to the efficiency of the reaction under mild conditions. This method furnished 64&#8197;examples of sulfonyl substituted ortho&#8208;iodo diarylmethanes as potentially valuable building blocks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is an intramolecular SNAr reaction, enabling the formation of a new arene carbon&#8208;carbon bond with sufficiently strong carbon&#8208;centered nucleophile. Reported here are ortho&#8208;tosylmethylene functionalized diaryliodonium salts, which can undergo an unprecedented Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement in ionic liquids, resulting in sulfonyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;iodo diarylmethanes as a powerful class of building blocks in chemical synthesis. The protocol features aryliodo moiety as a hyper nucleofuge, facilitating the formation of Meisenheimer complex within the migratory system.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Performance of Cobalt Oxide by Protic Ionic Liquid Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of a protic ionic liquid N&#8208;butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bim]NTf2) on Co3O4&#8722;x can improve the Lewis acidity of the Co center, shuttle protons and construct a hydrogen bonded and hydrophobic electrode surface microenvironment. In this way the simultaneous promotion of reactivity and selectivity of the electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia reaction can be realized.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is an appealing way for small&#8208;scale and decentralized ammonia synthesis and waste nitrate treatment. Currently, strategies to enhance the reaction performance through elaborate catalyst design have been well developed, but it is still of challenge to realize the promotion of reactivity and selectivity at the same time. Instead, a facile method of catalyst modification with ionic liquid to modulate the electrode surface microenvironment that mimic the role of the natural MoFe protein environment is found effective for the simultaneous improvement of NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a low NaNO3 concentration of 500&#8197;ppm. Protic ionic liquid (PIL) N&#8208;butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bim]NTf2) modified Co3O4&#8722;x is fabricated and affords the NH3 yield rate and FE of 30.23&#177;4.97&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and 84.74&#177;3.43&#8201;% at &#8722;1.71 and &#8722;1.41&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, outperforming the pristine Co3O4&#8722;x. Mechanistic and theoretical studies reveal that the PIL modification facilitates the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8722; as well as the NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction competition via enhancing the Lewis acidity of the Co center, shuttling protons, and constructing a hydrogen bonded and hydrophobic electrode surface microenvironment.

         <title>Pnictogen Interactions with Nitrogen Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular rotors were designed to experimentally measure the transition state stabilizing abilities of nitrogen pnictogen interactions. The rotors formed intramolecular C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions in the bond rotation transition states. Many common nitrogen functional groups were observed to form stabilizing interactions including amides, imines, and nitro groups.







Abstract
Stabilizing nitrogen pnictogen bond interactions were measured using molecular rotors. Intramolecular C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions were formed in the bond rotation transition states which lowered the rotational barriers and increased the rates of rotation, as measured by EXSY NMR. The pnictogen interaction energies show a very strong correlation with the positive electrostatic potential on nitrogen, which was consistent with a strong electrostatic component. In contrast, the NBO perturbation and pyramidalization analyses show no correlation, suggesting that the orbital&#8208;orbital component is minor. The strongest C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N pnictogen interactions were comparable to C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions and were stronger than C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ph interactions, when measured using the same N&#8208;phenylimide rotor system. The ability of the nitrogen pnictogen interactions to stabilize transition states and enhance kinetic processes demonstrates their potential in catalysis and reaction design.

         <title>Structural Switching of a Distorted Trigonal Metal&#8208;Organic Cage to a Tetragonal Cage and Singlet Oxygen Mediated Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distorted trigonal cage 1 was synthesized by a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. 1 exhibited a complete structural switching in the presence of C70 to form tetragonal complex (C70)2@2. The acetonitrile&#8208;soluble PF6&#175; analogue of (C70)2@2 was found to act as an excellent photosensitizer and catalyzed singlet oxygen mediated oxidation reactions under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Construction of metal&#8211;organic cages with unique architecture and guest binding abilities is highly desirable. Herein, we report the synthesis of a distorted trigonal cage&#8197;(1) from a twisted tetratopic ligand (L) and a PdII acceptor. Surprisingly, 1 exhibited a complete structural reorganization of its building units in the presence of C70 and C60 to form guest&#8208;encapsulated tetragonal cages, (C70)2@2 and (C60)2@2, respectively. These guest&#8208;bound cages were found to be potential 1O2 generators, with the former effectively catalyzing two different varieties of 1O2&#8208;mediated oxidation reactions.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction of metal&#8211;organic cages with unique architecture and guest binding abilities is highly desirable. Herein, we report the synthesis of a distorted trigonal cage&#8197;(&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) from a twisted tetratopic ligand (&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;) and a Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; acceptor. Surprisingly, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibited a complete structural reorganization of its building units in the presence of C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; to form guest-encapsulated tetragonal cages, (C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. These guest-bound cages were found to be potential &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generators, with the former effectively catalyzing two different varieties of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated oxidation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tin(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enabling Efficient, Selective Reduction of CO2 to Formate under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin(II)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) demonstrated selective CO2 photoreduction into formate. This MOF is an environmentally benign material containing only earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;toxic elements such as tin, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, but shows high formate generation selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) and apparent quantum yield (9.8&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Certain metal complexes are known as high&#8208;performance CO2 reduction photocatalysts driven by visible light. However, most of them rely on rare, precious metals as principal components, and integrating the functions of light absorption and catalysis into a single molecular unit based on abundant metals remains a challenge. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which can be regarded as intermediate compounds between molecules and inorganic solids, are potential platforms for the construction of a simple photocatalytic system composed only of Earth&#8208;abundant nontoxic elements. In this work, we report that a tin&#8208;based MOF enables the conversion of CO2 into formic acid with a record high apparent quantum yield (9.8&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm) and &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity without the need for any additional photosensitizer or catalyst. This work highlights a new MOF with strong potential for photocatalytic CO2 reduction driven by solar energy.

         <title>Free Amino Group Transfer via &#945;&#8208;Amination of Native Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 28, July 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino group transfer strategy was developed to install free NH2 to the &#945;&#8208;position of native carbonyls under mild conditions. The resulting primary &#945;&#8208;aminated products are amenable to in situ peptide coupling or Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization in one&#8208;pot procedures. We anticipate this method to provide a general platform towards the synthesis of amines, ultimately opening exciting avenues in the synthesis and medicinal study of peptidomimetics.







Abstract
We report herein a straightforward transfer of a free amino group (NH2) from a commercially available nitrogen source to unfunctionalized, native carbonyls (amides and ketones) resulting in direct &#945;&#8208;amination. Primary &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyls are readily produced under mild conditions, further enabling diverse in situ functionalization reactions&#8212;including peptide coupling and Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization&#8212;that capitalize on the presence of the unprotected primary amine.

         <title>Dynamic Zn/Electrolyte Interphase and Enhanced Cation Transfer of Sol Electrolyte for All&#8208;Climate Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn metal as one of the promising anodes of aqueous batteries possesses the notable advantages, but it faces severe challenges from serious side reactions and notorious dendrite growth. Herein, ultrathin nanosheets of &#945;&#8208;zirconium phosphate (ZrP) are explored as an electrolyte additive. The nanosheets not only create a dynamic and reversible interphase on Zn, but also promote the Zn2+ transportation in the electrolyte, especially in the outer Helmholtz plane near ZrP. Benefited from the enhanced kinetics and dynamic interphase, the pouch cells of Zn||LiMn2O4 using this electrolyte show the remarkably improved electrochemical performance under harsh conditions, i.e. Zn powders as the Zn anode, limited N/P ratio, high mass loading, and wide temperatures. The results expand the materials available for this dynamic interphase, provide the insightful understanding about the enhanced charge transfer in the electrolyte, and realize the combination of dynamic interphase and enhanced kinetics for all&#8208;climate performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Radical Polymerization of a Side&#8208;Chain Transformable Bulky Acrylamide Monomer and Subsequent PPM for Syntheses of Isotactic Polyacrylate and Polyacrylamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report syntheses of isotactic polyacrylate and polyacrylamide via a stereospecific radical polymerization of a pendant&#8208;transformable monomer, acrylamide carrying isopropyl&#8208;substituted ureidosulfonamide (1), followed by post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM). The study in the alcoholysis and aminolysis reactions of the model compound (2) for evaluation of the transformation ability of the electron&#8208;withdrawing pendant group on the repeating unit 1 revealed the following points: the pendant of the polymer became more reactive than that of monomer; the pendant was active enough for aminolysis reaction affording the amide compound quantitatively without additive/catalyst; the addition of a lithium triflate [Li(OTf)] and triethylamine (Et3N) was effective as for promotion of the alcoholysis reaction. Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) was quantitatively obtained via the radical polymerization of 1 in the presence of Li(OTf) at 60 &#730;C and the subsequent addition of methanol along with Et3N. Thus&#8208;obtained PMA showed higher isotacticity [m = 74%] than that directly obtained via radical polymerization of methyl acrylate (MA) (m = 51%). The isotacticity was further increased as the temperature and monomer concentration were lower, and eventually m was increased up to 93%. The aminolysis PPM after the iso&#8208;specific radical polymerization of 1 gave various isotactic polyacrylamides carrying different alkyl pendant groups, including poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM).</dc:description>

         <title>Fast&#8208;Response Nickel&#8208;Promoted Indium Oxide Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation from Intermittent Solar Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of a "net&#8208;zero&#8208;emission" system through CO2 hydrogenation to methanol with solar energy is an eco&#8208;friendly way to mitigate the greenhouse effect. Traditional CO2 hydrogenation demands centralized mass production for cost reduction with mass water electrolysis for hydrogen supply. To achieve continuous reaction with intermittent and fluctuating flow of H2 on small&#8208;scale for distributed application scenarios, modulating the catalyst interface environment and chemical adsorption capacity to adapt fluctuating reaction conditions is highly desired. This paper describes a distributed clean CO2 utilization system in which the surface structure of catalysts is carefully regulated. The Ni catalyst with unsaturated electrons loaded on In2O3 can reduce the dissociation energy of H2 to overcome the slow response of intermittent H2 supply, exhibiting a faster response (12 min) than bare oxide catalysts (42 min). Moreover, the introduction of Ni enhances the sensitivity of catalyst to hydrogen, enabling Ni/In2O3 catalyst with a good performance at lower H2 concentrations with a 15 times adaptability for wider hydrogen fluctuation range than In2O3, greatly reducing the negative impact of unstable H2 supplies from renewable energies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>P&#8208;type polymers are polymeric semiconducting materials that conduct holes and have extensive applications in optoelectronics such as organic photovoltaics. Taking the advantage of intrinsic discontinuous light absorption of organic semiconductors, semitransparent organic photovoltaics (STOPVs) present compelling opportunities in various potential applications such as building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, agrivoltaics, automobiles and wearable electronics. The characteristics of p&#8208;type polymers, including optical, electronic and morphological properties, determine the performance of STOPVs, and the requirements for p&#8208;type polymers differ between opaque organic photovoltaics and STOPVs. Hence, in this Minireview, recent advances of p&#8208;type polymers used in STOPVs are systematically summarized, with emphasis on the effects of chemical structures, conformation structures and aggregation structures of p&#8208;type polymers on the performance of STOPVs. Furthermore, new design concepts and guidelines are also proposed for p&#8208;type polymers to facilitate the future development of high&#8208;performance STOPVs.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Organoboron Species as Lewis Superacids and Organic Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report unveils an advancement in the formation of a Lewis superacid (LSA) and an organic superbase by the geometrical deformation of an organoboron species towards a T&#8208;shaped geometry. The boron dication [2]2+ supported by an amido diphosphine pincer ligand features both a large fluoride ion affinity (FIA &gt; SbF5) and hydride ion affinity (HIA &gt; B(C6F5)3), which qualifies it as both a hard and soft LSA. The unusual Lewis acidic properties of [2]2+ are further showcased by its ability to abstract hydride and fluoride from Et3SiH and AgSbF6 respectively, and effectively catalyze the hydrodefluorination, defluorination/arylation, as well as reduction of carbonyl compounds. One and two&#8208;electron reduction of [2]2+ affords stable boron radical cation [2]&#8226;+ and borylene 2, respectively. The former species has an extremely high spin density of 0.798e at the boron atom, whereas the latter compound has been demonstrated to be a strong organic base (calcd. pKBH+ (MeCN) = 47.4) by both theoretical and experimental assessment. Overall, these results demonstrate the strong ability of geometric constraining to empower the central boron atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Diazulenorubicene as a Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of peri&#8208;Tetracene with Two Sets of 5/7/5 Membered Rings Showing Good Semiconducting Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A (3+2) annulation reaction has been used to synthesize diazulenorubicenes (DARs), non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings. These compounds show red&#8208;shifted absorptions, low LUMO energies, aromaticity switching, and high charge mobilities up to 1.27&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, on&#8208;surface synthesis with the DAR compounds leads to large non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have received a lot of attention because of their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a non&#8208;benzenoid isomer of peri&#8208;tetracene, diazulenorubicene (DAR), with two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings synthesized by a (3+2) annulation reaction. Compared with the precursor containing only 5/7 membered rings, the newly formed five membered rings switch the aromaticity of the original heptagon/pentagon from antiaromatic/aromatic to non&#8208;aromatic/antiaromatic respectively, modify the intermolecular packing modes, and lower the LUMO levels. Notably, compound 2&#8201;b (DAR&#8208;TMS) shows p&#8208;type semiconducting properties with a hole mobility up to 1.27&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Moreover, further extension to larger non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs with 19&#8197;rings was achieved through on&#8208;surface chemistry from the DAR derivative with one alkynyl group.

         <title>Quantifying Degradation Parameters of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The cycling stability shows an inverse relationship with the thickness of the NiO surface layer. Simulation analysis further indicates that the slower Li+ diffusivity of NiO mainly accounts for the performance decay of the cathode.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal LiNixCoyMnzO2 (SC&#8208;NCM, x+y+z=1) cathodes are renowned for their high structural stability and reduced accumulation of adverse side products during long&#8208;term cycling. While advances have been made using SC&#8208;NCM cathode materials, careful studies of cathode degradation mechanisms are scarce. Herein, we employed quasi single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.20O2 (SC&#8208;NCM65) to test the relationship between cycling performance and material degradation for different charge cutoff potentials. The Li/SC&#8208;NCM65 cells showed &gt;77&#8201;% capacity retention below 4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li after 400 cycles and revealed a significant decay to 56&#8201;% for 4.7&#8197;V cutoff. We demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The NiO&#8208;type layer formation is also responsible for the strongly increased impedance and transition&#8208;metal dissolution. Notably, the capacity loss is found to have a linear relationship with the thickness of the rock&#8208;salt surface layer. Density functional theory and COMSOL Multiphysics modeling analysis further indicate that the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics is decisive, as the lower lithium diffusivity of the NiO phase hinders charge transport from the surface to the bulk.

         <title>Structural&#8208;transformation&#8208;induced Drastic Luminescence Changes in an Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid [ReN(CN)4]2&#8722; Salt Triggered by Chemical Stimuli</title>

         <dc:description>
The large shift in luminescent properties between near&#8208;infrared and visible emissions without any loss in quantum yield was achieved by massive structural changes of an organic&#8211;inorganic luminescent hybrid.







Abstract
We synthesized a (1&#8208;propylpyridinium)2[ReN(CN)4]&#8208;type organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid exhibiting water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced drastic structural changes of the [ReN(CN)4]2&#8722; assemblies. Specifically, upon exposure to water vapor, dehydrated nitrido&#8208;bridged chains were converted to hydrated cyanido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear clusters via rearrangements of large molecular building units in the crystals. These switchable assembly forms display substantially different photo&#8208;physical properties, although in both cases the emission is caused by a metal&#8208;centered d&#8211;d transition. The nitrido&#8208;bridged chain exhibited a near&#8208;infrared (749&#8197;nm) emission, which blue&#8208;shifted as the temperature increased, while a visible (561&#8197;nm) emission and its red shift was demonstrated by the cyanido&#8208;bridged cluster.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones via Tandem Allylboration/Lactonization: a Kinetic Resolution Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones via a tandem allylboration/lactonization approach was achieved using a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex. The kinetic resolution of the allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization was found to be a key aspect responsible for the success of this transformation. Stereodivergent syntheses and total syntheses of eupomatilones 2, 5 and 6 proved its synthetic utility.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone motif is a widely encountered unit in many natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, a practical and efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones from readily available allylic boronates and benzaldehyde derivatives was developed with chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/AlIII complex as the catalyst. The key success of this transformation was the kinetic resolution of allylboration intermediate via asymmetric lactonization. This protocol enabled to assemble all of four stereoisomers from the same set of starting materials upon variable lactonization. Taking advantage of the current method as the key step, catalytic asymmetric total synthesis of eupomatilones 2, 5, and 6 was accomplished. Control experiments were carried out to probe into the tandem reaction as well as the origin of stereoselectivities.

A one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation process applied to 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones under borane catalysis with PhSiH3 for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines is presented. Experimental studies and density functional theory calculations were conducted to explore the reaction mechanism. The diastereoselectivity was found to originate from a C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed marked progress in the efficient synthesis of various enantioenriched 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines. However, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective access to trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines remains much less explored. Herein we report that a frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;based catalyst generated via in situ hydroboration of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene with HB(C6F5)2 allows for the one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones with commercially available PhSiH3 to exclusively afford trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Furthermore, this reaction can be rendered asymmetric by using an enantioenriched borane&#8208;based catalyst derived from HB(C6F5)2 and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene to give rise to enantioenriched trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with almost complete diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A wide substrate scope, good tolerance of diverse functionality and up to 20&#8208;gram scale production are demonstrated. The enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol are achieved by the judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane. The catalytic pathway and the origin of the excellent stereoselectivity are elucidated by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations.

Herein we report that a frustrated Lewis pair-based catalyst generated via in situ hydroboration of 2-vinylnaphthalene with HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allows for the one-pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2-diaminobenzenes and 1,2-diketones with commercially available PhSiH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively afford &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Furthermore, this reaction can be rendered asymmetric by using an enantioenriched borane-based catalyst derived from HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a binaphthyl-based chiral diene to give rise to enantioenriched &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2,3-disubstituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with almost complete diastereo- and enantiocontrol (&amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A wide substrate scope, good tolerance of diverse functionality and up to 20-gram scale production are demonstrated. The enantio- and diastereocontrol are achieved by the judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane. The catalytic pathway and the origin of the excellent stereoselectivity are elucidated by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Ring&#8208;Opening Dihydroboration of Arylidenecyclopropanes to Access Skipped Diboronates</title>

         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening dihydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes with pinacolborane is developed to access synthetically versatile 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;diboronates. The catalysts are generated in situ from Co(acac)2/dpephos and Co(acac)2/xantphos, respectively. The ring&#8208;opening of arylidenecyclopropanes to form single homoallylic cobalt intermediates via &#946;&#8208;C elimination is crucial for the obtained high regioselectivity.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening dihydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes is developed to access synthetically versatile skipped diboronates with catalysts generated in situ from Co(acac)2 and dpephos or xantphos. A variety of arylidenecyclopropanes reacted with pinacolborane (HBpin) to form the corresponding 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;diboronates in high isolated yields and with high regioselectivity. Skipped diboronate products from these reactions can undergo various transformations to allow selective installation of two different functional groups along alkyl chains. Mechanistic studies suggest that these reactions combine cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes and hydroboration of homoallylic or allylic boronate intermediates.

         <title>Designs of Tandem Catalysts and Cascade Catalytic Systems for CO2 Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the design principles and development of tandem catalysts for CO2 upgrading to C2+ chemicals by CO2RR, as well as the cascade catalytic systems to tandem&#8208;utilize the C2+ products from CO2RR and achieve their subsequent conversion to higher order compounds. The current challenges in cascade CO2RR systems are discussed and potential approaches for future developments are outlined.







Abstract
Upgrading CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds through the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a practical approach to mitigate atmospheric CO2 while simultaneously producing high value chemicals. The reaction pathways for C2+ production involve multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and C&#8722;C coupling processes. By increasing the surface coverage of adsorbed protons (*Had) and *CO intermediates, the reaction kinetics of PCET and C&#8722;C coupling can be accelerated, thereby promoting C2+ production. However, *Had and *CO are competitively adsorbed intermediates on monocomponent catalysts, making it difficult to break the linear scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of the *Had/*CO intermediate. Recently, tandem catalysts consisting of multicomponents have been developed to improve the surface coverage of *Had or *CO by enhancing water dissociation or CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO production on auxiliary sites. In this context, we provide a comprehensive overview of the design principles of tandem catalysts based on reaction pathways for C2+ products. Moreover, the development of cascade CO2RR catalytic systems that integrate CO2RR with downstream catalysis has expanded the range of potential CO2 upgrading products. Therefore, we also discuss recent advancements in cascade CO2RR catalytic systems, highlighting the challenges and perspectives in these systems.

         <title>Azoheteroarene and Diazocine Molecular Photoswitches: Self&#8208;Assembly, Responsive Materials and Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azoheteroarenes and cyclic azobenzenes have emerged as versatile molecular photoswitches beyond azobenzenes. In this minireview, we highlight some of the most promising azo&#8208;based molecular photoswitches (arylazopyrazoles, arylazoisoxazoles, arylazopyridines and diazocines) and discuss their application in supramolecular assembly, responsive materials and photopharmacology.







Abstract
Aromatic units tethered with an azo (&#8722;N=N&#8722;) functionality comprise a unique class of compounds, known as molecular photoswitches, exhibiting a reversible transformation between their E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers in response to photo&#8208;irradiation. Photoswitches have been explored extensively in the recent past to prepare dynamic self&#8208;assembled materials, optoelectronic devices, responsive biomaterials, and more. Most of such materials involve azobenzenes as the molecular photoswitch and to date, SciFinder lists more than 7000&#8197;articles and 1000&#8197;patents. Subsequently, a great deal of effort has been invested to improve the photo&#8208;isomerization efficiency and related mesoscopic properties of azobenzenes. Recently, azoheteroarenes and cyclic azobenzenes, such as arylazopyrazoles, arylazoisoxazoles, arylazopyridines, and diazocines, have emerged as second generation molecular photoswitches beyond conventional azobenzenes. These photoswitches offer distinct photoswitching behavior and responsive properties which make them highly promising candidates for multifaceted applications ranging from photoresponsive materials to photopharmacophores. In this minireview, we introduce the structural refinement and photoresponsive properties of azoheteroarenes and diazocines and summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art on utilizing these photoswitches as responsive building blocks in supramolecular assembly, material science and photopharmacology, highlighting their versatile photochemical behavior, enhanced functionality, and latest applications.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution through Retarded Charge Trapping and Recombination by Continuously Distributed Defects in Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by its great success in the photovoltaic field, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) has recently been actively explored as photocatalysts in H2 evolution reactions. However, the practical application of MAPbI3 photocatalysts remains hampered by the intrinsically fast trapping and recombination of photogenerated charges. Herein, we propose a novel strategy of regulating the distribution of defective areas to promote charge&#8208;transfer dynamics of MAPbI3 photocatalysts. By deliberately designing and synthesizing the MAPbI3 photocatalysts featuring a unique continuation of defective areas, we demonstrate that such a feature enables retardation of charge trapping and recombination via lengthening the charge&#8208;transfer distance. As an outcome, such MAPbI3 photocatalysts turn out to achieve an impressive photocatalytic H2 evolution rate as high as 0.64 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, one order of magnitude higher than that of the conventional MAPbI3 photocatalysts. This work establishes a new paradigm for controlling charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cobalt&#8208;Tin and &#8208;Lead Tetrylidynes &#8211; Reactivity Study of the Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrylidynes [TbbSn&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (1a) and [TbbPb&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (2) (Tbb = 2,6&#8208;[CH(SiMe3)2]2&#8208;4&#8208;(t&#8208;Bu)C6H2) are accessed for the first time via a substitution reaction between [Na(OEt2)][Co(PMe3)4] and [Li(thf)2][TbbEBr2] (E = Sn, Pb). Following an alternative procedure the stannylidyne [Ar*Sn&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (1b) was synthesized by hydrogen atom abstraction using AIBN from the paramagnetic hydride complex [Ar*SnH=Co(PMe3)3] (4) (AIBN = azobis(isobutyronitrile)). The stannylidyne 1a adds two equivalents of water to yield the dihydroxide [TbbSn(OH)2CoH2(PMe3)3] (5). In reaction of the stannylidyne 1a with CO2 a product of a redox reaction [TbbSn(CO3)Co(CO)(PMe3)3] (6) was isolated. Protonation of the tetrylidynes occurs at the cobalt atom to give the metalla&#8208;stanna vinyl cation [TbbSn=CoH(PMe3)3][BArF4] (7a) [ArF = C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CF3)2].

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tetrylidynes [TbbSn&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (1a) and [TbbPb&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (2) (Tbb = 2,6-[CH(SiMe3)2]2-4-(t-Bu)C6H2) are accessed for the first time via a substitution reaction between [Na(OEt2)][Co(PMe3)4] and [Li(thf)2][TbbEBr2] (E = Sn, Pb). Following an alternative procedure the stannylidyne [Ar*Sn&#8801;Co(PMe3)3] (1b) was synthesized by hydrogen atom abstraction using AIBN from the paramagnetic hydride complex [Ar*SnH=Co(PMe3)3] (4) (AIBN = azobis(isobutyronitrile)). The stannylidyne 1a adds two equivalents of water to yield the dihydroxide [TbbSn(OH)2CoH2(PMe3)3] (5).

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Brushes Grown by Surface&#8208;Initiated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization from Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;based Non&#8208;Covalent Initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer brushes are densely grafted, chain end&#8208;tethered assemblies of polymers that can be produced via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. Typically, this is accomplished using initiators or chain transfer agents that are covalently attached to the substrate. This manuscript reports an alternative route towards polymer brushes, which involves the use of non&#8208;covalent cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;adamantane host&#8208;guest interactions to surface&#8208;immobilize initiators for atom transfer radical polymerization. These non&#8208;covalent initiators can be used for the surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization of a variety of water&#8208;soluble methacrylate monomers to generate supramolecular polymer brushes with film thicknesses of more than 100 nm. The non&#8208;covalent nature of the initiator also allows facile access to patterned polymer brushes, which can be produced in straightforward fashion by drop&#8208;casting a solution of the initiator&#8208;modified guest molecules onto a substrate that presents the cucurbit[7]uril host.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Metal Oxide Interactions in Pd&#8209;In2O3/ZrO2&#160;Catalysts Drive Selective and Stable CO2&#160;Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ternary Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2&#160;catalysts exhibit technological potential for CO2&#8208;based methanol synthesis, but developing scalable systems and comprehending complex dynamic behaviors of the active phase, promoter, and carrier are key for achieving high productivity. Here, we show that the structure of Pd&#8209;In2O3/ZrO2&#160;systems prepared by wet impregnation evolves under CO2&#160;hydrogenation conditions into a selective and stable architecture, independent of the order of addition of Pd and In phases. Detailed&#160;operando&#160;characterization and simulations reveal a rapid restructuring driven by the metal&#8208;metal oxide interaction energetics. The proximity of InPdx&#160;alloy particles decorated by InOx&#160;layers in the resulting architecture prevents performance losses associated with Pd sintering. The findings highlight the crucial role of reaction&#8208;induced restructuring in complex CO2&#160;hydrogenation catalysts and offer insights&#160;into the optimal integration of acid&#8208;base and redox functions&#160;for practical implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Manganese(I) Complexes: Efficient and Simple Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of bis(NHC) manganese(I) complexes 3 as catalysts for the hydrogenation of esters was investigated. For that purpose, a series of complexes has been synthesized via an improved two step procedure utilizing bis(NHC)&#8208;BEt3 adducts. By applying complexes 3 with KHBEt3 as additive, various aromatic and aliphatic esters were hydrogenated successfully at mild temperatures and low catalyst loadings, highlighting the efficiency of the novel catalytic system. The versatility of the developed catalytic system was further demonstrated by the hydrogenation of other substrate classes like ketones, nitriles, N&#8208;heteroarenes and alkenes. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations indicate an inner sphere mechanism with the loss of one CO ligand and reveal the role of BEt3 as cocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavage of Carbon Dioxide C=O Bond Promoted by Nickel Boron Cooperativity in a PBP&#8208;Ni Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of (tBuPBP)Ni(OAc) (5) by insertion of carbon dioxide into the Ni&#8211;C bond of (tBuPBP)NiMe (1) is presented. An unexpected CO2 cleavage process involving the formation of new B&#8211;O and Ni&#8211;CO bonds leads to the generation of a butterfly&#8208;structured tetra&#8208;nickel cluster (tBuPBOP)2Ni4(m&#8208;CO)2 (6). Mechanistic investigation of this reaction indicates a reductive scission of CO2 by O&#8208;atom transfer to the boron atom via a cooperative nickel&#8208;boron mechanism. The CO2 activation reaction produces a three coordinate (tBuP2BO)Ni&#8208;acyl intermediate (A) that leads to a (tBuP2BO)&#8208;Ni(I) complex (B) via a likely radical pathway. The Ni(I) species is trapped by treatment with the radical trap (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) to give (tBuP2BO)Ni(II)(&#951;2&#8208;TEMPO) (7). Additionally, 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis using 13C&#8208;enriched CO2 provides information about the species involved in the CO2 activation process.</dc:description>
