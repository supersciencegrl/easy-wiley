         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites Camouflaged with Hybrid Cell Membranes for Accurate Therapy of Early&#8208;Stage Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glioma features high fatality rate and short survival time of patients due to its fast growth speed and high invasiveness, hence timely treatment of early&#8208;stage glioma is extremely important. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) severely prevents therapeutic agents from entering the brain; meanwhile, the non&#8208;targeted distribution of agents always causes side effects to vulnerable cerebral tissues. Therefore, delivery systems that possess both BBB penetrability and precise glioma targeting ability are keenly desired. We herein proposed a hybrid cell membrane (HM) camouflage strategy to construct therapeutic nanocomposites, in which HM consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membrane and glioma cell membrane was prepared with a simple membrane fusion pathway. By coating HM onto drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles, the as&#8208;obtained biomimetic therapeutic agent (termed HMGINPs) inherited satisfying BBB penetrability and homologous glioma targeting ability simultaneously from the two source cells. HMGINPs exhibited good biocompatibility and superior therapeutic efficacy towards early&#8208;stage glioma.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Helicenes Defected by Heteroatoms and Heptagons with Narrow Emissions and Superior Photoluminescence Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of heteroatoms and/or heptagons as the defects into helicenes expands the variety of chiroptical materials with novel properties. However, it is still challenging to construct novel boron&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;containing helicenes with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. We report an efficient and scalable synthesis of a quadruple helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN with two nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (NBN) units and a double helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 bearing two NBN&#8208;doped heptagons, the latter could be formed via a two&#8208;fold Scholl reaction of the former. The helicenes 4Cz&#8208;NBN and 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 exhibit excellent PLQYs up to 99% and 65% with narrow FWHM of 24 nm and 22 nm, respectively. The emission wavelengths are tunable via stepwise titration experiments of 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 toward fluoride, enabling distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from green, orange (4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F1) to yellow (trans/cis&#8208;4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F2) with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and broader circular dichroism (CD) ranges. The five structures of the aforementioned four helicenes were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This work provides a novel design strategy for construction of non&#8208;benzenoid multiple helicenes exhibiting narrow emissions with superior PLQYs.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Liquids Using Interfacial Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilizing liquids based on supramolecular assembly (non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions) has attracted significant interest, due to the increasing demand for soft, liquid&#8208;based devices where the shape of the liquid is far removed from the equilibrium spherical shape. The components comprising these interfacial assemblies must have sufficient binding energies to the interface to prevent their ejection from the interface when the assemblies are compressed. Here, we highlight recent advances in structuring liquids based on non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions. We describe some of the progress made that reveals structure&#8208;property relationships. In addition to treating advances, we discuss some of the limitations and provide a perspective on future directions to inspire further studies on structured liquids based on supramolecular assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically&#8208;Driven CO2 Release Using a Metastable&#8208;State Photoacid for Energy Efficient Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the grand challenges underlying current direct air capture (DAC) technologies relates to the intensive energy cost for sorbent regeneration and CO2 release, making the massive scale (GtCO2/year) deployment required to have a positive impact on climate change economically unfeasible. This challenge underscores the critical need to develop new DAC processes with substantially reduced regeneration energies. Here, we report a photochemically&#8208;driven approach for CO2 release by exploiting the unique properties of an indazole metastable&#8208;state photoacid (mPAH). Our measurements on simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems revealed the potential of mPAH to be used for CO2 release cycles by regulating pH changes and associated isomers driven by light. Upon irradiating with moderate intensity light, a ~55% and ~68% to ~78% conversion of total inorganic carbon to CO2 was found for the simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems, respectively. Our results confirm the feasibility of on&#8208;demand CO2 release under ambient conditions using light instead of heat, thereby providing an energy efficient pathway for the regeneration of DAC sorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>T&#8208;shaped Ni0 Systems Featuring Cationic Tetrylenes: Direct Observation of L/Z&#8208;type Ligand Duality, and Alkene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a facile synthetic method for accessing rare T&#8208;shaped Ni0 species, stabilised by low&#8208;coordinate cationic germylene and stannylene ligands which behave as Z&#8208;type ligands toward Ni0. An in&#8208;depth computational analysis indicates significant Nid&#8594;Ep donation (E = Ge, Sn), with essentially no E&#8594;Ni donation. Further, the tetrylene ligand&#8217;s Lewis acidity can be modulated in&#8208;situ through the addition of a donor ligand, which selectively binds at the Lewis acidic tetrylene site. This switches this binding centre from a Z&#8208;type to a classical L&#8208;type ligand, with a concomitant geometry switch at Ni0 from T&#8208;shaped to trigonal planar. Exploring the effects of this geometry switch in catalysis, isolated T&#8208;shaped complexes 3a&#8208;c and 4a&#8208;c are capable of the hydrogenation of alkenes under mild conditions, whilst the closely related trigonal planar and tetrahedral Ni0 complexes 5, D, and E, which feature an L&#8208;type chloro&#8208; or cationic&#8208;tetrylene ligands, are inactive under these conditions. Further, addition of small amounts of N&#8208;bases to the catalytic systems involving T&#8208;shaped complexes significantly reduces turnover rates, giving evidence for the in&#8208;situ modulation of ligand electronics for catalytic switching.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Genetic Encoding of Unnatural Amino Acid in Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional protein engineering methods for modifying protein nanopore are typically limited to 20 natural amino acids, which restricts the diversity of nanopore in structure and function. To enrich the chemical environment inside the nanopore, we employed the genetic code expansion (GCE) technique to site&#8208;specifically incorporate unnatural amino acid (UAA) into the sensing region of aerolysin nanopore. This approach leveraged the efficient pyrrolysine&#8208;based aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase&#8208;tRNA pair for a high yield of pore&#8208;forming protein. Both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single&#8208;molecule sensing experiments demonstrated that the conformation of UAA residues provided a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of target molecules and the pore. This reasonably designed chemical environment enabled the direct discrimination of multiple peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids. Our work provides a new framework to endow unique sensing properties to nanopore that are difficult to achieve using classical protein engineering approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement of Diaryliodonium Salts in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is an intramolecular SNAr reaction, enabling the formation of a new arene carbon&#8208;carbon bond with sufficiently strong carbon&#8208;centered nucleophile. Reported here are ortho&#8208;tosylmethylene functionalized diaryliodonium salts, which can undergo an unprecedented Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement in ionic liquids, resulting in sulfonyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;iodo diarylmethanes as a powerful class of building blocks in chemical synthesis. The protocol features aryliodo moiety as a hyper nucleofuge, facilitating the formation of Meisenheimer complex within the migratory system.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation of Polyesters to Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of carbon resources stored in plastic polymers through chemical recycling and upcycling is a promising approach for mitigating plastic waste. However, most current methods for upcycling suffer from limited selectivity towards a specific valuable product, particularly when attempting full conversion of the plastic. We present a highly selective reaction route for transforming polylactic acid (PLA) into 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilizing a Zn&#8208;modified Cu catalyst. This reaction exhibits excellent reactivity (0.65 g/(gcat&#183;h)) and selectivity (99.5%) towards 1,2&#8208;propanediol, and most importantly, can be performed in a solvent&#8208;free mode. Significantly, the overall solvent&#8208;free reaction is an atom&#8208;economical reaction with all the atoms in reactants (PLA and H2) fixed into the final product (1,2&#8208;propanediol), eliminating the need for a separation process. This method provides an innovative and economically viable solution for upgrading polyesters to produce high&#8208;purity products under mild conditions with optimal atom utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>The Elusive Structure of Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride Determined by Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Levocetirizine dihydrochloride is a widely known antihistaminic active pharmaceutical ingredient that is effectively used for the relief of allergic symptoms in patients of various age groups. Despite its usage in such medications for more than two decades, its crystal structure has yet to be determined unambiguously. Electron diffraction is used here to determine its crystal structure.







Abstract
Levocetirizine is an orally administrated, second&#8208;generation antihistaminic active pharmaceutical ingredient that has been used to treat symptoms of allergy and long&#8208;term hives for over 25&#8197;years. Despite the wide use of this compound, its crystal structure has remained unknown. Here we report the application of 3D electron diffraction (3D ED)/Micro&#8208;crystal electron diffraction (MicroED) to determine the crystal structure of Levocetirizine dihydrochloride directly from crystalline powders that were extracted from commercially available tablets containing the compound. We also showcase the utility of dynamical refinement to unambiguously assign absolute configuration. The results highlight the immense potential of 3D ED/MicroED for structure elucidation of components of microcrystalline mixtures that obviates the need to grow large&#8208;size single crystals and the use of complementary analytical techniques, which could be important for identification as well as for primary structural characterization.

         <title>Trialkoxysilane Exchange: Scope, Mechanism, Cryptates and pH&#8208;Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange reaction of trialkoxysilanes with alcohols typically requires very harsh conditions and has therefore not been used for the self&#8208;assembly of host&#8208;guest systems. In this work, unexpected solvent and salt effects are described, rationalized and exploited for the synthesis of degradable supramolecular hosts.







Abstract
The dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) of the Si&#8722;O bond holds unique opportunities, but has rarely been employed to assemble discrete molecular architectures. This may be due to the harsh conditions required to initiate exchange reactions at silicon in aprotic solvents. Herein, we provide a comprehensive experimental and computational account on the reaction of trialkoxysilanes with alcohols and identify mild conditions for rapid exchange in aprotic solvents. Substituent, solvent and salt effects are uncovered, understood and exploited for the construction of sila&#8208;orthoester cryptates. A sharp, divergent pH&#8208;response of the obtained cages renders this substance class attractive for future applications well beyond host&#8208;guest chemistry, for instance, in drug delivery.

         <title>A New Sodium Thioborate Fast Ion Conductor: Na 3 B 5 S 9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new sodium fast&#8208;ion conductor, Na3B5S9, that exhibits a high Na ion total conductivity of 0.80 mS&#8729;cm&#8208;1 (sintered pellet; cold&#8208;pressed pellet = 0.21 mS&#8729;cm&#8208;1). The structure consists of corner&#8208;sharing B10S20 supertetrahedral clusters, which create a framework that supports 3D Na ion diffusion channels. The Na ions are well&#8208;distributed in the channels and form a disordered sublattice spanning five Na crystallographic sites. The combination of structural elucidation via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and powder synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at variable temperatures, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal high Na&#8208;ion mobility (predicted conductivity: 0.96 mS&#8729;cm&#8208;1) and the nature of the 3D diffusion pathways. Notably, the Na ion sublattice orders at low temperatures, resulting in isolated Na polyhedra and thus much lower ionic conductivity. This highlights the importance of a disordered Na ion sublattice &#8208; and existence of well&#8208;connected Na ion migration pathways formed via face&#8208;sharing polyhedra &#8208; in dictating Na ion diffusion.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative NanoSIMS Imaging of Individual Vesicles to Investigate the Relation between Fraction of Chemical Release and Vesicle Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We used correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging to quantify the contents of subvesicular compartments, and to measure the partial release fraction of 13C&#8208;dopamine in cellular nanovesicles as a function of size. Three modes of exocytosis comprise full release, kiss&#8208;and&#8208;run, and partial release. The latter has been subject to scientific debate, despite a growing amount of supporting literature. We tailored culturing procedures to alter vesicle size and definitively show no size correlation with the fraction of partial release. In NanoSIMS images, vesicle content was indicated by the presence of isotopic dopamine, while vesicles which underwent partial release were identified by the presence of an 127I&#8208;labelled drug, to which they were exposed during exocytosis allowing entry into the open vesicle prior to its closing again. Demonstration of similar partial release fractions indicates that this mode of exocytosis is predominant across a wide range of vesicle sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>CuNi Nanoalloys with Tunable Composition and Oxygen Defects for the Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of Cu to bimetallic CuNi nanoalloys of tunable composition and size promotes the catalytic activity in the electrochemical Oxygen Evolution reaction and the formation of Ni3+ under reaction conditions. The experimental evidence together with theoretical calculations showed that the relative amount between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen (OV/OL) is an excellent descriptor of the catalytic performance in alkaline conditions.







Abstract
Colloidal synthesis is an excellent tool for the study of cooperative effects in nanoalloys. In this work, bimetallic CuNi nanoparticles of defined size and composition are fully characterized and tested for the oxygen evolution reaction. Copper addition to nickel leads to modifications in the structural and electronic properties, showing a higher concentration of surface oxygen defects and formation of active Ni3+ sites under reaction conditions. The ratio OV/OL between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen shows a clear correlation with the overpotential, being an excellent descriptor of the electrocatalytic activity. This is attributed to modifications in the crystalline structure, leading to lattice strain and grain size effects. Bimetallic Cu50Ni50NP showed the lowest overpotential (318&#8197;mV vs RHE), low Tafel slope (63.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), and excellent stability. This work unravels the relative concentration between oxygen defects and lattice oxygen (OV/OL) as an excellent descriptor of the catalytic activity of bimetallic precatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The addition of Cu to bimetallic CuNi nanoalloys of tunable composition and size promotes the catalytic activity in the electrochemical Oxygen Evolution reaction and the formation of Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; under reaction conditions. The experimental evidence together with theoretical calculations showed that the relative amount between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) is an excellent descriptor of the catalytic performance in alkaline conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal synthesis is an excellent tool for the study of cooperative effects in nanoalloys. In this work, bimetallic CuNi nanoparticles of defined size and composition are fully characterized and tested for the oxygen evolution reaction. Copper addition to nickel leads to modifications in the structural and electronic properties, showing a higher concentration of surface oxygen defects and formation of active Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites under reaction conditions. The ratio O&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen shows a clear correlation with the overpotential, being an excellent descriptor of the electrocatalytic activity. This is attributed to modifications in the crystalline structure, leading to lattice strain and grain size effects. Bimetallic Cu&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;NP showed the lowest overpotential (318&#8197;mV vs RHE), low Tafel slope (63.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and excellent stability. This work unravels the relative concentration between oxygen defects and lattice oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) as an excellent descriptor of the catalytic activity of bimetallic precatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stochastic Simulation of Controlled Radical Polymerization Forming Dendritic Hyperbranched Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stochastic simulation of the formation process of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on the reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) using a branch&#8208;inducing monomer, evolmer, has been carried out. The simulation program successfully reproduced the change of dispersities (&#272;s) during the polymerization process. Furthermore, the simulation suggested that the observed &#272;s (= 1.5~2) are due to the distribution of the number of branches instead of undesired side reactions, and that the branch structures are well controlled. In addition, the analysis of the polymer structure reveals that the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one. The simulation also suggested the slight dependence of branch density on molecular weight, which was experimentally confirmed by synthesizing HBPs with an evolmer having phenyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Diffusion Limitation of Faradaic Processes: Property&#8208;Performance Relationships of 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3(HHTP)2 for Reversible Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional MOF, (Cu3(HHTP)2), is synthesized with two different morphologies. Flake&#8208; and rod&#8208;like shaped particles were evaluated to investigate the impact of the particle morphology of MOFs on electrochemical Li+ ion storage. By optimization of the particle morphology, diffusion limitation of the Faradaic process can be strongly reduced.







Abstract
Faradaic reactions including charge transfer are often accompanied with diffusion limitation inside the bulk. Conductive two&#8208;dimensional frameworks (2D MOFs) with a fast ion transport can combine both&#8212;charge transfer and fast diffusion inside their porous structure. To study remaining diffusion limitations caused by particle morphology, different synthesis routes of Cu&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu3(HHTP)2), a copper&#8208;based 2D MOF, are used to obtain flake&#8208; and rod&#8208;like MOF particles. Both morphologies are systematically characterized and evaluated for redox&#8208;active Li+ ion storage. The redox mechanism is investigated by means of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ XRD. Both types are compared regarding kinetic properties for Li+ ion storage via cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. A significant influence of particle morphology for 2D MOFs on kinetic aspects of electrochemical Li+ ion storage can be observed. This study opens the path for optimization of redox active porous structures to overcome diffusion limitations of Faradaic processes.

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of an Highly Stable Aluminium Phosphonate Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Showing Reversible HCl Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protons make the difference. Highly acidic synthesis conditions were employed to synthesize porous MIII&#8208;phosphonates with different degrees of framework protonation. Rapid release of HCl in solution and re&#8208;adsorption from aqueous solution and from the gas phase is demonstrated and structural changes that accompany these processes are elucidated.







Abstract
A concept for obtaining isoreticular compounds with tri&#8208; instead of tetravalent metal cations using highly acidic reaction conditions was developed and successfully applied in a high throughput study using N,N&#8242;&#8208;piperazinebis(methylenephosphonic&#160;acid) (H4PMP), that resulted in the discovery of a new porous aluminium phosphonate denoted CAU&#8208;60&#8901;6&#8201;HCl. The high&#8208;throughput study was subsequently extended to other trivalent metal ions. Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;60&#8901;6&#8201;HCl demonstrates reversible desorption of HCl (18.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% loading) with three distinct compositions observed with zero, four or six HCl molecules per formula unit. Structural changes were followed in detail by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, EDX analysis as well as IR spectroscopy. Rapid desorption of HCl in water within minutes and subsequent adsorption from the gas phase and from aqueous solution are shown. Furthermore, it is possible to adsorb HBr into the guest free Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;60 framework, demonstrating the high stability of this compound.

         <title>Localized Ligands Assist Ultrafast Multivalent&#8208;Cation Intercalation Pseudocapacitance</title>

         <dc:description>
By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand&#8208;assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon ion intercalation.







Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent cation (Mvn+, n&gt;1) carriers are considered potentially low&#8208;cost alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high charge&#8208;density Mvn+ carriers generally lead to sluggish kinetics and poor structural stability in cathode materials. Herein, we report an Mvn+ storage via intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism in a 2D bivalve&#8208;like organic framework featured with localized ligands. By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand&#8208;assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon intercalation. It thus enables an excellent power density of 57&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 over 20000 cycles for Ca2+ storage and a power density of 14&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a long cycling life over 45000 cycles for Zn2+ storage. This work may provide a largely unexploited route toward constructing a local dynamic coordination microstructure for ultrafast Mvn+ storage.

         <title>Supramolecular Peptide Nanostructures Regulate Catalytic Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;based supramolecular nanostructures can mimic the activity and 3&#8208;dimensional complexity of enzymes. We report three tetrapeptides with the same amino acids but in different orders that self&#8208;assemble into unique nanostructures, and we find that their supramolecular morphology influences enzymatic efficiency. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations reveal how histidine residues clustered in hydrophobic pockets influence their catalytic activity.







Abstract
We report three constitutionally isomeric tetrapeptides, each comprising one glutamic acid (E) residue, one histidine (H) residue, and two lysine (KS) residues functionalized with side&#8208;chain hydrophobic S&#8208;aroylthiooxime (SATO) groups. Depending on the order of amino acids, these amphiphilic peptides self&#8208;assembled in aqueous solution into different nanostructures:nanoribbons, a mixture of nanotoroids and nanoribbons, or nanocoils. Each nanostructure catalyzed hydrolysis of a model substrate, with the nanocoils exhibiting the greatest rate enhancement and the highest enzymatic efficiency. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations, analyzed with unsupervised machine learning, revealed clusters of H residues in hydrophobic pockets along the outer edge of the nanocoils, providing insight for the observed catalytic rate enhancement. Finally, all three supramolecular nanostructures catalyzed hydrolysis of the l&#8208;substrate only when a pair of enantiomeric Boc&#8208;l/d&#8208;Phe&#8208;ONp substrates were tested. This study highlights how subtle molecular&#8208;level changes can influence supramolecular nanostructures, and ultimately affect catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Superatom&#8208;in&#8208;Superatom Nanoclusters: Synthesis, Structure, and Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The doping of group&#8197;8 and 9 metals having unpaired d electrons into a thiolate&#8208;protected Ag25 nanocluster was demonstrated. Open d&#8208;shell group&#8197;8 (Ru, Os) and 9 (Rh, Ir) could be incorporated into the Ag24(SR)18 superatomic framework by forming metal&#8208;hydride superatoms with a closed d&#8208;shell. The synthesized superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters exhibited dopant&#8208;dependent photoluminescence intensities and lifetimes.







Abstract
We report a new strategy in which a thiolate&#8208;protected Ag25 nanocluster can be doped with open d&#8208;shell group&#8197;8 (Ru, Os) and 9 (Ir) metals by forming metal hydride (RuH2, OsH2, IrH) superatoms with a closed d&#8208;shell. Structural analyses using various experimental and theoretical methods revealed that the Ag25 nanoclusters were co&#8208;doped with the open d&#8208;shell metal and hydride species to produce superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters, establishing a novel superatom doping phenomenon for open d&#8208;shell metals. The synthesized superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters exhibited dopant&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Comparative PL lifetime studies of the Ag25 nanoclusters doped with 8&#8211;10&#8197;group metals revealed that both radiative and nonradiative processes were significantly dependent on the dopant. The former is strongly correlated with the electron affinity of the metal dopant, whereas the latter is governed predominantly by the kernel structure changed upon the doping of the metal hydride(s).

         <dc:description>
A method for the C(sp2)&#8722;I selective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) of bromo(iodo)arenes with 3&#176;, 2&#176;, and 1&#176;alkyl bromides is reported. This mild XEC displays a broad scope with demonstrated functional group tolerance and finds use in the streamlined preparation of synthetically challenging bioactive compounds. Given the prevalence of its building blocks and the substrate generality, this discovery will likely inspire numerous applications.







Abstract
Despite several methodologies established for C(sp2)&#8722;I selective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations, achieving arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons by cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl precursors with bromo(iodo)arenes in a C(sp2)&#8722;I selective manner is rare. Here we report a general Ni&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;I selective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) reaction, in which, beyond 3&#176; alkyl bromides (for constructing arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons), 2&#176; and 1&#176; alkyl bromides are also demonstrated to be viable coupling partners. Moreover, this mild XEC displays excellent C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and functional group compatibility. The practicality of this XEC is demonstrated in simplifying the routes to several medicinally relevant and synthetically challenging compounds. Extensive experiments show that the terpyridine&#8208;ligated NiI halide can exclusively activate alkyl bromides, forming a NiI&#8722;alkyl complex through a Zn reduction. Attendant density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal two different pathways for the oxidative addition of the NiI&#8722;alkyl complex to the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond of bromo(iodo)arenes, explaining both the high C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and generality of our XEC.

         <title>A Dicyanomethyl Radical Conjugated with a Pyridylamino Group: Combining Radical&#8208;based Dynamic Covalent Chemistry and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a dicyanomethyl radical with a pyridyl group that combines dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) property based on a reversible radical coupling/cleavage reaction and coordination ability to metal ions for the first time. This work demonstrated that DCC based on dicyanomethyl radicals works orthogonally to metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions.







Abstract
In this work, we aimed to develop a dicyanomethyl radical that undergoes both reversible C&#8722;C bond formation/dissociation and metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions to combine dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) based on organic radicals with coordination chemistry. We have previously reported a dicyanomethyl radical conjugated with a triphenylamine (1&#8901;) that exhibits a monomer/dimer equilibrium between the &#963;&#8208;bonded dimer (12). We designed and synthesized a novel dicyanomethyl radical with a pyridyl group as a coordination point (2&#8901;) by replacing the phenyl group of 1&#8901; with a 3&#8208;pyridyl group. We showed that 2&#8901; is also in an equilibrium with the &#963;&#8208;bonded dimer (22) in solution and has suitable thermodynamic parameters for application in DCC. 22 coordinates to PdCl2 in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio to selectively form a metallamacrocycle (22)2(PdCl2)2, and its structure was clarified by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR, ESR, and electronic absorption measurements revealed that (22)2(PdCl2)2 also undergoes the reversible C&#8722;C bond formation/dissociation reaction. Ligand&#8208;exchange experiment showed that 22 was liberated from (22)2(PdCl2)2 by the addition of another ligand with a higher affinity for PdII. This work demonstrated that DCC based on dicyanomethyl radicals works orthogonally to metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions.

         <title>Constructing Built&#8208;in Electric Field in Heterogeneous Nanowire Arrays for Efficient Overall Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By proposing and fabricating Ni2P&#8208;CoCH heterostructure with large &#916;&#934; as a model catalyst for overall alkaline water electrolysis, the introduction of a strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is successfully realized to create the asymmetrical charge distributions on catalyst surfaces. The negative charge&#8208;enriched Ni2P and positive charge&#8208;enriched CoCH as active sites separately achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities.







Abstract
Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are key to water electrolysis. Herein, we report a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) strategy to fabricate heterogeneous nickel phosphide&#8208;cobalt nanowire arrays grown on carbon fiber paper (Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP) with large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Impressively, Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to obtain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, the assembled lab&#8208;scale electrolyzer driven by an AAA battery delivers excellent stability after 50&#8197;h electrocatalysis with a 100&#8201;% faradic efficiency. Computational calculations combining with experiments reveal the interface&#8208;induced electric field effect facilitates asymmetrical charge distributions, thereby regulating the adsorption/desorption of the intermediates during reactions. This work offers an avenue to rationally design high&#8208;performance heterogeneous electrocatalysts.

         <title>Fucose Binding Motifs on Mucin Core Glycopeptides Impact Bacterial Lectin Recognition
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable studies of fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins, a library of fucosylated mucin glycopeptides carrying Lewis&#8208; and H&#8208;antigen structures on mucin core glycans was prepared using a chemoenzymatic approach. This library was applied to evaluate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecB and the Clostridium difficile toxin A binding preferences to explore the importance of the glycan core and peptide backbone presentation for lectin recognition.







Abstract
Mucin glycoproteins are essential components of the mucosal barrier, which protects the host from pathogens. Throughout evolution, bacteria have developed strategies to modulate and penetrate this barrier, and cause virulence by interacting with mucin O&#8208;glycans at the epithelial cell&#8208;surface. O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes on mucins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. Here, a chemoenzymatic synthesis strategy is described to prepare a library of fucosylated mucin core glycopeptides to enable studies of mucin&#8208;interacting and fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins. Glycan cores with biologically important Lewis and H&#8208;antigens were prepared decorating the peptide backbone at different sites and densities. The fucosylated mucin glycopeptides were applied in microarray binding studies to explore the importance of glycan core and peptide backbone presentation of these antigens in binding interactions with the P.&#8197;aeruginosa lectin LecB and the C.&#8197;difficile toxin&#8197;A.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Alcohols and Ketones via Cross&#8208;Coupling of Secondary Alcohols under Manganese Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two secondary alcohols in a divergent synthesis of either &#947;&#8208;disubstituted alcohols or &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones is herein reported. A wide range of different alcohols could undergo the cross&#8208;coupling process smoothly and furnish the corresponding products by using the same catalyst, with overall moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A homogeneous manganese&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two secondary alcohols for the divergent synthesis of &#947;&#8208;disubstituted alcohols and &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones is reported. Employing the well&#8208;defined Mn&#8208;MACHOPh as the catalyst, this novel protocol has a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and affords a diverse library of valuable disubstituted alcohols and ketones in moderate to good yields. The strong influence of the reaction temperature on the selective formation of alcohol products was theorized in preliminary DFT studies. Studies have shown that the Gibbs free energy of the formation of alcohols is thermodynamically more favourable than corresponding ketones at a lower temperature.

         <title>Carbon Nitride Pillared Vanadate Via Chemical Pre&#8208;Intercalation Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;deficient NH4V4O10 (NVO) nanobelts with large interlayer spacing are fabricated as the cathode for stable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The pre&#8208;intercalated C3N4 acts as the &#8220;pillars&#8221; to enlarge the interplanar spacing for better structural stability and faster ion transfer. The abundant oxygen vacancies improve the conductivity of NVO. The obtained NVO cathode enables exceptional rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling in full cells.







Abstract
Vanadium based compounds are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their high specific capacity. However, the narrow interlayer spacing, low intrinsic conductivity and the vanadium dissolution still restrict their further application. Herein, we present an oxygen&#8208;deficient vanadate pillared by carbon nitride (C3N4) as the cathode for AZIBs through a facile self&#8208;engaged hydrothermal strategy. Of note, C3N4 nanosheets can act as both the nitrogen source and pre&#8208;intercalation species to transform the orthorhombic V2O5 into layered NH4V4O10 with expanded interlayer spacing. Owing to the pillared structure and abundant oxygen vacancies, both the Zn2+ ion (de)intercalation kinetics and the ionic conductivity in the NH4V4O10 cathode are promoted. As a result, the NH4V4O10 cathode delivers exceptional Zn&#8208;ion storage ability with a high specific capacity of about 370&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, a high&#8208;rate capability of 194.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling performance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles.

The PdCu2 nanoparticles are incorporated into isoreticular COFs, namely, MF&#8722;X (X=&#8722;CH3, &#8722;H, &#8722;CF3 and &#8722;CN), for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, where PdCu2@MF&#8722;CH3 exhibits the best catalytic performance. The dual modulation of the Pd microenvironment turns out to be crucial: the Cu species (primary microenvironment) improves the selectivity, while the engineered pore walls around PdCu2 sites (secondary microenvironment) optimize the activity.







Abstract
The chemical microenvironment modulation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) holds promise for tackling the long&#8208;lasting challenge of the trade&#8208;off effect between activity and selectivity in catalysis. Herein, ultrafine PdCu2 NPs incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse groups on their pore walls have been fabricated for the semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Cu species, as the primary microenvironment of Pd active sites, greatly improves the selectivity. The functional groups as the secondary microenvironment around PdCu2 NPs effectively regulate the activity, in which PdCu2 NPs encapsulated in the COF bearing &#8722;CH3 groups exhibit the highest activity with &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 97&#8201;% selectivity. Both experimental and calculation results suggest that the functional group affects the electron&#8208;donating ability of the COFs, which successively impacts the charge transfer between COFs and Pd sites, giving rise to a modulated Pd electronic state and excellent catalytic performance.

         <title>Insertion of Chemical Handles into the Backbone of DNA during Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis by Oxidative Coupling of Amines to Phosphites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible and inexpensive method for linking chemical handles to the backbone of oligonucleotides during solid&#8208;phase synthesis was developed. Primary or secondary amines are linked to positions where a tert&#8208;butyl phosphoramidite is inserted by an oxidative coupling using iodine to obtain the desired phosphoramidate. With this method different functional groups such as azides, alkynes, amines were inserted as chemical handles.







Abstract
Conjugation of molecules or proteins to oligonucleotides can improve their functional and therapeutic capacity. However, such modifications are often limited to the 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; end of oligonucleotides. Herein, we report the development of an inexpensive and simple method that allows for the insertion of chemical handles into the backbone of oligonucleotides. This method is compatible with standardized automated solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis, and relies on formation of phosphoramidates. A unique phosphoramidite is incorporated into a growing oligonucleotide, and oxidized to the desired phosphoramidate using iodine and an amine of choice. Azides, alkynes, amines, and alkanes have been linked to oligonucleotides via internally positioned phosphoramidates with oxidative coupling yields above 80&#8201;%. We show the design of phosphoramidates from secondary amines that specifically hydrolyze to the phosphate only at decreased pH. Finally, we show the synthesis of an antibody&#8208;DNA conjugate, where the oligonucleotide can be selectively released in a pH&#8197;5.5 buffer.

         <title>Photodissociative Modules that Control Dual&#8208;Emission Properties in Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Organoborane Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual emissive triarylborane&#8208;based donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor fluorophores sensitive to environmental parameters, including temperature, solvent polarity, and viscosity of the medium, are reported by Shigehiro Yamaguchi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202303725). The intramolecularly coordinated B&#8211;X=P bond undergoes dissociation in the excited state, giving rise to bright emissions from the two different states. Precise tuning of the substituents led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.

         <title>Kinetic Control via Binding Sites within the Confined Space of Metal Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Frameworks for Enhanced Shape&#8208;Selectivity Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;selective catalysis is enabled by a steric, kinetic&#8208;control strategy based on the substrate being anchored on the internal wall of an adjustable pore space in porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs).







Abstract
One striking feature of enzyme is its controllable ability to trap substrates via synergistic or cooperative binding in the enzymatic pocket, which renders the shape&#8208;selectivity of product by the confined spatial environment. The success of shape&#8208;selective catalysis relies on the ability of enzyme to tune the thermodynamics and kinetics for chemical reactions. In emulation of enzyme's ability, we showcase herein a targeting strategy with the substrate being anchored on the internal pore wall of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), taking full advantage of the sterically kinetic control to achieve shape&#8208;selectivity for the reactions. For this purpose, a series of binding site&#8208;accessible metal metalloporphyrin&#8208;frameworks (MMPFs) have been investigated to shed light on the nature of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. They exhibit a different density of binding sites that are well arranged into the nanospace with corresponding distances of opposite binding sites. Such a structural specificity results in a facile switch in selectivity from an exclusive formation of the thermodynamically stable product to the kinetic product. Thus, the proposed targeting strategy, based on the combination of porous materials and binding events, paves a new way to develop highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for shifting selectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous yolk shells consisting of a plasmonic gold nanostar coated with a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) were prepared. This configuration shows improved colloidal stability, can sieve different molecules based on their size or charge, displays interesting synergy with gold for application in photocatalysis and presents a strong optical activity for use as SERS sensors.







Abstract
Hybrid composites between nanoparticles and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been described as optimal materials for a wide range of applications in optical sensing, drug delivery, pollutant removal or catalysis. These materials are usually core&#8208;shell single&#8208; or multi&#8208;nanoparticles, restricting the inorganic surface available for reaction. Here, we develop a method for the preparation of yolk&#8208;shells consisting in a plasmonic gold nanostar coated with MOF. This configuration shows more colloidal stability, can sieve different molecules based on their size or charge, seems to show some interesting synergy with gold for their application in photocatalysis and present strong optical activity to be used as SERS sensors.

         <title>A Universal Formation Mechanism of Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures Dominated by Concentration Waves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concentration wave dominated universal formation mechanism of hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS) is revealed by numerical simulation, as reported by Wei Ge, Dan Wang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202302621). The discovery of the physical essence behind the formation of HoMS not only flourishes the environment for HoMS synthesis, but also offers a predictive blueprint for creating dynamic HoMS by concentration waves, thereby establishing a valuable framework for future research in the realm of synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Benzothiazine 1&#8208;Imines via RuII/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Alkylation/Cyclization</title>

         <dc:description>Sulfondiimines are diaza&#8208;analogues of sulfones with a chiral sulfur center. Compared to sulfones and sulfoximines, their synthesis and transformations have so far been studied to a lesser extent. Here, we report the enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, i.e., cyclic sulfondiimine derivatives from sulfondiimines and sulfoxonium ylides via C&#8211;H alkylation/cyclization reactions. The combination of [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid is key to achieving high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Pro&#8208;nanomodulators for Deep&#8208;Tissue Sono&#8208;immunotherapy of Orthotopic Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunotherapy has provided a promising modality for cancer treatment, while it often has the issues of limited response rates and potential off&#8208;targeted side effects in clinical practices. We herein report the construction of semiconducting polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulators (SPpMs) with ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated activatable pharmacological actions for deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Such SPpMs consist of a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer backbone grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) chains linked with two immunomodulators (a programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 blocker and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase inhibitor) via a singlet oxygen (1O2) cleavable segment. In view of the excellent sonodynamic property of semiconducting polymer core, SPpMs enable effective generation of 1O2 under US treatment, even in a deep&#8208;tissue depth up to 12 cm. The generated 1O2 not only ablates tumors via sonodynamic effect and induces immunogenic cell death, but also destroys the 1O2 cleavable segments to allow in&#8208;situ release of immunomodulators in tumors. This synergetic action results in boosted antitumor immune response via reversing two tumor immunosuppressive pathways. As such, SPpMs can mediate deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy to complete eradicate orthotopic pancreatic cancer and effectively prevent tumor metastasis. Moreover, such a precision immune activation obviously reduces the possibility of immune&#8208;related adverse events.</dc:description>

         <title>Rashba Band Splitting and Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Induced by Halogen Bonds in Hybrid Layered Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an essential role in directing the self&#8208;assembly of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic crystals. In hybrid halide perovskites, hydrogen bonding has been the paramount non&#8208;covalent interaction. Here, we show another non&#8208;covalent interaction, namely, the halogen bond interaction, that directs a symmetry&#8208;breaking assembly in a new series of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites (ICH2CH2NH3)2(CH3NH3)n&#8208;1PbnI3n+1 (n is the layer thickness, n = 1&#8722;4). Structural analysis shows that the halogen bond strength varies with the layer thickness. For the odd number (n = 1, 3) layered perovskites, stronger halogen interaction leads to centrosymmetric structures, whereas for the n = 2 layered perovskites, weaker halogen bonds result in non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Transient reflection spectroscopy shows a suppressed radiative recombination rate (k2 ~ 0) and prolonged spin lifetime for n = 2 structure, suggesting an enhanced Rashba band splitting effect. The structural asymmetry is further confirmed with a reversible bulk photovoltaic effect. Our work provides a new design strategy to enable hybrid perovskites with emerging properties and functionalities associated with structural asymmetry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polyethyleneimines from the Manganese Catalyzed Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Ethylenediamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethyleneimines find many applications in products such as detergents, adhesives, cosmetics, and for processes such as tissue culture, gene therapy, and CO2 capture. The current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology for the production of the branched polyethyleneimines involves aziridine feedstock which is a highly toxic, volatile and mutagenic chemical and raises significant concern to human health and environment. We report here a novel method for the synthesis of branched polyethyleneimines from ethylene glycol and ethylenediamine feedstock which are much safer, environmentally benign, commercially available and potentially renewable feedstock. The polymerisation reaction is catalysed by a complex of an earth&#8208;abundant metal, manganese and liberates H2O as the only by&#8208;product. Our mechanistic studies using a combination of DFT computation and experiment suggest that the reaction proceeds by the formation and subsequent hydrogenation of imine intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanorings: Synthesis, Properties and Hierarchical Self&#8208;assembly of Chiral Ternary Complexes Featuring a Narcissistic Chiral Self&#8208;Recognition for Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported the synthesis and chiroptical properties of novel chiral carbon nanorings Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP containing a planar chiral [2.2]PCP unit, and demonstrated that Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP can not only host crown ether 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring complexes with a binding constant 3.35&#215;103 M&#8211;1, but also accommodate the complexes of 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and S/R&#8208;protonated amines to form homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; and heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208; ternary complexes, displaying significantly larger binding constants up to 3.31&#215;105 M&#8211;1 dependent on chiral guests. Importantly, homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes exhibit an enhanced CD signal, while heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208;ones remain a constant CD signal when compared with the chiral carbon nanorings, respectively, suggesting that homochiralS@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes display a highly narcissistic chiral self&#8208;recognition for S/R&#8208;protonated chiral amines, respectively. Finally, chiral ternary complexes can be further applied to determine the ee values of chiral guests. The findings highlight a new application of carbon nanorings in supramolecular sensors, beyond common recognition of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>A Thiazole&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework for Lithium&#8208;Sulphur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulphur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are a promising alternative power source, as they can provide a higher energy density than current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Porous materials are often used as cathode materials as they can act as a host for sulphur in such batteries. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have also been used, however they typically suffer from stability issues resulting in limited and thus insufficient durability under practical conditions and applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based dimethoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized COF (TTT&#8208;DMTD) incorporating a high density redox sites. The imine linkages were further post&#8208;synthetically transformed to yield a robust thiazole&#8208;linked COF (THZ&#8208;DMTD) by utilizing a sulphur&#8208;assisted chemical conversion method, while maintaining the crystallinity. As a synergistic effect of its high crystallinity, porosity and the presence of redox&#8208;active moieties, the thiazole&#8208;linked THZ&#8208;DMTD exhibited a high capacity and long&#8208;term stability (642 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1.0 C; 78.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles) when applied as a cathode material in a Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries are a promising alternative power source, as they can provide a higher energy density than current lithium-ion batteries. Porous materials are often used as cathode materials as they can act as a host for sulphur in such batteries. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have also been used, however they typically suffer from stability issues resulting in limited and thus insufficient durability under practical conditions and applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a crystalline and porous imine-linked triazine-based dimethoxybenzene-functionalized COF (TTT-DMTD) incorporating a high density redox sites. The imine linkages were further post-synthetically transformed to yield a robust thiazole-linked COF (THZ-DMTD) by utilizing a sulphur-assisted chemical conversion method, while maintaining the crystallinity. As a synergistic effect of its high crystallinity, porosity and the presence of redox-active moieties, the thiazole-linked THZ-DMTD exhibited a high capacity and long-term stability (642 mAh g-1 at 1.0 C; 78.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles) when applied as a cathode material in a Li-S battery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening Hydrophosphinylation of Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of methylene cyclopropanes allowed for the synthesis of a wide range of chiral allylic phosphine oxides via highly selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage (up to 96&#8201;% yield and up to 94&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations were performed to support the experimental results and to investigate the mechanism of the reaction.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs) has presented a considerable challenge due to the difficult manipulation of regioselectivity and complicated reaction patterns. Herein, we report a straightforward Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrophosphinylation reaction of MCPs via highly selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage. This method allows for rapid and efficient access to a wide range of chiral allylic phosphine oxides in good yields and high enantioselectivities. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Deoxidizing&#160;Electrolyte Additive Enables Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries, the Zn anode suffers from severe corrosion reactions and consequent dendrite growth troubles that cause fast performance decay. Herein, we uncover the corrosion mechanism and confirm that the dissolved oxygen (DO) other than the reputed proton is a principal origin of Zn corrosion and by&#8208;product precipitates, especially during the initial battery resting period.&#160;In a break from common physical deoxygenation methods, we propose a chemical self&#8208;deoxygenation strategy to tackle the DO&#8208;induced hazards. As a proof of concept, sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) is introduced to aqueous electrolytes as a self&#8208;deoxidizing additive. As a result, the Zn anode sustains a long&#8208;term cycling of 2500 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8210;2 and over 1100 h at 5 mA cm&#8210;2 together with a high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6%. The full cells also show a high capacity retention of 92% after 500 cycles. Our findings provide a renewed understanding of Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolytes and also a practical solution towards industrializing aqueous Zn batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic NO Oxidation with Simultaneous Nitrate Storage Using A Flow Photoanode Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective conversion of dilute NO pollutant into low&#8208;toxic product and simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants remains a great challenge from the perspective of waste management and sustainable chemistry. This study&#160;demonstrates that this bottleneck&#160;can be well tackled by refining the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#160;on Ni&#8208;modified NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (Zr) using nickel foam (Ni@NU/NF) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate through a flow photoanode reactor via the gas&#8208;phase photoelectrocatalysis. By rationally refining the ROS to &#8226;OH, Ni@NU/NF can rapidly eliminate 82% of NO without releasing remarkable NO2 under a low bias voltage (0.3 V) and visible light irradiation. The abundant mesoporous pores on Ni@NU/NF are conducive to the diffusion and storage of the formed nitrate, which enables the progressive conversion NO into nitrate with selectivity over 99% for long&#8208;term use. Through calculation, 90% of NO could be recovered as the nitrate species, indicating that this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy can capture, enrich and recycle the pollutant N source from the atmosphere. This study offers a new perspective of NO pollutant treatment and sustainable nitrogen exploitation, which may possess great potential to the development of highly efficient air purification systems for industrial and indoor NOx control.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Defective Copper Nanocluster Catalysts for Highly Selective C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of defective [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28) nanoclusters (NCs) on a gram scale has been developed. The surface vacancy on one of the vertices of Cu28 was systematically investigated at the atomic level and Cu28 can act as an effective and selective catalyst for Sonogashira C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions under visible&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
Point defects in nanoparticles have long been hypothesized to play an important role in governing the particle's electronic structure and physicochemical properties. However, single point defects in material systems usually exist with other heterogeneities, obscuring the chemical role of the effects. Herein, we report the synthesis of novel atomically precise, copper hydride nanoclusters (NCs), [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28; TPP: triphenylphosphine; C7H7S: o&#8208;thiocresol) with a defined defect in the gram scale via a one&#8208;pot reduction method. The Cu28 acts as a highly selective catalyst for C&#8722;C cross&#8208;couplings. The work highlights the potential of defective NCs as model systems for investigating individual defects, correlating defects with physiochemical properties, and rationally designing new nanoparticle catalysts.

         <title>Quadruple H&#8208;Bonding and Polyrotaxanes Dual Cross&#8208;linking Supramolecular Elastomer for High Toughness and Self&#8208;healing Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly tough and self&#8208;healable elastomer is prepared through a strategy by combining quadruple H&#8208;bonding and polyrotaxanes dual crosslinks. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulation and low&#8208;field solid state 1H&#8197;NMR confirmed the combined effect. Highly stretchable conductors based on the elastomers provide great potential for the high stretchable and tough electronic devices.







Abstract
Tough and self&#8208;healable substrates can enable stretchable electronics long service life. However, for substrates, it still remains a challenge to achieve both high toughness and autonomous self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Herein, a strategy by using the combined effects between quadruple H&#8208;bonding and slidable cross&#8208;links is proposed to solve the above issues in the elastomer. The elastomer exhibits high toughness (77.3&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), fracture energy (&#8776;127.2&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2), and good healing efficiency (91&#8201;%) at room temperature. The superior performance is ascribed to the inter and intra crosslinking structures of quadruple H&#8208;bonding and polyrotaxanes in the dual crosslinking system. Strain&#8208;induced crystallization of PEG in polyrotaxanes also contributes to the high fracture energy of the elastomers. Furthermore, based on the dual cross&#8208;linked supramolecular elastomer, a highly stretchable and self&#8208;healable electrode containing liquid metal is also fabricated, retaining resistance stability (0.16&#8211;0.26&#8197;&#937;) even at the strain of 1600&#8201;%.

The superior performance is ascribed to the inter and intra crosslinking structures of quadruple H-bonding and polyrotaxanes in the dual crosslinking system. Strain-induced crystallization of PEG in polyrotaxanes also contributes to the high fracture energy of the elastomers. Furthermore, based on the dual cross-linked supramolecular elastomer, a highly stretchable and self-healable electrode containing liquid metal is also fabricated, retaining resistance stability (0.16&#8211;0.26&#8197;&#937;) even at the strain of 1600&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Modified Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By accelerating the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs, enhancing the protonation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and promoting the O2 adsorption in a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; Yeager&#8208;type with enhanced adsorption energy, FS&#8208;COFs alter the photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process from two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; route to the one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; route, achieving efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a promising hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthetic strategy, especially the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) ORR route holds great potential in achieving highly efficient and selectivity. However, efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR is rarely harvested and the underlying mechanism for regulating the ORR pathways remains greatly obscure. Here, by loading sulfone units into covalent organic frameworks (FS&#8208;COFs), we present an efficient photocatalyst for H2O2 generation via one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR from pure water and air. Under visible light irradiation, FS&#8208;COFs exert a superb H2O2 yield of 3904.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, outperforming most reported metal&#8208;free catalysts under similar conditions. Experimental and theoretical investigation reveals that the sulfone units accelerate the separation of photoinduced electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8208;h+) pairs, enhance the protonation of COFs, and promote O2 adsorption in the Yeager&#8208;type, which jointly alters the reaction process from two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR to the one&#8208;step one, thereby achieving efficient H2O2 generation with high selectivity.

         <title>An Implantable Fiber Biosupercapacitor with High Power Density by Multi&#8208;Strand Twisting Functionalized Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biosupercapacitors (BSCs) that can harvest and store chemical energy show great promise for power delivery of biological applications. However, low power density still limits their applications, especially as miniaturized implants.&#160;Here, we report an implantable fiber BSC with maximal power density of 22.6 mW&#8231;cm&#8722;2, superior to the previous reports. The fiber BSC was fabricated by integrating anode and cathode fibers of biofuel cell with supercapacitor fibers through multi&#8208;strand twisting. This twisting structure endowed many channels inside and high electrochemical active area for efficient mass diffusion and charge transfer among different fibers, benefiting high power output. The obtained thin and flexible fiber BSC operated stably under deformations and performed high biocompatibility after implantation. Eventually, the fiber BSC was implanted subcutaneously in rats and successfully realized electrical stimulation of sciatic nerve, showing promise&#160;as a power source in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Photoreduction of Carborane Phosphonium Salts: Efficient Synthesis of Carborane&#8208;Oxindole&#8208;Pharmaceutical Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts, enabled by a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer complex, has been developed. This strategy allows access to various carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceuticals via carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals in the absence of a transition metal (TM) and photocatalyst (PC).







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreaction of carboranes is an effective approach to prepare carborane&#8208;containing compounds. While several methods involving boron&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals have been established, those for carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are underdeveloped, except for the UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photohomolysis. Herein, we describe a simple but effective approach to access carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals by photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts under blue light irradiation without using transition metals and photocatalysts. The utility of the method was demonstrated by successfully preparing a range of carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids by radical cascade reactions. Computational and experimental studies suggest that the carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are generated by single&#8208;electron transfer of the photoactive charge&#8208;transfer complexes between the salts and the additive potassium acetate.

         <title>Self&#8208;Polarization Triggered Multiple Polar Units Toward Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetrical refinement structure with self&#8208;polarizing unit possesses benchmark electrocatalytic activity towards CO2 to ethanol reductiopn on Cu2O@MOF/CF electrodes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8722;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of CH3CHO* for the generation of ethanol.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to highly valuable ethanol has been considered a intriguring strategy for carbon neutruality. However, the slow kinetics of coupling carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds, especially the low selectivity ethanol than ethylene in neutral conditions, is a significant challenge. Herein, the asymmetrical refinement structure with enhanced charge polarization is built in the vertically oriented bimetallic organic frameworks (NiCu&#8208;MOF) nanorod array with encapsulated Cu2O (Cu2O@MOF/CF), which can induce an intensive internal electric field to increase the C&#8722;C coupling for producing ethanol in neutral electrolyte. Particularly, when directly employed Cu2O@MOF/CF as the self&#8208;supporting electrode, the ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) could reach maximum 44.3&#8201;% with an energy efficiency of 27&#8201;% at a low working&#8208;potential of &#8722;0.615&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) using CO2&#8208;saturated 0.5&#8197;M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8722;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of H2CCHO*&#8208;to&#8208;*OCHCH3 for the generation of ethanol. Our research offers a reference for the design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to multicarbon chemicals.

         <title>Dual Recycling of Depolymerization Catalyst and Biodegradable Polyester that Markedly Outperforms Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual recycling of the potent depolymerization catalyst PMA and biodegradable polyester PVL that largely outperforms commodity polyolefins has been achieved. The chemical recycling of PVL in bulk phase is performed under mild temperature of only 100&#8201;&#176;C, recovering the pure monomer in quantitative yield for closed&#8208;loop recycling and the depolymerization catalyst that can be reused repeatedly without loss of activity and efficiency.







Abstract
Chemically recyclable, circular polymers continue to attract increasing attention, but rendering both catalysts for depolymerization and high&#8208;performance polymers recyclable is a more sustainable yet challenging goal. Here we introduce a dual catalyst/polymer recycling system in that recyclable inorganic phosphomolybdic acid catalyzes selective depolymerization of high&#8208;ceiling&#8208;temperature biodegradable poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone) in bulk phase, which, upon reaching suitable molecular weight, exhibits outstanding mechanical performance with a high tensile strength of &#8776;66.6&#8197;MPa, fracture strain of &#8776;904&#8201;%, and toughness of &#8776;308&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3, and thus markedly outperforms commodity polyolefins, recovering its monomer in pure state and quantitative yield at only 100&#8201;&#176;C. In sharp contrast, the uncatalyzed depolymerization not only requires a high temperature of &gt;310&#8201;&#176;C but is also low yielding and non&#8208;selective. Importantly, the recovered monomer can be repolymerized as is to reproduce the same polymer, thereby closing the circular loop, and the recycled catalyst can be reused repeatedly for depolymerization runs without loss of its catalytic activity and efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;Dual recycling of the potent depolymerization catalyst PMA and biodegradable polyester PVL that largely outperforms commodity polyolefins has been achieved. The chemical recycling of PVL in bulk phase is performed under mild temperature of only 100&#8201;&#176;C, recovering the pure monomer in quantitative yield for closed-loop recycling and the depolymerization catalyst that can be reused repeatedly without loss of activity and efficiency.

         <title>Fabrication of Photoprocessable Materials via Photopolymerization Using an Acid&#8208;Induced Photocleavable Platinum&#8208;Acetylide Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photopolymerization and photoprocessing are core technologies for the precise molding and tuning of polymer materials; however, they are incompatible with single materials because of their conflicting reactivity. Herein, the acid&#8208;induced photocleavage of a platinum&#8211;acetylide crosslinker allows the fabrication of materials via photopolymerization with 365&#8208;nm UV light as well as photoprocessing with 365&#8208;nm UV light under acidic conditions.







Abstract
Photopolymerization and photoprocessing are core technologies for molding and tuning polymer materials. However, they are incompatible with single materials owing to their contradictory photoreactivity. Herein, an acid&#8208;induced photocleavable crosslinker, a platinum&#8211;acetylide complex covered by permethylated cyclodextrins, enables the fabrication of photoprocessable materials via photopolymerization with N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)acrylamide. The polymer networks are molded by 365&#8197;nm irradiation as well as softened and degraded by a cooperative reaction with HCl as an acidic additive under 365&#8197;nm UV light, or 470&#8197;nm visible light in the presence of a photosensitizer. Moreover, the crosslinker is applied to a photoadhesive triggered by 365&#8197;nm irradiation. The adhesion is detachable on&#8208;demand through acid&#8208;induced photodegradation with the same wavelength and intensity of irradiation. Thus, acid&#8208;induced photocleavage allows the integration of light&#8208;induced molding and processing under various lights of various wavelengths, opening up new strategies for polymer technologies.

         <title>Pore Size Modulation in Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling High Performance Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;coordination directed structure swelling method was used to modulate the pore size of MIL&#8208;88B, which enables to reveal the pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent gas sensitivity and selectivity of MOF materials for the first time.







Abstract
Pore size plays a critical role in determining the performance of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in catalysis, sensing, and gas storage or separation. However, revealing the pore&#8208;size/property relationship remains extremely challenging because ideal structure models possessing different pore sizes but having the same components are lacking. In this work, a solvent&#8208;coordination directed structure swelling method was developed for modulating the ratio between the large and narrow pore phases of a flexible MOF, MIL&#8208;88B. Pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent gas sensitivity and selectivity were studied for the first time in the MIL&#8208;88B samples. The optimized MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;20&#8201;% sample showed one of the best sensing performances among all the reported MOF&#8208;based H2S&#8208;sensing materials. This work not only provides a method to synthesize ideal structure models for revealing the relationship between pore&#8208;size and properties, but also may inspire the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensing materials.

         <title>Rational Design of the &#946;&#8208;Bulge Gate in a Green Fluorescent Protein Accelerates the Kinetics of Sulfate Sensing
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The serendipitous discovery of an intrinsic fluorescent protein&#8208;based sensor for sulfate called SulfOFF&#8208;1 is reported. This function was unlocked by introducing mutations in a solvent&#8208;exposed region of the fluorescent protein mNeonGreen. An integrated approach encompassing in vitro spectroscopy and in silico modeling provides a comprehensive understanding of the sensor mechanism.







Abstract
Detection of anions in complex aqueous media is a fundamental challenge with practical utility that can be addressed by supramolecular chemistry. Biomolecular hosts such as proteins can be used and adapted as an alternative to synthetic hosts. Here, we report how the mutagenesis of the &#946;&#8208;bulge residues (D137 and W138) in mNeonGreen, a bright, monomeric fluorescent protein, unlocks and tunes the anion preference at physiological pH for sulfate, resulting in the turn&#8208;off sensor SulfOFF&#8208;1. This unprecedented sensing arises from an enhancement in the kinetics of binding, largely driven by position 138. In line with these data, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations capture how the coordinated entry and gating of sulfate into the &#946;&#8208;barrel is eliminated upon mutagenesis to facilitate binding and fluorescence quenching.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Applied Mass Spectrometry Team at the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS Mannheim) in Germany. They recently published an article together with Sirius Fine Chemicals SiChem GmbH and Bruker Daltonics. The work presents a novel concept for vacuum&#8208;stable&#8208;by&#8208;design MALDI matrices that enable long MALDI mass spectrometry measurements (e.g., for imaging) of at least 72&#8197;hours. Through the use of a photo&#8208;removable group, organic synthesis transformed the widely used, but unfortunately very volatile MALDI matrix 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyacetophenone (2,5&#8208;DHAP) into a vacuum&#8208;stable one. The protecting group can be uncaged by the MALDI laser in the ion source and then the matrix performs in the same way as the common matrix 2,5&#8208;DHAP. &#8220;A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging&#8221;, Q.

         <title>Electron Acceptor Molecule Doping Induced &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interaction to Promote Charge Transport Kinetics for Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene is utilized to trigger intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to facilitate carrier transportation. It effectively reduces defect density and optimizes energy level alignment. As a result, the 2D/3D perovskite solar cell achieves a champion PCE of up to 24.01&#8201;% coupled with greatly strengthened environmental stability.







Abstract
Although the incorporation of 2D perovskite into 3D perovskite can greatly enhance intrinsic stability, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2D/3D perovskite is still inferior to its 3D counterpart due to poor carrier transport kinetics resulted from the quantum and dielectric confinement of 2D component. To overcome this issue, the electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) was introduced to trigger intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction in 2D perovskite along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to improve charge transfer efficiency. By virtue of high electron affinity, TCNB can undergo electron transfer reaction and subsequently establish &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction with 1&#8208;naphthalenemethylammonium (NMA) cations, greatly strengthening lattice rigidity and reducing exciton binding energy. Transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate that 2D phases are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, reducing defect density and weakening nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, the p&#8208;type doping of perovskite by TCNB optimizes energy level alignment at perovskite/hole transport layer interface. Consequently, PCE of champion device is significantly boosted to 24.01&#8201;%. The unencapsulated device retains an initial efficiency close to 94&#8201;% after exposure to ambient environment for over 1000&#8197;h. This work paves a novel path for designing new mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells with high PCE and superior stability.

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Rechargeable Air Batteries Using Dihydroxybenzoquinone and Its Polymer as the Negative Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable air battery has been achieved using a redox&#8208;active organic molecule (dihydroxybenzoquinone, DHBQ) as the negative electrode active material and a proton exchange membrane as the electrolyte. The high redox activity of DHBQ with the polymer electrolyte made the concept of the device possible and furthermore, use of polymeric DHBQ improved significantly the discharge capacity with reasonable cyclability.







Abstract
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study was conducted on an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable air battery (SSAB) using redox&#8208;active 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DHBQ) and its polymer (PDBM) and a proton&#8208;conductive polymer (Nafion). DHBQ functioned well in the redox reaction with the solid Nafion ionomer at 0.47 and 0.57&#8197;V vs. RHE, similar to that in acid aqueous solution. The resulting air battery exhibited an open circuit voltage of 0.80&#8197;V and a discharge capacity of 29.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;gDHBQ&#8722;1 at a constant current density (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). With PDBM, the discharge capacity was much higher, 176.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;gPDBM&#8722;1, because of the improved utilization of the redox&#8208;active moieties. In the rate characteristics of the SSAB&#8208;PDBM, the coulombic efficiency was 84&#8201;% at 4&#8197;C, which decreased to 66&#8201;% at 101&#8197;C. In a charge/discharge cycle test, the capacity remaining after 30&#8197;cycles was 44&#8201;%, which was able to be significantly improved, to 78&#8201;%, by tuning the Nafion composition in the negative electrode.

         <title>A Concerted Enzymatic and Bioorthogonal Approach for Extracellular and Intracellular Activation of Environment&#8208;Sensitive Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Based Imaging Probes and Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, we report a novel targeting strategy involving the combination of an enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) moiety and a strained cycloalkyne to generate large accumulation of bioorthogonal sites in cancer cells. These bioorthogonal sites can serve as activation triggers in different regions for transition metal&#8208;based probes, which are new ruthenium(II) complexes carrying a tetrazine unit for controllable phosphorescence and singlet&#8208;oxygen generation. Importantly, the environment&#8208;sensitive emission of the complexes can be further enhanced in the hydrophobic regions offered by the large supramolecular assemblies, which is highly advantageous to biological imaging. Additionally, the (photo)cytotoxicity of the large supramolecular assemblies containing the complexes was investigated, and the results illustrate that cellular localization (extracellular and intracellular) imposes a profound impact on the efficiencies of photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Functionalized Terthiophene Redox Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main group systems capable of undergoing controlled redox events at extreme potentials are elusive yet highly desirable for a range of organic electronics applications including use as energy storage media. Herein we describe phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophenes that exhibit two reversible 1e&#8211; reduction at potentials below &#8211;2 V vs Fc/Fc+ (Fc = ferrocene) while retaining high degrees of stability. A phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophene radical anion was synthesized in which the redox&#8208;responsive nature of the platform was established using combined structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterization. Straightforward structural modification led to the identification of a derivative that exhibits exceptional stability during bulk 2e&#8211; galvanostatic charge&#8208;discharge cycling and enabled characterization of a 2e&#8211; redox series. A new multi&#8208;electron redox system class is hence disclosed that expands the electrochemical cell potential range achievable with main group electrolytes without compromising stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocurrent Generation and Polarity Switching in Electrochemical Cells through Light&#8208;induced Excited State Proton Transfer of Photoacids and Photobases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light is a common source of energy in sustainable technologies for photocurrent generation. To date, in such light&#8208;harvesting applications, the excited electrons generate the photocurrent. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for photocurrent generation that is based on excited state proton transfer (ESPT) of photoacids and photobases that can donate or accept a proton, respectively, but only after excitation. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can either serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes, or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer, both resulting in photocurrent generation. We further show that control of the current polarity is obtained by switching the irradiation between the photoacid and the photobase. Our study represents a new approach in photoelectrochemistry by introducing ESPT processes, which can be further utilized in light&#8208;responsive energy production or energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Charting the Chemical Reaction Space around a Multicomponent Combination: Controlled Access to a Diverse Set of Biologically Relevant Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charting the chemical reaction space around the combination of carbonyls, amines, and isocyanoacetates allows the description of new multicomponent processes leading to a variety of unsaturated imidazolone scaffolds. The resulting compounds display the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein and the core of the natural product coelenterazine. Despite the competitive nature of the pathways involved, general protocols provide selective access to the desired chemotypes. Moreover, we describe unprecedented reactivity at the C&#8208;2 position of the imidazolone core to directly afford C, S, and N&#8208;derivatives featuring natural products (e.g. leucettamines), potent kinase inhibitors, and fluorescent probes with suitable optical and biological profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Boron and Carbonyl based MR&#8208;TADF Emitter Designs to Achieve High Performance Deep Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds are attractive as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) as they simultaneously can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons to produce light and show very narrowband emission, which translates to excellent colour purity. Here, we report the first example of a MR&#8208;TADF emitter (DOBDiKTa) that fuses together fragments from the two major classes of MR&#8208;TADF compounds, those containing boron and those containing carbonyl groups as acceptor fragments in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon skeleton. Using this molecular design, this compound shows desirable narrowband deep blue emission and efficient TADF character. The OLED with DOBDiKTa as the emitter and mCP:PPT (1:1) as the co&#8208;host exhibits an EQEmax of 17.4%, an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 32% at 100 cd m&#8208;2, and CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.12). Compared to DOBNA and DiTKa, DOBDiKTa shows higher device efficiency with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off while maintaining a narrow pure blue electroluminescence, which demonstrates the promise of the proposed molecular design.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;silica Cu&#8208;CHA Zeolite Enriched with Al Pairs Transcribed from Silicoaluminophosphate Seed: Synthesis and Ammonia Selective Catalytic Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;exchanged low&#8208;silica CHA zeolites (Si/Al &#8804; 4) synthesized without organic templates are promising candidate catalysts for ammonia selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NH3&#8208;SCR), but their practical application is restricted due to the low hydrothermal stability. Here, inspired by the transcription from duplex DNA to RNA, we synthesized Al pairs enriched low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite (CHA&#8208;SPAEI, Si/Al = 3.7) by using silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) featured by strict alternation of &#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8211;P(Si)&#8211;O&#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8211; tetrahedra as seed. The proportion of Al pairs in CHA&#8208;SPAEI is 78%, which is much higher than that in the conventional low&#8208;silica CHA (CHA&#8208;LS, 52%). After hydrothermal ageing at 800 &#176;C for 6 h, Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;SPAEI shows NO conversion above 90% within 225&#8208;500 &#176;C under a gas hourly space velocity of 200,000 h&#8208;1, which is much better than that of Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;LS. The spatial close proximity of Al pairs in CHA&#8208;SPAEI is confirmed by the 27Al double&#8208;quantum single&#8208;quantum two&#8208;dimensional NMR analyses. The strict &#8208;P(Si)&#8208;O&#8208;Al&#8208;O&#8208;P(Si)&#8208;O&#8208; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promotes the Al pairs with the &#8208;Al&#8208;O&#8208;Si&#8208;O&#8208;Al&#8208;O&#8208; sequence via a transcription process. The utilization of aluminophosphate&#8208;based zeolites as seeds opens up a new avenue for the regulation of the Al distribution in zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic insight into anion&#8208;binding catalytic living cationic polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution reports in&#8208;depth mechanistic insight into anion&#8208;binding catalytic living cationic polymerization in which the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalyst and the roles of anion&#8208;binding interactions in the whole catalytic cycle are elucidated through a combination of theoretical DFT study and experimental study.







Abstract
Exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions to catalyze challenging ionic polymerizations is an ambitious goal but is in its infancy. We recently demonstrated non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding catalysis as an effective methodology to enable living cationic polymerization (LCP) of vinyl ethers in an environmentally benign manner. Here, we further elucidate the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalysts and the roles of anion&#8208;binding interactions by a combined theoretical DFT study and experimental study. The investigation suggests that the distinct cis&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azane framework combined with &#8220;selenium effect&#8221; and electron&#8208;withdrawing 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2&#8208;Phenyl substitution pattern in catalyst enables a critical contribution to accessing excellent stability, anion affinity and solubility under polymerization conditions. Thus, the catalyst could leverage anion&#8208;binding interactions to precisely control reversible and transient dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium, allowing it to dynamically bind, recognize and pre&#8208;organize propagating ionic species and monomer, thereby facilitating efficient chain propagation and minimizing irreversible chain transfer events under mild conditions. The more in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism for anion&#8208;binding catalytic LCP reported herein should help to guide future catalyst design and to extend this concept to broader polymerization systems where ionic species serve as crucial intermediates.

Abstract
Axially chiral compounds have been always considered a laboratory curiosity with rare prospects of being applied in asymmetric synthesis. Things have changed very quickly in the last twenty years when it was understood the important role and the enormous impact that these compounds have in medicinal, biological and material chemistry. The asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers became a rapidly expanding field and recent reports on the development of N&#8722;N atropisomers strongly prove how this research field is a hot topic open to new challenges and frontiers of asymmetric synthesis. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers highlighting the strategies and breakthroughs to obtain this novel and stimulating atropisomeric framework.

         <title>A Tandem&#8208;Locked Fluorescent NETosis Reporter for the Prognosis Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem&#8208;locked NETosis Reporter&#8197;1 (TNR1) is developed for sensitive and specific NETosis detection. TNR1 activates fluorescence signals only in the presence of both neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, which are neutrophil granular proteases involved in NETs formation. TNR1 represents the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing living mice.







Abstract
NETosis, the peculiar type of neutrophil death, plays important roles in pro&#8208;tumorigenic functions and inhibits cancer immunotherapy. Non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time imaging is thus imperative for prognosis of cancer immunotherapy yet remains challenging. Herein, we report a Tandem&#8208;locked NETosis Reporter&#8197;1 (TNR1) that activates fluorescence signals only in the presence of both neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CTSG) for the specific imaging of NETosis. In the aspect of molecular design, the sequence of biomarker&#8208;specific tandem peptide blocks can largely affect the detection specificity towards NETosis. In live cell imaging, the tandem&#8208;locked design allows TNR1 to differentiate NETosis from neutrophil activation, while single&#8208;locked reporters fail to do so. The near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 in tumor from living mice were consistent with the intratumoral NETosis levels from histological results. Moreover, the near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 negatively correlated with tumor inhibition effect after immunotherapy, thereby providing prognosis for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, our study not only demonstrates the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing living mice, but also proposes a generic approach for tandem&#8208;locked probe design.

         <title>Construction of Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers via Asymmetric Metal Carbene gem&#8208;Dialkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazines is reported, which leads to poly&#8208;functionalized chiral ketones with excellent enantioselectivity. This unprecedented metal carbene gem&#8208;dialkylation reaction features a cascade formal asymmetric allylation and aminomethylation process with concomitant construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters using readily available materials.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters has received tremendous interest over the past decades, and numerous efficient protocols have been disclosed based on the formation of one C&#8722;C bond between two assembling reactants. However, the use of asymmetric multi&#8208;component reactions that build two C&#8722;C bonds on the same carbonic center with concomitant assembly of quaternary stereocenters is rare and remains challenging. Herein, we disclose an enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazines under dirhodium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalysis, which leads to a practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of poly&#8208;functionalized chiral ketones that bear a &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter in generally good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In comparison to the previous method for the construction of tertiary and quaternary stereocenters via carbene gem&#8208;difunctionalization reactions, this reaction features an unprecedented gem&#8208;dialkylation process via sequential installation of two C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene center in one reaction, providing an essential complement to the asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters using common and readily available starting materials.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Energy Conversion in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents fundamental strategies to prepare photoactive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and composite materials for diverse applications in photocatalytic water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, and hydrogen peroxide evolution.







Abstract
Intensifying energy crises and severe environmental issues have led to the discovery of renewable energy sources, sustainable energy conversion, and storage technologies. Photocatalysis is a green technology that converts eco&#8208;friendly solar energy into high&#8208;energy chemicals. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous materials constructed by covalent bonds that show promising potential for converting solar energy into chemicals owing to their pre&#8208;designable structures, high crystallinity, and porosity. Herein, we highlight recent progress in the synthesis of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and their applications in water splitting, CO2 reduction, and H2O2 production. The challenges and future opportunities for the rational design of COFs for advanced photocatalysts are discussed. This Review is expected to promote further development of COFs toward photocatalysis.

         <title>When High&#8208;Temperature Cesium Chemistry Meets Self&#8208;Templating: Metal Acetates as Building Blocks of Unusual Highly Porous Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbon with a large specific surface area of the order of 3000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and pore volume approaching 2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 is obtained by highly facile and straightforward pyrolysis of cesium acetate. The unique role of CsAc is revealed as a precursor, catalyst, physical template, and activating agent during the whole process.







Abstract
Self&#8208;templating is a facile strategy for synthesizing porous carbons by direct pyrolysis of organic metal salts. However, the method typically suffers from low yields (&lt;4%) and limited specific surface areas (SSA&lt;2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) originating from low activity of metal cations (e.g., K+ or Na+) in promoting construction and activation of carbon frameworks. Here we use cesium acetate as the only precursor of oxo&#8208;carbons with large SSA of the order of 3000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, pore volume approaching 2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, tunable oxygen contents, and yields of up to 15&#8201;%. We unravel the role of Cs+ as an efficient promoter of framework formation, templating and etching agent, while acetates act as carbon/oxygen sources of carbonaceous frameworks. The oxo&#8208;carbons show record&#8208;high CO2 uptake of 8.71&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an ultimate specific capacitance of 313&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the supercapacitor. This study helps to understand and rationally tailor the materials design by a still rare organic solid&#8208;state chemistry.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Domain versus Single&#8208;Domain: A Magnetic Field is Not a Must for Promoting Spin&#8208;Polarized Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A ferromagnetic catalyst in single&#8208;domain exhibits similar water oxidation performance in the absence of an external magnetic field as does a multi&#8208;domain counterpart under magnetization. The findings tell that an external magnetic field is not the only way to take the benefits of spin&#8208;polarized water oxidation. Reducing the particle size into the single&#8208;domain region can also achieve the same.







Abstract
The reaction kinetics of spin&#8208;polarized oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be enhanced by ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts under an external magnetic field. However, applying a magnetic field necessitates additional energy consumption and creates design difficulties for OER. Herein, we demonstrate that a single&#8208;domain FM catalyst without external magnetic fields exhibits a similar OER increment to its magnetized multi&#8208;domain one. The evidence is given by comparing the pH&#8208;dependent increment of OER on multi&#8208; and single&#8208;domain FM catalysts with or without a magnetic field. The intrinsic activity of a single&#8208;domain catalyst is higher than that of a multi&#8208;domain counterpart. The latter can be promoted to approach the former by the magnetization effect. Reducing the FM catalyst size into the single&#8208;domain region, the spin&#8208;polarized OER performance can be achieved without a magnetic field, illustrating an external magnetic field is not a requirement to reap the benefits of magnetic catalysts.

         <title>A General Preparation of Solid Solution&#8208;Oxide Heterojunction Photocatalysts through Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Transformation Induced Pre&#8208;nucleation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we develop a generally applicable strategy to prepare the solid solution&#8208;oxide heterojunction through Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) transformation induced pre&#8208;nucleation. Our approach involved the transformation of MOFs possessing distinct topologies, leading to the pre&#8208;nucleation of the parent MOF in the form of an oxide within the pores of the daughter MOF. This transformative process was a pivotal step in synthesizing novel heterojunctions comprising solid solutions with significant variations of metal ions (Ce1&#8722;xTixO2) and rare earth oxide (CeO2).







Abstract
Solid solution&#8208;oxide heterostructures combine the advantages of solid solution and heterojunction materials to improve electronic structure and optical properties by metal doping, and enhance charge separation and transfer in semiconductor photocatalysts by creating a built&#8208;in electric field. Nevertheless, the effective design and synthesis of these materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we develop a generally applicable strategy that leverages the transformable properties of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to prepare solid solution&#8208;oxide heterojunctions with controllable structural and chemical compositions. The process consists of three main steps. First, MOFs with different topological structures and metal centers are transformed, accompanied by pre&#8208;nucleation of a metal oxide. Second, solid solution is prepared through calcination of the transformed MOFs. Finally, a heterojunction is formed by combining solid solution with another metal oxide group through endogenous overflow. DFT calculations and study on carrier dynamics show that the structure of the material effectively prevents electrons from returning to the bulk phase, exhibiting superior photocatalytic reduction performance of CO2. This study is expected to promote the controllable synthesis and research of MOF&#8208;derived heterojunctions.

         <title>Quantitative Point of Care Tests for Timely Diagnosis of Early&#8208;Onset Preeclampsia with High Sensitivity and Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preeclampsia is a cardiovascular complication that can occur during the second half of pregnancy. Here, we developed a point&#8208;of&#8208;care test incorporating upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based lateral flow strips conjugated to novel vascular biomarkers including FKBPL and CD44 proteins, for timely and reliable diagnosis of preeclampsia during pregnancy that can improve the odds of preventing major maternal complications and possibly death.







Abstract
Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous and multiorgan cardiovascular disorder of pregnancy. Here, we report the development of a novel strip&#8208;based lateral flow assay (LFA) using lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies targeting two different biomarkers for detection of preeclampsia. We first measured circulating plasma FKBPL and CD44 protein concentrations from individuals with early&#8208;onset preeclampsia (EOPE), using ELISA. We confirmed that the CD44/FKBPL ratio is reduced in EOPE with a good diagnostic potential. Using our rapid LFA prototypes, we achieved an improved lower limit of detection: 10&#8197;pg&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for FKBPL and 15&#8197;pg&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for CD44, which is more than one order lower than the standard ELISA method. Using clinical samples, a cut&#8208;off value of 1.24 for CD44/FKBPL ratio provided positive predictive value of 100&#8201;% and the negative predictive value of 91&#8201;%. Our LFA shows promise as a rapid and highly sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care test for preeclampsia.

         <title>DNA Nanotechnology for Investigating Mechanical Signaling in the Immune System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we summarized the recent development of DNA nanotechnology for investigating mechanical forces in the immune system. We discussed the force sensing mechanisms of different DNA structures (DNA hairpin and DNA duplex), followed by a survey of DNA tension sensors and gates used to detect the immunoreceptor forces and manipulate mechanical signaling, respectively.







Abstract
Immune recognition occurs at specialized cell&#8208;cell junctions when immune cells and target cells physically touch. In this junction, groups of receptor&#8208;ligand complexes assemble and experience molecular forces that are ultimately generated by the cellular cytoskeleton. These forces are in the range of piconewton (pN) but play crucial roles in immune cell activation and subsequent effector responses. In this minireview, we will review the development of DNA based molecular tension sensors and their applications in mapping and quantifying mechanical forces experienced by immunoreceptors including T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR), Lymphocyte function&#8208;associated antigen (LFA&#8208;1), and the B&#8208;cell receptor (BCR) among others. In addition, we will highlight the use of DNA as a mechanical gate to manipulate mechanotransduction and decipher how mechanical forces regulate antigen discrimination and receptor signaling.

         <title>The Chemistry of the Cyaphide Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
128&#8197;years after the erroneously assumed synthesis of sodium cyaphide, Na(CP), and 51&#8197;years after the definitive proof of the existence of HCP, the chemistry of the cyaphide anion has finally gained momentum. This review summarizes the chemistry of the cyaphide anion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;, from its beginnings to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art.







Abstract
We review the known chemistry of the cyaphide ion, (C&#8801;P)&#8722;. This remarkable diatomic anion has been the subject of study since the late nineteenth century, however its isolation and characterization eluded chemists for almost a hundred years. In this mini&#8208;review, we explore the pioneering synthetic experiments that first allowed for its isolation, as well as more recent developments demonstrating that cyaphide transfer is viable in well&#8208;established salt&#8208;metathesis protocols. The physical properties of the cyaphide ion are also explored in depth, allowing us to compare and contrast the chemistry of this ion with that of its lighter congener cyanide (an archetypal strong field ligand and important organic functional group). Recent studies show that the cyaphide ion has the potential to be used as a versatile chemical regent for the synthesis of novel molecules and materials, hinting at many interesting future avenues of investigation.

The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote&#8208;difunctionalization of nonactivated alkenes for double meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H/C&#8208;6(sp3)&#8722;H transformations was achieved by metalla&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and &#963;&#8208;activation, featuring excellent site&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity, along with ample scope.







Abstract
Twofold distal C&#8722;H functionalization was accomplished by difunctionalization of nonactivated alkenes to provide rapid access to multifunctionalized molecules. The multicomponent ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote 1,n&#8208;difunctionalization (n=6,7) of nonactivated alkenes with fluoroalkyl halides and heteroarenes in a modular manner is reported. The meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H/C&#8208;6(sp3)&#8722;H distal functionalization featured mild conditions, unique selectivity, and broad substrate scope with a domino process for twofold remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of the sequential formation of three different carbon&#8208;centered radicals. A plausible mechanism was proposed based on detailed experimental and computational studies.

         <title>Mixed Conductive, Injectable, and Fluorescent Supramolecular Eutectogel Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first example of mixed ionic/electronic conductive eutectogel composites formed from low molecular weight gelators (LMWG) combined with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): chondroitin sulfate (ChS) and glycine/choline chloride (Gly/ChCl) deep eutectic solvent (DES). Eutectogels exhibit fluorescence, high combined conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and biocompatible properties to be used as injectable materials for bioimaging.







Abstract
Eutectogels are an emerging family of soft ionic materials alternative to ionic liquid gels and organogels, offering fresh perspectives for designing functional dynamic platforms in water&#8208;free environments. Herein, the first example of mixed ionic and electronic conducting supramolecular eutectogel composites is reported. A fluorescent glutamic acid&#8208;derived low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) was found to self&#8208;assemble into nanofibrillar networks in deep eutectic solvents (DES)/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): chondroitin sulfate dispersions. These dynamic materials displayed excellent injectability and self&#8208;healing properties, high ionic conductivity (up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), good biocompatibility, and fluorescence imaging ability. This set of features turns the mixed conducting supramolecular eutectogels into promising adaptive materials for bioimaging and electrostimulation applications.

         <title>Sodium Carbazolide and Derivatives as Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium carbazolide tetrahydrofuran derivatives, a new type of metalorganic&#8208;based materials intended for hydrogen storage, are fabricated and exhibit fast ionic conductivity as high as 1.20&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 1.95&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, with excellent interfacial stability against Na electrodes. A &#8220;neutral ligand&#8208;assisted&#8221; cation migration mechanism is proposed, providing a new strategy for design of superionic conductor.







Abstract
Replacing widely used organic liquid electrolytes with solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) could effectively solve the safety issues in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Efforts on seeking novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes have been continued for decades. However, issues about SSEs still exist, such as low ionic conductivity at ambient temperature, difficulty in manufacturing, low electrochemical stability, poor compatibility with electrodes, etc. Here, sodium carbazolide (Na&#8208;CZ) and its THF&#8208;coordinated derivatives are rationally fabricated as Na+ conductors, and two of their crystal structures are successfully solved. Among these materials, THF&#8208;coordinated complexes exhibit fast Na+ conductivities, i.e., 1.20&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 1.95&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C for Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;1THF and Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;2THF, respectively, which are among the top Na+ conductors under the same condition. Furthermore, stable Na plating/stripping is observed even over 400&#8197;h cycling, showing outstanding interfacial stability and compatibility against Na electrode. More advantages such as ease of synthesis, low&#8208;cost, and cold pressing for molding can be obtained. In situ NMR results revealed that the evaporation of THF may play an essential role in the Na+ migration, where the movement of THF creates defects/vacancies and facilitates the migration of Na+.

         <title>An Integrated Dual&#8208;Functional Nanotool Capable of Studying Single&#8208;Cell Epigenetics and Programmable Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;cell epigenetics is envisioned to decipher manifold epigenetic phenomena and to contribute to our accurate knowledge about basic epigenetic mechanisms. Engineered nanopipette technology has gained momentum in single&#8208;cell study, whereas solutions to epigenetic study remain unachieved. This study addresses the challenge by exploring N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;bearing deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) confined within nanopipette for profiling representative m6A modifying enzyme of fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). Electroosmotic intracellular extraction of FTO could remove the m6A and cause DNAzyme cleavage, leading to the altered ionic current signal. Because the cleavage can release a DNA sequence, we simultaneously program it as an antisense strand against FTO&#8208;mRNA, intracellular injection of which has been shown to induce early stage apoptosis. This nanotool thus features the dual functions of studying single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving White&#8208;Light Emission Using Organic Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission can be realized by purely organic phosphorescent emitters using either single&#8208;component or host&#8208;guest systems by mixing two fundamental colors (blue and yellow) or three primary colors (blue, green and red). Here we describe current strategies for achieving white phosphorescence at room&#8208;temperature using organic emitters.







Abstract
Artificial lighting currently consumes approximately one&#8208;fifth of global electricity production. Organic emitters with white persistent RTP have potential for applications in energy&#8208;efficient lighting technologies, due to their ability to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons. Compared to heavy metal phosphorescent materials, they have significant advantages in cost, processability, and reduced toxicity. Phosphorescence efficiency can be improved by introducing heteroatoms, heavy atoms, or by incorporating luminophores within a rigid matrix. White&#8208;light emission can be achieved by tuning the ratio of fluorescence to phosphorescence intensity or by pure phosphorescence with a broad emission spectrum. This review summarizes recent advances in the design of purely organic RTP materials with white&#8208;light emission, describing single&#8208;component and host&#8208;guest systems. White phosphorescent carbon dots and representative applications of white&#8208;light RTP materials are also introduced.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne Hydrocyanation toward Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereodivergent Synthesis of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;Trisubstituted Acrylonitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various trisubstituted E&#8208; and Z&#8208;acrylonitriles have been successfully synthesized from the same starting material via a ligand&#8208;controlled palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent hydrocyanation reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that Z&#8208;acrylonitriles were obtained by a sequential hydrocyanation/geometric isomerization (E to Z) pathway.







Abstract
We herein describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of propiolamides for the stereodivergent synthesis of trisubstituted acrylonitriles. This synthetic method tolerated various primary, secondary and tertiary propiolamides. The cautious selection of a suitable ligand is essential to the success of this stereodivergent process. Control experiments indicate the intermediacy of E&#8208;acrylonitriles, which lead to Z&#8208;acrylonitriles via isomerization. The density functional theory calculations suggests that the bidentate ligand L2 enables a feasible cyclometallation/isomerization pathway for the E to Z isomerization, while the monodentate ligand L1 inhibits the isomerization, leading to divergent stereoselectivity. The usefulness of this method can be demonstrated by the readily derivatization of products to give various E&#8208; and Z&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. In addition, the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;acrylonitrile products have also been successfully employed in cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Enhancing Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia over Cu Nanosheets via Facet Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance Cu nanosheet catalyst was developed for electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction. Benefiting from the tandem catalysis of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets, a NH3 partial current density of 665&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with NH3 yield rate of 1.41&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.59&#8197;V vs. RHE as well as high stability of 700&#8197;h in a flow cell were achieved.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into ammonia (NH3) represents a potential way for achieving carbon&#8208;free NH3 production while balancing the nitrogen cycle. Herein we report a high&#8208;performance Cu nanosheets catalyst which delivers a NH3 partial current density of 665&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and NH3 yield rate of 1.41&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell at &#8722;0.59&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The catalyst showed a high stability for 700&#8197;h with NH3 Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;88&#8201;% at 365&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy results verify that Cu nanosheets are in situ derived from the as&#8208;prepared CuO nanosheets under electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction conditions. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations indicate that the high performance is attributed to the tandem interaction of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets. The NO2&#8722; generated on the Cu(100) facets is subsequently hydrogenated on the Cu(111) facets, thus the tandem catalysis promotes the crucial hydrogenation of *NO to *NOH for NH3 production.

         <title>Construction of Thioamide Peptides from Chiral Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward linking of natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane was established to construct various thioamide&#8208;containing peptides. The carbonyl group is replaced with a thiono group by sequential activation, and the chirality of the amino acid component is maintained in the products.







Abstract
Thioamide peptides were synthesized in a straightforward one&#8208;pot process via the linkage of diverse natural amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane, wherein carbonyl groups were replaced with thiono compounds with minimal racemization. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies demonstrated that the trichlorosilane enables the activation of carboxylic acids via intense interactions with the Si&#8722;O bond, followed by coupling of the carboxylic acids with thiolphosphonate to obtain the key intermediate S&#8208;acyl dithiophosphate. Silyl&#8208;activated quadrangular metathesis transition states afforded the thioamide peptides. The potential applications of these thioamide peptides were further highlighted via late&#8208;stage linkages of diverse natural products and pharmaceutical drugs and the thioamide moiety.

         <title>Ultrathin Niobium Carbide MXenzyme for Remedying Hypertension by Antioxidative and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXenzyme shows benign biocompatibility and multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, combatting neurogenic hypertension by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibiting inflammatory response.







Abstract
Hypertension, as a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, is associated with oxidative stress and impairment of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, but there is still a tremendous knowledge gap between hypertension treatment and nanomedicines. Herein, we report a specific nanozyme based on ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXene, termed Nb2C MXenzyme, to fight against hypertension by achieving highly efficient reactive oxygen species elimination and inflammatory factors inhibition. The biocompatible Nb2C MXenzyme displays multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, involving superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, inducing cytoprotective effects by resisting oxidative stress, thereby alleviating inflammatory response and reducing blood pressure, which is systematically demonstrated in a stress&#8208;induced hypertension rat model. This strategy not only opens new opportunities for nanozymes to treat hypertension but also expands the potential biomedical applications of 2D MXene nanosystems.

         <title>Molten Salts&#8208;Driven Discovery of a Polar Mixed&#8208;Anion 3D framework at the nanoscale: Zn4Si2O7Cl2, Charge Transport and Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanowires of the new oxychloride Zn4Si2O7Cl2 crystallize from molten salts as a polar three&#8208;dimensional tetrahedral framework. They exhibit strongly anisotropic charge carrier mobility, adjustable electrical properties, and photoelectrochemical properties for H2 production from water.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;anion compounds widen the chemical space of attainable materials compared to single anionic compounds, but the exploration of their structural diversity is limited by common synthetic paths. Especially, oxychlorides rely mainly on layered structures, which suffer from low stability during photo(electro)catalytic processes. Herein we report a strategy to design a new polar 3D tetrahedral framework with composition Zn4Si2O7Cl2. We use a molten salt medium to enable low temperature crystallization of nanowires of this new compound, by relying on tetrahedral building units present in the melt to build the connectivity of the oxychloride. These units are combined with silicon&#8208;based connectors from a non&#8208;oxidic Zintl phase to enable precise tuning of the oxygen content. This structure brings high chemical and thermal stability, as well as strongly anisotropic hole mobility along the polar axis. These features, associated with the ability to adjust the transport properties by doping, enable to tune water splitting properties for photoelectrocatalytic H2 evolution and water oxidation. This work then paves the way to a new family of mixed&#8208;anion solids

         <title>Direct Arylation of Silicon Nanocrystals with Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Derived Benzynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;free arylation reagents are reported for the functionalization of silicon nanocrystals. Benzyne derivatives formed via a hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction effectively cleave Si&#8722;H bonds and yield benzenoid&#8208;passivated silicon surfaces under mild conditions.







Abstract
Colloidal silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) have garnered significant interest in optoelectronics and biomedical applications. Direct arylation provides pathways to enhance the solution processability of particles and manipulate the photophysical and electronic properties of SiNCs. Unfortunately, existing methods employed to prepare aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs are based on organometallic coupling or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed strategies, which require metal&#8208;based reagents for preactivation or the precursors and complicated post&#8208;treatment processes for product purification. Herein, we demonstrate a metal&#8208;free method that directly functionalizes SiNCs with aryl&#8208;based ligands. We design a series of benzyne derivatives formed from the thermal cyclization of predesigned alkynes, allowing efficient arylation on hydride&#8208;terminated silicon surfaces under mild conditions. These aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs exhibit strong blue emissions with nanosecond&#8208;scaled decay, suggesting the formation of a new radiative recombination channel on SiNC surfaces.

         <title>An Electrochemical Strategy to Synthesize Disilanes and Oligosilanes from Chlorosilanes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Si&#8722;Si bonds is an important transformation in organic synthesis. Herein, we present a unified electrochemical strategy for the efficient and selective synthesis of disilanes, oligosilanes, and cyclosilanes&#8212;which are important precursors for the synthesis of functional organic and polymeric compounds&#8212;from readily available chlorosilanes.







Abstract
Silanes are important compounds in industrial and synthetic chemistry. Here, we develop a general approach for the synthesis of disilanes as well as linear and cyclic oligosilanes via the reductive activation of readily available chlorosilanes. The efficient and selective generation of silyl anion intermediates, which are arduous to achieve by other means, allows for the synthesis of various novel oligosilanes by heterocoupling. In particular, this work presents a modular synthesis for a variety of functionalized cyclosilanes, which may give rise to materials with distinct properties from linear silanes but remain challenging synthetic targets. In comparison to the traditional Wurtz coupling, our method features milder conditions and improved chemoselectivity, broadening the functional groups that are compatible in oligosilane preparation. Computational studies support a mechanism whereby differential activation of sterically and electronically distinct chlorosilanes are achieved in an electrochemically driven radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism.

         <title>Exploiting Interactions between Polyoxometalates and Proteins for Applications in (Bio)chemistry and Medicine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review aims to provide molecular&#8208;level insight into the interactions between polyoxometalates and proteins that make this vast family of anionic nanoclusters interesting potential inorganic drugs, effective catalysts for selective protein modification, multifunctional crystallizing agents, and versatile protein separation materials.







Abstract
The specific interactions of anionic metal&#8208;oxo clusters, known as polyoxometalates (POMs), with proteins can be leveraged for a wide range of analytical and biomedical applications. For example, POMs have been developed as selective catalysts that can induce protein modifications and have also been shown to facilitate protein crystallization, both of which are instrumental in the structural characterization of proteins. POMs can also be used for selective protein separation and enzyme inhibition, which makes them promising therapeutic agents. Hence, understanding POM&#8208;protein interactions is essential for the development of POM&#8208;based materials and their implementation in several fields. In this Review we summarize in detail the key insights that have been gained so far on POM&#8208;protein interactions. Emphasis is also given to hybrid POMs functionalized with organic ligands to prompt further research in this direction owing to the promising recent results on tuning POM&#8208;protein interactions through POM functionalization.

         <title>Cyanine Polymersomes Inbreathe Gas Signaling Molecule: SO2&#8208;Driven Bilayer Tubular Deformation for Transmembrane Traffic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating nanoscale assemblies that can respond to gas signaling molecules has emerged as a field of growing interest owing to their unique biomedical applications in gas&#8208;guided delivery and gas therapeutics. Yet, among a variety of endogenous gaseous biosignals, exploiting sulfur dioxide (SO2) as a cue for controllable self&#8208;assembly remains elusive, despite its crucial two&#8208;sided roles both in physiology and pathology. Here we show a SO2&#8208;responsive polymersome system assembled from a novel class of cyanine&#8208;containing block copolymers. By intake of SO2 gas, the tautomerism of cyanine drives such vesicles to continuously deform, and change into long nanotubes through axial stretching and anisotropic extrusion of the membranes. Unexpectedly, during this order&#8208;to&#8208;order phase transition, their membranes manifest well SO2&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent permselectivity, which allows the cargos of different sizes loaded therein to be selectively transferred across the bilayers. This study would inspire us to better understand and mimic the function of gas signaling molecules in shifting biomembrane shape and managing transmembrane traffic.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Indirect Evolution of Photoluminescent Semiconductor&#160;CdS Magic&#8208;Size Clusters through Their Precursor Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal semiconductor II&#8722;VI metal chalcogenide (ME) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) exhibit either an optical absorption singlet or doublet. In the latter case, a sharp photoluminescence (PL) signal is observed. Whether the PL&#8208;inactive MSCs transform to the PL&#8208;active ones is unknown. We show that PL&#8208;inactive CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL&#8208;active CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). MSC&#8208;322 displays a sharp absorption at ~322 nm, whereas MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 both have broad absorptions respectively around 328 and 373 nm. In a reaction of cadmium myristate and S powder in 1&#8208;octadecene, MSC&#8208;322 develops; with HOAc, MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 are present. We propose that the MSCs evolve from their relatively transparent precursor compounds (PCs). The PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization involves monomer substitution, while monomer addition occurs for the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation. Our findings suggest that S dominates the precursor self&#8208;assembly quantitatively, and ligand&#8208;bonded Cd mainly controls MSC optical properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of elementary reactions in organometallic catalysis is an important method with which to discover new reactions. In this article, we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in gold catalytic cycle. A wide range of structurally diverse alkynyl iodides are good coupling partners in this iodo&#8208;alkynylation transformation. Both aliphatic and aromatic alkynyl iodides can react with benzynes smoothly to afford highly functionalized 1,2&#8208;disubstituted aromatics in moderate to good yields. Its good functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage application of complex molecules demonstrate its synthetic robustness. Studies of the mechanism reveals the feasibility of oxidative addition and the DFT calculations demonstrate the possible migratory insertion of benzyne into Au(III)&#8208;carbon bonds in the Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalytic cycle, representing an important step towards an elementary reaction in gold chemistry research.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical coupling initiated by organophosphine addition to ynoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual nucleophilic phosphine photoredox catalysis is yet to be developed due to facile oxidation of the phosphine organocatalyst to the phosphoranyl radical cation. Herein, we report a reaction design that avoids this event and exploits traditional nucleophilic phosphine organocatalysis with photoredox catalysis to allow the Giese coupling with ynoates. The approach has good generality, while its mechanism is supported by cyclic voltametric, Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching, and interception studies.</dc:description>

         <title>40 Years of Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium batteries are one of the most appropriate energy storage systems in our electrified society, as virtually all portable electronic devices and electric vehicles today rely on the chemical energy stored in them. However, sub&#8208;zero Celsius operation, especially below &#8722;20&#176;C, remains a huge challenge for lithium batteries and greatly limits their application in extreme environments. Slow Li+ diffusion and charge transfer kinetics have been identified as two main origins of the poor performance of RLBs under low&#8208;temperature conditions, both strongly associated with the liquid electrolyte that governs bulk and interfacial ion transport. In this review, we first analyze the low&#8208;temperature kinetic behavior and failure mechanism of lithium batteries from an electrolyte standpoint. We next trace the history of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes in the past 40 years (1983&#8211;2022), followed by a comprehensive summary of the research progress as well as introducing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization and computational methods for revealing their underlying mechanisms. Finally, we provide some perspectives on future research of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes with particular emphasis on mechanism analysis and practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Transition&#8208;Promoted Rapid Photomechanical Motions of Single Crystals of a Triene Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular crystals with the ability to transform light energy into macroscopic mechanical motions are a promising class of materials with potential applications in actuating and photonic devices. In regard to such materials, coordination polymers that exhibit dynamic photomechanical motion, associated with a phase transition, are unknown. Herein, we report an intriguing photoactive, one&#8208;dimensional Zn(II) coordination polymer, 1, derived from 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethenylbenzene and 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzoate. Single crystals of 1 under UV light irradiation exhibit rapid shrinking and bending, violent bursting&#8208;jumping, splitting and cracking behavior. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and 1H NMR spectroscopy reveal an unusual photoinduced phase transition involving a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction resulting in photomechanical responses. Interestingly, crystals of 1, which are triclinic with space group P&#160;1, are transformed into a higher symmetry, monoclinic cell with space group C2/c. This process represents a rare example of symmetry enhancement upon photoirradiation. The photomechanical activity is likely due to the sudden release of stress associated with strained molecular geometries and significant solid&#8208;state molecular movement arising from cleavage and formation of chemical bonds. A composite membrane fabricated from 1 and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) also displays interesting photomechanical behavior under UV light illumination, indicating the material's potential as a photoactuator.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Cobalt Catalysed Hydrogen Atom Transfer for the Hydrofunctionalisation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogen atom transfer from metal&#8208;hydrides to alkenes allows feedstock olefins to be used as alkyl radical precursors. The chemoselectivity of this process makes it an attractive synthetic tool and as such it has been regularly used in synthesis of complex molecules. However, onwards reactivity is limited by compatibility with the conditions which form the key metal&#8208;hydride species. Now, through the merger with photocatalysis or electrochemistry, milder methods are emerging which can unlock entirely new reactivity and offer perspectives on expanding these methods in unprecedented directions. This review outlines the most recent developments in electro&#8208; and photochemical cobalt catalysed methods and offers suggestions on the future outlook.</dc:description>

         <title>Extending the &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System in Spiro&#8208;Type Hole Transport Material Enhances the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole transport materials (HTMs) are a key component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The small molecular 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;amine&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, termed &#8220;Spiro&#8221;) is the most successful HTM used in PSCs, but its versatility is imperfect. To improve its performance, we developed a novel spiro&#8208;type HTM (termed &#8220;DP&#8221;) by substituting four anisole units on Spiro with 4&#8208;methoxybiphenyl moieties. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of Spiro in this way, the HOMO level of the HTM matches well with the perovskite valence band, enhancing hole mobility and increasing the glass transition temperature. DP&#8208;based PSC achieves high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.24% for small&#8208;area (0.06 cm2) devices and 21.86% for modules (designated area of 27.56 cm2), along with the certified efficiency of 21.78% on a designated area of 27.86 cm2. The encapsulated DP&#8208;based devices maintain 95.1% of the initial performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions after 2,560 hours and 87% at the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions over 600 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Multistep Excited&#8208;State Structural Transformations in N,N&#8242;&#8208;Diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that a single polycyclic &#960;&#8208;scaffold can undergo sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolution along the bent, planar, and twisted conformers, which coexist to produce intrinsic multiple fluorescence emissions in room&#8208;temperature solution. By installing a methyl or trifluoromethyl group on the ortho&#8208;site of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC), the enhanced steric effects change the fluorescence emission of DPAC from a dominant red band to well&#8208;resolved triple bands. The ultra&#8208;broadband triple emissions of ortho&#8208;substituted DPACs range from ~350 to ~850 nm, which is unprecedented for small fluorophores with molecular weight of &lt; 500. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the above dramatic changes originate from the influence of steric hindrance on the shape of excited state potential energy surface (S1 PES). Compared to the steep S1 PES of parental DPAC, introduction of ortho&#8208;substituent is shown to make the path of structural evolution in S1 wider and flatter, so the ortho&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit slower structural transformations from bent to planar and then to twisted forms, yielding intrinsic triple emission. The results provide the proof of concept that the bent, planar, and twisted emissive states can coexist in the same S1 PES, which greatly expand the fundamental understanding of the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Diarylmethylamines by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8208;H Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMA) are important structural motifs widely present in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and chiral ligands. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral DAMAs via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8208;H alkoxylation strategy. The reaction features easy operation, the use of earth&#8208;abundant and cost&#8208;efficient cobalt(II) catalyst, and readily available ligand. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90% yield and up to 99% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.</dc:description>

The reaction features easy operation, the use of earth-abundant and cost-efficient cobalt(II) catalyst, and readily available ligand. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90% yield and up to 99% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Connecting Ruthenium Photocatalysis to 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane&#8208;Mediated Chemiluminescence: a Versatile Combination for Optical Detection and Read&#8208;Out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical storage and photon quantification systems based on sensitive photoreactions have numerous applications. Herein, we report a highly efficient photocatalytic reaction, in which ruthenium photoredox catalysis is combined with a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane, from which chemiluminescence can be triggered. In this system, blue light irradiation as optical input enables a defined inverse correlation with base&#8208;triggered, blue light emission as optical output. Comparison of readout by 1H NMR and chemiluminescence, relative to previous optical input, underlines the reliability and usefulness of the ruthenium&#8208;dioxetane system for optical storage, sensing and ruthenium detection.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aqueous Electrolyte Gated Artificial Synapse with Synaptic Plasticity Selectively Mediated by Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emulation of functions and behaviors of biological synapses using electronic devices has inspired the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in biomedical interfaces. Despite the achievements, artificial synapses that can be selectively responsive to non&#8208;electroactive biomolecules and directly operate in biological environments are still lacking. Herein, we report an artificial synapse based on organic electrochemical transistors and investigate the selective modulation of its synaptic plasticity by glucose. The enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase results in long&#8208;term modulation of the channel conductance, mimicking selective binding of biomolecules to their receptors and consequent long&#8208;term modulation of the synaptic weight. Moreover, the device shows enhanced synaptic behaviors in the blood serum at a higher glucose concentration, which suggests its potential application in vivo as artificial neurons. This work provides a step towards the fabrication of ANNs with synaptic plasticity selectively mediated by biomolecules for neuro&#8208;prosthetics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Colossal Anisotropic Thermal Expansion through Coupling Spin Crossover and Rhombus Deformation in a Hexanuclear {FeIII4FeII2} Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colossal and anisotropic thermal expansion is a key function for microscale or nanoscale actuators in material science. Herein, we present a hexanuclear compound of [(Tp*)FeIII(CN)3]4[FeII(Ppmp)]2&#183;2CH3OH (1, Tp* = hydrotris(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate and Ppmp = 2&#8208;[3&#8208;(2'&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl]pyridine), which has a rhombic core structure abbreviated as {FeIII2FeII2}. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed that 1 underwent temperature&#8208;induced spin transition with the thermal hysteresis. The FeII site in 1 behaved as a spin crossover (SCO) unit, and significant deformation of its octahedron was observed during the spin transition process. Moreover, the distortion of the FeII centers actuated anisotropic deformation of the rhombic {FeIII2FeII2} core, which was spread over the whole crystal through the subsequent molecular rearrangements, leading to the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion. Our results provide a rational strategy for realizing the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion and shape memory effects by tuning the magnetic bistability.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Together with the synthesis and experimental characterization of 14 hybrid materials containing [UO2X4]2&#8208; (X=Cl&#8208;and Br&#8208;) and organic cations, we report on novel methods for determining formation enthalpy (&#916;Hf) and correlating trends to observed vibrational signatures. &#916;Hf&#160;&#160;values were analyzed through isothermal acid calorimetry and a Density Functional Theory + Thermodynamics (DFT+T) approach and results showed good agreement between theory and experiment. We then assess packing efficiency, organic ligand protonation enthalpy, and hydrogen bonding energy (EtotalH,nom) as descriptor of &#916;Hf&#160;trend. Our results demonstrated strong association between Etotal&#160;H,nom&#160;and &#916;Hf&#160;highlighting the importance of hydrogen bonding networks in solid&#8208;state hybrid materials' relative stability. Finally, we investigated how hydrogen bonding networks affect the vibrational characteristics of uranyl solid&#8208;state materials using experimental Raman and IR spectroscopy and theoretical bond orders. We found that solid&#8208;state hydrogen bonding can red&#8208;shift U&#8801;O stretching modes. The tightly integrated experimental and theoretical studies bridge the trends in macroscopic thermodynamic energies and spectroscopic features with molecular&#8208;level details of the geometry and electronic structure.

         <title>Synthesis of a Blue&#8208;Emissive Azaborathia[9]helicene by Silicon&#8208;Boron Exchange from Unusual Atropisomeric Teraryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the concise synthesis and chir(optical) properties of an azaborathia[9]helicene consisting of two thienoazaborole motifs. The key intermediate, a highly congested teraryl with nearly parallel isoquinoline moieties, was generated as a mixture of atropisomers upon fusion of the central thiophene ring of the dithienothiophene moiety. These diastereomers were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealing intriguing interactions in the solid state. Subsequent insertion of boron into the aromatic scaffold via silicon&#8208;boron exchange involving triisopropylsilyl groups fixed the helical geometry, thereby establishing a novel method for the preparation of azaboroles. The ligand exchange at boron in the final step afforded the blue emitter displaying a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.17 in CH2Cl2 and excellent configurational stability. Detailed structural and theoretical investigation of unusual atropisomers and the helicene provide insights into their isomerization processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Linking Composition, Structure and Thickness of CoOOH to Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity by Correlative Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of &#946;&#8208;CoOOH crystallographic orientations in catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains elusive. We combine correlative electron backscatter diffraction/scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography to establish the structure&#8208;activity relationships of various faceted &#946;&#8208;CoOOH formed on a Co microelectrode under OER conditions. We reveal that ~6 nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01 0), grown on [ 0]&#8208;oriented Co, exhibits higher OER activity than ~3 nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(10 3) or ~6 nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(0006) formed on [02 &#8208; and [0001]&#8208;oriented Co, respectively. This arises from higher amounts of incorporated hydroxyl ions and more easily reducible CoIII&#8208;O sites present in &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01 0) than those in the latter two oxyhydroxide facets. Our correlative multimodal approach shows great promise in linking local activity with atomic&#8208;scale details of structure, thickness and composition of active species, which opens opportunities to design pre&#8208;catalysts with preferred defects that promote the formation of the most active OER species.</dc:description>

         <title>Birefringence Regulation by Clarifying the Relationship Between Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs and Optical Anisotropy in Tin&#8208;based Ternary Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is important to establish and clarify the relationship between stereochemically active lone pairs and birefringence, since it is one of the significantly effective routes to explore birefringent crystals by introducing Sn&#8208;centered polyhedra with stereochemically active lone pairs. Herein, four tin(&#8545;)&#8208;based ternary halides A3SnCl5 and ASn2Cl5 (A = NH4 and Rb) have been synthesized successfully. The experimental birefringence of Rb3SnCl5 and RbSn2Cl5 is larger than or equal to 0.046 and 0.123@546 nm, respectively. Through investigating the alkali or alkaline&#8208;earth metal tin(&#8545;)&#8208;based ternary halides, the structure&#8208;performance relationship has been concluded between stereochemically active lone pairs and optical anisotropy. It is beneficial to the analysis and prediction of birefringence in tin&#8208;based halides and provides a guide for exploring tin(&#8545;)&#8208;based optoelectronic functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Caging of Carboxyl Groups for On&#8208;Demand Protein Activation with Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The caging of amino acid side chains can provide exquisite control of protein function. The first chemical caging of carboxyl groups (Asp and Glu) in enzymic active sites is reported. Caging of a heme propionate in a protein was also feasible by this approach based on esterification with a tuned diazo compound. Decaging is enabled by small&#8208;molecule reagents that elicit a Staudinger reaction or 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition.







Abstract
Tools for on&#8208;demand protein activation enable impactful gain&#8208;of&#8208;function studies in biological settings. Thus far, however, proteins have been chemically caged at primarily Lys, Tyr, and Sec, typically through the genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids. Herein, we report that the preferential reactivity of diazo compounds with protonated acids can be used to expand this toolbox to solvent&#8208;accessible carboxyl groups with an elevated pKa value. As a model protein, we employed lysozyme (Lyz), which has an active&#8208;site Glu35 residue with a pKa value of 6.2. A diazo compound with a bioorthogonal self&#8208;immolative handle esterified Glu35 selectively, inactivating Lyz. The hydrolytic activity of the caged Lyz on bacterial cell walls was restored with two small&#8208;molecule triggers. The decaging was more efficient by small molecules than by esterases. This simple chemical strategy was also applied to a hemeprotein and an aspartyl protease, setting the stage for broad applicability.

         <title>A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vacuum&#8208;stable&#8208;by&#8208;design MALDI matrix enables long MALDI MS imaging measurements of at least 72&#8197;hours. Using a photo&#8208;removable 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) group, organic synthesis transformed the widely used, but unfortunately very volatile MALDI matrix 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy acetophenone (2,5&#8208;DHAP) into a vacuum&#8208;stable matrix, which can be uncaged by the MALDI laser in the ion source and then perform as the common matrix 2,5&#8208;DHAP.







Abstract
Insufficient vacuum stability of matrix chemicals is a major limitation in matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of large tissue sample cohorts. Here, we designed and synthesized the photo&#8208;cleavable caged molecule 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxyacetophenone (DMNB&#8208;2,5&#8208;DHAP) and employed it for lipid MALDI&#8208;MSI of mouse brain tissue sections. DMNB&#8208;2,5&#8208;DHAP is vacuum&#8208;stable in a high vacuum MALDI ion source for at least 72&#8197;h. Investigation of the uncaging process suggested that the built&#8208;in laser (355&#8197;nm) in the MALDI ion source promoted the in situ generation of 2,5&#8208;DHAP. A caging group is used for the first time in designing a MALDI matrix that is vacuum&#8208;stable, uncaged upon laser irradiation during the measurement process, and that boosts lipid ion intensity with MALDI&#8208;2 laser&#8208;induced postionization.

         <title>Multimodal Analysis of Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Nanoporous Block Copolymer Membranes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous block copolymer membranes functionalized with a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst (POM&#8208;WOC) and a light&#8208;absorbing ruthenium complex were probed and characterized using operando scanning electrochemical microscopy, ex situ spatially resolved micro&#8208;X&#8208;ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Molecular scale information was obtained about the spatial distribution and catalytic performance of the membrane.







Abstract
Heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis is a cornerstone of sustainable energy conversion. Most catalytic studies focus on bulk analyses of the hydrogen and oxygen evolved, which impede the correlation of matrix heterogeneities, molecular features, and bulk reactivity. Here, we report studies of a heterogenized catalyst/photosensitizer system using a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst and a model, molecular photosensitizer that were co&#8208;immobilized within a nanoporous block copolymer membrane. Via operando scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), light&#8208;induced oxygen evolution was determined using sodium peroxodisulfate (Na2S2O8) as sacrificial electron acceptor. Ex situ element analyses provided spatially resolved information on the local concentration and distribution of the molecular components. Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR&#8208;ATR) studies of the modified membranes showed no degradation of the water oxidation catalyst under the reported light&#8208;driven conditions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimensional reduction strategy in which 3D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin, flexible metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs), has been proposed to facilitate their cryopreservation applications. The 2D MOLs displayed superior ice crystal growth inhibition for the enhanced interfacial interaction through structural deformation/stretching and increased inner ordered structures utilization efficiency.







Abstract
To increase the red blood cell (RBC) cryopreservation efficiency by metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), a dimensional reduction approach has been proposed. Namely, 3D MOF nanoparticles are progressively reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). We found that 2D MOLs are beneficial for enhanced interactions of the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network and increased utilization of inner ordered structures, due to the higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. Specifically, a series of hafnium (Hf)&#8208;based 2D MOLs with different thicknesses (monolayer to stacked multilayers) and densities of hydrogen bonding sites have been synthesized. Both ice recrystallization inhibition activity (IRI) and RBCs cryopreservation assay confirm the pronounced better IRI activity and excellent cell recovery efficiency (up to &#8776;63&#8201;% at a very low concentration of 0.7&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1) of thin&#8208;layered Hf&#8208;MOLs compared to their 3D counterparts, thereby verifying the dimensional reduction strategy to improved cryoprotectant behaviors.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atom Support Boosts Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a novel interface chemistry manipulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) before the self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) by constructing a novel 2D/2D heterostructure composed of NiO anchored Ru&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical studies verify the thermodynamically favorable process of UOR on the Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based catalysts have been regarded as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), however, their activity is largely limited by the inevitable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) during the UOR. Here, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of UOR before the NSOR via constructing a 2D/2D heterostructure that consists of ultrathin NiO anchored Ru&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations confirm this unique triggering mechanism on the surface of Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO. Consequently, the fabricated catalyst exhibits outstanding UOR activity with a low potential of 1.288&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable long&#8208;term durability for more than 330&#8197;h operation. DFT calculations and spectroscopic characterizations demonstrate that the favorable electronic structure induced by this unique heterointerface endows the catalyst energetically more favorable for the UOR than the NSOR.

         <title>A Dissipative Reaction Network Drives Transient Solid&#8211;Liquid and Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Cycling of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent nanoparticles have been dispersed in water under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions by coupling to a dissipative reaction network that consumes a fuel at a controlled rate. The transient dispersed state enables autonomous solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid back&#8211;and&#8211;forth phase cycling of gold nanoparticles on a timescale that is easily adjusted by changing the pH value.







Abstract
Transient states maintained by energy dissipation are an essential feature of dynamic systems where structures and functions are regulated by fluxes of energy and matter through chemical reaction networks. Perfected in biology, chemically fueled dissipative networks incorporating nanoscale components allow the unique properties of nanomaterials to be bestowed with spatiotemporal adaptability and chemical responsiveness. We report the transient dispersion of gold nanoparticles in water, powered by dissipation of a chemical fuel. A dispersed state that is generated under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions permits fully reversible solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid phase transfer. The molecular basis of the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium process is reversible covalent modification of nanoparticle&#8208;bound ligands by a simple inorganic activator. Activator consumption by a coupled dissipative reaction network leads to autonomous cycling between phases. The out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium lifetime is tunable by adjusting the pH value, and reversible phase cycling is reproducible over several cycles.

         <title>A Remotely Controlled Nanosystem for Spatiotemporally Specific Gene Regulation and Combinational Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR light&#8208;controlled, mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanosystem can be used for spatiotemporally selective gene regulation and tumor treatment. The system relies on photodynamic effect&#8208;induced translocation of a DNA repair enzyme, which enables spatially&#8208;controlled gene regulation and thus enhanced antitumor effects.







Abstract
The dearth of technologies that allow gene modulation and therapy with high spatiotemporal precision remains a bottleneck in biomedical research and applications. Here we present a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanosystem that allows spatiotemporally controlled regulation of gene expression and thus combinational tumor therapy. The nanosystem is built by engineering of an enzyme&#8208;activatable antisense oligonucleotide and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;based photodynamic system and a mitochondria localization signal. The system relies on photodynamic effect&#8208;induced translocation of a DNA repair enzyme from nucleus into mitochondria, which enables spatially selective gene regulation via enzymatic reactions. We demonstrate that the NIR light&#8208;induced mitochondrial photodamage and gene regulation enable enhanced antitumor effect. Our approach may enable the specific gene regulation and tumor treatment with high precision both spatially and temporally.

         <title>Influence of Composition of Nickel&#8208;Iron Nanoparticles for Abiotic CO2 Conversion to Early Prebiotic Organics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high temperature and pressure, synthetic Ni&#8722;Fe nanoparticles catalyze H2&#8208;dependent CO2 fixation to form the main intermediates of the acetyl&#8208;CoA pathway (e.g., formate, acetate, and pyruvate). The reported chemistry is reminiscent of hydrothermal vents, which yield large amounts of H2 in the presence of transition metals and are implicated in forming the first biochemical pathways through CO2 fixation.







Abstract
Abiotic synthesis of formate and short hydrocarbons takes place in serpentinizing vents where some members of vent microbial communities live on abiotic formate as their main carbon source. To better understand the catalytic properties of Ni&#8722;Fe minerals that naturally exist in hydrothermal vents, we have investigated the ability of synthetic Ni&#8722;Fe based nanoparticular solids to catalyze the H2&#8208;dependent reduction of CO2, the first step required for the beginning of pre&#8208;biotic chemistry. Mono and bimetallic Ni&#8722;Fe nanoparticles with varied Ni&#8208;to&#8208;Fe ratios transform CO2 and H2 into intermediates and products of the acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A pathway&#8212;formate, acetate, and pyruvate&#8212;in mM range under mild hydrothermal conditions. Furthermore, Ni&#8722;Fe catalysts converted CO2 to similar products without molecular H2 by using water as a hydrogen source. Both CO2 chemisorption analysis and post&#8208;reaction characterization of materials indicate that Ni and Fe metals play complementary roles for CO2 fixation.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of glycals was developed to access 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides. This method exhibits broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity under very mild conditions. In addition, unprecedented stereodivergent synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;ribofuranosides was achieved using different chiral bisoxazoline ligands.







Abstract
2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides represent an important class of carbohydrates that are present in many bioactive molecules. However, owing to the lack of substituents at the C2 position, the stereoselective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is highly challenging. Herein, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled stereoselective C&#8208;alkyl glycosylation reaction to access 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides from readily available glycals and alkyl halides. This method exhibits broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity under very mild conditions. In addition, unprecedented stereodivergent synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;ribofuranosides is achieved using different chiral bisoxazoline ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that hydrometallation of the glycal with the bisoxazoline&#8208;ligated Co&#8722;H species may be the turnover&#8208;limiting and stereodetermining step of this transformation.

         <title>Supercharged CO2 Photothermal Catalytic Methanation: High Conversion, Rate, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride photothermal catalyst for enabling the Solar Sabatier process is reported that reduces the energy intensity of the thermo&#8208;catalytic version, yet maintains an amazing Sabatier conversion of 87.68&#8201;%, a reaction rate of 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity under ambient pressure conditions. Together these attributes are considered a prerequisite for scaling the process to a technologically relevant level.







Abstract
To overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic impediments of the Sabatier CO2 methanation reaction, the process must be operated under very high temperature and pressure conditions, to obtain an industrially viable conversion, rate, and selectivity. Herein, we report that these technologically relevant performance metrics have been achieved under much milder conditions using solar rather than thermal energy, where the methanation reaction is enabled by a novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride catalyst. In this regard, an in situ generated HOB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B surface frustrated Lewis's pair is considered responsible for the high Sabatier conversion 87.68&#8201;%, reaction rate 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1h&#8722;1, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity, realized under ambient pressure conditions. This discovery bodes well for an opto&#8208;chemical engineering strategy aimed at the development and implementation of a sustainable &#8216;Solar Sabatier&#8217; methanation process.

         <title>Design of Drug Efficacy Guided by Free Energy Simulations of the &#946;2&#8208;Adrenoceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets and numerous approved drugs act by either stimulating or blocking receptor activation. However, the design of ligands that modulate GPCR signaling is challenging. We demonstrate that molecular simulations of GPCRs can be used to predict ligand efficacy and identify potent &#946;2&#8208;adrenoceptor agonists.







Abstract
G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) play important roles in physiological processes and are modulated by drugs that either activate or block signaling. Rational design of the pharmacological efficacy profiles of GPCR ligands could enable the development of more efficient drugs, but is challenging even if high&#8208;resolution receptor structures are available. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the &#946;2 adrenergic receptor in active and inactive conformations to assess if binding free energy calculations can predict differences in ligand efficacy for closely related compounds. Previously identified ligands were successfully classified into groups with comparable efficacy profiles based on the calculated shift in ligand affinity upon activation. A series of ligands were then predicted and synthesized, leading to the discovery of partial agonists with nanomolar potencies and novel scaffolds. Our results demonstrate that free energy simulations enable design of ligand efficacy and the same approach can be applied to other GPCR drug targets.

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral Au13 Clusters Stabilized by Enantiopure Monodentate NHC Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of new enantiopure chiral NHC&#8208;stabilized superatomic gold clusters exhibited an oxygen&#8208;insensitive circularly polarized fluorescence with a record&#8208;setting quantum yield of 61&#8201;% in the solution state.







Abstract
Chiral Au nanoclusters have promising application prospects in chiral sensing, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptics. However, enantiopure superatomic homogold clusters with crystallographic structures emitting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remain challenging. In this study, we designed chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), and for the first time enantioselectively synthesized a pair of monovalent cationic superatomic Au13 clusters. This new enantiomeric pair of clusters has a quasi&#8208;C2 symmetric core and exhibited CPL with an unprecedent solution&#8208;state quantum yield (QY) of 61&#8201;% among those of the atomically precise Au nanoclusters. DFT calculations provided insights into the circular dichroism behavior, and revealed the origin of CPL from superatomic Au clusters. This work opens a new avenue for developing novel homochiral nanoclusters using chiral NHC ligands and provides fundamental understanding of the origin of the chiroptics of metal clusters.

         <title>Functionalisation of Graphene Sensor Surfaces for the Specific Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalisation of selective biosensors: The noncovalent functionalisation of graphene with perylene bisimide via the FLaT approach allows for specific coupling with antibodies. The application of the respective antigen results in a concentration dependent change of electrical characteristics, proving selective binding of the small molecule without cross&#8208;sensitivity towards other small molecules.







Abstract
We report on a controllable and specific functionalisation route for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) for the recognition of small physiologically active molecules. Key element is the noncovalent functionalisation of the graphene surface with perylene bisimide (PBI) molecules directly on the growth substrate. This Functional Layer Transfer enables the homogeneous self&#8208;assembly of PBI molecules on graphene, onto which antibodies are subsequently immobilised. The sensor surface was characterised by atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and electrical measurements, showing superior performance over conventional functionalisation after transfer. Specific sensing of small molecules was realised by monitoring the electrical property changes of functionalised GFET devices upon the application of methamphetamine and cortisol. The concentration dependent electrical response of our sensors was determined down to a concentration of 300&#8197;ng&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for methamphetamine.

This Functional Layer Transfer enables the homogeneous self-assembly of PBI molecules on graphene, onto which antibodies are subsequently immobilised. The sensor surface was characterised by atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and electrical measurements, showing superior performance over conventional functionalisation after transfer. Specific sensing of small molecules was realised by monitoring the electrical property changes of functionalised GFET devices upon the application of methamphetamine and cortisol. The concentration dependent electrical response of our sensors was determined down to a concentration of 300&#8197;ng&#8201;ml&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for methamphetamine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupling Redox Hopping and Catalysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks &#8208;based Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic challenges associated with the multielectron activation in MOF&#8208;based CO2 electrocatalysts can be addressed by decoupling the catalysis from the charge transport. Better performance and desired selectivity can be achieved when the activation potential of the catalysts is matched with the conduction band of the charge&#8208;transporting framework.







Abstract
Traditional MOF e&#8208;CRR, constructed from catalytic linkers, manifest a kinetic bottleneck during their multi&#8208;electron activation. Decoupling catalysis and charge transport can address such issues. Here, we build two MOF/e&#8208;CRR systems, CoPc@NU&#8208;1000 and TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000, by installing cobalt metalated phthalocyanine and tetraphenylporphyrin electrocatalysts within the redox active NU&#8208;1000 MOF. For CoPc@NU&#8208;1000, the e&#8208;CRR responsive CoI/0 potential is close to that of NU&#8208;1000 reduction compared to the TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000. Efficient charge delivery, defined by a higher diffusion (Dhop=4.1&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) and low charge&#8208;transport resistance (
=59.5&#8197;&#937;) in CoPC@NU&#8208;1000 led FECO=80&#8201;%. In contrast, TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000 fared a poor FECO=24&#8201;% (Dhop=1.4&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 
=91.4&#8197;&#937;). For such a decoupling strategy, careful choice of the host framework is critical in pairing up with the underlying electrochemical properties of the catalysts to facilitate the charge delivery for its activation.

         <title>Do The Twist: Efficient Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Visible Light Polymerization Facilitated by Spin&#8208;Orbit Charge Transfer Inter&#8208;system Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic catalyst enables rapid and efficient production of polymers using low energy visible light by leveraging a unique charge transfer mechanism. This mechanism relies on communication between connected, yet electronically decoupled units, which is facilitated by twisting one unit out of plane. This discovery is anticipated to enable the rapid and energy efficient production of plastics through emergent 3D printing technology.







Abstract
The use of visible light to drive polymerizations with spatiotemporal control offers a mild alternative to contemporary UV&#8208;light&#8208;based production of soft materials. In this spectral region, photoredox catalysis represents the most efficient polymerization method, yet it relies on the use of heavy&#8208;atoms, such as precious metals or toxic halogens. Herein, spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing from boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyads bearing twisted aromatic groups is shown to enable efficient visible light polymerizations in the absence of heavy&#8208;atoms. A &#8776;5&#8211;15&#215; increase in polymerization rate and improved photostability was achieved for twisted BODIPYs relative to controls. Furthermore, monomer polarity had a distinct effect on polymerization rate, which was attributed to charge transfer stabilization based on ultrafast transient absorption and phosphorescence spectroscopies. Finally, rapid and high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with a green LED was demonstrated using the present photosystem.

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;C Cleavage of Methylenecyclobutanes for &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes by Strain Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of methylenecyclobutanols was accomplished by C&#8722;C cleavage to release ring strain, selectively affording &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The photocatalyzed reaction proceeds in good yields, and was used for the concise synthesis of the natural product alatanone A.







Abstract
Radical additions onto olefins have surfaced as an increasingly powerful strategy for the synthesis of difunctionalized scaffolds. However, despite of major advances, known approaches continue to be largely limited to two manifolds, namely 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes and remote difunctionalization via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Herein, we describe a mechanistically distinct approach by photoinduced carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) activation/ring&#8208;opening to access &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from methylenecyclobutanols and sulfonyl chlorides by strain release. Remarkably, the sulfonyl motif on the products was easily removed by another photocatalytic process, which enabled the concise assembly of the natural product alatanone A. The synthetic utility of our approach was reflected by versatile functional group tolerance, ample substrate scope, and scalability. The photocatalysis represents a conceptually distinct alternative to existing approaches for remote 1,4&#8208;diversifications, with a double bond remaining in the thus obtained products.

         <dc:description>
A Janus separator based on cation exchange resin and Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes with triple synergistic effects is exploited to suppress Zn dendrites growth, mitigate polyiodide shuttle effect and facilitate redox kinetics of iodine species. This is reflected in the outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;I2 battery with a lifespan over 2500&#8197;h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;I2 batteries stand out in the family of aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and immanent safety. However, Zn dendrite growth, polyiodide shuttle effect and sluggish I2 redox kinetics result in dramatically capacity decay of Zn&#8722;I2 batteries. Herein, a Janus separator composed of functional layers on anode/cathode sides is designed to resolve these issues simultaneously. The cathode layer of Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes can effectively anchor polyiodide and catalyze the redox kinetics of iodine species, while the anode layer of cation exchange resin rich in &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups is beneficial to attract Zn2+ ions and repel detrimental SO42&#8722;/polyiodide, improving the stability of cathode/anode interfaces synergistically. Consequently, the Janus separator endows outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;I2 batteries with a lifespan over 2500&#8197;h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

A ligand&#8208;controlled cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation reaction for the &#946;&#8208;selective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides from glycals is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions by a radical pathway and may inspire the development of similar stereoselective coupling reactions, particularly in the field of carbohydrate synthesis.







Abstract
We report a ligand&#8208;controlled CoII&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling hydroalkylation for direct and &#946;&#8208;selective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides from glycals. This reaction proceeds by a radical pathway for alkyl halide activation and is &#946;&#8208;selective through ligand control. This approach may inspire the development of further stereoselective coupling reactions with potential application in the field of carbohydrates.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of a Labeled, Cancer&#8208;Targeting DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting aptamer AS1411 via parahydrogen. For that, we screened for suitable parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) labels, performed solid phase synthesis to incorporate the label into AS1411 and adapted the polarity of DNA via PEGylation to enable efficient, selective hydrogenation in organic solvents without affecting canonical nucleotides.







Abstract
Enhancing NMR signals of biomacromolecules by hyperpolarization offers exciting opportunities for diagnostic applications. However, their hyperpolarization via parahydrogen remains challenging as specific catalytic interactions are required, which are difficult to tune due to the large size of the biomolecule and its insolubility in organic solvents. Herein, we show the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting DNA aptamer AS1411. By screening different molecular motifs for an unsaturated label in nucleosides and in DNA oligomers, we were able to identify structural prerequisites for the hyperpolarization of AS1411. Finally, adjusting the polarity of AS1411 by complexing the DNA backbone with amino polyethylene glycol chains allowed the hydrogenation of the label with parahydrogen while the DNA structure remains stable to maintain its biological function. Our results are expected to advance hyperpolarized molecular imaging technology for disease detection in the future.

         <title>Non&#8208;planar Nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] Cluster Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;planar nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] cluster sites in N&#8208;doped carbon plane with similar active center atomic composition to ferredoxin achieve efficient O2 adsorption and activation while avoiding too robust adsorption of OH* intermediate, thus realizing excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance beyond planar [FeN4] and [Fe2N6]. This work provides insights into co&#8208;regulation of atomic composition and spatial configuration for efficient ORR catalysis.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts, as promising alternative to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), are still highly expected to achieve better performance by modulating the composition and spatial structure of active site. Herein, we constructed the non&#8208;planar nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] cluster sites in N&#8208;doped carbon plane. Adjacent double Fe atoms effectively weaken the O&#8722;O bond by forming a peroxide bridge&#8208;like adsorption configuration, and the introduction of S atoms breaks the planar coordination of Fe resulting in greater structural deformation tension, lower spin state, and downward shifted Fe d&#8208;band center, which together facilitate the release of OH* intermediate. Hence, the non&#8208;planar [Fe2S2] cluster catalyst, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;V, displays superior ORR activity than that of planar [FeN4] or [Fe2N6]. This work provides insights into the co&#8208;regulation of atomic composition and spatial configuration for efficient oxygen reduction catalysis.

         <title>Aromatic Amides: A Smart Backbone toward Isolated Ultralong Bright Blue&#8208;Phosphorescence in Confined Polymeric Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulation of the triplet excited state by utilizing an aromatic amide skeleton has led to ultralong blue phosphorescence in confined films. Strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling within the aromatic amide as well as hydrogen bonding interactions with polyvinyl alcohol accelerate intersystem crossing and suppress the non&#8208;radiative relaxations, thereby overcoming the dilemma of achieving organic phosphorescence with both high energy and long lifetime.







Abstract
We describe an aromatic amide skeleton for manipulation of triplet excited states toward bright long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence. Spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the aromatic amides can promote strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling between (&#960;,&#960;*) and the bridged (n,&#960;*) states, and enable multiple channels to populate the emissive 3(&#960;,&#960;*), as well as facilitate robust hydrogen bonding with polyvinyl alcohol to suppress non&#8208;radiative relaxations. Isolated inherent deep&#8208;blue (0.155, 0.056) to sky&#8208;blue (0.175, 0.232) phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 34.7&#8201;%) in confined films are achieved. The blue afterglow of the films can last for several seconds and are showcased in information display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and white light afterglow. Owing to the high population of 3(&#960;,&#960;*) states, the smart aromatic amide skeleton provides an important molecular design prototype to manipulate triplet excited states for ultralong phosphorescence with various colors.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Diversification of Complex Bioactive Molecules by Accelerated Synthesis in Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules was achieved using an automated platform based on desorption&#8208;electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. Accelerated reactions in microdroplets enable the ultrafast synthesis of diversified drug molecules. Over 250&#8197;analogues of bioactive compounds were generated and characterized using nanogram amounts of material in less than 1&#8197;second per reaction.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage diversification of drug molecules is an important strategy in drug discovery that can be facilitated by reaction screening using high&#8208;throughput experimentation. Here we present a rapid method for functionalizing bioactive molecules based on accelerated reactions in microdroplets. Reaction mixtures are nebulized at throughputs better than 1&#8197;reaction/second and the accelerated reactions occurring in the microdroplets are followed by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI&#8208;MS). Because the accelerated reactions occur on the millisecond timescale, they allow an overall screening throughput of 1&#8197;Hz working at the low nanogram scale. Using this approach, an opioid agonist (PZM21) and an antagonist (naloxone) were diversified using three reactions important in medicinal chemistry: sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click reactions, imine formation reactions, and ene&#8208;type click reactions. Some 269&#8197;functionalized analogs of naloxone and PZM21 were generated and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) after screening over 500&#8197;reactions.

Accelerated reactions in microdroplets enable the ultrafast synthesis of diversified drug molecules. Over 250&#8197;analogues of bioactive compounds were generated and characterized using nanogram amounts of material in less than 1&#8197;second per reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late-stage diversification of drug molecules is an important strategy in drug discovery that can be facilitated by reaction screening using high-throughput experimentation. Here we present a rapid method for functionalizing bioactive molecules based on accelerated reactions in microdroplets. Reaction mixtures are nebulized at throughputs better than 1&#8197;reaction/second and the accelerated reactions occurring in the microdroplets are followed by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS). Because the accelerated reactions occur on the millisecond timescale, they allow an overall screening throughput of 1&#8197;Hz working at the low nanogram scale. Using this approach, an opioid agonist (PZM21) and an antagonist (naloxone) were diversified using three reactions important in medicinal chemistry: sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click reactions, imine formation reactions, and ene-type click reactions. Some 269&#8197;functionalized analogs of naloxone and PZM21 were generated and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) after screening over 500&#8197;reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction of Platinum(IV) Prodrug Hemoglobin Nanoparticles with Deeply Penetrating Ultrasound Radiation for Tumor&#8208;Targeted Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective activation of PtIV prodrugs upon irradiation is receiving much interest. The majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds to superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors.







Abstract
The development of PtIV prodrugs that are reduced into the therapeutically active PtII species within the tumor microenvironment has received much research interest. In order to provide spatial and temporal control over the treatment, there is a high demand for the development of compounds that could be selectively activated upon irradiation. Despite recent progress, the majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds to superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors. The nanoparticles were found to selectively accumulate inside a mouse colon carcinoma tumor upon intravenous injection and were able to eradicate the tumor upon exposure to ultrasound radiation.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of Monometallic C^C* Platinum(II) Formamidinate Complexes using Sterically Demanding Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following a concise quantum chemical screening, sterically demanding amidinate ligands were employed in the synthesis of monometallic C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. This new class of photoluminescent platinum(II) complexes features a hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength of up to 137&#8197;nm in comparison to their bimetallic counterparts explained by the loss of metallophilic interactions.







Abstract
A novel class of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes&#8212;previously considered to be inaccessible&#8212;was synthesized by an improved synthetic route utilizing ligands predicted by density functional theory calculations. Based on a concise quantum chemical screening three model ligands with varying steric demand were chosen and a series of six photoluminescent C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) formamidinate complexes was obtained. The least sterically demanding ligand led to a bimetallic complex in two isomeric forms, which could be separated and confirmed by the corresponding solid&#8208;state structures. Sterically more hindered amidinate ligands gave the monometallic complexes supporting the theoretical predictions. The monometallic complexes show a significant hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength, explained by the loss of the metal&#8208;metal interactions. Depending on the cyclometalating ligand quantum yields up to 87&#8201;% with short decay times were found for this new class of phosphorescent green&#8208;blue to pure blue platinum(II) emitters.

         <title>Entropic Contributions to Sodium Solvation and Solvent Stabilization upon Electrochemical Sodium Deposition from Diglyme and Propylene Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropic contributions to the free enthalpy may significantly influence the equilibrium potential of an electrode in a battery system. By microcalorimetric measurements of Na deposition from a diglyme solution, we show that solvation entropy destabilizes the Na+ in solution by about 0.7&#8197;eV, thus strongly increasing the stability of the electrolyte solution upon Na deposition and affecting the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
The formation of an appropriate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode of a sodium battery is crucially dependent on the electrochemical stability of solvent and electrolyte at the redox potential of Na/Na+ in the respective system. In order to determine entropic contributions to the relative stability of the electrolyte solution, we measure the reaction entropy of Na metal deposition for diglyme (DG) and propylene carbonate (PC) based electrolyte solutions by electrochemical microcalorimetry at single electrodes. We found a large positive reaction entropy for Na+ deposition in DG of &#916;R
234&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 (c.f.: &#916;R
83&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1), which signals substantial entropic destabilization of Na+ in DG by about 0.73&#8197;eV, thus increasing the stability of solvent and electrolyte relative to Na+ reduction. We attribute this strong entropic destabilization to a highly negative solvation entropy of Na+, due to the low dielectric constant and high freezing entropy of DG.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Optophysiology Platform for Recording Intracellular and Extracellular Signals across the Brain of Free&#8208;Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform was created for simultaneously quantifying intracellular L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and extracellular dopamine (DA), and recording electrophysiological signals in the brain of free&#8208;moving mice. Using our powerful tool, we found that Cys regulated DA by facilitating the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. Molecular networks involving Cys and DA were significantly affected in the depressed mice and recovered by the treatment with N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine.







Abstract
Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of both intra/extracellular chemical signals across the large&#8208;scale brain is the key bottleneck for understanding the interactions between the molecules inside and outside neurons. Here we built up a high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform, together with developing two probes for specific recognition of L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and dopamine (DA), for simultaneously quantifying of both intracellular Cys and extracellular DA with high selectivity and accuracy across the brain of freely moving animals, as well as recording electrical signals. Using this powerful tool, it was found that intracellular Cys regulated extracellular DA through inducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the depressed mice brain. We also established the functional networks of Cys and DA across 32 brain regions in freely moving animals. More importantly, it was discovered that depression reduced the correlations between adjacent brain regions, which was recovered by the treatment of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine.

The electrocatalyst composed of Cu nanoparticles and g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (Cu&#8722;CN) is reported, which could efficiently covert CO into acetate with a Faradaic efficiency of 62.8&#8201;% in a flow cell and acetic acid continuously in a porous solid electrolyte reactor. In situ experiments and density functional theory studies reveal the synergy between dual catalytic regions: Cu/C3N4 interface enhances the generation and coverage of *CHO from CO, and Cu NPs facilitate the acetic acid (acetate) generation from migrated *CHO.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction reaction of carbon monoxide (CORR) offers a promising way to manufacture acetic acid directly from gaseous CO and water at mild condition. Herein, we discovered that the graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) supported Cu nanoparticles (Cu&#8722;CN) with the appropriate size showed a high acetate faradaic efficiency of 62.8&#8201;% with a partial current density of 188&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in CORR. In situ experimental and density functional theory calculation studies revealed that the Cu/C3N4 interface and metallic Cu surface synergistically promoted CORR into acetic acid. The generation of pivotal intermediate &#8722;*CHO is advantage around the Cu/C3N4 interface and migrated *CHO facilitates acetic acid generation on metallic Cu surface with promoted *CHO coverage. Moreover, continuous production of acetic acid aqueous solution was achieved in a porous solid electrolyte reactor, indicating the great potential of Cu&#8722;CN catalyst in the industrial application.

         <title>Harnessing the Structure and Dynamics of the Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclase for (&#8722;)&#8208;Ambroxide Production
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy in engineering the active site and entrance tunnel of squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase is demonstrated in the archetypal promiscuous cyclization of (E,E)&#8208;homofarnesol towards high&#8208;value (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide. Moreover, the long&#8208;term stability of the enzyme in vivo was exploited in a feeding strategy to demonstrate high cyclization performance.







Abstract
Terpene cyclases offer enormous synthetic potential, given their unique ability to forge complex hydrocarbon scaffolds from achiral precursors within a single cationic rearrangement cascade. Harnessing their synthetic power, however, has proved to be challenging owing to their generally low catalytic performance. In this study, we unveiled the catalytic potential of the squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase (SHC) by harnessing its structure and dynamics. First, we synergistically tailored the active site and entrance tunnel of the enzyme to generate a 397&#8208;fold improved (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide synthase. Our computational investigations explain how the introduced mutations work in concert to improve substrate acquisition, flow, and chaperoning. Kinetics, however, showed terpene&#8208;induced inactivation of the membrane&#8208;bound SHC to be the major turnover limitation in vivo. Merging this insight with the improved and stereoselective catalysis of the enzyme, we applied a feeding strategy to exceed 105 total turnovers. We believe that our results may bridge the gap for broader application of SHCs in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Longitudinally Grafting of Graphene with Iron Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Porous Organic Polymer to Boost Oxygen Electroreduction</title>

Exfoliated laminar iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymer (PFePc) nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) are designed as noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Comprehensive variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy measurements further reveal the rapid ORR kinetics of the prepared 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc.







Abstract
Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymers (PFePc) are attractive noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the low site&#8208;exposure degree and poor electrical conductivity of bulk PFePc restricted their practical applications. Herein, laminar PFePc nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) was prepared. Such structural engineering qualifies 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc with high site utilization and rapid mass transfer. Thence, 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc demonstrates efficient ORR performance with a high specific activity of 69.31&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 81.88&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high turnover frequency of 0.93&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1 at 0.90&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in O2&#8208;saturated 0.1&#8197;M KOH, outperforming the lamellar PFePc wrapped graphene counterpart. Systematic electrochemical analyses integrating variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy further underline the rapid kinetics of 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc towards ORR.

Bright multicolor electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with high device performance are prepared by adoping triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive carbon dots (CDs) as single emissive layer.







Abstract
Two kinds of triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive carbon dots (CDs) with orange and yellow color are facilely synthesized through solvothermal treatment, taking advantage of the nonplanar structure and good carrier mobility of triphenylamine unit. Theoretical calculations show that the triphenylamine structure could greatly inhibit the direct &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of aromatic skeletons and enhance the fluorescence properties of CDs in aggregation state. By adopting the CDs as single emissive layer, high&#8208;performance orange&#8208;color and green&#8208;color electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are successfully fabricated, with maximum brightness of 9450/4236&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, high current efficiency of 1.57/2.34&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.1/3.6&#8197;eV are respectively achieved. Significantly, white&#8208;color LED device is further prepared. This work provides a universal platform for the construction of novel solid&#8208;state emissive CDs with significant applications in photoelectric device.

         <title>Reducing Overpotential of Solid&#8208;State Sulfide Conversion in Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve a superior potassium&#8208;sulfur battery performance, we elucidate the solid&#8208;state K2S3&#8722;K2S conversion pathway via meta&#8208;stable intermediates on a range of transition metal single&#8208;atom catalytic sulfur hosts. It is demonstrated that the host with Cu single atom exhibits a relatively weak Cu&#8208;S bonding, resulting in low overpotential of K2S3&#8722;K2S conversion. The resultant catalytic sulfur host demonstrates high discharge capacities of 1595 and 1226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 335 and 1675&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Improving kinetics of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion in sulfur cathodes can enhance sulfur utilization of metal&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, fundamental understanding of the solid&#8208;state conversion remains to be achieved. Here, taking potassium&#8208;sulfur batteries as a model system, we for the first time report the reducing overpotential of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion via the meta&#8208;stable S32&#8722; intermediates on transition metal single&#8208;atom sulfur hosts. The catalytic sulfur host containing Cu single atoms demonstrates high capacities of 1595 and 1226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current densities of 335 and 1675&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, with stable Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;100&#8201;%. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical computations reveal that the relatively weak Cu&#8208;S bonding results in low overpotential of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion and high sulfur utilization. The elucidation of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion mechanism can direct the exploration of highly efficient metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

     alt="Reducing Overpotential of Solid-State Sulfide Conversion in Potassium-Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve a superior potassium-sulfur battery performance, we elucidate the solid-state K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S conversion pathway via meta-stable intermediates on a range of transition metal single-atom catalytic sulfur hosts. It is demonstrated that the host with Cu single atom exhibits a relatively weak Cu-S bonding, resulting in low overpotential of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S conversion. The resultant catalytic sulfur host demonstrates high discharge capacities of 1595 and 1226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 335 and 1675&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving kinetics of solid-state sulfide conversion in sulfur cathodes can enhance sulfur utilization of metal-sulfur batteries. However, fundamental understanding of the solid-state conversion remains to be achieved. Here, taking potassium-sulfur batteries as a model system, we for the first time report the reducing overpotential of solid-state sulfide conversion via the meta-stable S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intermediates on transition metal single-atom sulfur hosts. The catalytic sulfur host containing Cu single atoms demonstrates high capacities of 1595 and 1226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at current densities of 335 and 1675&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, with stable Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;100&#8201;%. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical computations reveal that the relatively weak Cu-S bonding results in low overpotential of solid-state sulfide conversion and high sulfur utilization. The elucidation of solid-state sulfide conversion mechanism can direct the exploration of highly efficient metal-sulfur batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoelectromagnetic Responsive Adaptive Porous Frameworks through Dynamic Covalent Chemistry of Tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned Aryldicyanomethyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic trimer&#8208;based dynamic framework with a complex 3D channel network has been constructed through reversible dynamic covalent linking of tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned aryl dicyanomethyl radical building blocks. Due to the conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;mediated reaction dynamics, the system shows macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, photoluminescence, and magnetic properties.







Abstract
Dynamic materials undergoing adaptive solid&#8208;state transitions are attractive for soft mechanics and information technology. Here, we report a novel porous framework system based on macrocyclic trimers assembled from open&#8208;shell tetraarylethylene building blocks with aryldicyanomethyl radicals as coupling linkers. Under mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli, the framework showed adaptability by activating conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;based transformations, thus displaying macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, luminescence, and magnetism. We studied the dynamic processes by variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR), variable&#8208;temperature electron spin resonance (VT&#8208;ESR), and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurement and further established a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for multi&#8208;modal information encryption. The strategy may open avenues for rational design of solid&#8208;state photoelectromagnetic dynamic materials by merging dynamic covalent coupling chemistry and functional aggregation principles.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;promoted Electrocatalytic Graphitization of Biochars for Energy Storage: Mechanistic Understanding using Multi&#8208;scale Approaches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a catalytic process of nickel&#8208;promoted electrochemical graphitization in molten calcium chloride. Multi&#8208;scale approach from atomic reactions to macroscale cells is useful in understanding the mechanism of evolution in the electrolytic cell, the kinetics of electrochemical reactions and the pathways of nickel&#8208;promoted graphitization and tubularization.







Abstract
Owing to high&#8208;efficiency and scalable advantages of electrolysis in molten salts, electrochemical conversion of carbonaceous resources into graphitic products is a sustainable route for achieving high value&#8208;added carbon. To understand the complicated kinetics of converting amorphous carbon (e.g. carbonized lignin&#8208;biochar) into highly graphitic carbon, herein this study reports the key processing parameters (addition of Ni, temperature and time) and multi&#8208;scale approach of nickel&#8208;boosted electrochemical graphitization&#8208;catalysis processes in molten calcium chloride. Upon both experiments and modellings, multi&#8208;scale analysis that ranges from nanoscale atomic reaction to macroscale cell reveal the multi&#8208;field evolution in the electrolysis cell, mechanism of electrochemical reaction kinetics as well as pathway of nickel&#8208;boosted graphitization and tubulization. The results of as&#8208;achieved controllable processing regions and multi&#8208;scale approaches provide a rational strategy of manipulating electrochemical graphitization processes and utilizing the converted biomass resources for high value&#8208;added use.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence from Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We doped yitterbium ions into perovskite nanocrystal hosts for extending their electroluminescence wavelength towards 1000&#8197;nm. The synergy of halide&#8208;stoichiometry control and surface passivation enables us to achieve an efficient near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diode with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%, representing the highest efficiency among organic LEDs and perovskite LEDs with peak wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm to date.







Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) deliver size&#8208; and composition&#8208;tunable luminescence of high efficiency and color purity in the visible range. However, attaining efficient electroluminescence (EL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region from PeNCs is challenging, limiting their potential applications. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) by doping ytterbium ions into a PeNCs host (Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs), extending the EL wavelengths toward 1000&#8197;nm, which is achieved through a direct sensitization of Yb3+ ions by the PeNC host. Efficient quantum&#8208;cutting processes enable high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 126&#8201;% from the Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs. Through halide&#8208;composition engineering and surface passivation to improve both PLQY and charge&#8208;transport balance, we demonstrate an efficient NIR LED with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;% at a central wavelength of 990&#8197;nm, representing the most efficient perovskite&#8208;based LEDs with emission wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm.

         <title>Close&#8208;Shell Reductive Elimination versus Open&#8208;Shell Radical Coupling for Site&#8208;Selective Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activations by Computation and Experiments</title>

         <dc:description>
The origins of site&#8208;selectivity for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and arylation have been illuminated by means of density functional theory calculations. The competition between close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and open&#8208;shell radical attack is responsible for the ortho&#8208; versus meta&#8208;selectivity, for which a multi&#8208;linear regression model, predicting the site&#8208;selection, was devised and tested experimentally.







Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond activation&#8208;assisted meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as a useful tool to forge distal C&#8722;C bonds. However, given the limited number of mechanistic studies, a clear understanding of the origin of the site&#8208;selectivity and the complete reaction pattern is not available. Here, we present systematic computational studies on ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization with primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl bromides and aryl bromides. The C&#8722;H scission and the C&#8722;C formation were carefully examined. Monocyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes were identified as the active species, which then underwent inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer (ISET) to activate the organic bromides. The site&#8208;selectivity results from the competition between the close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and the open&#8208;shell radical coupling. Based on this mechanistic understanding, a multilinear regression model was built to predict the site&#8208;selectivity, which was further validated by experiments.

         <title>Ene Reductase Enabled Intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Substituted Cyclohexanones for Efficient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds</title>

An unprecedented &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reaction that is enabled by ene reductases is reported. When the reaction is coupled with photocatalysis, various 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#8208;ones can be synthesized in a straightforward manner from readily available cyclohexenones and N&#8208;phenylglycines. This chemoenzymatic reaction can be carried out on a gram scale, and the product can be further selectively derivatized.







Abstract
Herein we report that ene reductases (EREDs) can facilitate an unprecedented intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reaction for the synthesis of bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles containing the 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold. To streamline the synthesis of these privileged motifs, we developed a gram&#8208;scale one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic cascade by combining iridium photocatalysis with EREDs, using readily available N&#8208;phenylglycines and cyclohexenones that can be obtained from biomass. Further derivatization using enzymatic or chemical methods can convert 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#8208;one into 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;ols, which can be potentially utilized for the synthesis of azaprophen and its analogues for drug discovery. Mechanistic studies revealed the reaction requires oxygen, presumably to produce oxidized flavin, which can selectively dehydrogenate the 3&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone derivatives to form the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which subsequently undergoes spontaneous intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition under basic conditions.

Pillar[5]arene derivatives with perylene diimide tethers have been shown to form aggregates in nonpolar organic solvents that undergo a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer on complexation with a cationic amino acid ethyl ester. The chiral transfer only occurs when the chiral inducer exceeds a threshold concentration, with significant gabs values of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8722;2 observed.







Abstract
Perylene diimide tethered pillar[5]arene derivatives form aggregates in non&#8208;polar organic solvents, and the complexation of cationic amino acid ethyl ester (cAA&#8208;OEt) with the aggregates induce a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer, leading to intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals having dissymmetric factors (gabs) of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8722;2. The hierarchical chiral induction exhibited an intriguing threshold dose effect, namely, the chiral induction does not occur in the low concentration range of cAA&#8208;OEt but is triggered when cAA&#8208;OEt exceeds a threshold concentration. The inhibited interconversion between the Rp and Sp conformers of pillar[5]arene, which is further restricted in the aggregation, plays a crucial role in the threshold effect. When adding enantiopure cAA&#8208;OEt first to the threshold concentration and then adding an equal amount of the antipodal cAA&#8208;OEt to give cAA&#8208;OEt in racemic form, CD spectra having the same sign as the CD induced by first adding pure cAA&#8208;OEt were induced, thus showing an unprecedented &#8220;first come, first served&#8221; effect.

         <title>Iron&#8208;siRNA Nanohybrids for Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy via Ferritin Heavy Chain Downregulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reinforcing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent based on siRNA&#8208;embedded iron nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) is reported. The degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs to Fe2+ and siRNA occurs in acidic endo/lysosomes and is promoted by oxygen depletion&#8208;caused intracellular pH decrease. In addition to initiating CDT, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of ferritin heavy chain (FHC) siRNA, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.







Abstract
Ferrous iron (Fe2+) has more potent hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH)&#8208;generating ability than other Fenton&#8208;type metal ions, making Fe&#8208;based nanomaterials attractive for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). However, because Fe2+ can be converted by ferritin heavy chain (FHC) to nontoxic ferric form and then sequestered in ferritin, therapeutic outcomes of Fe&#8208;mediated CDT agents are still far from satisfactory. Here we report the synthesis of siRNA&#8208;embedded Fe0 nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) for self&#8208;reinforcing CDT via FHC downregulation. Upon internalization by cancer cells, pH&#8208;responsive Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs are degraded to release Fe2+ and FHC siRNA in acidic endo/lysosomes with the aid of oxygen (O2). The accompanied O2 depletion causes an intracellular pH decrease, which further promotes the degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs. In addition to initiating chemodynamic process, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of siRNA by disrupting the membranes, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Triggered Chemodynamic Therapy via a Peptide&#8208;H2S Donor Conjugate with Complexed Fe2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining an enzyme&#8208;triggered hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor with the Fenton reaction promoter Fe2+, we developed a peptide&#8208;H2S donor conjugate&#8208;Fe2+ complex that increased levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species in C6 cancer cells, providing an H2S&#8208;amplified, enzyme&#8208;responsive system for precise cancer treatment.







Abstract
Inducing high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside tumor cells is a cancer therapy method termed chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Relying on delivery of Fenton reaction promoters such as Fe2+, CDT takes advantage of overproduced ROS in the tumor microenvironment. We developed a peptide&#8208;H2S donor conjugate, complexed with Fe2+, termed AAN&#8208;PTC&#8211;Fe2+. The AAN tripeptide was specifically cleaved by legumain, an enzyme overexpressed in glioma cells, to release carbonyl sulfide (COS). Hydrolysis of COS by carbonic anhydrase formed H2S, an inhibitor of catalase, an enzyme that detoxifies H2O2. Fe2+ and H2S together increased intracellular ROS levels and decreased viability in C6 glioma cells compared with controls lacking either Fe2+, the AAN sequence, or the ability to generate H2S. AAN&#8208;PTC&#8211;Fe2+ performed better than temezolimide while exhibiting no cytotoxicity toward H9C2 cardiomyocytes. This study provides an H2S&#8208;amplified, enzyme&#8208;responsive platform for synergistic cancer treatment.

A manganese&#8208;coordinated polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based biocatalyst (Mn&#8722;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8722;N5 sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated networks was synthesized. Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, Mn&#8722;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS&#8208;scavenging activity and offers promise as an artificial antioxidase for stem&#8208;cell therapeutics and the treatment of other ROS&#8208;related diseases.







Abstract
Constructing highly effective biocatalysts with controllable coordination geometry for eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) to address the current bottlenecks in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics remains challenging. Herein, inspired by the coordination structure of manganese&#8208;based antioxidase, we report a manganese&#8208;coordinated polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based biocatalyst (Mn&#8722;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8722;N5 sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated networks that serves as an artificial antioxidase to rescue stem cell fate. Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, Mn&#8722;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, including elimination of H2O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;. Consequently, Mn&#8722;PcBC efficiently rescues the bioactivity and functionality of stem cells in high&#8208;ROS&#8208;level microenvironments by protecting the transcription of osteogenesis&#8208;related genes. This study offers essential insight into the crucial functions of axially coordinated Mn&#8722;N5 sites in ROS scavenging and suggests new strategies to create efficient artificial antioxidases for stem&#8208;cell therapies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Prenucleation&#8208;Induced Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy is proposed with formamide as a double&#8208;face solvent to accelerate the nucleation of formamidine/cesium&#8208;based perovskites. The preferentially precipitated PbI2&#8208;DMSO crystals by formamide act as nucleation seeds to accelerate the nucleation process. The crystalline quality of the prepared perovskite film is significantly improved. The efficiency of hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exceeds 19&#8201;%.







Abstract
Perovskite film with high crystal quality is fundamental to achieving high&#8208;performance solar cells. A fast nucleation process is crucial to improving the crystallization quality. Here, we propose a self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy to achieve fast nucleation. This is realized through rational solvent design. The key characteristics of different solvents are systematically evaluated. Among them, formamide, with ultra&#8208;high dielectric constant, low Gutman donor number, and a high boiling point, is selected as the co&#8208;solvent. These unique characteristics render formamide a double&#8208;face solvent that is a good solvent for formamidinium iodide (FAI) and CsI while a poor solvent for PbI2. As a result, formamide induces the self&#8208;driven prenucleation of PbI2&#8208;DMSO seeding crystals and accelerates the nucleation, improving the crystalline quality of perovskite film. The efficiency of the hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells is boosted beyond 19&#8201;% for the first time.

         <title>Growing ZIF&#8208;8 Seeds on Charged COF Substrates toward Efficient Propylene&#8208;Propane Separation Membranes</title>

Charged COF nanosheets are used as nuclei&#8208;deposition substrate (NDS) to generate MOF@COF nanosheet seeds, which enables the fabrication of ultrathin, defect&#8208;free MOF membranes by secondary growth.







Abstract
We report a covalent organic framework (COF) induced seeding strategy to fabricate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes. Contrary to graphene oxide nuclei&#8208;depositing substrate, COF substrate has uniform pore size, high microporosity and abundant functional groups. We designed a series of charged COF nanosheets to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;8@COF nanosheet seeds with high aspect ratio over 150, which were readily processed into a compact and uniform seed layer. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8 membranes with thickness down to 100&#8197;nm exhibit an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 separation performance and superior long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is also validated by fabricating ultrathin ZIF&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;66 membranes.

         <title>Highly Stable Triangular Single&#8208;Layer 2D Assemblies: Synthesis and Their Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Elastic and Anisotropic Curling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable single&#8208;layer 2D assemblies of AuI&#8208;thiolate, with both long&#8208;range molecular order and a uniform triangular morphology, have been synthesized, and their elastic and anisotropic curling upon external stimuli has been achieved on single&#8208;assembly level.







Abstract
Synthesis of highly stable two&#8208;dimensional single&#8208;layer assemblies (SLAs) is a key challenge in supramolecular science, especially those with long&#8208;range molecular order and well&#8208;defined morphology. Here, thin (thickness &lt;2&#8197;nm) triangular AuI&#8208;thiolate SLAs with high thermo&#8208;, solvato&#8208; and mechano&#8208; stability have been synthesized via a double&#8208;ligand co&#8208;assembly strategy. Furthermore, the SLAs show assembly&#8208;level elastic and anisotropic deformation responses to external stimuli as a result of the long&#8208;range anisotropic molecular packing, which provides SLAs with new application potentials in bio&#8208;mimic nanomechanics.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Biomimetic Dimerization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant. This protocol allows the dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerance to construct natural and unnatural pyrroloindole dimers and dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold linking two turn structures.







Abstract
Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established. The discovery of the extremely active iron catalyst enables aerobic enzyme&#8208;mimetic oxidation to be performed in a flask. This method was applicable to the oxidative dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan derivatives, including various dipeptides and oligopeptides, with remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerance without the protection of the amino acid residues. Furthermore, oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives bearing dioxopiperazine units enabled the convergent total synthesis of five natural pyrroloindole compounds and unnatural congeners. The established chemical method provides facile access to a broad range of dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold to link two turn structures, which will serve as a powerful tool to create new small&#8208; and medium&#8208;sized&#8208;molecules as drug candidates.

This method was applicable to the oxidative dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan derivatives, including various dipeptides and oligopeptides, with remarkable functional-group tolerance without the protection of the amino acid residues. Furthermore, oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives bearing dioxopiperazine units enabled the convergent total synthesis of five natural pyrroloindole compounds and unnatural congeners. The established chemical method provides facile access to a broad range of dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold to link two turn structures, which will serve as a powerful tool to create new small- and medium-sized-molecules as drug candidates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Vinylcyclopropane&#8208;Cyclopentene (VCP&#8208;CP) Rearrangement</title>

2&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropylacetaldehydes undergo enantioselective vinylcyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene (VCP&#8208;CP) rearrangement using a Jorgensen&#8208;Hayashi&#8208;type catalyst. The reaction proceeds through enamine/iminium activation and comprises the in situ generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane intermediate that undergoes ring&#8208;opening/cyclization. Computational studies together with the experimental data support a type&#8208;II DYKAT process operating.







Abstract
We have demonstrated that the catalytic and enantioselective vinylcyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene rearrangement can be carried out on (vinylcyclopropyl)acetaldehydes through activation via enamine intermediates. The reaction makes use of racemic starting materials that, upon ring opening facilitated by the catalytic generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane, deliver an acyclic iminium ion/dienolate intermediate in which all stereochemical information has been deleted. The final cyclization step forms the rearrangement product, showing that chirality transfer from the catalyst to the final compound is highly effective and leads to the stereocontrolled formation of a variety of structurally different cyclopentenes.

         <title>Molecular Dipole Engineering of Carbonyl Additives for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach was proposed to design and synthesize efficient carbonyl additives to improve perovskite device performance. After systematic research, we find that molecular dipole plays an important role in determining the passivation effect of the additive molecule. After optimization, the companion efficiency of the perovskite device is 23.20&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2), 20.18&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2) and it can maintain long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions.







Abstract
Carbonyl functional materials as additives are extensively applied to reduce the defects density of the perovskite film. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding for the effect of carbonyl additives to improve device performance. In this work, we systematically study the effect of carbonyl additive molecules on the passivation of defects in perovskite films. After a comprehensive investigation, the results confirm the importance of molecular dipole in amplifying the passivation effect of additive molecules. The additive with strong molecular dipole possesses the advantages of enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). After optimization, the companion efficiency of PSCs is 23.20&#8201;%, and it can maintain long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions. Additionally, a large&#8208;area solar cell module&#8208;modified DLBA was 20.18&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2). This work provides an important reference for the selection and designing of efficient carbonyl additives.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Synthesis and Biological Activity of 2&#8208;Exomethylene Pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates: Discovery of Mincle&#8208;Selective Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphine&#8208;ligand&#8208;controlled Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type glycosylation enabled the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates with an exomethylene group at the C2 position. These compounds are Mincle&#8208;selective ligands that do not bind to CD1d, suggesting that the 2&#8208;OH group of natural glycoconjugates is critical for CD1d binding.







Abstract
Glycoconjugate analogues in which the sp3&#8208;hybridized C2 position of the carbohydrate structure (normally bearing a hydroxy group) is converted into a compact sp2&#8208;hybridized exomethylene group are expected to have unique biological activities. We established ligand&#8208;controlled Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type glycosylation methodology to directly prepare a variety of these 2&#8208;exomethylene pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates, including glucosylceramide analogues, in an &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;selective manner. Glucocerebrosidase GBA1 cleaves these synthetic pseudo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosylceramides similarly to native glucosylceramides. The pseudo&#8208;glucosylceramides exhibit selective ligand activity towards macrophage&#8208;inducible C&#8208;type lectin (Mincle), but unlike native glucosylceramides, are inactive towards CD1d.

         <title>Starch&#8208;Based Superabsorbent Hydrogel with High Electrolyte Retention Capability and Synergistic Interface Engineering for Long&#8208;Lifespan Flexible Zinc&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic interaction between the acrylate groups along the starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) polymeric chains and zinc contributes to the dendrite&#8208;free interfacial layer formation. However, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;host exhibits limited interaction with the zinc anode, suggesting a random zinc deposition.







Abstract
The advent of wearable electronics has strongly stimulated advanced research into the exploration of flexible zinc&#8722;air batteries (ZABs) with high theoretical energy density, high inherent safety, and low cost. However, the half&#8208;open battery structure and the high concentration of alkaline aqueous environment pose great challenges on the electrolyte retention capability and the zinc anode stability. Herein, a starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) with high ionic conductivity, electrolyte absorption and retention capabilities, strong alkaline resistance and high zinc anode stability has been designed and applied in ZABs. Experimental and calculational analyses probe into the root of the superiority of SSHPEs, confirming the significance of the carboxyl functional groups along their polymer chains. These features endow the as&#8208;fabricated ZAB a long cycle life of 300&#8197;h, much longer than that with commonly used poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based electrolyte.

         <title>Electron Redistribution Enables Redox&#8208;Resistible Li6PS5Cl towards High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an electron redistribution strategy with Mg and F co&#8208;doping to inhibit the interfacial redox reactions between Li6PS5Cl and Li. Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptation from Li metal, and F further generates the self&#8208;limiting interface between the electrolyte and Li metal. This design enhances interfacial stability, enabling the high performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery.







Abstract
Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivity hold great promise for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the parasitic redox reactions between sulfide electrolyte and Li metal result in interfacial instability and rapid decline of the battery performance. Herein, a redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) electrolyte is created by regulating the electron distribution in LPSC with Mg and F incorporation.

     alt="Electron Redistribution Enables Redox-Resistible Li6PS5Cl towards High-Performance All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose an electron redistribution strategy with Mg and F co-doping to inhibit the interfacial redox reactions between Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and Li. Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptation from Li metal, and F further generates the self-limiting interface between the electrolyte and Li metal. This design enhances interfacial stability, enabling the high performance of all-solid-state lithium battery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivity hold great promise for all-solid-state lithium batteries. However, the parasitic redox reactions between sulfide electrolyte and Li metal result in interfacial instability and rapid decline of the battery performance. Herein, a redox-resistible Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (LPSC) electrolyte is created by regulating the electron distribution in LPSC with Mg and F incorporation. The introduction of Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptance from Li, and F generates the self-limiting interface, which hinders the redox reactions between LPSC and Li metal. This redox-resistible Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl-MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte therefore presents a high critical current density (2.3 times that of pristine electrolyte). The LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl-MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li cell shows an outstanding cycling stability (93.3&#8201;%@100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C). This study highlights the electronic structure modulation to address redox issues on sulfide-based lithium batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Revival of Degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 to Stable Highly Luminescent Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
After ageing under ambient conditions, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of as&#8208;synthesized CsPbI3 nanocrystals drastically declined to &#8776;11&#8201;% due to the formation of surface defect states. These &#8220;optically sick&#8221; CsPbI3 nanocrystals are then revived to their cubic phase through the addition of 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH), and regain a PLQY of approximately 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 is regarded as an attractive optical luminophore, it is readily degraded to the optically inactive &#948;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions. Here, we present a simple approach to revive degraded (&#8220;optically sick&#8221;) &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 through &#8220;medication&#8221; with thiol&#8208;containing ligands. The effect of different types of thiols is systematically studied through optical spectroscopy. The structural reconstruction of degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals to cubic crystals in the presence of thiol&#8208;containing ligands is visualized through high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We found that 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH) effectively revives degraded CsPbI3 and results in high immunity towards moisture and oxygen, hitherto unreported. DSH facilitates the passivation of surface defects and etching of degraded Cs4PbI6 phase, thus reverting them back to the cubic CsPbI3 phase, leading to enhanced PL and environmental stability.

         <title>Overcoming the Trade&#8208;Off between C2H2 Sorption and Separation Performance by Regulating Metal&#8208;Alkyne Chemical Interaction in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;alkyne chemical interaction of PdII and PtII in two isostructural NbO metal&#8211;organic frameworks was regulated to obtain different binding affinities for C2H2. As a result, C2H2 could be selectively adsorbed and C2H2/CO2 could be separated at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Designing porous materials for C2H2 purification and safe storage is essential research for industrial utilization. We emphatically regulate the metal&#8208;alkyne interaction of PdII and PtII on C2H2 sorption and C2H2/CO2 separation in two isostructural NbO metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA and Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA. The experimental investigations and systematic theoretical calculations reveal that PdII in Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA undergoes spontaneous chemical reaction with C2H2, leading to irreversible structural collapse and loss of C2H2/CO2 sorption and separation. Contrarily, PtII in Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA shows strong di&#8208;&#963; bond interaction with C2H2 to form specific &#960;&#8208;complexation, contributing to high C2H2 capture (28.7&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#8197;bar and 153&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar). The reusable Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA efficiently separates C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures with satisfying selectivity and C2H2 capacity (37&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1). This research provides valuable insight into designing high&#8208;performance MOFs for gas sorption and separation.

         <title>A Modular Tubular Flow System with Replaceable Photocatalyst Membranes for Scalable Coupling and Hydrogenation</title>

A modular tubular flow system with replaceable porous structured photocatalyst membranes provides a solution for scaling&#8208;up heterogeneous photocatalytic coupling and hydrogenation reactions with high efficiency under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is effective for the selective synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals at lab&#8208;scale, yet falls short of requirements for mass production (low cost and user friendliness). Here we report the design and fabrication of a modular tubular flow system embedded with replaceable photocatalyst membranes for scalable photocatalytic C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N homocoupling and hydrogenation reactions, which can be operated in either circular and continuous flow mode with high performance. The photocatalyst membranes almost fully occupy the volume of the reactor, thus enabling optimal absorption of the incident light. Additionally, the porous structured photocatalyst membranes facilitate the mass transfer of the reactants to efficiently use the active sites, resulting in 0th&#8208;order reaction kinetics and a high space&#8208;time yield compared to the batch reaction system at practical application levels and prolonged reaction times.

         <title>Utilizing Nitroarenes and HCHO to Directly Construct Functional N&#8208;Heterocycles by Supported Cobalt/Amino Acid Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst and L&#8208;proline, a reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations is presented, which enables direct and diverse access to 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines.







Abstract
Due to the generation of multiple intermediates during the nitroarene reduction, precise interception of single one to develop tandem reactions involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations still remains a significant challenge. Herein, the relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst with l&#8208;proline has been successfully applied to establish a bran&#8208;new reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde, which enables direct and diverse construction of both symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines. It proceeds with operational simplicity, good substrate and functionality compatibility, and excellent step and atom&#8208;efficiency. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Co&#8208;catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect on the formation of key N&#8208;hydroxy imine, and the l&#8208;proline subsequently facilitates the key C&#8722;C bond formation. The current work opens a door to develop useful transformations with nitroarenes by reduction&#8208;interrupted strategy.

&lt;p&gt;By relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst and L-proline, a reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations is presented, which enables direct and diverse access to 1,3-diaryl imidazolines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the generation of multiple intermediates during the nitroarene reduction, precise interception of single one to develop tandem reactions involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations still remains a significant challenge. Herein, the relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst with &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-proline has been successfully applied to establish a bran-new reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde, which enables direct and diverse construction of both symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3-diaryl imidazolines. It proceeds with operational simplicity, good substrate and functionality compatibility, and excellent step and atom-efficiency. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Co-catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect on the formation of key &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy imine, and the &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-proline subsequently facilitates the key C&#8722;C bond formation. The current work opens a door to develop useful transformations with nitroarenes by reduction-interrupted strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exposed Zinc Sites on Hybrid ZnIn2S4@CdS Nanocages for Efficient Regioselective Photocatalytic Epoxide Alcoholysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow CdS nanocages wrapped in ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were synthesized to form the hierarchical photocatalyst ZnIn2S4@CdS. Surface&#8208;exposed Zn acid centers and the Z&#8208;Scheme pathway between ZnIn2S4 and CdS promote the polarization of epoxide molecules and interfacial charge transfer, leading to photoredox&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alcoholysis of epoxides.







Abstract
Photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis through C&#8722;O bond cleavage and formation has emerged as an alternative to synthesizing anti&#8208;tumoral pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, the lack of crucial evidence to interpret the interaction between reactants and photocatalyst surface makes it challenging for photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis with both high activity and regioselectivity. In this work, we report the hierarchical ZnIn2S4@CdS photocatalyst for epoxide alcoholysis with high regioselectivity nearly 100&#8201;%. Mechanistic studies unveil that the precise activation switch on exposed Zn acid sites for C&#8722;O bond polarization and cleavage has a critical significance for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the establishment of Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates the interface charge separation and transfer. Remarkably, the underlying regioselective photocatalytic reaction pathway has been distinctly revealed.

         <title>A BN&#8208;Doped U&#8208;Shaped Heteroacene as a Molecular Floating Gate for Ambipolar Charge Trapping Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise electrophilic aromatic borylation reaction was used to synthesize a wide band gap U&#8208;shaped BN&#8208;doped heteroacene. The donor effect of the nitrogen atoms and the high electron affinity of the boron atoms fine&#8208;tuned the electronic features, as well as the dual&#8208;functional layer enabled by supramolecular engineering, resulting in an organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory with large ambipolar memory windows and a high charge storage density.







Abstract
Two wide&#8208;band gap U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with/without boron and nitrogen (BN&#8208;) doping (BN&#8208;1 and C&#8208;1) were synthesized to tune the electronic features to suit the performance requirements for organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory (OFET&#8208;NVM). The chemical structures were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Owing to the electron&#8208;donor effect of N and the high electron affinity of B, the BN&#8208;1&#8208;based OFET&#8208;NVM displays large ambipolar memory windows and an enhanced charge storage density compared to C&#8208;1 and most reported small molecules. A novel supramolecular system formed from BN&#8208;1 and PMMA contributes to fabricating uniform films with homogeneous microstructures, which serve as a two&#8208;in&#8208;one tunnelling dielectric and charge&#8208;trapping layer to realize long&#8208;term charge retention and reliable endurance. Our results demonstrate that both BN doping and supramolecular engineering are crucial for the charge trapping of OFET&#8208;NVM.

         <title>Enhancing Energy Conversion Efficiency and Durability of Alkaline Nickel&#8208;Zinc Batteries with Air&#8208;Breathing Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To leverage the oxygen produced from the avoidable side reaction of oxygen evolution in Ni&#8208;Zn battery, an air&#8208;breathing cathode is constructed by coupling oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst with the Ni(OH)2 cathode. Benefiting from the stabilizing effects on the electrolyte and electrodes, this novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB) exhibits an ultralong lifespan and ultrahigh energy efficiency (85&#8201;%), superior to Ni&#8208;Zn battery and Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB).







Abstract
Despite their high output voltage and safety advantages, rechargeable alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries face significant challenges associated with the cathodic side reaction of oxygen evolution, which results in low energy efficiency (EE) and poor stability. Herein, we propose to leverage the side oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in nickel&#8208;zinc batteries by coupling electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in the cathode, thus constructing an air breathing cathode. Such a novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB), designed in a pouch&#8208;type cell with a lean electrolyte, exhibits an outstanding EE of 85&#8201;% and a long cycle life of 100 cycles at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which are significantly superior to those of traditional Ni&#8208;Zn batteries (54&#8201;%, 50 cycles). Compared to Ni&#8208;Zn, the enhanced EE of Ni&#8208;ZnAB is attributed to the contribution from ORR, while the improved cycling stability is because the stability of the anode, cathode and electrolyte are also enhanced in Ni&#8208;ZnAB. Furthermore, an ultrahigh stability of 500 cycles with an average EE of 84&#8201;% at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved using a mold cell with rich electrolyte, demonstrating the strong application potential of Ni&#8208;ZnAB.

Two shape&#8208;persistent macrocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (MC&#8208;COFs) with aligned porous channels were synthesized. The MC&#8208;COFs&#8217; electrical conductivities were enhanced over 6 orders of magnitude upon I2 doping, with the framework structural integrity maintained. The electrical properties of MC&#8208;COFs can be switched between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states through simple doping&#8208;regenerating cycles.







Abstract
Two covalent organic frameworks consisting of carbazolylene&#8208;ethynylene shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles with azine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1) or imine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;2) linkages were synthesized via imine condensation. The obtained 2D frameworks are fully conjugated which imparts semiconducting properties. In addition, the frameworks showed high porosity with aligned accessible porous channels along the z axis, serving as an ideal platform for post&#8208;synthetic incorporation of I2 into the channels to enable electrical conductivity. The resulting MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 showed an electrical conductivity up to 7.8&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature upon I2 doping with the activation energy as low as 0.09&#8197;eV. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the electrical properties of both MC&#8208;COFs are switchable between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states by simply implementing doping&#8208;regenerating cycles. The knowledge gained in this study opens new possibilities for the future development of tunable conductive 2D organic materials.

         <title>Isobaric Stable Isotope N&#8208;Phosphorylation Labeling (iSIPL) for Ultrasensitive Proteome Quantification</title>

A novel isobaric phosphorus reagent enables the accurate quantitative proteome analysis and peptide sequencing with high sensitivity. The reporter ion clusters with characteristic P&#8722;N bonds were efficiently generated with very high intensities for protein quantification.







Abstract
Stable isotope chemical labeling methods have been widely used for high&#8208;throughput mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based quantitative proteomics in biological and clinical applications. However, the existing methods are far from meeting the requirements for high sensitivity detection. In the present study, a novel isobaric stable isotope N&#8208;phosphorylation labeling (iSIPL) strategy was developed for quantitative proteome analysis. The tryptic peptides were selectively labeled with iSIPL tag to generate the novel reporter ions containing phosphoramidate P&#8722;N bond with high intensities under lower collision energies. iSIPL strategy are suitable for peptide sequencing and quantitative analysis with high sensitivity and accuracy even for samples of limited quantity. Furthermore, iSIPL coupled with affinity purification and mass spectrometry was applied to measure the dynamics of cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) interactomes during transactivation of the HIV&#8208;1 provirus. The interaction of CDK9 with PARP13 was found to significantly decrease during Tat&#8208;induced activation of HIV&#8208;1 gene transcription, suggesting the effectiveness of iSIPL strategy in dynamic analysis of protein&#8208;protein interaction in vivo. More than that, the proposed iSIPL strategy would facilitate large&#8208;scale accurate quantitative proteomics by increasing multiplexing capability.

         <title>Design of Multicomponent Peptide Fibrils with Ordered and Programmable Compositional Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent peptide nanofibrils are constructed with an unprecedented degree of control over peptide arrangement. A neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning method is described to convert 8 designed peptides into the fibrils with 412 different compositional patterns with tunable compositions and peptide positions. This strategy may enable application&#8208;specific tailoring of material and biological properties of peptide fibrils.







Abstract
Advanced applications of biomacromolecular assemblies require a stringent degree of control over molecular arrangement, which is a challenge to current synthetic methods. Here we used a neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning strategy to build multicomponent peptide fibrils with an unprecedented capacity to manipulate local composition and peptide positions. Eight peptides were designed to have regulable nearest neighbors upon co&#8208;assembly, which, by simulation, afforded 412 different patterns within fibrils, with varied compositions and/or peptide positions. The fibrils with six prescribed patterns were experimentally constructed with high accuracy. The controlled patterning also applies to functionalities appended to the peptides, as exemplified by arranging carbohydrate ligands at nanoscale precision for protein recognition. This study offers a route to molecular editing of inner structures of peptide assemblies, prefiguring the uniqueness and richness of patterning&#8208;based material design.

         <title>Selective Production of CO from Organic Pollutants by Coupling Piezocatalysis and Advanced Oxidation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an unprecedented Co3S4/MoS2/peroxymonosulfate/ultrasound system to achieve a high rate of conversion from pollutants to CO through the coupling of piezocatalysis and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). This system is assisted by the formation of an electron transfer chain from Mo and S to Co, thus improving the thermodynamic process from carbonate to CO and enhancing the yield and selectivity. Our discovery represents a significant boost to achieving low emissions in wastewater treatment.







Abstract
To date, the chemical conversion of organic pollutants into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks rather than CO2 remains a major challenge. Herein, we successfully developed a coupled piezocatalytic and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) system for achieving the conversion of various organic pollutants to CO. The CO product stems from the specific process in which organics are first oxidized to carbonate through peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs, and then the as&#8208;obtained carbonate is converted into CO by piezoelectric reduction under ultrasonic (US) vibration by using a Co3S4/MoS2 catalyst. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the introduction of Co3S4 not only effectively promotes the transfer and utilization of piezoelectric electrons but also realizes highly selective conversion from carbonate to CO. The Co3S4/MoS2/PMS system has achieved selective generation of CO in actual complex wastewater treatment for the first time, indicating its potential practical applicability.

Herein, a catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of N,N&#8208;disubstituted acrylamides has been developed. Sterically&#8208;disfavored and electronically&#8208;disfavored enantioselective hydroaminations of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes were obtained using different transition metals (Cu, Ni) and chiral ligands, delivering enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives in good yields and selectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoacid and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoacid derivatives play an important role in biological science and pharmaceutical chemistry. Thus, the development of methods for their synthesis is highly valuable and yet remains challenging. Herein, an unprecedented catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of N,N&#8208;disubstituted acrylamides with aminating agents has been developed, accessing enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives. Sterically&#8208;disfavored and electronically&#8208;disfavored enantioselective hydroamination of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes have been successfully tuned using different transition metals and chiral ligands. Notably, extremely hindered aliphatic &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam derivatives were synthesized by Cu&#8722;H catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;N bond forming with tertiary alkyl species.

         <title>Small Molecule Degraders of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B and T&#8208;Cell Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inhibitor for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) was discovered and transformed into a first&#8208;in&#8208;class, potent, and selective dual PROTAC degrader for both targets. The degrader promotes antigen presentation of tumor cells and activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells. Importantly, the degrader is effective in vivo and suppresses syngeneic tumor growth.







Abstract
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) play non&#8208;redundant negative regulatory roles in T&#8208;cell activation, tumor antigen presentation, insulin and leptin signaling, and are potential targets for several therapeutic applications. Here, we report the development of a highly potent and selective small molecule degrader DU&#8208;14 for both PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP. DU&#8208;14 mediated PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation requires both target protein(s) and VHL E3 ligase engagement and is also ubiquitination&#8208; and proteasome&#8208;dependent. DU&#8208;14 enhances IFN&#8208;&#947; induced JAK1/2&#8208;STAT1 pathway activation and promotes MHC&#8208;I expression in tumor cells. DU&#8208;14 also activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells and augments STAT1 and STAT5 phosphorylation. Importantly, DU&#8208;14 induces PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation in vivo and suppresses MC38 syngeneic tumor growth. The results indicate that DU&#8208;14, as the first PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP dual degrader, merits further development for treating cancer and other indications.

&lt;p&gt;An inhibitor for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) was discovered and transformed into a first-in-class, potent, and selective dual PROTAC degrader for both targets. The degrader promotes antigen presentation of tumor cells and activates CD8+ T-cells. Importantly, the degrader is effective in vivo and suppresses syngeneic tumor growth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) play non-redundant negative regulatory roles in T-cell activation, tumor antigen presentation, insulin and leptin signaling, and are potential targets for several therapeutic applications. Here, we report the development of a highly potent and selective small molecule degrader DU-14 for both PTP1B and TC-PTP. DU-14 mediated PTP1B and TC-PTP degradation requires both target protein(s) and VHL E3 ligase engagement and is also ubiquitination- and proteasome-dependent. DU-14 enhances IFN-&#947; induced JAK1/2-STAT1 pathway activation and promotes MHC-I expression in tumor cells. DU-14 also activates CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells and augments STAT1 and STAT5 phosphorylation. Importantly, DU-14 induces PTP1B and TC-PTP degradation in vivo and suppresses MC38 syngeneic tumor growth. The results indicate that DU-14, as the first PTP1B and TC-PTP dual degrader, merits further development for treating cancer and other indications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Armor&#8208;like Inorganic&#8208;rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by the Pentafluorophenylboronic Acid Additive for High&#8208;voltage Li||NCM622 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;voltage stability of NCM622 is realized by armor&#8208;like CEI via electrolyte engineering, where the armored lithium borate on the CEI surface represses the dissolution of CEI moieties and improves the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed across whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) comprising Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathode could potentially realize high capacity and power density. However, suitable electrolytes to tolerate the oxidation on the cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage are urgently needed. Herein, we present an armor&#8208;like inorganic&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) strategy for exploring oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolytes for sustaining 4.8&#8197;V Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) batteries with pentafluorophenylboronic acid (PFPBA) as the additive. In such CEI, the armored lithium borate surrounded by CEI up&#8208;layer represses the dissolution of inner CEI moieties and also improves the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed over whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability and Li+ conductivity compared with polymer moieties. With such robust Li+ conductive CEI, the Li||NCM622 battery delivered excellent stability at 4.6&#8197;V cut&#8208;off voltage with 91.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 400&#8197;cycles. The excellent cycling performance was also obtained even at 4.8&#8197;V cut&#8208;off voltage.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Motif of Bacteroides vulgatus Lipopolysaccharides against Inflammatory Bowel Diseases through an Orthogonal One&#8208;Pot Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridecasaccharide from Bacteroides vulgatus mpk lipopolysaccharides has been synthesized for the first time by a strategy involving orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside&#8208;based orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation.







Abstract
Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, efficient access to long, branched and complex lipopolysaccharides remains challenging. Herein, we report the modular synthesis of a tridecasaccharide from Bacteroides vulgates through an orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoids the issues of thioglycoside&#8208;based one&#8208;pot synthesis. Our approach also features: 1) 5,7&#8208;O&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene&#8208;directed glycosylation for stereoselective construction of the &#945;&#8208;Kdo linkage; 2) hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery for the stereoselective formation of &#946;&#8208;mannosidic bonds; 3) remote anchimeric assistance for stereoselective assembly of the &#945;&#8208;fucosyl linkage; 4) several orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthetic steps and strategic use of orthogonal protecting groups to streamline oligosaccharide assembly; 5) convergent [1+6+6] one&#8208;pot synthesis of the target.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Metallosalphen&#8208;Based 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for NO2 Sensing: Metal Coordination Induced Planarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nonplanar Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) with C2v&#8208;symmetry was developed to construct 2D Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF via in situ one pot synthesis, featuring metal coordination induced planarization of the Salphen cores. The existence of N2O2 pocket of 6OH&#8208;Salphen endows 2D Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with higher metal density, shorter metal&#8208;metal distance and a narrower band gap, thus making it display a high response toward NO2 (766&#8201;% at 100&#8197;ppm).







Abstract
As an emerging class of promising porous materials, the development of two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) is hampered by the few categories and tedious synthesis of the specific ligands. Herein, we developed a nonplanar hexahydroxyl&#8208;functionalized Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) through a facile two&#8208;step synthesis, which was further applied to construct layered 2D c&#8208;MOFs through in situ one pot synthesis based on the synergistic metal binding effect of the N2O2 pocket of Salphen. Interestingly, the C2v&#8208;symmetry of ligand endows Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with periodically heterogeneous pore structures. Benefitting from the higher metal density and shorter in&#8208;plane metal&#8208;metal distance, Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF showcased excellent NO2 sensing performance with good sensitivity, selectivity and reversibility. The current work opens up a new avenue to construct 2D c&#8208;MOF directly from nonplanar ligands, which greatly simplifies the synthesis and provides new possibilities for preparing different topological 2D c&#8208;MOF based functional materials.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 22/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some matrix chemicals used in MALDI mass spectrometry are not sufficiently vacuum&#8208;stable and therefore not suitable for extended MALDI imaging experiments. Caging the MALDI matrices by covalent attachment of a photocleavable group renders them vacuum&#8208;stable, as reported by Qiuqin Zhou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202217047). The caged matrix is eventually uncaged in&#8197;situ by the UV laser in the MALDI ion source. Thereby, the original matrix is liberated, thus enabling MALDI imaging of large clinical or pharmacological sample cohorts. Artwork by Miriam Rittel, Stefano Rizzo, and Silas Ackermann.

         <title>Back Cover: Isolated Tin(IV) Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 in Neutral Aqueous Solution (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 22/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;copper metal based catalyst for the deep electroreduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons is reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202301767). For the first time, a Sn&#8208;based catalyst was developed for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to produce hydrocarbons. This Sn&#8208;based MOF shows an unexpected performance in the eCO2RR to produce CH4, as formate or CO are usually common products for traditional Sn&#8208;based catalysts.

Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. In their Research Article (e202301351), Guozhi Xiao and co&#8208;workers accomplished the first synthesis of a tridecasaccharide motif from Bacteroides vulgatus lipopolysaccharides by a strategy involving orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoided issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside&#8208;based orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation.

Ambergris is a highly valued natural product in the fragrance industry and is also known as "floating gold" because of its biosynthesis in the intestines of sperm whales. Owing to this scarce natural resource, the stereoselective synthesis of its most prominent olfactory component, (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide, via alternative routes is attractive. In their Research Article (e202301607), S&#237;lvia Osuna, Bernhard Hauer et&#8197;al. demonstrate the catalytic potential of an engineered squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase in the intricate cyclization of the precursor homofarnesol. Cover art: Verena Resch, Graz.

         <title>Engineering Graphdiyne for Solar Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of their large specific surface area, adjustable band gap, and uniformly pore structure, graphdiyne (GDY) materials have become a rising star for photocatalytic energy conversion. This Minireview summarizes the unique physicochemical properties of GDY as well as the construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction and nitrogen reduction.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY) with a direct band gap, excellent carrier mobility and uniform pores, is regarded as a promising photocatalytic material for solar energy conversion, while the research on GDY in photocatalysis is a less developed field. Herein, the distinctive structure, adjustable band gap, and electronic properties of GDY for photocatalysis is firstly summarized. The construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion, including H2 evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and N2 reduction reaction (NRR) are then elaborated. At last, the challenges and perspectives in developing GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production are discussed. It is anticipated that a timely Minireview will be helpful for rapid progress of GDY in solar energy conversion.

         <title>Lessons Learned from the Grouping of Chemicals to Assess Risks to Human Health</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grouping chemicals for risk assessment can consider the similarity of their intrinsic properties (e.g. structure), extrinsic properties, (e.g. persistence), and toxicological properties (e.g. genotoxicity). Based on the lessons learned on several substance classes, we derive principles of grouping, and differentiate between the prioritization of chemicals in groups of the same initial concern versus the definitive groups for justified read&#8208;across.







Abstract
In analogy to the periodic system that groups elements by their similarity in structure and chemical properties, the hazard of chemicals can be assessed in groups having similar structures and similar toxicological properties. Here we review case studies of chemical grouping strategies that supported the assessment of hazard, exposure, and risk to human health. By the EU&#8208;REACH and the US&#8208;TSCA New Chemicals Program, structural similarity is commonly used as the basis for grouping, but that criterion is not always adequate and sufficient. Based on the lessons learned, we derive ten principles for grouping, including: transparency of the purpose, criteria, and boundaries of the group; adequacy of methods used to justify the group; and inclusion or exclusion of substances in the group by toxicological properties. These principles apply to initial grouping to prioritize further actions as well as to definitive grouping to generate data for risk assessment. Both can expedite effective risk management.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Molecular Oxygen Activation in Heterogeneous Thermo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Mini&#8208;review systematically summarized the recent research progress of dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) for molecular oxygen activation (MOA) in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Despite the rapid developments in this field, many great challenges still hinder the practical application of DASCs. We look forward to the challenges and application prospects of DASCs for MOA.







Abstract
Efficient molecular oxygen activation (MOA) is the key to environmentally friendly catalytic oxidation reactions. In the last decade, single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with nearly 100&#8201;% atomic utilization and unique electronic structure have been widely investigated for MOA. However, the single active site makes the activation effect unsatisfactory and difficult to deal with complex catalytic reactions. Recently, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) have provided a new idea for the effective activation of molecular oxygen (O2) due to more diverse active sites and synergetic interactions among adjacent atoms. In this review, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of DASCs for MOA in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Finally, we look forward to the challenges and application prospects in the construction of DASCs for MOA.

         <title>Gold Complexes in Anticancer Therapy: From New Design Principles to Particle&#8208;Based Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold compounds have attracted considerable interest as anticancer drugs. However, the clinical translation of this class of compounds is hampered by suboptimal pharmacological performance. To address this problem, strategies based on molecular design principles have been the primary focus. More recently, the use of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems has emerged as a promising strategy to circumvent many limitations of these promising anticancer metallodrugs.







Abstract
The discovery of the medicinal properties of gold complexes has fuelled the design and synthesis of new anticancer metallodrugs, which have received special attention due to their unique modes of action. Current research in the development of gold compounds with therapeutic properties is predominantly focused on the molecular design of drug leads with superior pharmacological activities, e.g., by introducing targeting features. Moreover, intensive research aims at improving the physicochemical properties of gold compounds, such as chemical stability and solubility in the physiological environment. In this regard, the encapsulation of gold compounds in nanocarriers or their chemical grafting onto targeted delivery vectors could lead to new nanomedicines that eventually reach clinical applications. Herein, we provide an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of gold anticancer compounds, andmore importantly we thoroughly revise the development of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems for gold chemotherapeutics.

         <title>A Flow Cytometry&#8208;Based Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for Directed Evolution of Oxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; was developed by integrating oxidation/Fenton reaction cascade, Fe3+ mediated eGFPHis decoration, and fluorescence&#8208;activated&#8208;cell&#8208;sorting into a general strategy. FlOxi was validated in two evolution campaigns targeting two oxidases, exemplifying the suitability of the platform for screening oxidase variants in an ultrahigh&#8208;throughput manner.







Abstract
Oxidases are of interest to chemical and pharmaceutical industries because they catalyze highly selective oxidations. However, oxidases found in nature often need to be re&#8208;engineered for synthetic applications. Herein, we developed a versatile and robust flow cytometry&#8208;based screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; for directed oxidase evolution. FlOxi utilizes hydrogen peroxide produced by oxidases expressed in E. coli to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ (Fenton reaction). Fe3+ mediates the immobilization of a His6&#8208;tagged eGFP (eGFPHis) on the E. coli cell surface, ensuring the identification of beneficial oxidase variants by flow cytometry. FlOxi was validated with two oxidases&#8212;a galactose oxidase (GalOx) and a D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (D&#8208;AAO)&#8212;yielding a GalOx variant (T521A) with a 4.4&#8208;fold lower Km value and a D&#8208;AAO variant (L86M/G14/A48/T205) with a 4.2&#8208;fold higher kcat than their wildtypes. Thus, FlOxi can be used for the evolution of hydrogen peroxide&#8208;producing oxidases and applied for non&#8208;fluorescent substrates.

Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; mediates the immobilization of a His&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-tagged eGFP (eGFP&lt;sup&gt;His&lt;/sup&gt;) on the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; cell surface, ensuring the identification of beneficial oxidase variants by flow cytometry. FlOxi was validated with two oxidases&#8212;a galactose oxidase (GalOx) and a D-amino acid oxidase (D-AAO)&#8212;yielding a GalOx variant (T521A) with a 4.4-fold lower &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value and a D-AAO variant (L86M/G14/A48/T205) with a 4.2-fold higher &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; than their wildtypes. Thus, FlOxi can be used for the evolution of hydrogen peroxide-producing oxidases and applied for non-fluorescent substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Augmenting the Performance of Hydrogenase for Aerobic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution via Solvent Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are shown to be superior solvents for solar hydrogen generation using natural hydrogenase enzymes. This &#8220;inDEStructible&#8221; system demonstrates that DES&#8208;based engineered solvents stabilise hydrogenase towards oxygen and enable efficient H2 generation in air.







Abstract
This work showcases the performance of [NiFeSe] hydrogenase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen generation in a variety of organic&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. Despite its well&#8208;known sensitivity towards air and organic solvents, the hydrogenase shows remarkable performance under an aerobic atmosphere in these solvents when paired with a TiO2 photocatalyst. Tuning the water content further increases hydrogen evolution activity to a TOF of 60&#177;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 and quantum yield to 2.3&#177;0.4&#8201;% under aerobic conditions, compared to a TOF of 4&#8197;s&#8722;1 in a purely aqueous solvent. Contrary to common belief, this work therefore demonstrates that placing natural hydrogenases into non&#8208;natural environments can enhance their intrinsic activity beyond their natural performance, paving the way for full water splitting using hydrogenases.

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Human Cells at Near&#8208;Physiological Concentrations with Sensitive 19F NMR Chemical Tags</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using sensitive 19F NMR chemical tags, globular proteins (6&#8211;40.5&#8197;kD) were observed in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M after electroporation delivery. The method further enabled the quantification of protein&#8208;protein interactions in human cells, demonstrating a practical approach for studying the conformations and dynamics of human&#8208;derived proteins in their native conditions.







Abstract
In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is an effective tool for observing proteins at atomic resolution in their native cellular environment. However, its utility is limited by its low sensitivity and the extensive line broadening caused by nonspecific interactions in the cells, which is even more pronounced in human cells due to the difficulty of overexpressing or delivering high concentrations of isotopically labeled proteins. Here, we present a high&#8208;sensitivity tag (wPSP&#8208;6F) containing two trifluoromethyl groups that can efficiently label globular proteins with molecular weights in the 6&#8211;40&#8197;kDa range under mild conditions. This tag allowed us to detect globular proteins in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M, which would not have been achievable with 15N or 3&#8208;fluorotyrosine labeling. Moreover, we detected conformational changes and interactions of proteins in the cellular environment. The new sensitive 19F NMR tag may significantly expand the scope of protein NMR in human cells.

         <title>Isolated Tin(IV) Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 in Neutral Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based catalysts are known for their high yield of formate or CO in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, but here we report for the first time that a new Sn&#8208;based catalyst can achieve exceptional partial current density for the CH4 product.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts with non&#8208;copper metal sites for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) to hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, a stable metal&#8211;organic framework (DMA)4[Sn2(THO)2] (Sn&#8208;THO, THO6&#8722; = triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexakis(olate), DMA = dimethylammonium) with isolated and distorted octahedral SnO62&#8722; active sites is reported as an electrocatalyst for eCO2RR, showing an exceptional performance for eCO2RR to the CH4 product rather than the common products formate and CO for reported Sn&#8208;based catalysts. The partial current density of CH4 reaches a high value of 34.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most reported copper&#8208;based and all non&#8208;Cu metal&#8208;based catalysts. Our experimental and theoretical results revealed that the isolated SnO62&#8722; active site favors the formation of key *OCOH species to produce CH4 and can greatly inhibit the formation of *OCHO and *COOH species to produce *HCOOH and *CO, respectively.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers 5&#8208;Aminolevulinic Acid and Porphyrin for Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoplatform ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL for photodynamic therapy by conjugating 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a 2D Hf12&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic nanophotosensitizer (Hf&#8208;MOL). Upon endocytosis, ALA is released from Hf&#8208;MOL and accumulates in mitochondria for porphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis, while Hf&#8208;MOL is retained in lysosomes. Light irradiation excites both PpIX and Hf&#8208;MOL to elicit potent cytotoxicity and antitumor responses.







Abstract
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends on the subcellular localization of photosensitizers. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoparticle platform for enhanced PDT of cancer. By grafting 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a Hf12&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (Hf&#8208;MOL) via carboxylate coordination, ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL enhanced ALA delivery and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis in mitochondria, and trapped the Hf&#8208;MOL comprising 5,15&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;benzoatoporphyrin (DBP) photosensitizers in lysosomes. Light irradiation at 630&#8197;nm simultaneously excited PpIX and DBP to generate singlet oxygen and rapidly damage both mitochondria and lysosomes, leading to synergistic enhancement of the PDT efficacy. The dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL outperformed Hf&#8208;MOL in preclinical PDT studies, with a 2.7&#8208;fold lower half maximal inhibitory concentration in cytotoxicity assays in vitro and a 3&#8208;fold higher cure rate in a colon cancer model in vivo.

Use of the dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3, affords an equilibrium mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2, and cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3, which suppresses monomer dissociation. Multinuclear NMR and computational analyses indicated that DED interactions are the main arbiter of the dimer&#8208;trimer thermal interconversion.







Abstract
Reaction of {LiC6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3&#8901;Et2O}2 (Cyp=cyclopentyl) (1) of the new dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, 2,4,6&#8208;triscyclopentylphenyl with SnCl2 afforded a mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2 (2), and the cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3 (3). 2 is favored in solution at higher temperature (345&#8197;K or above) whereas 3 is preferred near 298&#8197;K. Van't Hoff analysis revealed the 3 to 2 conversion has a &#916;H=33.36&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;S=0.102&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1, which gives a &#916;G300 K=+2.86&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, showing that the conversion of 3 to 2 is an endergonic process. Computational studies show that DED stabilization in 3 is &#8722;28.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 per {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2 unit, which exceeds the DED energy in 2 of &#8722;16.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 per unit. The data clearly show that dispersion interactions are the main arbiter of the 3 to 2 equilibrium. Both 2 and 3 possess large dispersion stabilization energies which suppress monomer dissociation (supported by EDA results).

         <title>Tough, Reprocessable, and Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Polymers with Ultrastable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8722;N coordination into a commercial epoxy matrix has led to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;based materials with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The polymers show excellent mechanical properties, environmental stability, shape memory, and recyclability, which could be useful for anticounterfeiting, data encryption, and information editing applications.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers, whose emission can persist for a long period after photoexcitation, are of great importance for practical applications. Herein, dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8722;N coordination are incorporated into a commercial epoxy matrix. The reversible dissociation of B&#8722;N bonds upon loading provides an efficient energy dissipation pathway for the epoxy network, while the rigid epoxy matrix can inhibit the quenching of triplet excitons in boronic esters. The obtained polymers exhibit enhanced mechanical toughness (12.26&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), ultralong RTP (&#964;=540.4&#8197;ms), and shape memory behavior. Notably, there is no apparent decrease in the RTP property upon prolonged immersion in various solvents because the networks are robust. Moreover, the dynamic bonds endow the polymers with superior reprocessablity and recyclability. These novel properties have led to their potential application for information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Breakthrough Separation of 2&#8208;Butene Isomers with High Dynamic Selectivity and Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mixed&#8208;linker MET&#8208;Fe (MET&#8208;Fe&#8208;x) was designed for breakthrough separation of 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates from petrochemical and refinery processes to higher value&#8208;added end products. We reported that the synergetic effect of shape&#8208;selective electrostatic repulsion at the pore window and electrostatic attraction inside the cavity can boost the dynamic separation performance.







Abstract
Developing porous sorbents represents a potential energy&#8208;efficient way for industrial gas separation. However, a bottleneck for reducing the energy penalty is the trade&#8208;off between dynamic adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we showed this problem can be overcome by modulating the kinetic and thermodynamic separation behaviours in metal&#8211;organic frameworks for sieving 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates to higher value&#8208;added end products. We found that the iron&#8208;triazolate framework can realize the selective shape screening of 2&#8208;butene isomers assisted by electrostatic interactions at the pore apertures. Further introducing uncoordinated N binding sites by ligand substitution lowered the gas diffusion barrier and greatly boosted the dynamic separation performance. In breakthrough tests under ambient conditions, trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 can be efficiently separated from cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 with a record capacity of 2.10&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with high dynamic selectivity of 2.39.

         <title>Chemical&#8208;Mechanical Robustness of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enabled by Surface Atomic Arrangement Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical effect of intrinsic surface composition and structure on the properties of single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides as cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries is demonstrated via control of the elemental&#8208;structural surface atomic arrangement. The concomitant concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure were thus constructed, enabling the chemical&#8208;mechanical robustness of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes in the electrochemical process.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxide cathodes have been one of the dominant cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with efficient Li+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by the weak layered interaction and unstable surface, mechanical and chemical failure plagues their electrochemical performance, especially for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. Here, adopting a simultaneous elemental&#8208;structural atomic arrangement control based on the intrinsic Ni&#8722;Co&#8722;Mn system, the surface role is intensively investigated. Within the invariant oxygen sublattice of the crystal, a robust surface with the synergistic concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure is constructed on the model single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode. With mechanical strain dissipation and chemical erosion suppression, the cathode exhibits an impressive capacity retention of 82&#8201;% even at the harsh 60&#8201;&#176;C after 150&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work highlights the coupling effect of structure and composition on the chemical&#8208;mechanical properties, and the concept will spur more researches on the cathodes that share the same sublattice.

         <title>11C&#8208;Cyanation of Aryl Fluorides via Nickel and Lithium Chloride&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiosynthetic method for [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;fluorine bond activation is reported. This method enables the efficient ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of a broad range of aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicate that LiCl greatly promotes the oxidative addition of aryl fluorides to a nickel(0) complex, affording aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complexes at room temperature.







Abstract
Aryl fluorides are expected to be useful as radiolabeling precursors due to their chemical stability and ready availability. However, direct radiolabeling via carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#8722;F) bond cleavage is a challenging issue due to its significant inertness. Herein, we report a two&#8208;phase radiosynthetic method for the ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of aryl fluorides to obtain [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation. We also established a practical protocol that avoids the use of a glovebox, except for the initial preparation of a nickel/phosphine mixture, rendering the method applicable for general PET centers. This method enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse [11C]aryl nitriles from the corresponding aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicated a significant promotion effect of lithium chloride on the oxidative addition, affording an aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complex, which serves as a precursor for rapid 11C&#8208;cyanation.

         <title>Photoinduced Fluorescence Switching in Molecular Aggregates by Topological [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates by the topological [2+2] photocycloaddition of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives promises a way to regulate molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. It was demonstrated that such a photocycloaddition can occur when derivatives are doped in selective polymer matrixes, which paves the way for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.







Abstract
The optical modulation of fluorescence characteristics in molecular aggregates, which mainly involves diverse molecular stacking and the consequent intermolecular interactions, remains a significant challenge for potential applications in optical anticounterfeiting, data storage, and imaging. Here we successfully realize in situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives by topological [2+2] photocycloaddition, which represents a promising way to regulate the molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. Notably, 2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;TF) in both crystal and powder forms exhibits a unique switching from an initial nonfluorescent state to a highly fluorescent state (&#934;PL=0.46) upon UV irradiation, because of the destruction of the [2+2] cycloaddition process by volume expansion of the photodimer. Furthermore, we demonstrate such a [2+2] photocycloaddition can occur when 2&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxypheny)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;OH) is doped within selective polymer matrixes, and can be utilized for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.

Naphthospironone A, a cytotoxic and antibacterial natural product, was synthesised for the first time. The key to construction of its spiro[bicyclo[3.2.1]octane&#8208;pyran] core was a two&#8208;step sequence involving hydrogenolytic debrominative olefin migration followed by a base&#8208;induced intramolecular aldol&#8208;type cyclisation.

B as a modifier was introduced to tune the oxidation state of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction with dilute NO3&#8722; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8722;N). The optimal Cu(B) exhibits a 100&#8201;% ammonia Faraday efficiency (FENH3) and a record&#8208;high yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, superior over the pristine Cu (FENH3=23&#8201;%, 12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1).







Abstract
Electrochemically converting NO3&#8722; into NH3 offers a promising route for water treatment. Nevertheless, electroreduction of dilute NO3&#8722; is still suffering from low activity and/or selectivity. Herein, B as a modifier was introduced to tune electronic states of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) with dilute NO3&#8722; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8722;N). Notably, a linear relationship was established by plotting NH3 yield vs. the oxidation state of Cu, indicating that the increase of Cu+ content leads to an enhanced NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion activity. Under a low NO3&#8722;&#8722;N concentration of 100&#8197;ppm, the optimal Cu(B) catalyst displays a 100&#8201;% NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion at &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, which is more than 25&#8197;times compared with the pristine Cu nanoparticles (12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1). This research provides an effective method for conversion of dilute NO3&#8722; to NH3, which has certain guiding significance for the efficient and green conversion of wastewater in the future.

         <title>Terminal Alkynes as One&#8208;Carbon Donors in [5+1] Heteroannulation: Synthesis of Pyridines via Ynimine Intermediates and Application in the Total Synthesis of Anibamine B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208; through pentasubstituted pyridines were synthesized in one operation from readily accessible &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters and terminal alkynes with complete regiochemical control and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. The first total synthesis of the indolizinium alkaloid anibamine B was accomplished featuring this novel pyridine synthesis as a key step.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] heteroannulation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oximes and their derivatives with alkynes has been developed into a powerful strategy for the synthesis of pyridines. It nevertheless lacks regioselectivity when unsymmetrically substituted alkynes are used. We report herein the unprecedented synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines by a formal [5+1] heteroannulation of two readily accessible building blocks. A copper&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters and terminal alkynes affords ynimines, which, without isolation, undergo an acid&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction involving ketenimine formation, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and aromatization to afford pyridines. Terminal alkynes served as a one&#8208;carbon donor to the pyridine core in this transformation. Di&#8208; through pentasubstituted pyridines are accessible with complete regioselectivity and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. The first total synthesis of anibamine B, an indolizinium alkaloid with potent antiplasmodial activity, was accomplished featuring this reaction as a key step.

         <title>Chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) Units Realizing Giant Birefringence with Transparency in the Near&#8208;Infrared for Optoelectronic Materials</title>

The chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) species are shown to be excellent birefringent &#8220;genes&#8221;. The metal polysulfide family is a rich birefringent crystal source, realizing birefringence as large as 0.58, and wide band gaps of approximately 2.0&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals are requisite optical devices in laser and modern opto&#8208;electronic fields. Development of excellent birefringent materials is still challenging. Herein, the linear or chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) species were theoretically proved to be the origin of the large birefringence, and could be regarded as birefringent genes. Besides, the metal polysulfide family was first proposed to be rich birefringent materials source, among which Cs2S6 realizes giant birefringence 0.58@1064&#8197;nm together with a wide band gap of 1.70&#8197;eV (based on the generalized gradient approximation). Moreover, the first dual&#8208;anion group polysulfide Na4Ba3(S2)4S3 was obtained, showing wide infrared transmission range (0.5&#8211;6.2&#8197;&#956;m), wide band gap (2.3&#8197;eV), and large birefringence (0.37 at 1064&#8197;nm). This work provides a new guiding thought for exploring large birefringence crystals in the future.

         <title>Electronic Transmission Channels Promoting Charge Separation of Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Controllable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An accelerated electronic transmission channel with electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; was designed in conjugated polymers. This channel was found to promote charge separation and photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) represent a promising platform for photocatalytic CO2 fixation owing to their suitable band structures that meet the requirements of the reduction potential of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels. However, the photocatalytic performance of CPs is rather restrained by the low charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we rationally designed three CPs with a more delocalized electronic transmission channel and planar molecular structure, which are regarded to evidently reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) and accelerate the internal charge transfer process. Besides, the assembly of suitable electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; and cocatalysts on the surface of CPs could effectively facilitate interfacial electron delivery. Accordingly, the optimal P&#8208;2CN exhibits an apparent quantum yield of 4.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm for photocatalytic CO2 to CO. Further adjusting the amounts of cyano groups and cocatalysts, the CO selectivity could be obtained in the range of 0&#8211;80.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional LDH films templating for controlled preparation and performance enhancement of polyamide nanofiltration membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailored design of high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes that can be used in a variety of applications such as water desalination, resource recovery, and sewage treatment is desirable. Herein, we describe the use of layered double hydroxides (LDH) intermediate layer to control the interfacial polymerization between trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and piperazine (PIP) for the preparation of polyamide (PA) membrane. The dense surface of LDH layer and its unique mass transfer behavior influence the diffusion of PIP, and the supporting role of the LDH layer allows the formation of ultrathin PA membranes. By only changing the concentration of PIP, a series of membranes with controllable thickness from 10 to 50 nm and tunable crosslinking&#8208;degree can be prepared. The membrane prepared with a higher concentration of PIP shows excellent performance for divalent salt retention with water permeance of 28 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1, high rejection of 95.1% for MgCl2 and 97.1% for Na2SO4. While the membrane obtained with a lower concentration of PIP can sieve dye molecules of different sizes with a flux of 70 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for the controllable preparation of high&#8208;performance&#160;membranes and provides new insights into how the intermediate layer affects the IP reaction and the final separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalently Grafting Graphene&#160;onto Si Photocathode to Expedite Aqueous Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon semiconductor functionalized with molecular catalysts emerges as a promising cathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the limited kinetics and stabilities remains a major hurdle for the development of such composites.&#160;We herein report&#160;an assembling strategy&#160;of silicon photocathodes via chemically grafting a conductive graphene layer onto the surface of n+&#8208;p Si followed by catalyst immobilization.&#160;The covalently&#8208;linked graphene layer effectively enhances the photogenerated carriers transfer between the cathode and the reduction catalyst, and improves the operating stability of the electrode.&#160;Strikingly, we demonstrate that altering the stacking&#160;configuration of the immobilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP)&#160;catalyst through calcination can further enhance the electron transfer rate and the PEC performance.&#160;At the end, the graphene&#8208;coated Si cathode immobilized with CoTPP catalyst managed to sustain a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent of &#8208;1.65 mA cm&#8208;2 over 16 h for CO production in water at a near neutral potential of &#8208;0.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode.&#160;This represents a remarkable improvement of PEC CO2RR performance in contrast to the reported photocathodes functionalized with molecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Origin of Viscosity of Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viscosity is an extremely important property for ion transport and wettability of electrolytes. Easy access to viscosity values and a deep understanding of this property remain challenging yet critical to evaluating the electrolyte performance and tailoring electrolyte recipes with targeted properties. We proposed a screened overlapping method to efficiently compute the viscosity of lithium battery electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulations. The origin of electrolyte viscosity was further comprehensively probed. The viscosity of solvents exhibits a positive correlation with the binding energy between molecules, indicating viscosity is directly correlated to intermolecular interactions. Salts in electrolytes enlarge the viscosity significantly with increasing concentrations while diluents serve as the viscosity reducer, which is attributed to the varied binding strength from cation&#8211;anion and cation&#8211;solvent associations. This work develops an accurate and efficient method for computing the electrolyte viscosity and affords deep insight into viscosity at the molecular level, which exhibits the huge potential to accelerate advanced electrolyte design for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;fueled Mechanical Motions with Dynamic Phosphorescence Induced by Topochemical [2+2] Reactions in Organoboron Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the quest for essential energy solutions towards an ecological friendly future, the efficient transformation of visible light/solar energy into mechanical motions in metal&#8208;free luminescent crystals offers a sustainable choice of smart materials for lightweight actuating, sensing, and all&#8208;organic electronic devices. Such green energy&#8208;triggered photodynamic motions with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in molecular crystals have not been reported yet. Here, we demonstrate three new stoichiometrically different Lewis acid&#8208;base molecular organoboron crystals (PS1, PS2, and PS3), which exhibit rapid photosalient effects (ballistic splitting, moving, and jumping) under both UV and visible light associated with quantitative single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) [2+2] cycloaddition of preorganized olefins. Furthermore, these systems respond to sunlight and mobile (white) flashlight with a complete SCSC transformation in a relatively slow fashion. Remarkably, all PS1, PS2, and PS3 crystals display visible light&#8208;promoted dynamic green RTP as their emission peaks promptly blue&#8208;shift, due to instantaneous photomechanical effects. Time&#8208;dependent structural mapping of intermediate photoproducts during fast SCSC [2+2] photoreaction, by X&#8208;ray photodiffraction, reveals a rationale for the origin of these photodynamic motions associated with rapid topochemical transformations. The reported light&#8208;driven behavior (mechanical motions, dynamic phosphorescence, and topochemical reactivity), is considered advantageous for the strategic design of stimuli&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;functional crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Circumcoronene is a highly symmetric polybenzenoid hydrocarbon that has fascinated organic chemists and materials scientists for decades. However, until recently, it had only been studied theoretically, because its synthesis in solution remained challenging. In a recent report, Wu and co&#8208;workers describe the first successful solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolation of crystalline circumcoronene derivatives, validating the long&#8208;predicted Clar structure. Their synthetic approach enables preparation of new polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons with multiple K&#8208;regions, which are difficult to obtain, and expands our understanding of the chemistry of these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Significant Two&#8208;Dimensional Structural Transformation in a Coordination Polymer that Changes Its Electronic and Protonic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D (2D: two&#8208;dimensional) structural transformation accompanying significant bond rearrangement and coordination environment change is demonstrated in a coordination polymer (CP) comprised of copper(II) ions and terephthalate (BDC2&#8211;) ligands for the first time. When immersed in water, a free&#8208;standing membrane of 2D Cu(BDC)(DMF) (Cu&#8208;1; DMF: N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide) transforms into 2D Cu(BDC)(H2O)2 (Cu&#8208;2) while maintaining its highly oriented layered structure. In the 2D sheet, paddlewheel&#8208;type Cu(II) dimers coordinated with four bidentate BDC ligands in a square&#8208;planar array in Cu&#8208;1 were released to form uniform aqua&#8208;bridged Cu(II) chains, which are cross&#8208;linked with each other by unidentate BDC ligands, in Cu&#8208;2. The present facile approach to implement the 2D&#8208;to&#8208;2D transformation accompanied by bond rearrangement, which is characteristic of CPs, leads to a marked increase in in&#8208;plane magnetic susceptibility and proton conductivity. In situ experiments in support of theoretical calculations unveiled the energy diagram that governs the unique structural transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Catalysis of CO2 into Valuable Products Activated by Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermo&#8208;catalysis of CO2 into high valuable products is an efficient and green method for mitigating global warming and other environmental problems, of which Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most promising heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 thermo&#8208;catalysis, and many excellent researches have been published. Hence, this review focuses on the valuable products obtained from various CO2 conversion reactions catalyzed by noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOFs, such as cyclic carbonates, oxazolidinones, carboxylic acids, N&#8208;phenylformamide, methanol, ethanol, and methane. We classified these published references according to the types of products, and analyzed the methods for improving the catalytic efficiency of MOFs in CO2 reaction. The advantages of using noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free MOF catalysts for CO2 conversion were also discussed along the text. This review concludes with future perspectives on the challenges to be addressed and potential research directions. We believe that this review will be helpful to readers and attract more scientists to join the topic of CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Macroscopic Assembly of Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Metal&#8208;free Supramolecular Glasses for Enhanced Color&#8208;tunable Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glassy materials, with desirable mechanical rigidity, shaping ability, high transparency, are attracting great interest in diverse fields. However, optically bulk molecule&#8208;based glasses are still rare, mainly due to limited monomeric species and harsh preparation conditions. Herein, we report a facile bottom&#8208;up solution fabrication process to obtain metal&#8208;free supramolecular glasses (SMGs) at the macroscopic scale using L&#8208;Histidine and hexamethylenetetramine as building blocks. The chiral SMGs possess color&#8208;tunable ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (decay lifetime up to 141.2 ms) and circular polarized luminescence (g factor up to 8.7 &#215; 10&#8211;3). The strong hydrogen bonds effectively drive the formation of SMGs, and provide a rigid microenvironment to boost triplet exciton generation. By virtue of excitation&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent ultralong phosphorescence of the SMGs, applications including multicolored displays, visual UV detection, and persistently luminescent thermometer are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Trinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activated alkyl halides have been extensively explored to generate alkyl radicals with Ru&#8208; and Ir&#8208; photocatalysts for 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes, but unactivated alkyl bromides remain challenging substrates due to their strong reduction potential. Here we report a three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction of alkenes, unactivated alkyl bromides and nucleophiles (e.g., amines and indoles) using a trinuclear gold catalyst [Au3(tppm)2](OTf)3. It can achieve the 1,2&#8208;aminoalkylation and 1,2&#8208;alkylarylation readily. This protocol has a broad reaction scope and excellent functional group compatibility (&gt;100 examples with up to 96% yield). It also affords a robust formal [2+2+1] cyclization strategy for the concise construction of pyrrolidine skeletons under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies support an inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer pathway for the successful cleavage of inert C&#8211;Br bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>The Formation of NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ Nanocrystals Studied by In Situ X&#8208;ray Scattering: Phase Transition and Size Focusing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals are a popular class of optical materials. They can be doped with optically active lanthanide ions and shaped into core&#8211;multi&#8208;shell geometries with controlled dopant distributions. Here, we follow the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals from &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles using in situ small&#8208;angle and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ex&#8208;situ electron microscopy. We observe an evolution from a monomodal particle size distribution to bimodal, and eventually back to monomodal. The final size distribution is narrower in absolute numbers than the initial distribution. These peculiar growth dynamics happen in large part before the &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#946; phase transformation. We propose that the splitting of the size distribution is caused by variations in the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles, potentially due to inter&#8208;particle differences in stoichiometry. Rate equation modeling confirms that a continuous distribution of reactivities can result in the observed particle growth dynamics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Mechanochemical approaches are widely used for the efficient, solvent&#8208;free synthesis of organic molecules, however their applicability to the synthesis of functional polymers has remained underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that mechanochemically triggered free&#8208;radical polymerization allows solvent&#8208; and initiator&#8208;free syntheses of structurally and morphologically well&#8208;defined complex functional macromolecular architectures, namely stimuli&#8208;responsive microgels. The developed mechanochemical polymerization approach is applicable to a variety of monomers and allows synthesizing microgels with tunable chemical structure, variable size, controlled number of crosslinks and reactive functional end&#8208;groups.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported a new electrophilic amination of various primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl, benzylic, allylic zinc and magnesium organometallics with O&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl hydroxylamines (O&#8208;TBHAs) in 52&#8208;99% yield. These O&#8208;TBHAs displayed an excellent long&#8208;term stability and were readily prepared from various highly functionalized secondary amines via a convenient 3 step procedure. The amination reactions showed remarkable chemoselectivity proceeding without any transition&#8208;metal catalyst and were usually complete after 1&#8208;3 h reaction time at 25 &#176;C. Furthermore, this electrophilic amination also provided access to enantioenriched tertiary amines (up to 88% ee) by using optically enriched secondary alkylmagnesium reagents of the type s&#8208;AlkylMgCH2SiMe3.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Torsional&#8208;cum&#8208;Steric Strains: A Pre&#8208;macrocyclization Strategy Enables Conformation&#8208;Specific Fullerene Binding in m&#8208;Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though the chemistry of resorcinarenes is half a century old, the conformationally&#8208;locked resorcinarene crowns are generally constructed using hydrogen bonds or covalent tethers. Often, covalent tethering involves extra post&#8208;macrocyclization steps involving upper&#8208;rim functionalities. We have leveraged the torsional&#8208;cum&#8208;steric strains through &#945;&#8208;substituents of the lower&#8208;rim C&#8208;alkyl chains and accomplished conformationally&#8208;rigid fluorescent m&#8208;cyclophane deep&#8208;crowns in a predetermined way. The strategy offers a pre&#8208;macrocyclization route conserving upper&#8208;rim functionalities, an aspect overlooked in resorcinarene chemistry. X&#8208;ray structural and computational analyses unveil the cause for conformational rigidity in&#160;m&#8208;cyclophanes due to &#945;&#8208;branching in C&#8208;alkyls (linear vs. &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;branched).&#160; The conformationally&#8208;locked fluorescent deep&#8208;crown with a preorganized cavity captures hydrophobic spherical guest C60 in both solution and solid states specifically, when compared to conformationally&#8208;dynamic boats, enabling conformation&#8208;specific binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones with Two Non&#8208;vicinal Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral heterocyclics with two or more carbon stereocenters are quite important in many fields. However, powerful strategies for the construction of such synthetically valuable heterocyclics, especially with two or more remote carbon stereocenters, have largely lagged behind. We report here a powerful method for the synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters from readily available chemical feedstocks under mild conditions. Both of the two diastereoisomers can be obtained with good to excellent enantioselectivities. Because the well&#8208;designed copper/PyBox catalytic system overrides the intrinsic stereoinduction of the close chirality center generated by the previous innocent radical addition step. Nevertheless, this work has the power to selectively provide only a single diastereoisomer of them by taking advantage of the epimerization effect and to synthesize all the four diastereoisomers with the pair of chiral ligands L2 and L2'&#160;that have opposite chirality. The obtained useful chiral &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones can be synthetically transformed into acyclic or cyclic molecules with two non&#8208;vicinal carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that this radical reaction follows a linear relationship and even can be well performed with a less loading amount of ligand compared to that of the copper catalyst.</dc:description>
