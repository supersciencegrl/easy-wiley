         <title>CRISPR&#8208;Cas Biochemistry and CRISPR&#8208;Based Molecular Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#8208;based nucleic acid testing has played a critical role in disease diagnostics, pathogen surveillance, and many more. However, this method requires a long turnaround time, expensive equipment, and trained personnel, limiting its widespread availability and diagnostic capacity. On the other hand, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has recently demonstrated capability for nucleic acid detection with high sensitivity and specificity. CRISPR&#8208;mediated biosensing holds great promise for revolutionizing nucleic acid testing procedures and developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics. This review focuses on recent developments in both fundamental CRISPR biochemistry and CRISPR&#8208;based nucleic acid detection techniques. Four ongoing research hotspots in molecular diagnostics&#8211;target preamplification&#8208;free detection, microRNA (miRNA) detection, non&#8208;nucleic&#8208;acid detection, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection&#8211;are also covered</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazo[1,2&#8208;B]indazoles: Straightforward Access to Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Polyaromatics from s&#8208;Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The straightforward access to a new class of aza&#8208;polyaromatics is reported. Starting from readily available fluorinated s&#8208;tetrazine, a cyclization process with azide leads to the formation of an unprecedented tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazole or a bis&#8208;tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazole (cis and trans). Based on the new nitrogen core, further N&#8208;directed palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C&#8211;H bond functionalization allows the introduction of halides or acetates. The physicochemical properties of these compounds were studied by a joint experimental/theoretical approach. The tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles display solid&#8208;state p&#8208;stacking, low reduction potential,absorption in the visible range up to the near&#8208;infrared and intense fluorescence, depending on the molecular structure.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Probing and Identification of Electrochemical Reaction Intermediates by Floating Electrolytic Electrospray Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;depth study of electrochemical (EC) synthesis can require a powerful mass spectrometry (MS) analytical platform which can discover and identify fleeting intermediates in EC reactions. Here we report a floating electrolytic electrospray ionization (FE&#8208;ESI) strategy that can perform EC process in a floating electrolytic cell and monitor intermediates by high&#8208;resolution MS. Compared with previous EC&#8208;MS methods, a significant advantage of FE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS is it allows one to modulate the electrolytic and electrospray process individually, ensuring its high sensitivity in discovering intermediate and universality to investigate redox reactions in different scenarios. This powerful platform had been successfully used to investigate EC reductive coupling of p&#8208;tolylboronic acid and p&#8208;nitrotoluene. A series of nitrene intermediates were discovered and identified by FE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, indicating a hidden mechanism involving nitrene formation might play key role in EC reductive coupling process.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Bridged Heterometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets Incorporating Four Lanthanoceniums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The syntheses and magnetic properties of organometallic heterometallic compounds [K(THF)6]{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (1&#8208;RE) and [K(Crypt)]2{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (2&#8208;RE) containing hexaazatrinaphthylene radicals (HAN &#183; 3&#8208;) and four rare earth (RE) ions are reported. 1&#8208;RE shows isolable species with ligand&#8208;based mixed valency as revealed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) thus leading to the isolation of 2&#8208;RE via one&#8208;electron chemical reduction. Strong electronic communication in mixed&#8208;valency supports stronger overall ferromagnetic behaviors in 2&#8208;RE than 1&#8208;RE containing Gd and Dy ions. Ac magnetic susceptibility data reveal 1&#8208;Dy and 2&#8208;Dy both exhibit slow magnetic relaxation. Importantly, larger coercive field was observed in the hysteresis of 2&#8208;Dy at 2.0 K, indicating the enhanced SMM behavior compared with 1&#8208;Dy. Ligand&#8208;based mixed&#8208;valency strategy has been used for the first time to improve the magnetic coupling in lanthanide (Ln) SMMs, thus opening up new ways to construct strongly coupled Ln&#8208;SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Switchable Selective Oxidations of Styrene Over Covalent Triazine Frameworks in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using photocatalytic oxidation to convert basic chemicals into high value compounds in environmentally benign reaction media is a current focus in catalytic research. The challenge lies at gaining controllability over product formation selectivity. Herein, we design covalent triazine frameworks as heterogeneous, metal&#8208;free and recyclable photocatalysts for visible light&#8208;driven switchable selective oxidation of styrene in pure water. The product formation selectivity was achieved by activation or deactivation of the specific photogenerated oxygen species. Using the same photocatalyst, by deactivation of photogenerated H2O2, benzaldehyde was obtained with over 99% conversion and over 99% selectivity as single product. The highly challenging and sensitive epoxidation reaction of styrene was carried out by creating peroxymonocarbonate as initial epoxidation agent in the presence of bicarbonate, which led to a formation of styrene oxide with a selectivity up to 76% with nearly quantitative conversion. This study demonstrates a preliminary yet interesting example for simple control over switchable product formation selectivity for challenging oxidation reactions of organic compounds in pure water.</dc:description>

         <title>A Transformable and Bulky Methacrylate Monomer That Enables the Synthesis of an MMA&#8208;nBA Alternating Copolymer: Sequence&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we designed a methacrylate molecule with an alkyl&#8208;substituted trichloro salicylic acid pendant as a transformable bulky monomer to enable the synthesis of an alternating copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and n&#8208;butyl acrylate (nBA). The adamantyl&#8208;substituted methacrylate monomer (1&#8208;Ad) showed very low homopolymerization propensity in radical polymerizations, but afforded the alternating copolymer with nBA via copolymerization. The 1&#8208;Ad units in the resultant copolymer were quantitatively and selectively transformed into MMA via transesterification with methanol to yield the alternating copolymer of MMA and nBA. Its alternating sequence was clearly demonstrated by a structural analysis via 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as the low reactivity ratios for the 1&#8208;Ad and nBA pair. Finally, we verified the superior self&#8208;healing ability of the alternating copolymer compared to that of the corresponding 1:1 statistical copolymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplification of Lipid Peroxidation by Regulating Cell Membrane Unsaturation to Enhance Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid peroxidation (LPO) is one of the most damaging processes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although it is well known that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are much more susceptible than saturated or monounsaturated ones to LPO, there is no study exploring the effect of cell membrane unsaturation degree on CDT. Here, we report a self&#8208;reinforcing CDT agent (denoted as OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs), consisting of oleanolic acid (OA)&#8208;loaded iron single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;SAC)&#8208;embedded hollow carbon nanosphere encapsulated by erythrocyte membrane (EM), which promotes LPO to improve chemodynamic efficacy via modulating the degree of membrane unsaturation. Upon uptake of OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs by cancer cells, Fe&#8208;SAC&#8208;catalyzed conversion of endogenous hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, in addition to initiating chemodynamic therapeutic process, causes the dissociation of EM shell and the ensuing release of OA that can enrich cellular membranes with PUFAs, enabling LPO amplification&#8208;enhanced CDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Boranes Paving the Way to Anionic Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>First examples of anionic cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs) that contain borane substituents have been synthesized. The nature of the borane substituents allows a modulation of the &#963;&#8208;donor or &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities compared to their neutral analogues. A B(CN)3&#8208;substituted Ani&#8208;cAAC has been generated and used in situ. The corresponding C2F5BF2&#8208;Ani&#8208;cAAC&#160;6&#160;was ob&#173;tain&#173;ed in high yield on a multi&#8208;gram scale. First reactions of these novel ligands with elemental sele&#173;nium and chloro(triphenylphosphine)gold(I) led to the ani&#173;onic selenium adducts&#160;7&#160;and&#160;8&#160;and the Ani&#8208;cAAC gold complex&#160;9. The properties of these compounds and data derived from theoretical calculations provide an insight into the electronic and steric properties of these novel anionic cAACs. Especially the ease of synthesis and the combination of properties such as negative charge, large buried volume, and good &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability renders Ani&#8208;cAACs unique and promising new building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronically Ambivalent Hydrodefluorination of Aryl&#8208;CF3 groups enabled by Electrochemical Deep&#8208;Reduction on a Ni Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Ar&#8208;CF2H moiety is featured in an increasing number of bioactive compounds due to its unique combination of properties. The hydrodefluorination of Ar&#8208;CF3 compounds is a direct and efficient route toward this motif. As reported methods for this transformation have focused on specific substrate families, herein we describe a general&#8212;electronically ambivalent&#8212;procedure for the single&#8208;step direct mono&#8208;hydrodefluorination of a variety of feedstock and functionalized Ar&#8208;CF3 compounds. Exploiting the inherent tunability of electrochemistry and the selectivity enabled by a Ni cathode, the deep reduction garners high selectivity for ArCF2H products, with good to excellent yields up to gram scale. The protocol has been extended to a single&#8208;step di&#8208;hydrodefluorination yielding benzyl fluorides. The late&#8208;stage peripheral editing of a single CF3 feedstock to construct fluoromethyl (CF2H, CFH2) moieties will aid the rapid diversification of lead&#8208;compounds and compound libraries.</dc:description>

         <title>Sr(Ag1&#8208;xLix)2Se2 and [Sr3Se2][(Ag1&#8208;xLix)2Se2] Tunable Direct Band Gap Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesizing solids in molten fluxes enables the rapid diffusion of soluble species at temperatures lower than in solid&#8208;state reactions, leading to crystal formation of kinetically stable compounds. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of mixed hydroxide and halide fluxes in synthesizing complex Sr/Ag/Se in mixed LiOH/LiCl. We have accessed a series of two&#8208;dimensional Sr(Ag1&#8208;xLix)2Se2 layered phases. With increased LiOH/LiCl ratio or reaction temperature, Li partially substituted Ag to form solid solutions of Sr(Ag1&#8208;xLix)2Se2 with x up to 0.45. In addition, a new type of intergrowth compound [Sr3Se2][(Ag1&#8208;xLix)2Se2] was synthesized upon further reaction of Sr(Ag1&#8208;xLix)2Se2 with SrSe. Both Sr(Ag1&#8208;xLix)2Se2 and [Sr3Se2][Ag2Se2] exhibit a direct band gap, which increases with increasing Li substitution (x). Therefore, the band gap of Sr(Ag1&#8208;xLix)2Se2 can be precisely tuned via fine&#8208;tuning x that is controlled by only the flux ratio and temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>A Covalent Organic Framework as a Long&#8208;life and High&#8208;Rate Anode Suitable for Both Aqueous Acidic and Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous rechargeable batteries are prospective candidates for large&#8208;scale grid energy storage. However, traditional anode materials applied lack acid&#8208;alkali co&#8208;tolerance. Herein, we report a covalent organic framework containing pyrazine (C=N) and phenylimino (&#8208;NH&#8208;) groups (HPP&#8208;COF) as a long&#8208;cycle and high&#8208;rate anode for both acidic and alkaline batteries. The HPP&#8208;COF's robust covalent linkage and the hydrogen bond network between &#8208;NH&#8208; and water molecules collectively improve the acid&#8208;alkaline co&#8208;tolerance. More importantly, the hydrogen bond network promotes the rapid transport of H+/OH&#8208; by the Grotthuss mechanisms. As a result, the HPP&#8208;COF delivers a superior capacity and cycle stability (66.6 mAh g&#8208;1@ 30 A g&#8208;1, over 40000 cycles in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte; 91.7 mAh g&#8722;1@ 100 A g&#8208;1, over 30000 cycles @ 30 A g&#8208;1 in 1 M NaOH electrolyte). The work opens a new direction for the structural design and application of COF materials in acidic and alkaline batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Perfluoroalkyl Selenoxides, Selenones and Selenoximines: General Preparation and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A selective access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides, via Oxone&#174; as oxidant or to selenones by using a Polyoxometalate&#8208;based Ionic Liquid (POM&#8208;IL) as a catalyst for the oxidation step is described. The reaction works with various perfluoralkyl chains and substituents with satisfactory to excellent yields. A two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction from selenocyanates was performed to gain access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides. The previously unknown perfluoroalkyl selenoximines family was also prepared with good yields. Having unlocked two strategies for the synthesis of fluoroalkylated Se(IV) and Se(VI) compounds, we then evaluated the Hansch&#8211;Leo lipophilicity parameters of these groups.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Guided Construction of Nanozymes for Determining H2O2 Produced by Sonication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities, termed as nanozymes, have found wide applications in various fields. It has been a long&#8208;term aim to rationally design and synthesize highly active nanozymes and thus to further improve their application performance. Guided by the nanoconfinement effect, we confine cytochrome c (Cyt c) within a mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), PCN&#8208;222 nanoparticle (NP), forming a protein/MOF hybrid nanozyme, termed as Cyt c@PCN&#8208;222 NP. The confined Cyt c exhibits around 3&#8211;4&#8208;fold higher peroxidase&#8208;like activity than free Cyt c. Due to the increase in the activity of Cyt c, the Cyt c@PCN&#8208;222 NPs exhibit a quite low limit of detection (~0.13 &#956;M) towards H2O2. Sonication&#8208;induced H2O2 formation in water by using a lab&#8208;quipped ultrasonic cleaner can be sensitively probed, which suggests that H2O2&#8208;sensitive materials should be carefully handled during the utilization of ultrasonic equipment.

It has been a long-term aim to rationally design and synthesize highly active nanozymes and thus to further improve their application performance. Guided by the nanoconfinement effect, we confine cytochrome c (Cyt c) within a mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), PCN-222 nanoparticle (NP), forming a protein/MOF hybrid nanozyme, termed as Cyt c@PCN-222 NP. The confined Cyt c exhibits around 3&#8211;4-fold higher peroxidase-like activity than free Cyt c. Due to the increase in the activity of Cyt c, the Cyt c@PCN-222 NPs exhibit a quite low limit of detection (~0.13 &#956;M) towards H2O2. Sonication-induced H2O2 formation in water by using a lab-quipped ultrasonic cleaner can be sensitively probed, which suggests that H2O2-sensitive materials should be carefully handled during the utilization of ultrasonic equipment. We speculate that this nanoconfinement strategy can broaden our synthetic methodology for the rational design of nanozymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Intramolecular para&#8208;Cycloadditions on Simple Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative cycloadditions are a powerful tool to access a large chemical space exploiting simple and ubiquitous building blocks. The energetic burden due to the loss of aromaticity has however greatly limited their synthetic potential. We devised a general intramolecular method that overcomes these limitations thanks to the photosensitation of allenamides. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted process gives complex [2.2.2]&#8208;(hetero)&#8208;bicyclooctadienes at room temperature, likely through the stabilization of transient (bi)radicals by naphthalene.

         <title>Discovery of a Unique Flavonoid Biosynthesis Mechanism in Fungi by Genome Mining</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavonoids are important plant natural products with variable structures and bioactivities. All known plant flavonoids are generated under the catalysis of type III PKS followed by chalcone isomerase (CHI) and flavone synthase (FNS). Here, the biosynthetic gene cluster of chlorflavonin, a fungal flavonoid with acetolactate synthase inhibitory activity, was discovered using a self&#8208;resistance&#8208;gene&#8208;directed strategy. A novel flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in fungi was revealed. Core enzyme NRPS&#8208;PKS is responsible for the generation of the key precursor chalcone. Then, a new type CHI catalyzes the conversion of chalcone to flavanone via a histidine&#8208;mediated Oxa&#8208;Michael addition mechanism. Finally, the desaturation of flavanone to flavone is catalyzed by a new type FNS, an FMN&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase. The unique biosynthesis mechanism of fungal flavonoids expands our understanding of flavonoid biosynthesis and provides new insight into synthetic biology research on plant flavonoids</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Novel Plasticizers by Direct Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Di&#8208; or Multi&#8208;carbonylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first di&#8208; and multi&#8208;carbonylations of olefins with di&#8208; or polyols provide a general and straightforward access to a variety of di&#8208; or multiesters with high efficiency and selectivity. Representative diesters show potential performance (Tg) as novel plasticizers.







Abstract
Diesters are of fundamental importance in the chemical industry and are used for many applications, e.g. as plasticizers, surfactants, emulsifiers, and lubricants. Herein, we present a straightforward and efficient method for the selective synthesis of diesters via palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct carbonylation of di&#8208; or polyols with readily available alkenes. Key&#8208;to&#8208;success is the use of a specific palladium catalyst with the &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8208;base&#8221; ligand L16 providing esterification of all alcohols and a high n/iso ratio. The synthesized diesters were evaluated as potential plasticizers in PVC films by measuring the glass transition temperature (Tg) via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

         <title>Unusual Changes of C&#8722;H Bond Lengths in Chiral Zinc Complexes Induced by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution neutron diffraction studies have been successfully performed on chiral complexes to observe C&#8722;H bond elongations and shortenings caused by three types of tetrel bonds (TBs) and a trifurcated improper hydrogen bond, respectively. This study helps to fundamentally understand uncommon and subtle C&#8722;H bond changes induced by weak interactions.







Abstract
In order to better understand the effect of non&#8208;covalent weak interactions on molecules, we have explored a variety of weak interactions, such as improper H&#8208;bonding (HB), tetrel bonds (TBs) and halogen bonds, in fluorinated chiral zinc complexes. High resolution neutron diffraction studies revealed a methylene carbon&#8208;hydrogen bond elongation and shortening due to TB and improper HB interactions, respectively. To show the accumulative effects of multiple weak interactions on the C&#8722;H bond, three types of tetrel bonds have been carefully examined. We have also shown how C&#8722;H bond elongation can be easily offset by forming an improper HB with the H atom from this C&#8722;H bond. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and electrostatic potential analysis investigations have been used to affirm the nature of the interactions based on density functional theory (DFT) and other related calculations.

         <title>Optical Spin Polarization of a Narrow&#8208;Linewidth Electron&#8208;Spin Qubit in a Chromophore/Stable&#8208;Radical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising approach to molecular qubits employs a photoexcited chromophore covalently linked to a deuterated stable radical (C&#8722;R&#8901;). Photoexcitation of the C within C&#8722;R&#8901; results in ultrafast intersystem crossing to produce the spin&#8208;polarized quartet state (Q) that decays to the spin&#8208;polarized ground state (D0). Both Q and D0 have narrow linewidths that allow facile addressability using microwave pulses.







Abstract
Photoexcited organic chromophores appended to stable radicals can serve as qubit and/or qudit candidates for quantum information applications. 1,6,7,12&#8208;Tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxy)&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4&#8201;:&#8201;9,10&#8208;bis(dicarboximide) (tpPDI) linked to a partially deuterated &#945;,&#947;&#8208;bisdiphenylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylallyl radical (BDPA&#8208;d16) was synthesized and characterized by time&#8208;resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Photoexcitation of tpPDI&#8208;BDPA&#8208;d16 results in ultrafast radical&#8208;enhanced intersystem crossing to produce a quartet state (Q) followed by formation of a spin&#8208;polarized doublet ground state (D0). Pulse&#8208;EPR experiments confirmed the spin multiplicity of Q and yielded coherence times of Tm=2.1&#177;0.1&#8197;&#956;s and 2.8&#177;0.2&#8197;&#956;s for Q and D0, respectively. BDPA&#8208;d16 eliminates the dominant 1H hyperfine couplings, resulting in a single narrow line for both the Q and D0 states, which enhances the spectral resolution needed for good qubit addressability.

         <title>Retina&#8208;Inspired Organic Photonic Synapses for Selective Detection of SWIR Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the color recognition function of the retina, an artificial photonic synapse, based on a novel narrow&#8208;band gap polymer P1 and PC71BM, with unprecedentedly selective response to short wavelength infrared (SWIR) light is reported, which realized letter imaging and memory with noise reduction function. This work has the potential to broaden the range of artificial visual systems and facilitate the coupling of neuromorphic computing with optical communication.







Abstract
Photonic synapses with the dual function of optical signal detection and information processing can simulate human visual system. However, photonic synapses with selective detection of short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light have never been reported, which can not only broaden the human vision region but also integrate neuromorphic computation and infrared optical communication. Here, organic photonic synapses based on a new donor&#8208;acceptor copolymer P1 are fabricated, which exhibit excellent synaptic characteristics with selective detection for SWIR and extremely low energy consumption (2.85&#8201;fJ). The working mechanism is rooted in energy level barriers and unbalanced charge transportation. Moreover, these photonic synapses demonstrate excellent performance in multi&#8208;signal logic editing, letter imaging and memory with noise reduction function. This contribution provides ideas of constructing selective&#8208;response synapses for artificial visual system and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Strong Coupling of Chiral Frenkel Exciton for Intense, Bisignate Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly coupled chiral Frenkel excitons yield intense circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an intrinsic dissymmetry factor in emission glum as high as 0.08, measured through thin films of cyanine J&#8208;aggregate bundles. The bisignate, highly correlated dissymmetry factors in absorption gabs and in emission glum reveal a small Davydov splitting of the excited states and the anti&#8208;Kasha nature of the chiral emission.







Abstract
We show that chiral Frenkel excitons yield intense circularly polarized luminescence with an intrinsic dissymmetry factor in emission glum as high as 0.08. This outstanding value is measured through thin films of cyanine J&#8208;aggregates that form twisted bundles. Our measurements, obtained by a Mueller polarization analysis, are artifact&#8208;free and reveal a quasi&#8208;perfect correlation between the dissymmetry factors in absorption, gabs, and in emission glum. We interpret the bisignate dissymmetry factors as the signature of a strong coupling between chiral Frenkel excitons longitudinally excited along the bundles. We further resolve by polarimetry analysis the split in energy between the excited states with a Davydov splitting as small as 28&#8197;meV. We finally show the anti&#8208;Kasha nature of the chiral emission bands with opposite optical chirality. These mirror&#8208;imaged emissive chiroptical features emerge from the structural rigidity of the bundles that preserves the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state chirality.

         <title>Controlled Construction of Heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)]4+ Cages: A Facile Approach for Site&#8208;Selective endo&#8208;Functionalization of Supramolecular Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented heteroleptic [Pd2 (LA)2 (LB) (LC)] supramolecular cages were selectively constructed by taking advantage of a pair of orthogonal steric control elements encoded in distinct ligands. This strategy allows the site&#8208;selective introduction of distinct endo&#8208;functionalities into the cavity of the heteroleptic cage.







Abstract
Construction of supramolecular structures with internal functionalities is a promising approach to build enzyme&#8208;like cavities. The endo&#8208;functionalized [Pd12L24] and [Pd2L4] coordination cages represent the most successful systems in this regard. However, these systems mainly contain one type of endo&#8208;moiety. We herein provide a solution for the controlled endo&#8208;functionalization of [Pd2L4] cages. Site&#8208;selective introduction of the endo&#8208;functional group was achieved through the formation of heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)] cages. Using two orthogonal steric control elements is the key for the selective formation of the hetero&#8208;assemblies. We demonstrated the construction of two hetero&#8208;cages with a single internal functional group as well as a hetero&#8208;cage with two distinct endohedral functionalities. The endo&#8208;functionalized hetero&#8208;cages bound sulfonate guests with fast&#8208;exchange dynamics. This strategy provides a new solution for the controlled endo&#8208;functionalization of supramolecular cavities.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of Dioxaphosphorane&#8208;Fused Diphosphacycles Exhibiting Unique Dynamic Fluorescence &#8220;On/Off&#8221; Properties</title>

Herein, we report a straightforward three&#8208;component synthesis of novel dioxaphosphorane&#8208;fused diphosphacycles with distinctive photophysical properties. Based on their unique structure and properties, a novel fluorescent switch for pH sensing was revealed by a dynamic ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing mechanism.







Abstract
Rigidly planar polycyclic phosphacycles featuring an internal dioxaphosphorane are promising photofunctional materials. However, the lack of efficient synthetic methods resulted in limited structural diversities which significantly hampered extensive study. Herein, we report a straightforward three&#8208;component synthesis of novel dioxaphosphorane&#8208;fused diphosphacycles with distinctive photophysical properties. Control experiments and theory calculations were performed to account for a plausible reaction mechanism. We also systematically investigated the structure&#8208;property relationships of these unprecedented platforms by combining experiments (X&#8208;ray analysis, optical and redox properties) and theoretical computations. Based on their unique structure and properties, a novel fluorescent switch for pH sensing was revealed by a dynamic ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing process.

         <title>Single&#8208;Shot Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Full&#8208;Length H2 Relaxin Disulfide Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insulin family proteins (e.g. H2 relaxin, insulin itself, and H3 relaxin) incorporating a pre&#8208;made diaminodiacid bridge (DADA) at A&#8208;B chain terminal disulfide can be very easily and rapidly synthesized by a single&#8208;shot automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis. These new insulin analogues exhibit almost identical structures and activities when compared to their natural counterparts.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of insulin superfamily proteins (ISPs) has recently been widely studied to develop next&#8208;generation drugs. Separate synthesis of multiple peptide fragments and tedious chain&#8208;to&#8208;chain folding are usually encountered in these studies, limiting accessibility to ISP derivatives. Here we report the finding that insulin superfamily proteins (e.g. H2 relaxin, insulin itself, and H3 relaxin) incorporating a pre&#8208;made diaminodiacid bridge at A&#8208;B chain terminal disulfide can be easily and rapidly synthesized by a single&#8208;shot automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis and expedient one&#8208;step folding. Our new H2 relaxin analogues exhibit almost identical structures and activities when compared to their natural counterparts.

&lt;p&gt;The insulin family proteins (e.g. H2 relaxin, insulin itself, and H3 relaxin) incorporating a pre-made diaminodiacid bridge (DADA) at A-B chain terminal disulfide can be very easily and rapidly synthesized by a single-shot automated solid-phase synthesis. These new insulin analogues exhibit almost identical structures and activities when compared to their natural counterparts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical synthesis of insulin superfamily proteins (ISPs) has recently been widely studied to develop next-generation drugs. Separate synthesis of multiple peptide fragments and tedious chain-to-chain folding are usually encountered in these studies, limiting accessibility to ISP derivatives. Here we report the finding that insulin superfamily proteins (e.g. H2 relaxin, insulin itself, and H3 relaxin) incorporating a pre-made diaminodiacid bridge at A-B chain terminal disulfide can be easily and rapidly synthesized by a single-shot automated solid-phase synthesis and expedient one-step folding. Our new H2 relaxin analogues exhibit almost identical structures and activities when compared to their natural counterparts. This new synthetic strategy will expediate production of new ISP analogues for pharmaceutical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable 3D Hexagonal Geometry of DNA Tensegrity Triangles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In DNA nanotechnology, the programmability of non&#8208;canonical interactions is a key area of exploration. Here, we present three methods for programming a non&#8208;canonical hexagonal arrangement of normally rhombohedral DNA tensegrity triangles. We also determine cross&#8208;talking and reconfiguration between hexagonal and rhombohedral DNA crystals. These methods allow for additional versatility and programmability of non&#8208;canonical 3D DNA constructs.







Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical interactions in DNA remain under&#8208;explored in DNA nanotechnology. Recently, many structures with non&#8208;canonical motifs have been discovered, notably a hexagonal arrangement of typically rhombohedral DNA tensegrity triangles that forms through non&#8208;canonical sticky end interactions. Here, we find a series of mechanisms to program a hexagonal arrangement using: the sticky end sequence; triangle edge torsional stress; and crystallization condition. We showcase cross&#8208;talking between Watson&#8211;Crick and non&#8208;canonical sticky ends in which the ratio between the two dictates segregation by crystal forms or combination into composite crystals. Finally, we develop a method for reconfiguring the long&#8208;range geometry of formed crystals from rhombohedral to hexagonal and vice versa. These data demonstrate fine control over non&#8208;canonical motifs and their topological self&#8208;assembly. This will vastly increase the programmability, functionality, and versatility of rationally designed DNA constructs.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 Cathode Catalysts for Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed ZnNC catalysts with Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 moieties have been synthesized, and the ZnNC&#8208;based anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell not only presents an ultrahigh peak power density of 1.63&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 but also a long&#8208;term durability with more than 100&#8197;h operations in H2&#8208;O2 system. Density functional calculation further reveals that the Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 structure is the origin of high activity of as&#8208;synthesized ZnNC catalyst.







Abstract
To achieve practical application of fuel cell, it is vital to develop highly efficient and durable Pt&#8208;free catalysts. Herein, we prepare atomically dispersed ZnNC catalysts with Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 moieties and abundant mesoporous structure. The ZnNC&#8208;based anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) presents an ultrahigh peak power density of 1.63 and 0.83&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;O2 and H2&#8208;air (CO2&#8208;free), and also exhibits long&#8208;term stability with more than 120 and 100&#8197;h for H2&#8208;air (CO2&#8208;free) and H2&#8208;O2, respectively. Density functional calculations further unveil that the Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 structure is the origin of high activity of as&#8208;synthesized ZnNC catalyst, while the Zn&#8208;Pyridinic&#8208;N4 moiety is inactive for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which successfully explain the puzzle why most Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;organic framework &#8208;derived ZnNC catalysts in previous reports did not present good ORR activity because of their Zn&#8208;Pyridinic&#8208;N4 moieties. This work offers a new route for speeding up development of AEMFCs.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Sulfoximines via Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective C&#8722;H Borylation: A Remarkable Sidearm Effect of Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational&#8208;designed chiral bidentate boryl ligand (CBL) with a bulky side arm was effective in iridium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;and enantioselective C&#8722;H borylation of N&#8208;silyl diaryl sulfoximines, affording a vast array of non&#8208;annulated chiral diaryl sulfoximines (39 examples) with high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;%). DFT calculations revealed that the side arm was critical to confer high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity by virtue of the steric effect.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation of prochiral sulfoximines for non&#8208;annulated products remains a formidable challenge. We herein report iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H borylation of N&#8208;silyl diaryl sulfoximines using a well&#8208;designed chiral bidentate boryl ligand with a bulky side arm. This method is capable of accommodating a broad range of substrates under mild reaction conditions, affording a vast array of chiral sulfoximines with high enantioselectivities. We also demonstrated the synthetic utility on a preparative&#8208;scale C&#8722;H borylation for diverse downstream transformations, including the synthesis of chiral version of bioactive molecules. Computational studies showed that the bulky side arm of the ligand confers high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity through steric effect.

         <title>Stable Operation of Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries in Air Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most of aqueous organic redox flow batteries were operated in an insert atmosphere because the reduced organic molecules in anolyte were sensitive to oxygen. We propose a strategy for it by using oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in catholyte to balance oxygen reduction reaction in anolyte. Just with a trace OER catalyst layer (Ni (OH)2) on the surface of current collector for catholyte, the flow cell shows excellent stability in air atmosphere.







Abstract
As a green route for large&#8208;scale energy storage, aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are attracting extensive attention. However, most of the reported AORFBs were operated in an inert atmosphere. Herein, we clarify this issue by using the reported AORFB (i.e., 3, 3&#8242;&#8208;(9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;methylbutanoicacid) (DPivOHAQ)||Ferrocyanide) as an example. We demonstrate that the dissolved O2 can oxidize the discharged DPivOHAQ in anolyte, leading to capacity&#8208;imbalance between anolyte and catholyte. Therefore, this cell shows continuous capacity fading when operated in an air atmosphere. We propose a simple strategy for this challenge, in which the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in catholyte is employed to balance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anolyte. When using the Ni(OH)2&#8208;modifed carbon felt (CF) as a current collector for catholyte, this cell shows an excellent stability in air atmosphere because the Ni(OH)2&#8208;induced OER capacity in catholyte exactly balances the ORR capacity in anolyte. Such O2&#8208;balance strategy facilitates AORFBs&#8217; practical application.

         <title>Cadmium&#8208;Doped and Pincer Ligand&#8208;Modified Gold Nanocluster for Catalytic KA2 Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2 (PNP)2 (SR)12 with an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two PNP pincer ligands and two Au2Cd (SR)6 staple motifs has been developed as an efficient catalyst for the KA2 reaction. The cooperation between the three parts of the gold nanocluster has been verified as contributing to its high activity.







Abstract
A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 (PNP=2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)pyridine, SR=4&#8208;MeOPhS) consisting of an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two Au2CdS6 staple motifs, and two PNP pincer ligands has been designed, synthesized and well characterized. This cadmium and PNP pincer ligand co&#8208;modified gold nanocluster showed high catalytic efficiency in the KA2 reaction, featuring high TON, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope as well as catalyst recyclability. Comparison of the catalytic performance between Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 and the structurally similar single cadmium (or PNP) modified gold nanoclusters demonstrates that the co&#8208;existence of the cadmium and PNP on the surface is crucial for the high catalytic activity of the gold nanocluster. This work would be enlightening for developing efficient catalysts for cascade reactions and discovering the catalytic potential of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations.

         <title>Identification of the Active Sites on Metallic MoO2&#8722;x Nano&#8208;Sea&#8208;Urchin for Atmospheric CO2 Photoreduction Under UV, Visible, and Near&#8208;Infrared Light Illumination</title>

         <dc:description>
Metallic vacancy&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin shows excellent light absorption property covering from UV to NIR light and exhibits greatly enhanced selective photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction on a dual active site (Mo&#8722;Vo&#8722;Mo).







Abstract
We report an oxygen vacancy (Vo)&#8208;rich metallic MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin with partially occupied band, which exhibits super CO2 (even directly from the air) photoreduction performance under UV, visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light illumination. The Vo&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin displays a CH4 evolution rate of 12.2 and 5.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under full spectrum and NIR light illumination in concentrated CO2, which is ca. 7&#8208; and 10&#8208;fold higher than the Vo&#8208;poor MoO2&#8722;x, respectively. More interestingly, the as&#8208;developed Vo&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin can even reduce CO2 directly from the air with a CO evolution rate of 6.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under NIR light illumination. Experiments together with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the oxygen vacancy in MoO2&#8722;x can facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation to generate *COOH as well as the subsequent protonation of *CO towards the formation of CH4 because of the formation of a highly stable Mo&#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo intermediate.

         <title>Design and Manipulation of a Minimalistic Hydrocarbon Nanocar on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design and construction of a minimalistic nanocar is described, featuring an anthracene chassis and four benzene derivatives as wheels. After sublimation and adsorption on an Au(111) surface, controlled and fast manipulation of a nanocar is shown along the surface using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope.







Abstract
Nanocars are carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;molecules with a precise design that facilitates their atomic&#8208;scale control on a surface. The rational design of these molecules is important in atomic and molecular&#8208;scale manipulation to advance the development of molecular machines, as well as for a better understanding of self&#8208;assembly, diffusion and desorption processes. Here, we introduce the molecular design and construction of a collection of minimalistic nanocars. They feature an anthracene chassis and four benzene derivatives as wheels. After sublimation and adsorption on an Au(111) surface, we show controlled and fast manipulation of the nanocars along the surface using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The mechanism behind the successful displacement is the induced dipole created over the nanocar by the STM tip. We utilized carbon monoxide functionalized tips both to avoid decomposition and accidentally picking the nanocars up during the manipulation. This strategy allowed thousands of maneuvers to successfully win the Nanocar Race II championship.

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with fast&#8208;charge capability and long lifespan could be applied in various sustainable energy storage systems, from personal devices to grid storage. Inspired by the disordered Rubik's cube, here, we report that the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept can lead to a very substantial improvement in the sodium storage properties of hexacyanoferrate (HCF). An example of HE&#8208;HCF has been synthesized as a proof of concept, which has achieved impressive cycling stability over 50&#8201;000&#8197;cycles and an outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability up to 75&#8197;C. Remarkable air stability and all&#8208;climate performance are observed. Its quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanism and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been measured and analyzed by multiple in situ techniques and density functional theory calculations. This strategy provides new insights into the development of advanced electrodes and provides the opportunity to tune electrochemical performance by tailoring the atomic composition.

         <title>Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalysis Manipulated Sulfur Speciation Pathway for High&#8208;Capacity and Stable Na&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis facilitates successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfides, whereas porous Fe2O3 core serves as the main reactor and accelerates long&#8208;chain Na2S8/Na2S6 to Na2S4 conversion and the redox&#8208;active Fe (CN)64&#8722;&#8208;doped polypyrrole shell functions as physical barrier and catalyzes confined short&#8208;chain Na2S4 reduction to final Na2S inside the nanopores.







Abstract
The sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics and the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway, leading to serious shuttling effect and high activation barrier associated with sulfur cathode. We describe here the use of core&#8211;shell structured composite matrixes containing abundant catalytic sites for nearly fully reversible cycling of sulfur cathodes for Na&#8208;S batteries. The bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis provide successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfides, whereas Fe2O3 accelerates Na2S8/Na2S6 to Na2S4 conversion and the redox&#8208;active Fe(CN)64&#8722;&#8208;doped polypyrrole shell catalyzes Na2S4 reduction to Na2S. The electrochemically reactive Na2S can be readily charged back to sulfur with minimal overpotential. Simultaneously, stable cycling of Na&#8208;S pouch cell with a high reversible capacity of 696&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is also demonstrated. The bidirectional confined tandem catalysis renders the manipulation of sulfur redox electrochemistry for practical Na&#8208;S cells.

         <title>A Telomerase&#8208;Assisted Strategy for Regeneration of DNA Nanomachines in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a smart DNA nanomachine that can perform regeneration operations via telomerase (TE)&#8208;aided track extension in living cells. By customizing apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) as the responsive module of the nanomachine, multiply augmented imaging of APE1 at the single&#8208;cell level could be implemented. By arranging the regenerative module, the nanomachine could provide the expression diversity of TE in different cell lines.







Abstract
DNA nanomachines have been engineered into diverse personalized devices for diagnostic imaging of biomarkers; however, the regeneration of DNA nanomachines in living cells remains challenging. Here, we report an ingenious DNA nanomachine that can implement telomerase (TE)&#8208;activated regeneration in living cells. Upon apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;responsive initiation of the nanomachine, the walker of the nanomachine moves along tracks regenerated by TE, generating multiply amplified signals through which APE1 can be imaged in situ. Additionally, augmentation of the signal due to the regeneration of the nanomachines could reveal differential expression of TE in different cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the use of biomarkers to assist in the regeneration of nanomachines in living cells. This study offers a new paradigm for the development of more applicable and efficient DNA nanomachines.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Containing Passivation Layer via Surface Chelation for Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface treatment of inorganic perovskite film by trifluoroacetamidine featuring chelation configuration and multiple fluorine atoms allows record power conversion efficiency of inorganic perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Minimizing surface defect is vital to further improve power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed a passivator trifluoroacetamidine (TFA) to suppress CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx film defects. The amidine group of TFA can strongly chelate onto the perovskite surface to suppress the iodide vacancy, strengthened by additional hydrogen bonds. Moreover, three fluorine atoms allow strong intermolecular connection via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus constructing a robust shield against moisture. The TFA&#8208;treated PSCs exhibit remarkably suppressed recombination, yielding the record PCEs of 21.35&#8201;% and 17.21&#8201;% for 0.09&#8197;cm2 and 1.0&#8197;cm2 device areas, both of which are the highest for all&#8208;inorganic PSCs so far. The device also achieves a PCE of 39.78&#8201;% under indoor illumination, the highest for all&#8208;inorganic indoor photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, TFA greatly improves device ambient stability by preserving 93&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 960&#8197;h.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Inspired Polymers with Metal&#8208;Site&#8208;Regulated Ordered Conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational regulation in poly(amino acid)s mediated by an exogenous ligand and metal ions. The polypeptides show controllable transitions between &#946;&#8208;sheet and &#945;&#8208;helix conformations as well as a conformation&#8208;driven vesicular expanding and shrinking phenomenon. Moreover, the metallopolymers self&#8208;assemble into ferritin&#8208;inspired nanovehicles for efficient brain delivery and long&#8208;lasting magnetic resonance imaging in vivo.







Abstract
Metal ions play critical roles in facilitating peptide folding and inducing conformational transitions, thereby impacting on the biological activity of many proteins. However, the effect of metal sites on the hierarchical structures of biopolymers is still poorly understood. Herein, inspired by metalloproteins, we report an order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational regulation in synthetic polymers mediated by a variety of metal ions. The copolymers are decorated with clinically available desferrioxamine (DFO) as an exogenous ligand template, which presents a geometric constraint toward peptide backbone via short&#8208;range hydrogen bonding interactions, thus dramatically altering the secondary conformations and self&#8208;assembly behaviors of polypeptides and allowing for a controllable &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix transition modulated by metal&#8211;ligand interactions. These metallopolymers could form ferritin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structures with high stability and membrane activity for efficient brain delivery across the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and long&#8208;lasting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo.

         <title>MOFs with Open Metal(III) Sites for the Environmental Capture of Polar Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimeric metaIII) carboxylate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) exhibit a preferential adsorption of polar volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over water through a direct binding of the VOC vapor on the open metal sites, paving the way for their utilization in indoor air quality control.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMS) interact strongly with a range of polar gases/vapors. However, under ambient conditions, their selective adsorption is generally impaired due to a high OMS affinity to water. This led previously to the privilege selection of hydrophobic MOFs for the selective capture/detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herein, we show that this paradigm is challenged by metal(III) polycarboxylates MOFs, bearing a high concentration of OMS, as MIL&#8208;100(Fe), enabling the selective capture of polar VOCs even in the presence of water. With experimental and computational tools, including single&#8208;component gravimetric and dynamic mixture adsorption measurements, in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory calculations we reveal that this adsorption mechanism involves a direct coordination of the VOC on the OMS, associated with an interaction energy that exceeds that of water. Hence, MOFs with OMS are demonstrated to be of interest for air purification purposes.

However, under ambient conditions, their selective adsorption is generally impaired due to a high OMS affinity to water. This led previously to the privilege selection of hydrophobic MOFs for the selective capture/detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herein, we show that this paradigm is challenged by metal(III) polycarboxylates MOFs, bearing a high concentration of OMS, as MIL-100(Fe), enabling the selective capture of polar VOCs even in the presence of water. With experimental and computational tools, including single-component gravimetric and dynamic mixture adsorption measurements, in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory calculations we reveal that this adsorption mechanism involves a direct coordination of the VOC on the OMS, associated with an interaction energy that exceeds that of water. Hence, MOFs with OMS are demonstrated to be of interest for air purification purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Co&#8208;Dissolved Isostructural Polyoxovanadates to Construct Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>

Dispersing nanosized [PtV9O28]7&#8722; clusters into a [V10O28]6&#8722; aqueous solution, the so&#8208;called co&#8208;dissolved strategy, ensures double separations resulting in the construction of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The SAC with Pt/O synergism can efficiently boost CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
We explored a co&#8208;dissolved strategy to embed mono&#8208;dispersed Pt center into V2O5 support via dissolving [PtV9O28]7&#8722; into [V10O28]6&#8722; aqueous solution. The uniform dispersion of [PtV9O28]7&#8722; in [V10O28]6&#8722; solution allows [PtV9O28]7&#8722; to be surrounded by [V10O28]6&#8722; clusters via a freeze&#8208;drying process. The V centers in both [PtV9O28]7&#8722; and [V10O28]6&#8722; were converted into V2O5 via a calcination process to stabilize Pt center. These double separations can effectively prevent the Pt center agglomeration during the high&#8208;temperature conversion process, and achieve 100&#8201;% utilization of Pt in [PtV9O28]7&#8722;. The resulting Pt&#8208;V2O5 single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts exhibit a CH4 yield of 247.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 25&#8197;times higher than that of Pt nanoparticle on the V2O5 support, which was accompanied by the lactic acid photooxidation to form pyruvic acid. Systematical investigations on this unambiguous structure demonstrate an important role of Pt&#8722;O atomic pair synergy for highly efficient CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Pore Geometry and Surface Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Anhydrous Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three robust and porous covalent organic frameworks with rare concave dodecagonal nanopores were designed and synthesized via a pore engineering approach. The fine&#8208;tailored and functionalized pored can anchor H3PO4 molecules to form abundant proton hopping sites, thus affording high proton conductivity at anhydrous conditions.







Abstract
Developing new materials for anhydrous proton conduction under high&#8208;temperature conditions is significant and challenging. Herein, we create a series of highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via a pore engineering approach. We simultaneously engineer the pore geometry (generating concave dodecagonal nanopores) and pore surface (installing multiple functional groups such as &#8722;C=N&#8722;, &#8722;OH, &#8722;N=N&#8722; and &#8722;CF3) to improve the utilization efficiency and host&#8211;guest interaction of proton carriers, hence benefiting the enhancement of anhydrous proton conduction. Upon loading with H3PO4, COFs can realize a proton conductivity of 2.33&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under anhydrous conditions, among the highest values of all COF materials. These materials demonstrate good stability and maintain high proton conductivity over a wide temperature range (80&#8211;160&#8201;&#176;C). This work paves a new way for designing COFs for anhydrous proton conduction applications, which shows great potential as high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membranes.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Near&#8208;Infrared Photoluminescence from Functionalized Lead&#8208;Free Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient thermally&#8208;activated delayed near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence has been achieved in lead&#8208;free CuInSe2&#8208;based nanocrystals surface&#8208;functionalized with tetracene ligands, prolonging the exciton lifetime to 60&#8197;&#956;s at room temperature. Such long&#8208;lived near&#8208;infrared emission may find an array of applications.







Abstract
As an analogue to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of organic molecules, thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) observed in molecule&#8208;functionalized semiconductor nanocrystals represents an exotic mechanism to harvest energy from dark molecular triplets and to obtain controllable, long&#8208;lived PL from nanocrystals. The reported TADPL systems have successfully covered the visible spectrum. However, TADF molecules already emit very efficiently in the visible, diminishing the technological impact of the less&#8208;efficient nanocrystal&#8208;molecule TADPL. Here we report bright, near&#8208;infrared TADPL in lead&#8208;free CuInSe2 nanocrystals functionalized with carboxylated tetracene ligands, which results from efficient triplet energy transfer from photoexcited nanocrystals to ligands, followed with thermally activated reverse energy transfer from ligand triplets back to nanocrystals. This strategy prolonged the nanocrystal exciton lifetime from 100&#8197;ns to 60&#8197;&#956;s at room temperature.

         <title>Designing Solid Electrolyte Interfaces towards Homogeneous Na Deposition: Theoretical Guidelines for Electrolyte Additives and Superior High&#8208;Rate Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) electrolyte additive is developed to accelerate Na ion diffusion through the solid electrolyte interphase layer and induce spherical Na deposition for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode due to the derived NaBr with high ionic conductivity. As enabled by the 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, the Na||Na3V2 (PO4)3 full cells exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
Metallic Na is a promising metal anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Nevertheless, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and uncontrollable Na dendrite growth lead to disastrous short circuit and poor cycle life. Through phase field and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, we first predict that the sodium bromide (NaBr) with the lowest Na ion diffusion energy barrier among sodium halogen compounds (NaX, X=F, Cl, Br, I) is the ideal SEI composition to induce the spherical Na deposition for suppressing dendrite growth. Then, 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) additive is introduced into the common fluoroethylene carbonate&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte (the corresponding SEI has high mechanical stability) to construct a desirable NaBr&#8208;rich stable SEI layer. When the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell utilizes the electrolyte with 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, an extraordinary capacity retention of 94&#8201;% is achieved after 2000&#8197;cycles at a high rate of 10&#8197;C. This study provides a design philosophy for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode and can be expanded to other metal anodes.

Then, 1,2-dibromobenzene (1,2-DBB) additive is introduced into the common fluoroethylene carbonate-based carbonate electrolyte (the corresponding SEI has high mechanical stability) to construct a desirable NaBr-rich stable SEI layer. When the Na||Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cell utilizes the electrolyte with 1,2-DBB additive, an extraordinary capacity retention of 94&#8201;% is achieved after 2000&#8197;cycles at a high rate of 10&#8197;C. This study provides a design philosophy for dendrite-free Na metal anode and can be expanded to other metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Positioning of Metal Ions to Stabilize Open Tin Sites in Beta Zeolite for Catalytic Conversion of Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal ions such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ were positioned within Sn&#8208;Beta zeolite to form adjacent bimetallic catalytically active sites with stable open Sn sites. The Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta catalyst selectively converts glucose to methyl lactate and methyl vinyl glycolate in methanol in high yields of 71.2&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Via hydrothermal synthesis of Sn&#8208;Al gels, mild dealumination and ion exchange, a bimetallic Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta catalyst was prepared which can convert glucose to methyl lactate (MLA) and methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) in methanol at yields of 71.2&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, respectively. Results from solid&#8208;state magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, spectroscopic analysis, probe&#8208;temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, and density functional theory calculations conclusively reveal that the openness of the Sn sites, such as by the formation of [(SiO)3&#8722;Sn&#8722;OH] entities, is governed by an adjacent metal cation such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+. This relies on the low structure&#8208;defective pore channel, provided by the current synthesis scheme, and the specific silica hydroxyl anchor point is associated with the incorporation of Sn for additional and precise metal ion localization. The presence of metal cations significantly improved the catalytic performance of Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta for glucose isomerization and conversion to MLA of sugar compared with Sn&#8208;Beta.

         <title>Increased Surface Density of States at the Fermi Level for Electron Transport Across Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductance of molecular junctions bridged in Pt&#8208; or Pd&#8208;adlayer modified Au electrodes was investigated. The conductance on bimetallic electrodes was found 2&#8211;30 fold higher than that on Au electrodes. This was attributed to the increase in the local density of states by partially&#8208;filled d shells of the adlayer.







Abstract
Fermi's golden rule, a remarkable concept for the transition probability involving continuous states, is applicable to the interfacial electron&#8208;transporting efficiency via correlation with the surface density of states (SDOS). Yet, this concept has not been reported to tailor single&#8208;molecule junctions where gold is an overwhelmingly popular electrode material due to its superior amenability in regenerating molecular junctions. At the Fermi level, however, the SDOS of gold is small due to its fully filled d&#8208;shell. To increase the electron&#8208;transport efficiency, herein, gold electrodes are modified by a monolayer of platinum or palladium that bears partially filled d&#8208;shells and exhibits significant SDOS at the Fermi energy. An increase by 2&#8211;30 fold is found for single&#8208;molecule conductance of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hexanes bridged via common headgroups. The improved junction conductance is attributed to the electrode self&#8208;energy which involves a stronger coupling with the molecule and a larger SDOS participated by d&#8208;electrons at the electrode&#8208;molecule interfaces.

         <title>Multilayered Ceramic Membrane with Ion Conducting Thin Layer Induced by Interface Reaction for Stable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the architectural structure of the rooted grasses in soil, an interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of ion&#8208;conducting thin layers rooted in multilayered ceramic membranes has been developed. This novel technique paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance multilayered ceramics with functional layers for various applications, from ceramic fuel cells and membrane reactors to gas sensors.







Abstract
Conventional methods for fabricating multilayered ceramic membranes with ion conducting dense thin layers are often cumbersome, costly, and limited by poor adhesion between layers. Inspired by the architectural structure of the rooted grasses in soil, here, we report an interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of Ce0.9Gd0.1O2&#8722;&#948; (CGO) thin layers rooted in the parent multilayered ceramic membranes by only one firing step. The CGO dense layers are very thin, and adhered strongly to the parent support layer, ensuring low ionic transport resistance and structural integrity of the multilayered membranes. When using as an oxygen permeable membrane for upgrading fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen, it shows very long durability in harsh conditions containing H2O, CH4, H2, CO2 and H2S. Furthermore, our approach is highly scalable and applicable to a wide variety of ion conducting thin layers, including Y0.08Zr0.92O2&#8722;&#948;, Ce0.9Sm0.1O2&#8722;&#948; and Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8722;&#948;.

         <title>Correlating Oxidation State and Surface Ligand Motifs with the Selectivity of CO2 Photoreduction to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface oxidation state of titanium oxynitride photocatalysts influences C2 product selectivity in CO2 photoreduction. The surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio and the surface oxidation state can be regulated and controlled through the concentration of nitrogen dopant and oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
The design for non&#8208;Cu&#8208;based catalysts with the function of producing C2+ products requires systematic knowledge of the intrinsic connection between the surface state as well as the catalytic activity and selectivity. In this work, photochemical in situ spectral surface characterization techniques combined with the first principle calculations (DFT) were applied to investigate the relationships between the composition of surface states, coordinated motifs, and catalytic selectivity of a titanium oxynitride catalyst. When the catalyst mediates CO2 photoreduction, C2 product selectivity is positively correlated with the surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio and the surface oxidation state is regulated and controlled by coordinated motifs of N&#8722;Ti&#8208;O/V[O], which can reduce the potential dimerization energy barriers of *CO&#8722;CO* and promote spontaneous formation of the subsequent *CO&#8722;CH2* intermediate. This phenomenon provides a new perspective for the design of heterogeneous catalysts for photoreduction of CO2 into useful products.

         <title>An All&#8208;Natural Wood&#8208;Inspired Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting surface nanocrystallization method was developed to make the surface&#8208;inert and weakly interacting wood particles better assemble to construct the aerogel. This bottom&#8208;up method allows the preparation of large&#8208;size composite aerogels. The wood&#8208;inspired oriented channel structure endows the obtained aerogel with superior thermal insulation properties to natural wood and most existing commercial sponges.







Abstract
The oriented pore structure of wood endows it with a variety of outstanding properties, among which the low thermal conductivity has attracted researchers to develop wood&#8208;like aerogels as excellent thermal insulation materials. However, the increasing demands of environmental protection have put forward new and strict requirements for the sustainability of aerogels. Here, we report an all&#8208;natural wood&#8208;inspired aerogel consisting of all&#8208;natural ingredients and develop a method to activate the surface&#8208;inert wood particles to construct the aerogel. The obtained wood&#8208;inspired aerogel has channel structure similar to that of natural wood, endowing it with superior thermal insulation properties to most existing commercial sponges. In addition, remarkable fire retardancy and complete biodegradability are integrated. With the above outstanding performances, this sustainable wood&#8208;inspired aerogel will be an ideal substitute for the existing commercial thermal insulation materials.

         <title>Photo&#8208;controllable Luminescence from Radicals Leading to Ratiometric Emission Switching via Dynamic Intermolecular Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;controllable luminescence from a new molecular radical system featuring photoinduced structural change and dynamic intermolecular coupling was achieved. Unprecedented ratiometric emission with a wide range of color changes was demonstrated. Luminescence&#8208;encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns with a &#8220;burn after reading&#8221; mode are demonstrated by employing the dynamic luminescent radical material.







Abstract
The development of photoinduced luminescent radicals with dynamic emission color is still challenging. Herein we report a novel molecular radical system (TBIQ) that shows photo&#8208;controllable luminescence, leading to a wide range of ratiometric color changes via light excitation. The conjugated skeleton of TBIQ is decorated with steric&#8208;demanding tertiary butyl groups that enable appropriate intermolecular interaction to make dynamic intermolecular coupling possible for controllable behaviors. We reveal that the helicenic pseudo&#8208;planar conformation of TBIQ experiences a planarization process after light excitation, leading to more compactly stacked supermolecules and thus generating radicals via intermolecular charge transfer. The photo&#8208;controllable luminescent radical system is employed for a high&#8208;level information encryption application. This study may offer unique insight into molecular dynamic motion for optical manufacturing and broaden the scope of smart&#8208;responsive materials for advanced applications.

         <title>Increasing Molecular Planarity through Donor/Side&#8208;Chain Engineering for Improved NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Imaging and NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Therapy under 1064&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a simple strategy based on molecular planarity to design a high&#8208;performance donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type conjugated small molecule with both intense NIR&#8208;II absorption and robust energy output. The resulting probe was used for 1064&#8197;nm laser&#8208;triggered NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging and dual&#8208;mode imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy in vivo.







Abstract
Developing conjugated small molecules (CSM) with intense NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) absorption for phototheranostic is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to a lack of reliable design guidelines. This study reports a high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II CSM for phototheranostic by tailoring molecular planarity. A series of CSM show bathochromic absorption extended to the NIR&#8208;II region upon the increasing thiophene number, but an excessive number of thiophene results in decreased NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8211;1400&#8197;nm) brightness and photothermal effects. Further introduction of terminal nonconjugated alkyl chain can enhance NIR&#8208;II absorption coefficient, NIR&#8208;IIa brightness, and photothermal effects. Mechanism studies ascribe this overall enhancement to molecular planarity stemming from the collective contribution of donor/side&#8208;chain engineering. This finding directs the design of NIR&#8208;II CSM by rational manipulating molecular planarity to perform 1064&#8197;nm mediated phototheranostic at high efficiency.

         <title>Ambient Electrosynthesis of Urea with Nitrate and Carbon Dioxide over Iron&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;based electrocatalyst was fabricated by a facile liquid&#8208;phase laser irradiation technique, exhibiting superior electrocatalytic activity toward urea synthesis with CO2 and NO3&#8722;. The superior performance is ascribed to the formed Fe(a)@C and Fe3O4 on CNTs as the dual active sites for facilitating the generation of *NH2 and *CO intermediates with lower energy barriers for urea formation.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts to generate key *NH2 and *CO intermediates is crucial for ambient urea electrosynthesis with nitrate (NO3&#8722;) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Here we report a liquid&#8208;phase laser irradiation method to fabricate symbiotic graphitic carbon encapsulated amorphous iron and iron oxide nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (Fe(a)@C&#8208;Fe3O4/CNTs). Fe(a)@C&#8208;Fe3O4/CNTs exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward urea synthesis using NO3&#8722; and CO2, affording a urea yield of 1341.3&#177;112.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 and a faradic efficiency of 16.5&#177;6.1&#8201;% at ambient conditions. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that the formed Fe(a)@C and Fe3O4 on CNTs provide dual active sites for the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8722; and CO2, thus generating key *NH2 and *CO intermediates with lower energy barriers for urea formation. This work would be helpful for design and development of high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts for ambient urea synthesis.

         <title>Stable Luminescent [Cu(NN)(PP)]+ Complexes Incorporating a &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Diphosphane Ligand with Metal&#8208;Confining Properties</title>

An unprecedented Smiles&#8208;like rearrangement of diphenyl&#8208;(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane gives access to a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane that forms stable heteroleptic [Cu (NN) (PP)]+ complexes. Unfavorable flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state as a result of diimine encapsulation (bpy, phen, or mmp) is responsible for the enhanced luminescent properties.







Abstract
A &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane with metal&#8208;confining properties was efficiently synthesized thanks to an unprecedented Smiles&#8208;like rearrangement of diphenyl&#8208;(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane in the presence of excess n&#8208;BuLi. The cis&#8208;chelating bidentate ligand is capable of forming very stable heteroleptic [Cu(NN)(PP)]+ complexes in which a metal&#8208;bound diimine ligand (bpy, phen, or mmp) is located within the cyclodextrin cavity. As a result of ligand encapsulation, flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state is disfavored, thereby resulting in enhanced luminescent properties.

&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented Smiles-like rearrangement of diphenyl-(2-phosphanylphenyl)phosphane gives access to a &#946;-cyclodextrin-based diphosphane that forms stable heteroleptic [Cu (NN) (PP)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. Unfavorable flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state as a result of diimine encapsulation (bpy, phen, or mmp) is responsible for the enhanced luminescent properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#946;-cyclodextrin-based diphosphane with metal-confining properties was efficiently synthesized thanks to an unprecedented Smiles-like rearrangement of diphenyl-(2-phosphanylphenyl)phosphane in the presence of excess &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-BuLi. The &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-chelating bidentate ligand is capable of forming very stable heteroleptic [Cu(NN)(PP)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes in which a metal-bound diimine ligand (bpy, phen, or mmp) is located within the cyclodextrin cavity. As a result of ligand encapsulation, flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state is disfavored, thereby resulting in enhanced luminescent properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Morphology Optimization of the Photoactive Layer through Crystallinity and Miscibility Regulation for High&#8208;performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design principle of the third component is established to tackle the issue of excessive self&#8208;aggregation of Y6&#8208;derivatives during the film formation through crystallinity and miscibility regulation. With the addition of BTP&#8208;Th, the ternary device yielded a remarkable efficiency of 18.53&#8201;%, which is a significant improvement with regard to the efficiency of 17.22&#8201;% for the control reference binary device.







Abstract
On the premise of strongly crystalline materials involved, it is a challenge to control the phase separation of bulk&#8208;heterojunction donor/acceptor active layer to fabricate high&#8208;performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we develop a molecular design strategy of the third component to synthesize three guest materials (namely BTPT, BTP&#8208;Th, and BTP&#8208;2Th) to address this issue. We investigate and reveal the effect of crystallinity and miscibility of the third component in controlling the phase separation of Y6&#8208;derivatives&#8208;based blend film. As a result, a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.53&#8201;% is obtained in the ternary PSC based on PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6 with BTP&#8208;Th as the third component, which is a significant improvement with regard to the efficiency of 17.22&#8201;% for the control binary device. Our study offers a molecular design strategy to develop a third component for building ternary PSCs in terms of crystallinity and miscibility regulation.

         <title>Water&#8208;Harvesting Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Gigantic Al24 Units and their Deconstruction into Molecular Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;linkage strategy to make single crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) gives porous solids with gigantic Al24 units. Selective linkage replacement rigidifies the MOFs resulting in outstanding water&#8208;harvesting behaviour. The selective linkage dissociation of the MOF provides a new route to prepare highly symmetrical clusters.







Abstract
In contrast to the vast Al&#8208;oxo molecular cluster chemistry, Al&#8208;based building units for metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) construction are limited in structural diversity and complexity. Synthesis of single crystalline MOFs based on this &#8220;hard&#8221; metal is further complicated by the poor reversibility of the Al&#8208;organic coordination linkages. Here, a strategy to employ two kinds of linkages with distinct strength&#8212;strong Al&#8208;carboxylate linkage and weak Cu&#8208;pyrazol N linkage&#8212;gives FDM&#8208;91 (FDM=Fudan Materials) with gigantic Al24&#8208;based units. After replacing the weak moieties with organic linkers post&#8208;synthetically, two new stable MOFs with exceptional water harvesting capacity (up to 0.53&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cycling performance are developed. Linkage&#8208;selective dissociation of FDM&#8208;91 further leads to the isolation of the Al24 molecular clusters. The versatile chemistry performed here to reinforce or deconstruct MOFs provides a new way to make important extended and discrete structures.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Vinylphosphonates and Diarylvinylphosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first efficient Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of terminal olefins using H2 was developed, affording chiral ethylphosphine products with up to 99&#8201;% yield, 96&#8201;% ee and 1000&#8197;S/C (substrate/catalyst). The calculation and experimental mechanism study indicate that the two added hydrogen atoms of the product originate from H2 and the reaction proceeds through a NiII rather than Ni0 cyclic process.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted ethylphosphonate and ethylphosphine oxide compounds are widely used in drugs, pesticides, and ligands. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis is still rare. Of the only asymmetric hydrogenation methods available at present, all cases use rare metal catalysts. Herein, we report an efficient earth&#8208;abundant transition&#8208;metal nickel catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation affording the corresponding chiral ethylphosphine products with up to 99&#8201;% yield, 96&#8201;% ee (enantiomeric excess) (99&#8201;% ee, after recrystallization) and 1000&#8197;S/C (substrate/catalyst); this is also the first study on the asymmetric hydrogenation of terminal olefins using a nickel catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere. The catalytic mechanism was investigated via deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and calculations which indicate that the two added hydrogen atoms of the products come from hydrogen gas. Additionally, it is believed that the reaction involves a NiII rather than Ni0 cyclic process based on the weak attractive interactions between the Ni catalyst and terminal olefin substrate.

         <title>Shortwave Infrared Fluorofluorophores for Multicolor In Vivo Imaging
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorofluorophores (fluoro refers to fluorine and fluorescence) are chemical tools to study perfluorocarbons. To understand the biodistribution of perfluorocarbons in animals, fluorofluorophores that emit past 1000&#8197;nm are necessary. Here we describe the synthesis, characterization, and application of shortwave infrared (SWIR)&#8208;emissive fluorofluorophores towards understanding how to control the pharmacokinetics of perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions in mammals.







Abstract
Developing chemical tools to detect and influence biological processes is a cornerstone of chemical biology. Here we combine two tools which rely on orthogonality&#8211; perfluorocarbons and multiplexed shortwave infrared (SWIR) fluorescence imaging&#8211; to visualize nanoemulsions in real time in living mice. Drawing inspiration from fluorous and SWIR fluorophore development, we prepared two SWIR&#8208;emissive, fluorous&#8208;soluble chromenylium polymethine dyes. These are the most red&#8208;shifted fluorous fluorophores&#8211; &#8220;fluorofluorophores&#8221;&#8212;to date. After characterizing the dyes, their utility was demonstrated by tracking perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion biodistribution in vivo. Using an excitation&#8208;multiplexed approach to image two variables simultaneously, we gained insight into the importance of size and surfactant identity on biodistribution.

         <title>C3&#8208;Cyanation of Pyridines: Constraints on Electrophiles and Determinants of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;selective cyanation of pyridines was accomplished by a tandem process of borane&#8208;catalyzed pyridine hydroboration, substitution of the resulting dihydropyridine with a cyano electrophile, and finally oxidative aromatization. This method was suitable for use in late&#8208;stage cyanation of pyridine drugs.







Abstract
Methods for C&#8722;H cyanation of pyridines are rare. Here, we report a method for C3&#8208;selective cyanation of pyridines by a tandem process with the reaction of an in situ generated dihydropyridine with a cyano electrophile as the key step. The method is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of pyridine drugs. The low reduction potential of the electrophile and effective transfer of the nitrile group were found to be essential for the success of this method. We studied the reaction mechanism in detail by means of control experiments and theoretical calculations and found that a combination of electronic and steric factors determined the regioselectivity of reactions involving C2&#8208;substituted pyridines.

         <title>Evidence of Sulfur Non&#8208;Innocence in [CoII(dithiacyclam)]2+&#8208;Mediated Catalytic Oxygen Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison of the abilities of two CoII complexes bearing N4 and S2N2 ligations to mediate 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2&#8201;H+ O2 reduction to H2O2 reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the reactive intermediates point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
In many metalloenzymes, sulfur&#8208;containing ligands participate in catalytic processes, mainly via the involvement in electron transfer reactions. In a biomimetic approach, we now demonstrate the implication of S&#8208;ligation in cobalt mediated oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). A comparative study between the catalytic ORR capabilities of the four&#8208;nitrogen bound [Co(cyclam)]2+ (1; cyclam=1,5,8,11&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) and the S&#8208;containing analog [Co(S2N2&#8208;cyclam)]2+ (2; S2N2&#8208;cyclam=1,8&#8208;dithia&#8208;5,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the intermediates formed upon dioxygen activation at the CoII centers in 1 and 2 point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic ORR capabilities of 2.

         <title>Electronic Perturbation of Copper Single&#8208;Atom CO2 Reduction Catalysts in a Molecular Way</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise electronic perturbation of Cu single&#8208;atoms is achieved on graphdiyne derivates with electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating groups (&#8722;F, &#8722;H, &#8722;OMe), rendering distinctive Cu&#948;+ valance and electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity. In situ spectroscopical and theoretical studies reveal that the positive Cu&#948;+ centers adjusted by the &#8722;F group decrease the pKa of adsorbed H2O, promoting the hydrogenation of intermediates toward a high CH4 production.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) plays a crucial role in harnessing their catalytic activities, yet challenges remain at a molecular scale in a controlled fashion. By tailoring the structure of graphdiyne (GDY) with electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating groups, we show herein the electronic perturbation of Cu single&#8208;atom CO2 reduction catalysts in a molecular way. The elaborately introduced functional groups (&#8722;F, &#8722;H and &#8722;OMe) can regulate the valance state of Cu&#948;+, which is found to be directly scaled with the selectivity of the electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. An optimum CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 72.3&#8201;% was achieved over the Cu SAC on the F&#8208;substituted GDY. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that the positive Cu&#948;+ centers adjusted by the electron&#8208;withdrawing group decrease the pKa of adsorbed H2O, promoting the hydrogenation of intermediates toward the CH4 production. Our strategy paves the way for precise electronic perturbation of SACs toward efficient electrocatalysis.

         <title>Amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanosheets@Crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanorods for High Current&#8208;density Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step strategy. The catalysts display efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER, as well as for water splitting in neutral solution. The amorphous structure abundant unsaturated sites altered the local electronic structure of metallic sites and optimized the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (O* to OOH*).







Abstract
It is vitally important to develop highly active, robust and low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in neutral solution especially at large current density. In this work, amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheets@crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorods (Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5) was synthesized using a facil one&#8208;step strategy. In phosphate buffer saline solution, the Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 shows tiny overpotentials of 48 and 209&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 238 and 514&#8197;mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 delivers excellent stability for at least 300&#8197;h without obvious degradation. Theoretical calculations revealed that the Ni sites in the defect&#8208;rich amorphous structure of Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 owns higher electron state density and strengthened the binding energy of H2O, which will optimize H adsorption/desorption energy barriers and reduce the adsorption energy of OER determining step.

         <dc:description>
A new family of highly unusual terpenoids (persicamidines&#8197;A&#8211;E) was isolated. Extensive NMR analysis unraveled a hexacyclic terpenoid with a modified sugar and a highly unusual isourea moiety. Persicamidines showed potent antiviral activity. Each displayed single&#8208;digit nanomolar activity against hCoV&#8208;229E, comparable to that of remdesivir. Particularly Persicamidine&#8197;C was a very potent inhibitor of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, with an IC50 value of 74&#8197;nM.







Abstract
A new family of highly unusual sesquarterpenoids (persicamidines&#8197;A&#8211;E) exhibiting significant antiviral activity was isolated from a newly discovered actinobacterial strain, Kibdelosporangium persicum sp. nov., collected from a hot desert in Iran. Extensive NMR analysis unraveled a hexacyclic terpenoid molecule with a modified sugar moiety on one side and a highly unusual isourea moiety fused to the terpenoid structure. The structures of the five analogues differed only in the aminoalkyl side chain attached to the isourea moiety. Persicamidines&#8197;A&#8211;E showed potent activity against hCoV&#8208;229E and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viruses in the nanomolar range together with very good selectivity indices, making persicamidines promising as starting points for drug development.

Encapsulation makes the difference!. A&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane ligand with metal&#8208;confining properties is key in the stabilization of heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes. In their Research Article (e202214638), Nicola Armaroli, B&#233;atrice Delavaux&#8208;Nicot, Jean&#8208;Fran&#231;ois Nierengarten, Dominique Armspach et&#8197;al. show how encapsulation of the metal&#8208;bound diimine ligand moiety in the cyclodextrin cavity influences their electronic properties. In particular, flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state is largely prevented, which results in enhanced luminescent properties.

Multilayered ceramic membranes with ion&#8208;conducting dense thin layers are essential platforms for solid&#8208;state electrochemical devices, gas separation membranes, and sensors. In their Research Article (e202210485), Heqing Jiang et&#8197;al. develop a new interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of zirconia&#8208; or ceria&#8208;based dense thin layers rooted in multilayered ceramic membranes that show robust and practical performance for upgrading fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen.

         <title>Biological Effects of Black Phosphorus Nanomaterials on Mammalian Cells and Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of black phosphorus nanomaterials (BPNMs) on biological systems and human health is of significant concern as a result of their increased usage. The mechanisms and regulation factors of BPNMs&#8217; endogenous toxicity to mammalian systems are reviewed at the levels of body, tissues, cells, organelles, and molecules. A rule&#8208;based machine learning model reveals that experimental methods, lateral size, and incubation time are determinants for their cell viability.







Abstract
The remarkable progress of applied black phosphorus nanomaterials (BPNMs) is attributed to BP's outstanding properties. Due to its potential for applications, environmental release and subsequent human exposure are virtually inevitable. Therefore, how BPNMs impact biological systems and human health needs to be considered. In this comprehensive Minireview, the most recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms and regulation factors of BPNMs&#8217; endogenous toxicity to mammalian systems are presented. These achievements lay the groundwork for an understanding of its biological effects, aimed towards establishing regulatory principles to minimize the adverse health impacts.

         <title>Exploring Helical Peptides and Foldamers for the Design of Metal Helix Frameworks: Current Trends and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress of metal peptide frameworks (MPFs) comprised of helical peptides and foldamers for future energy storage, chiral recognition, and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Flexible and biocompatible metal peptide frameworks (MPFs) derived from short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been explored for the storage of greenhouse gases, molecular recognition, and chiral transformations. In addition to short flexible peptides, peptides with specifically folded conformations have recently been utilized to fabricate a variety of metal helix frameworks (MHFs). The secondary structures of the peptides govern the structure&#8208;assembly relationship and thereby control the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#8208;MHFs. Particularly, the hierarchical structural organization of peptide&#8208;based MHFs has not yet been discussed in detail. Here, we describe the recent progress of metal&#8208;driven folded peptide assembly to construct 3D porous structures for use in future energy storage, chiral recognition, and biomedical applications, which could be envisioned as an alternative to the conventional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs).

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Multicolour Luminescence of Organic Materials: Internal Mechanism and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to Kasha's rule for luminescent materials, the emitting electronic level of a given multiplicity is the lowest excited level of that multiplicity. A characteristic exception, excitation&#8208;dependent multicolour emission, is presented systemically, with the aim of enriching fundamental photophysics and potential applications. This Minireview will serve as a timely summary of the scattered reports of multicolour phenomena and their underlying mechanisms.







Abstract
Excitation&#8208;dependent emission (Ex&#8208;de) materials have been of considerable academic interest and have potential applications in real life. Such multicolour luminescence is a characteristic exception to the ubiquitously accepted Kasha's rule. This phenomenon has been increasingly presented in some studies on different luminescence systems; however, a systematic overview of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is currently absent. Herein, we resolve this issue by classifying multicolour luminescence from single chromophores and dual/ternary chromophores, as well as multiple emitting species. The underlying processes are described based on electronic and/or geometrical conditions under which the phenomenon occurs. Before we present it in categories, related photophysical and photochemical foundations are introduced. This systematic overview will provide a clear approach to designing multicolour luminescence materials for special applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent modification of graphene supported on a surface makes it possible to control the graphene reactivity, tailor its electronic properties, and immobilize active molecules. Based on a critical comparison of the different chemical routes, this Review provides up&#8208;to&#8208;date guidelines for working with chemically modified 2D materials on a surface.







Abstract
In the last decade, the use of graphene supported on solid surfaces has broadened its scope and applications, and graphene has acquire a promising role as a major component of high&#8208;performance electronic devices. In this context, the chemical modification of graphene has become essential. In particular, covalent modification offers key benefits, including controllability, stability, and the facility to be integrated into manufacturing operations. In this Review, we critically comment on the latest advances in the covalent modification of supported graphene on substrates. We analyze the different chemical modifications with special attention to radical reactions. In this context, we review the latest achievements in reactivity control, tailoring electronic properties, and introducing active functionalities. Finally, we extended our analysis to other emerging 2D materials supported on surfaces, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides, and elemental analogs of graphene.

         <title>sn&#8208;1 Specificity of Lysophosphatidylcholine Acyltransferase&#8208;1 Revealed by a Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isomer&#8208;resolving mass spectrometry assay reveals that lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase&#8208;1 (LPCAT1) has an sn&#8208;1 specificity when catalyzing the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines (PCs). The specific link between PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 and the activity of LPCAT1 enables visualization of the boundaries between cancerous and normal regions in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue via desorption electrospray ionization (DESI).







Abstract
Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase&#8208;1 (LPCAT1) plays a critical role in the remodeling of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in cellular lipidome. However, evidence is scarce regarding its sn&#8208;selectivity, viz. the preference of assembling acyl&#8208;Coenzyme&#8197;A (CoA) at the C1 or C2&#8208;hydroxyl on a glycerol backbone because of difficulty to quantify the thus&#8208;formed PC sn&#8208;isomers. We have established a multiplexed assay to measure both sn&#8208; and acyl&#8208;chain selectivity of LPCAT1 toward a mixture of acyl&#8208;CoAs by integrating isomer&#8208;resolving tandem mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal that LPCAT1 shows exclusive sn&#8208;1 specificity regardless of the identity of acyl&#8208;CoAs. We further confirm that elevated PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 relative to its sn&#8208;isomer results from an increased expression of LPCAT1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue as compared to normal liver tissue. MS imaging via desorption electrospray ionization of PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 thus enables visualization of HCC margins in human liver tissue at a molecular level.

&lt;p&gt;An isomer-resolving mass spectrometry assay reveals that lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-1 (LPCAT1) has an &lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-1 specificity when catalyzing the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines (PCs). The specific link between PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 and the activity of LPCAT1 enables visualization of the boundaries between cancerous and normal regions in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue via desorption electrospray ionization (DESI).

         <title>Direct Visualization of Nanoconfinement Effect on Nanoreactor via Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence microscopy based on Ru@MSN realizes direct observation of nanoconfinement during electrochemical process which can bridges mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications. Long time decay and recover ability caused by nanoarchitecture are resolved. The nanoconfinement effects are stable even in complex biological conditions, offering excellent route for single biomolecule imaging.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement in mesoporous nanoarchitectures could dramatically change molecular transport and reaction kinetics during electrochemical process. A molecular&#8208;level understanding of nanoconfinement and mass transport is critical for the applications, but a proper route to study it is lacking. Herein, we develop a single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence (SNECL) microscopy based on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle to directly visualize in situ nanoconfinement&#8208;enhanced electrochemical reactions at the single molecule level. Meanwhile, mass transport capability of single nanoreactor, reflected as long decay time and recovery ability, is monitored and simulated with a high spatial resolution. The nanoconfinement effects in our system also enable imaging single proteins on cellular membrane. Our SNECL approach may pave the way to decipher the nanoconfinement effects during electrochemical process, and build bridges between mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications.

         <title>A Type 1 Aldolase, NahE, Catalyzes a Stereoselective Nitro&#8208;Michael Reaction: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective Michael addition of pyruvate to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes catalyzed by NahE, a type 1 aldolase, is reported. &#946;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric acids can be isolated after oxidative decarboxylation in high yields on a preparative scale, providing access to precursors of &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogues of demonstrated pharmacological activity.







Abstract
Michael addition reactions are highly useful in organic synthesis and are commonly accomplished using organocatalysts. However, the corresponding biocatalytic Michael additions are rare, typically lack synthetically useful substrate scope, and suffer from low stereoselectivity. Herein we report a biocatalytic nitro&#8208;Michael addition, catalyzed by NahE, that proceeds with low catalyst loading at room temperature in moderate to excellent enantioselectivity and high yields. A series of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes reacted with pyruvate in the presence of NahE to give, after oxidative decarboxylation, &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric acids in up to 99&#8201;% yield without need for chromatography, providing a simple preparative&#8208;scale route to chiral GABA analogues. This reaction represents the first example of an aldolase displaying promiscuous Michaelase activity and opens the use of nitroalkenes in place of aldehydes as substrates for aldolases.

         <title>Dearomatization of Biaryls through Polarity Mismatched Radical Spirocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral dearomatization transforms biaryls into complex spirocycles commonly found in bioactive natural products. This polarity mismatched radical spirocyclization tolerates diverse functional groups and is applied in the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; and 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones. The first synthesis of denobilone A, a cytotoxic plant metabolite, showcases its utility to access underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.







Abstract
Dearomatization reactions involving radical cyclizations can facilitate the synthesis of complex polycyclic systems that find applications in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. Here we employ redox&#8208;neutral photocatalysis to affect a radical spirocyclization that transforms biaryls into spirocyclic cyclohexadienones under mild reaction conditions. In a departure from previously reported methods, our work demonstrates the polarity mismatched addition of a nucleophilic radical to an electron rich arene, and allows the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; or 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones with broad functional group tolerance. By transforming biaryls into spirocycles, our methodology accesses underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space, and provides an efficient means of creating quaternary spirocenters that we apply to the first synthesis of the cytotoxic plant metabolite denobilone A.

         <title>Didepside Formation by the Nonreducing Polyketide Synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera Requires Interaction of Starter Acyl Transferase and Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ester&#8208;bond&#8208;forming dimerization to afford the didepside lecanoric acid is shown to require both the starter acyltransferase and the thioesterase domains of the nonreducing polyketide synthase Preu6 of the fungus Preussia isomera. These domains also engage in an unexpected, direct protein&#8211;protein interaction that must be considered when attempting combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.







Abstract
Orsellinic acid (OA) derivatives are produced by filamentous fungi using nonreducing polyketide synthases (nrPKSs). The chain&#8208;releasing thioesterase (TE) domains of such nrPKSs were proposed to also catalyze dimerization to yield didepsides, such as lecanoric acid. Here, we use combinatorial domain exchanges, domain dissections and reconstitutions to reveal that the TE domain of the lecanoric acid synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera must collaborate with the starter acyl transferase (SAT) domain from the same nrPKS. We show that artificial SAT&#8208;TE fusion proteins are highly effective catalysts and reprogram the ketide homologation chassis to form didepsides. We also demonstrate that dissected SAT and TE domains of Preu6 physically interact, and SAT and TE domains of OA&#8208;synthesizing nrPKSs may co&#8208;evolve. Our work highlights an unexpected domain&#8211;domain interaction in nrPKSs that must be considered for the combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.

         <title>Overall Carbon&#8208;neutral Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Molten Salts using a Liquid Metal Sn Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overall carbon&#8208;neutral electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts is established by using liquid metal Sn cathode due to enhanced CO2 conversion and excellent energy&#8208;storage capability of Sn@C.







Abstract
An overall carbon&#8208;neutral CO2 electroreduction requires enhanced conversion efficiency and intensified functionality of CO2&#8208;derived products to balance the carbon footprint from CO2 electroreduction against fixed CO2. A liquid Sn cathode is herein introduced into electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts to fabricate core&#8211;shell Sn&#8722;C spheres (Sn@C). An in situ generated Li2SnO3/C directs a self&#8208;template formation of Sn@C. Benefitting from the accelerated reaction kinetics from the liquid Sn cathode and the core&#8211;shell structure of Sn@C, a CO2&#8208;fixation current efficiency higher than 84&#8201;% and a high reversible lithium&#8208;storage capacity of Sn@C are achieved. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by other low melting point metals, such as Zn and Bi. This process integrates energy&#8208;efficient CO2 conversion and template&#8208;free fabrication of value&#8208;added metal&#8208;carbon, achieving an overall carbon&#8208;neutral electrochemical reduction of CO2.

         <title>Planar Chiral Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials for Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two efficient planar chiral multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent compounds showing narrow emissions and circularly polarized luminescence were prepared. The sky&#8208;blue circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diode exhibited the narrowest emission and high external quantum efficiency of 32.1&#8201;%, and the first nearly pure green circularly polarized electroluminescence was realized. Both devices display g factors at 10&#8722;3 level.







Abstract
Chiral boron/nitrogen doped multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising for highly efficient and color&#8208;pure circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Herein, we report two pairs of MR&#8208;TADF materials (Czp&#8208;tBuCzB, Czp&#8208;POAB) based on planar chiral paracyclophane with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 98&#8201;%. The enantiomers showed symmetric circularly polarized photoluminescence spectra with dissymmetry factors |gPL| of up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;3 in doped films. Meanwhile, the sky&#8208;blue CP&#8208;OLEDs with (R/S)&#8208;Czp&#8208;tBuCzB showed an external quantum efficiency of 32.1&#8201;% with the narrowest full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 24&#8197;nm among the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs, while the devices with (R/S)&#8208;Czp&#8208;POAB displayed the first nearly pure green CP electroluminescence with |gEL| factors at the 10&#8722;3 level. These results demonstrate the incorporation of planar chirality into MR&#8208;TADF emitter is a reliable strategy for constructing of efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>A Fluorogenic Inhibitor of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuOCou is a novel fluorogenic inhibitor of the mitochondria calcium uniporter (MCU). Its aquation&#8208;activated increase in MCU&#8208;inhibitory activity can be visualized directly by a concomitant enhancement in fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
Inhibitors of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) are valuable tools for studying the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in various pathophysiological conditions. In this study, a new fluorogenic MCU inhibitor, RuOCou, is presented. This compound is an analogue of the known MCU inhibitor Ru265 that contains fluorescent axial coumarin carboxylate ligands. Upon aquation of RuOCou and release of the axial coumarin ligands, a simultaneous increase in its MCU&#8208;inhibitory activity and fluorescence intensity is observed. The fluorescence response of this compound enabled its aquation to be monitored in both HeLa cell lysates and live HeLa cells. This fluorogenic prodrug represents a potential theranostic MCU inhibitor that can be leveraged for the treatment of human diseases related to MCU activity.

         <title>Biodegradable High&#8208;Density Polyethylene&#8208;like Material</title>

While it resembles high density polyethylene with regard to its mechanical properties and solid&#8208;state structure and has a high melting point (Tm=96&#8201;&#176;C), the novel polyester&#8208;2,18 material at the same time fully hydrolyzes in in vitro enzymatic degradation studies and mineralizes under industrial composting conditions (ISO standard 14855&#8208;1) within two months.







Abstract
We report a novel polyester material generated from readily available biobased 1,18&#8208;octadecanedicarboxylic acid and ethylene glycol possesses a polyethylene&#8208;like solid&#8208;state structure and also tensile properties similar to high density polyethylene (HDPE). Despite its crystallinity, high melting point (Tm=96&#8201;&#176;C) and hydrophobic nature, polyester&#8208;2,18 is subject to rapid and complete hydrolytic degradation in in vitro assays with isolated naturally occurring enzymes. Under industrial composting conditions (ISO standard 14855&#8208;1) the material is biodegraded with mineralization above 95&#8201;% within two months. Reference studies with polyester&#8208;18,18 (Tm=99&#8201;&#176;C) reveal a strong impact of the nature of the diol repeating unit on degradation rates, possibly related to the density of ester groups in the amorphous phase. Depolymerization by methanolysis indicates suitability for closed&#8208;loop recycling.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Catenane&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuI&#8208;complexed [2]catenane&#8208;based catalysts that can be activated &#8216;on&#8208;demand&#8217; through the controlled breakdown of the mechanical bond have been developed. Encapsulation of the CuI ion within the cavity formed by the two interlocked macrocycles inhibits its ability to catalyze the CuAAC reaction. However, the disassembly of the interlocked architecture by the opening of the macrocycles restores the capacity of the copper catalyst to form triazoles.







Abstract
Rotaxanes and molecular knots exhibit particular properties resulting from the presence of a mechanical bond within their structure that maintains the molecular components interlocked in a permanent manner. On the other hand, the disassembly of the interlocked architecture through the breakdown of the mechanical bond can activate properties which are masked in the parent compound. Herein, we present the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive CuI&#8208;complexed [2]catenanes as OFF/ON catalysts for the copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. The encapsulation of the CuI ion inside the [2]catenanes inhibits its ability to catalyze the formation of triazoles. In contrast, the controlled opening of the two macrocycles induces the breaking of the mechanical bond, thereby restoring the catalytic activity of the CuI ion for the CuAAC reaction. Such OFF/ON catalysts can be involved in signal amplification processes with various potential applications.

In contrast, the controlled opening of the two macrocycles induces the breaking of the mechanical bond, thereby restoring the catalytic activity of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ion for the CuAAC reaction. Such OFF/ON catalysts can be involved in signal amplification processes with various potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programming Photodegradability into Vinylic Polymers via Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic allylic sulfides were obtained through intramolecular photocycloaddition of coumarin under UVA light. Subsequent radical ring&#8208;opening copolymerization with MA using RAFT, incorporated the coumarin dimers into the backbone of polymers. By decreasing the irradiation wavelength to UVB light or exposing the polymer to sun light, the photocycloreversion of the imbedded coumarin dimers initiated photodegradation of the polymer.







Abstract
Incorporation of photolabile moieties into the polymer backbone holds promise to remotely&#8208;control polymer degradation. However, suitable synthetic avenues are limited, especially for radical polymerizations. Here we report a strategy to program photodegradability into vinylic polymers by exploiting the wavelength selectivity of photocycloadditions for radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (rROP). Irradiation of coumarin terminated allylic sulfides with UVA light initiated intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition producing cyclic macromonomers. Subsequent RAFT&#8208;mediated rROP with methyl acrylate yielded copolymers that inherited the photoreactivity of the cyclic parent monomer. Irradiation with UVB initiated efficient photocycloreversion of the coumarin dimers, causing polymer degradation within minutes under UVB light or days under sunlight exposure. Our synthetic strategy may pave the way to insert photolabile linkages into vinylic polymers, tuning degradation for specific wavelengths.

         <title>Electrochemical Kinetics Support a Second Coordination Sphere Mechanism in Metal&#8208;Based Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Mo/W formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) is debated because the metal ion of the active site is 6&#8208;coordinated, leaving no coordination site open for substrate binding. We have used direct electrochemistry to investigate the catalytic cycle of two homologous FDHs: our results strongly support a &#8220;second coordination sphere&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based formate dehydrogenases are molybdenum or tungsten&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze the interconversion between formate and CO2. According to the current consensus, the metal ion of the catalytic center in its active form is coordinated by 6&#8201;S (or 5&#8201;S and 1&#8201;Se) atoms, leaving no free coordination sites to which formate could bind to the metal. Some authors have proposed that one of the active site ligands decoordinates during turnover to allow formate binding. Another proposal is that the oxidation of formate takes place in the second coordination sphere of the metal. Here, we have used electrochemical steady&#8208;state kinetics to elucidate the order of the steps in the catalytic cycle of two formate dehydrogenases. Our results strongly support the &#8220;second coordination sphere&#8221; hypothesis.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosides by Silver&#8208;Assisted Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver&#8208;assisted gold catalysis was applied to alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors for the synthesis of purine, pyrimidine, quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one, and asparagine glycosides. It was demonstrated (40 examples) to be highly versatile for the synthesis of important types of N&#8208;glycosides. The method has been utilized for the synthesis of various 2&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and the disaccharide dipeptide moiety of chloroviruses.







Abstract
The synthesis of N&#8208;glycosides from stable glycosyl donors in a catalytic fashion is still challenging, though they exist ubiquitously in DNA, RNA, glycoproteins, and other biological molecules. Herein, silver&#8208;assisted gold&#8208;catalyzed activation of alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors is shown to be a versatile approach for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, asparagine glycosides and quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one N&#8208;glycosides. Thus synthesized nucleosides were subjected to the oxidation&#8211;reduction sequence for the conversion of Ribf&#8208; into Araf&#8208; nucleosides, giving access to nucleosides that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. Furthermore, the protocol is demonstrated to be suitable for the synthesis of 2&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides in a facile manner. Direct attachment of an asparagine&#8208;containing dipeptide to the glucopyranose and subsequent extrapolation to afford the dipeptide disaccharide unit of chloroviruses is yet another facet of this endeavor.

         <title>Schlenk's Legacy&#8212;Methyllithium Put under Close Scrutiny</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide contaminations of commercial methyllithium solutions (MeLi&#8208;c) can be simply removed by the use of K [N (SiMe3)2] as a halide&#8208;trapping reagent and solvent&#8208;dependent precipitation. 7Li&#8208;NMR spectroscopy is an efficient tool for quantifying the halide contaminations, which can effect solid&#8208;state structures as shown for monomeric [(Me3TACN)LiCH3].







Abstract
Commercially available stock solutions of organolithium reagents are well&#8208;implemented tools in organic and organometallic chemistry. However, such solutions are inherently contaminated with lithium halide salts, which can complicate certain synthesis protocols and purification processes. Here, we report the isolation of chloride&#8208;free methyllithium employing K[N(SiMe3)2] as a halide&#8208;trapping reagent. The influence of distinct LiCl contaminations on the 7Li&#8208;NMR chemical shift is examined and their quantification demonstrated. The structural parameters of new chloride&#8208;free monomeric methyllithium complex [(Me3TACN)LiCH3], ligated by an azacrown ether, are assessed by comparison with a halide&#8208;contaminated variant and monomeric lithium chloride [(Me3TACN)LiCl], further emphasizing the effect of halide impurities.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenative Desulfurization of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides was developed to selectively cleave the C=S bond. Remarkably, functional groups such as aldehyde, ketone, sulfone, or even nitro could be unprecedentedly tolerated in this manganese&#8208;based protocol and this, despite their sensitivity to reductive conditions.







Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalysis has emerged as an important alternative to noble transition metal catalysis in hydrogenation reactions. However, there has been no Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of thioamides reported so far, presumably due to the poisoning of catalysts by sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, we described the first manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides to amines or imines. The key to success is the use of MnBr(CO)5 instead of commonly&#8208;employed pincer&#8208;manganese catalysts, together with simple NEt3 and CuBr. This protocol features excellent selectivity on sole cleavage of the C=S bond of thioamides, in contrast to the only known Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of thioamides, and unprecedented chemo&#8208;selectivity tolerating vulnerable functional groups such as nitrile, ketone, aldehyde, ester, sulfone, nitro, olefin, alkyne and heterocycle, which are usually susceptible to common hydride&#8208;type reductive protocols.

&lt;p&gt;Earth-abundant transition metal catalysis has emerged as an important alternative to noble transition metal catalysis in hydrogenation reactions. However, there has been no Earth-abundant transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of thioamides reported so far, presumably due to the poisoning of catalysts by sulfur-containing molecules. Herein, we described the first manganese-catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides to amines or imines. The key to success is the use of MnBr(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; instead of commonly-employed pincer-manganese catalysts, together with simple NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CuBr. This protocol features excellent selectivity on sole cleavage of the C=S bond of thioamides, in contrast to the only known Ru-catalyzed hydrogenation of thioamides, and unprecedented chemo-selectivity tolerating vulnerable functional groups such as nitrile, ketone, aldehyde, ester, sulfone, nitro, olefin, alkyne and heterocycle, which are usually susceptible to common hydride-type reductive protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unconventional Pathway in the Gas&#8208;Phase Synthesis of 9H&#8208;Fluorene (C13H10) via the Radical&#8211;Radical Reaction of Benzyl (C7H7) with Phenyl (C6H5)</title>

Gas&#8208;phase synthesis of 9H&#8208;fluorene (C13H10)&#8212;the simplest polycyclic aromatic system carrying a five&#8208;membered ring&#8212;along with diphenylmethane (C13H12) via unconventional reaction dynamics of the benzyl (C7H7&#8901;) with the phenyl (C6H5&#8901;) radical is reported.







Abstract
The simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carrying a five&#8208;membered ring&#8212;9H&#8208;fluorene (C13H10)&#8212;is produced isomer&#8208;specifically in the gas phase by reacting benzyl (C7H7&#8901;) with phenyl (C6H5&#8901;) radicals in a pyrolytic reactor coupled with single photon ionization mass spectrometry. The unconventional mechanism of reaction is supported by theoretical calculations, which first produces diphenylmethane and unexpected 1&#8208;(6&#8208;methylenecyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienyl)benzene intermediates (C13H12) accessed via addition of the phenyl radical to the ortho position of the benzyl radical. These findings offer convincing evidence for molecular mass growth processes defying conventional wisdom that radical&#8208;radical reactions are initiated through recombination at their radical centers. The structure of 9H&#8208;fluorene acts as a molecular building block for complex curved nanostructures like fullerenes and nanobowls providing fundamental insights into the hydrocarbon evolution in high temperature settings.

         <title>Highly Selective Transmembrane Transport of Exogenous Lithium Ions through Rationally Designed Supramolecular Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 6, February 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial Li+ channels composed of pore&#8208;forming small aromatic molecules show almost exclusive transport of exogenous lithium ions over major physiological cations, with a Li+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 23.0. This highly selective Li+ channel may become an important tool for studying the physiological role of intracellular lithium ions.







Abstract
Lithium ions have been applied in the clinic in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. In this work, we report artificial supramolecular lithium channels composed of pore&#8208;containing small aromatic molecules. By adjusting the lumen size and coordination numbers, we found that one of the supramolecular channels developed shows unprecedented transmembrane transport of exogenous lithium ions with a Li+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 23.0, which is in the same level of that of natural Na+ channels. Furthermore, four coordination sites inside channels are found to be the basic requirement for ion transport function. Importantly, this artificial lithium channel displays very low transport of physiological Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions. This highly selective Li+ channel may become an important tool for studying the physiological role of intracellular lithium ions, especially in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

A ligand&#8208;controlled switching method has been developed for the multistate switching of catenanes. To verify this concept, a [3]catenane composed of three macrocyclic metalloporphyrin dimers with a rigid &#960;&#8208;backbone was synthesized. Multistate switching of the [3]catenane was achieved by complexation with various amine ligands, with the multistate switching behavior arising from the tunable optical properties of the [3]catenane.







Abstract
Catenanes with multistate switchable properties are promising components for next&#8208;generation molecular machines and supramolecular materials. Herein, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled switching method, a novel method for the multistate switching of catenanes controlled by complexation with added amine ligands. To verify this method, a [3]catenane comprising cyclic porphyrin dimers with a rigid &#960;&#8208;system has been synthesized. Owing to the rigidity, the relative positions among the cyclic components of the [3]catenane can be precisely controlled by complexation with various amine ligands. Moreover, ligand&#8208;controlled multistate switching affects the optical properties of the [3]catenanes: the emission intensity can be tuned by modulating the sizes and coordination numbers of integrated amine ligands. This work shows the utility of using organic ligands for the structural switching of catenanes, and will contribute to the further development of multistate switchable mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>A Multifluorination Strategy Toward Wide Bandgap Polymers for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;deficient tetrafluoronaphthodithiophene (FNT) was created to construct a family of PFNT&#8208;F/Cl polymers for organic solar cells. The PFNT&#8208;F/Cl&#8208;based OSCs exhibit impressive FF values of 0.80, and remarkable PCEs of 17.53&#8201;% and 18.10&#8201;%, suggesting multifluorinated polymers are promising donor materials for non&#8208;fullerene OSCs.







Abstract
Creating new electron&#8208;deficient unit is highly demanded to develop high&#8208;performance polymer donors for non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we reported a multifluorinated unit 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrafluoronaphtho[2,1&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;b&#8242;]dithio&#8208;phene (FNT) and its polymers PFNT&#8208;F and PFNT&#8208;Cl. The advantages of multifluorination: (1) it enables the polymers to exhibit low&#8208;lying HOMO (&#8776;&#8722;5.5&#8197;eV) and wide band gap (&#8776;2.0&#8197;eV); (2) the short interactions (F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H, F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F) endow the polymers with properties of high film crystallinity and efficient hole transport; (3) well miscibility with NFAs that leads to a more well&#8208;defined nanofibrous morphology and face&#8208;on orientation in the blend films. Therefore, the PFNT&#8208;F/Cl&#8201;:&#8201;N3 based OSCs exhibit impressive FF values of 0.80, and remarkable PCEs of 17.53&#8201;% and 18.10&#8201;%, which make them ranked the best donor materials in OSCs. This work offers new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance polymers by multifluorination strategy.

         <title>Deciphering the Biological Activities of Antifungal Agents with Chemical Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rising percentage of fungal pathogens resistant to antifungal drugs and fungicides emphasizes the threat that they pose to animal and human health and global food security. This Minireview outlines the pivotal role of chemical biology in uncovering biological activities, detecting resistance, and in characterizing the interactions between antifungal agents and their targets.







Abstract
The growing number of fungal infections caused by pathogens resistant to one or more classes of antifungal drugs emphasizes the threat that these microorganisms pose to animal and human health and global food security. Open questions remain regarding the mechanisms of action of the limited repertoire of antifungal agents, making it challenging to rationally develop more efficacious therapeutics. In recent years, the use of chemical biology approaches has resolved some of these questions and has provided new promising concepts to guide the design of antifungal agents. By focusing on examples from studies carried out in recent years, this minireview describes the key roles that probes based on antifungal agents and their derivatives have played in uncovering details about their activities, in detecting resistance, and in characterizing the interactions between these agents and their targets.

         <title>Interfaces with Fluorinated Amphiphiles: Superstructures and Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated amphiphiles show interfacial properties distinctively different from ordinary nonfluorinated amphiphiles, such as unique and highly branched superstructures and better stabilization of microdroplets. Further fluorine&#8208;specific phenomena of fluorinated amphiphiles can be observed at solid/liquid interfaces, such as during their adsorption on fluorous adsorber materials or formation of amphiphobic surface coatings upon cross&#8208;linking.







Abstract
This Minireview discusses recent developments in research on the interfacial phenomena of fluorinated amphiphiles, with a focus on applications that exploit the unique and manifold interfacial properties associated with these amphiphiles. Most notably, fluorinated amphiphiles form stable aggregates with often distinctly different morphologies compared to their nonfluorinated counterparts. Consequently, fluorinated surfactants have found wide use in high&#8208;performance applications such as microfluidic&#8208;assisted screening. Additionally, their fluorine&#8208;specific behaviour at solid/liquid interfaces, such as the formation of superhydrophobic coatings after deposition on surfaces, will be discussed. As fluorinated surfactants and perfluorinated materials in general pose potential environmental threats, recent developments in their remediation based on their adsorption onto fluorinated surfaces will be evaluated.

         <title>Development of a General and Selective Nanostructured Cobalt Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of Benzofurans, Indoles and Benzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrolysis of Co&#8208;DABCO&#8208;citric acid template on silica resulted in stable and reusable Co/Co3O4 core&#8211;shell nanostructured catalyst which allows for the selective hydrogenation of benzofurans as well as indoles and benzothiophenes.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of benzofurans in the presence of a heterogeneous non&#8208;noble metal catalyst is reported. The developed optimal catalytic material consists of cobalt&#8208;cobalt oxide core&#8211;shell nanoparticles supported on silica, which has been prepared by the immobilization and pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;DABCO&#8208;citric acid complex on silica under argon at 800&#8201;&#176;C. This novel catalyst allows for the selective hydrogenation of simple and functionalized benzofurans to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans as well as related heterocycles. The versatility of the reported protocol is showcased by the reduction of selected drugs and deuteration of heterocycles. Further, the stability, recycling, and reusability of the Co&#8208;nanocatalyst are demonstrated.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Chemistries Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent work from Guo and co&#8208;workers who proposed a hybrid electrolyte strategy obtained by mixing H2O and dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) as solvents to build up a high&#8208;quality phosphate&#8208;based solid&#8208;state interphase layer is highlighted. This new solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) protects Zn metal anodes from corrosion and dendrite formation. Thus, ultrahigh Coulombic efficiencies and extended lifespan can be achieved.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are deemed a promising technology for electrochemical energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, AZMBs still suffer from severe side reactions, including Zn dendrite formation and intrinsic hydrogen evolution reaction. In contrast to the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer that stabilizes Li/Na/K metal anodes in organic electrolytes, it is difficult to form an SEI layer on the Zn surface because of the difficulty in decomposing the salt anions within the narrow electrochemical potential window of water. A team from the University of Adelaide reports a novel pure or hybrid electrolyte with H2O by using dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) as solvent or co&#8208;solvent to construct a uniform and stable phosphate&#8208;based SEI layer (ZnP2O6 and Zn3(PO4)2). As a result, high Coulombic efficiencies and improved capacity retentions are obtained.

In contrast to the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer that stabilizes Li/Na/K metal anodes in organic electrolytes, it is difficult to form an SEI layer on the Zn surface because of the difficulty in decomposing the salt anions within the narrow electrochemical potential window of water. A team from the University of Adelaide reports a novel pure or hybrid electrolyte with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O by using dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) as solvent or co-solvent to construct a uniform and stable phosphate-based SEI layer (ZnP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). As a result, high Coulombic efficiencies and improved capacity retentions are obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prebiotic Synthesis and Isomerization in Interstellar Analog Ice: Glycinal, Acetamide, and Their Enol Tautomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycinal (HCOCH2NH2) and acetamide (CH3CONH2) are simple molecular building blocks of biomolecules in prebiotic chemistry, though their origin on early Earth and formation in interstellar media remain a mystery. These molecules are formed with their tautomers in low temperature interstellar model ices upon interaction with simulated galactic cosmic rays. Glycinal and acetamide are accessed via barrierless radical&#8208;radical reactions of vinoxy (&#8226;CH2CHO) and acetyl (&#8226;C(O)CH3), and then undergo keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Exploiting tunable photoionization reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy and photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves, these results demonstrate fundamental reaction pathways for the formation of complex organics through non&#8208;equilibrium ice reactions in cold molecular cloud environments. These molecules demonstrate an unconventional starting point for abiotic synthesis of organics relevant to contemporary biomolecules like polypeptides and cell membranes in deep space.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Oxycyanation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Cyanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxycyanation of alkenes would allow the direct construction of useful &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile scaffolds. However, only limited examples of such reactions have been reported, and some problems including limited substrate scope and the lack of diastereocontrol in the case of the oxycyanation of internal alkenes have arisen. We herein report on the intermolecular oxycyanation of alkenes using p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN) in the presence of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as a catalyst, affording products that contain a sulfinyloxy group and a cyano group at the vicinal position. The reaction features a stereospecific syn&#8208;addition. The reaction also shows a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations by experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the reaction proceeds via an unprecedented stereospecific mechanism through the electrophilic cyanation of alkenes, in which B(C6F5)3 efficiently activates TsCN through the coordination of the cyano group to the boron center.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Removal of Sulfate from Water by Precipitation with a Rigid Bis&#8208;amidinium Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple, readily&#8208;prepared biphenyl bis&#8208;amidinium compound (1&#8729;Cl2) is able to selectively precipitate sulfate from water. The precipitant is effective at concentrations as low as 1 mM and shows complete selectivity against monovalent anions, and high selectivity even against CO32&#8211; and HPO42&#8211;. It is highly effective (&gt; 90% sulfate removed) in both seawater and highly acidic conditions relevant to mining waste&#8208;streams. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that 1&#8729;SO4 forms a tightly packed, anhydrous, structure where each sulfate anion receives eight hydrogen bonds from amidinium N&#8211;H hydrogen bond donors.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolving Robust and Interpretable Enzymes for the Bioethanol Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Obtaining a robust and applicable enzyme for bioethanol production is a dream for biorefinery engineers. Here, we printed a general routine to explain how to evolve an all&#8208;round and interpretable enzyme that can be directly employed in the bioethanol industry. By integrating the transferable protein evolution strategy InSiReP 2.0 (In Silico guided Recombination Process), enzymatic characterization for actual production, and computational molecular understanding, the model cellulase PvCel5A (endoglucanase II Cel5A from Penicillium verruculosum) was successfully evolved to overcome the remaining challenges of low ethanol and temperature tolerance, which primarily limited biomass transformation and bioethanol yield. Remarkably, application of the PvCel5A variants in both 1st and 2nd generation bioethanol production processes (i. Conventional corn ethanol fermentation combined with the in situ pretreatment process; ii. Cellulosic ethanol fermentation process) resulted in a 5.69&#8208;10.08 % increase of the ethanol yield, which was unlikely to be achieved by other optimization techniques.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of internal alkynes (ynamides/yne&#8208;acetates/alkynes) is described.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Porphyrin Coordination Supramolecular Network Cathode for High&#8208;performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodine has great potential in energy storage, but high solubility of I3&#8722; has seriously delayed its promotion. Benefited from abundant active sites and the open channel, two&#8208;dimensional coordination supramolecular networks (2D CSNs) is considered to be a candidate for energy storage. Herein, a 2D porphyrin&#8208;CSN cathode named Zn&#8208;TCPP for aqueous iodine dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) shows an excellent specific capacity of 278 mAh g&#8722;1, and a high energy density of 340 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1, as well as a durable cycle performance of 5000 cycles and a high Coulombic efficiency of 98%. Molecular orbital theory, UV&#8722;vis, Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal charge&#8208;transfer interaction between the donor of porphyrin nitrogen and the acceptor of I3&#8722;, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations demonstrate the contribution of 2D layered network structure of Zn&#8208;TCPP to the penetration of I3&#8722;.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metabolic&#8208;Tag&#8208;Based Method for Assessing the Permeation of Small Molecules Across the Mycomembrane in Live Mycobacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The general lack of permeability of small molecules observed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is most ascribed to its unique cell envelope. More specifically, the outer mycomembrane is hypothesized to be the principal determinant for access of antibiotics to their molecular targets. We describe a novel assay that combines metabolic tagging of the peptidoglycan, which sits directly beneath the mycomembrane, click chemistry of test molecules, and a fluorescent labeling chase step, to measure the permeation of small molecules. We showed that the assay workflow was robust and compatible with high&#8208;throughput analysis in mycobacteria by testing a small panel of azide&#8208;tagged molecules. The general trend is similar across the two types of mycobacteria with some notable exceptions.

More specifically, the outer mycomembrane is hypothesized to be the principal determinant for access of antibiotics to their molecular targets. We describe a novel assay that combines metabolic tagging of the peptidoglycan, which sits directly beneath the mycomembrane, click chemistry of test molecules, and a fluorescent labeling chase step, to measure the permeation of small molecules. We showed that the assay workflow was robust and compatible with high-throughput analysis in mycobacteria by testing a small panel of azide-tagged molecules. The general trend is similar across the two types of mycobacteria with some notable exceptions. We anticipate that this assay platform will lay the foundation for medicinal chemistry efforts to understand and improve uptake of both existing drugs and newly-discovered compounds into mycobacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Photovoltaic Catalyst with &#963;&#8208;&#960; Anchor for High&#8208;Performance Solar Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient in&#8208;situ deposition of metallic cocatalyst, like zero&#8208;valent platinum (Pt), on organic photovoltaic catalysts (OPCs) is the prerequisite for their high catalytic activities. Here we develop the OPC (Y6CO), by introducing carbonyl in the core, which is available to &#963;&#8208;&#960; coordinate with transition metals, due to the high&#8208;energy empty &#960;* orbital of carbonyl. Y6CO exhibits a stronger capability to anchor Pt species and reduce them to metallic state, resulting in more Pt(0) deposition, relative to the control OPC without the central &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchor. Single&#8208;component and heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) employing Y6CO show enhanced average hydrogen evolution rates of 230.98 and 323.22 mmol h&#8722;1 g[OPC]&#8722;1, respectively, under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm&#8722;2 for 10 h, and heterojunction NPs yield the external quantum efficiencies of ca. 10% in 500&#8208;800 nm. This work demonstrates &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchoring is one efficient strategy for integrating metallic cocatalyst and OPC for high&#8208;performance photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Hindered and Deconjugative &#945;&#8208;Regioselective Asymmetric Mannich Reaction of Meinwald Rearrangement&#8208;Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to &#947;&#8208;addition, the &#945;&#8208;addition of &#945;&#8208;branched &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes has larger steric hindrance and disrupts the &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation, therefore a few examples are reported. In this article, a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective &#945;&#8208;regioselective Mannich reaction of isatin&#8208;derived ketimines with &#945;, &#946; or &#947;&#8208;branched &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes generated in&#8208;situ from Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides is realized by using chiral N,N&#697;&#8208;dioxide/Sc(III) catalysts. A series of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary allyl aldehydes and homoallylic alcohols with vicinal multisubstituted stereocenters are constructed in excellent yields, good d.r. and excellent ee values. Experimental studies and DFT (density functional theory) calculations reveal that the large steric hindrance of ligand and the Boc (tButyloxy carbonyl) group of imines are critical factors for the &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Probes Based on AIEgen&#8208;Mediated Polyelectrolyte Assemblies for Manipulating Intramolecular Motion and Magnetic Relaxivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uniting photothermal therapy (PTT) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) holds great potential in nanotheranostics. However, the extensively utilized hydrophobicity&#8208;driven assembling strategy not only restricts the intramolecular motion&#8208;induced PTT, but also blocks the interactions between MR agents and water. Herein, we report an aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;mediated polyelectrolyte nanoassemblies (APN) strategy, which bestows a unique &#8220;soft&#8221; inner microenvironment with good water permeability. Femtosecond transient spectra verify that APN well activates intramolecular motion from the twisted intramolecular charge transfer process. This de novo APN strategy uniting synergistically three factors (rotational motion, local motion, and hydration number) brings out high MR relaxivity. For the first time, APN strategy has successfully modulated both intramolecular motion and magnetic relaxivity, achieving fluorescence lifetime imaging of tumor spheroids and spatio&#8208;temporal MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;efficient PTT.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrothermal Water&#8211;Gas Shift Reaction at Room Temperature with a Silicomolybdate based Pd Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8211;gas shift (WGS) reaction is often conducted at elevated temperature and requires energy&#8208;intensive separation of hydrogen (H2) from methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and residual carbon monoxide (CO). Designing processes to decouple CO oxidation and H2 production provides an alternative strategy to obtain high purity H2 streams. Herein, we report an electrothermal WGS process combining thermal oxidation of CO on a silicomolybdic acid (SMA)&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pd1/CsSMA) and electrocatalytic H2 evolution. Those two half&#8208;reactions are coupled through phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) as a redox mediator at a moderate anodic potential of 0.6 V (versus Ag/AgCl). Under optimized conditions, our catalyst exhibited a TOF of 1.2 s&#8208;1 with turnover numbers above 40,000 molCO2/molPd&#160; achieving stable H2 production with a purity consistently exceeding 99.99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polyphenol&#8211;DNA Microparticles for In Vivo Adjuvant and Antigen Co&#8208;Delivery and Immune Stimulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;based materials have attracted interest due to the tunable structure and encoded biological functionality of nucleic acids. A simple and general approach to synthesize DNA&#8208;based materials with fine control over morphology and bioactivity is important to expand their applications. Here, we report the synthesis of DNA&#8208;based particles via the supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and DNA. Uniform particles with different morphologies are obtained using a variety of DNA building blocks. The particles enable the co&#8208;delivery of cytosine&#8211;guanine adjuvant sequences and the antigen ovalbumin in model cells. Intramuscular injection of the particles in mice induces antigen&#8208;specific antibody production and T cell responses with no apparent toxicity. Protein expression in cells is shown using capsules assembled from TA and plasmid DNA. This work highlights the potential of TA as a universal material for directing the supramolecular assembly of DNA into gene and vaccine delivery platforms.</dc:description>

Enantioselective lithiation of&#160;N&#8217;&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N&#8208;isopropyl ureas using a chiral lithium amide base generates a benzyllithium that undergoes an unactivated stereospecific intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution to generate an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylmethylamine in the form of its urea derivative, in up to &gt;99% ee. Treatment with acid induces an &#8216;azatropic shift&#8217; with retention of configuration, the product of which may be hydrolysed to the target amine.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel aluminum&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework with uniform micropores for trace BTEX adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential porous adsorbents for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX). A novel MOF, using low toxic aluminum (Al) as the metal, named as ZJU&#8208;620(Al), with uniform micropore size of 8.37 &#177; 0.73 &#197; and specific surface area of 1347 m2/g, was synthesized. It is constructed by one&#8208;dimensional rod&#8208;shaped AlO6 clusters, formate ligands and 4,4',4''&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tribenzoic ligands. ZJU&#8208;620(Al) exhibits excellent chemical&#8208;thermal stability and adsorption for trace BTEX, e.g., benzene adsorption of 3.80 mmol/g at P/P0 = 0.01 and 298 K, which is the largest one reported. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations and Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, it was observed that the excellent adsorption could be attributed to the high affinity of BTEX molecules in ZJU&#8208;620(Al) micropores because the kinetic diameters of BTEX are close up to the pore size of ZJU&#8208;620(Al).</dc:description>

         <title>A Compound I Mimic Reveals the Transient Active Species of a Cytochrome P450 Enzyme: Insight into the Stereoselectivity of P450&#8208;Catalysed Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining snapshots of cytochrome&#8197;P450s with their substrates in catalytically relevant poses has been a longstanding challenge. By exploiting the properties of a synthetic porphyrin that closely mimics the highly unstable P450 active species, styrene could be captured in poses that align with the experimental evidence. This approach shows great promise as a tool in the targeted design of more efficient P450 biocatalysts.







Abstract
Catching the structure of cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzymes in flagrante is crucial for the development of P450 biocatalysts, as most structures collected are found trapped in a precatalytic conformation. At the heart of P450 catalysis lies Cpd&#8201;I, a short&#8208;lived, highly reactive intermediate, whose recalcitrant nature has thwarted most attempts at capturing catalytically relevant poses of P450s. We report the crystal structure of P450BM3 mimicking the state in the precise moment preceding epoxidation, which is in perfect agreement with the experimentally observed stereoselectivity. This structure was attained by incorporation of the stable Cpd&#8201;I mimic oxomolybdenum mesoporphyrin IX into P450BM3 in the presence of styrene. The orientation of styrene to the Mo&#8208;oxo species in the crystal structures sheds light onto the dynamics involved in the rotation of styrene to present its vinyl group to Cpd&#8201;I. This method serves as a powerful tool for predicting and modelling the stereoselectivity of P450 reactions.

         <title>Emergence of Visible&#8208;Light Water Oxidation Upon Hexaniobate&#8208;Ligand Entrapment of Quantum&#8208;Confined Copper&#8208;Oxide Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of sensitizer&#8208;free visible&#8208;light water oxidation by CuO was achieved using water&#8208;soluble hexaniobate cluster anions to entrap quantum&#8208;confined nanocrystals of the familiar earth&#8208;abundant metal oxide.







Abstract
The formation of small 1 to 3&#8197;nm organic&#8208;ligand free metal&#8208;oxide nanocrystals (NCs) is essential to utilization of their attractive size&#8208;dependent properties in electronic devices and catalysis. We now report that hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anions, [Nb6O19]8&#8722;, can arrest the growth of metal&#8208;oxide NCs and stabilize them as water&#8208;soluble complexes. This is exemplified by formation of hexaniobate&#8208;complexed 2.4&#8208;nm monoclinic&#8208;phase CuO NCs (1), whose ca. 350 Cu&#8208;atom cores feature quantum&#8208;confinement effects that impart an unprecedented ability to catalyze visible&#8208;light water oxidation with no added photosensitizers or applied potentials, and at rates exceeding those of hematite NCs. The findings point to polyoxoniobate&#8208;ligand entrapment as a potentially general method for harnessing the size&#8208;dependent properties of very small semiconductor NCs as the cores of versatile, entirely&#8208;inorganic complexes.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Ni/V2O3 Heterostructure Catalyst for Boosting Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction in Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering approach was developed to fabricate a low&#8208;cost Ni/V2O3 heterostructure catalyst, which can efficiently and stably catalyze the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the Ni/V2O3 interface sites can optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable HOR performance.







Abstract
Alkaline fuel cells can permit the adoption of platinum group metal&#8208;free (PGM&#8208;free) catalysts and cheap bipolar plates, thus further lowering the cost. With the exploration of PGM&#8208;free hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts, nickel&#8208;based compounds have been considered as the most promising HOR catalysts in alkali. Here we report an interfacial engineering through the formation of nickel&#8208;vanadium oxide (Ni/V2O3) heterostructures to activate Ni for efficient HOR catalysis in alkali. The strong electron transfer from Ni to V2O3 could modulate the electronic structure of Ni sites. The optimal Ni/V2O3 catalyst exhibits a high intrinsic activity of 0.038&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ni/V2O3 interface as the active sites can enable to optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable activity and durability.

         <title>Third&#8208;Generation Sequencing of Epigenetic DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Third&#8208;generation sequencing platforms provide fast, convenient, and often inexpensive means of DNA sequencing; however, direct detection of epigenetic bases is yet to be routinely achieved. Here, derivatisation and labelling techniques that enable profiling of cytosine modifications on these platforms are reviewed.







Abstract
The discovery of epigenetic bases has revolutionised the understanding of disease and development. Among the most studied epigenetic marks are cytosines covalently modified at the 5 position. In order to gain insight into their biological significance, the ability to determine their spatiotemporal distribution within the genome is essential. Techniques for sequencing on &#8220;next&#8208;generation&#8221; platforms often involve harsh chemical treatments leading to sample degradation. Third&#8208;generation sequencing promises to further revolutionise the field by providing long reads, enabling coverage of highly repetitive regions of the genome or structural variants considered unmappable by next generation sequencing technology. While the ability of third&#8208;generation platforms to directly detect epigenetic modifications is continuously improving, at present chemical or enzymatic derivatisation presents the most convenient means of enhancing reliability. This Review presents techniques available for the detection of cytosine modifications on third&#8208;generation platforms.

         <title>Lead(II) Formate in Rembrandt's Night Watch: Detection and Distribution from the Macro&#8208; to the Micro&#8208;scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

X&#8208;ray powder diffraction mapping at multiple length scales revealed the unusual presence of lead(II) formate, Pb(HCOO)2, in several areas of The Night Watch, Rembrandt's most famous painting. A possible chemical pathway resulting in the formation of this compound in historical oil paint was explored via micro&#8208;analysis, notably using synchrotron radiation. New clues on the reactivity of metallic driers in oil systems were thus gathered.







Abstract
The Night Watch, painted in 1642 and on view in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, is considered Rembrandt's most famous work. X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (XRPD) mapping at multiple length scales revealed the unusual presence of lead(II) formate, Pb(HCOO)2, in several areas of the painting. Until now, this compound was never reported in historical oil paints. In order to get insights into this phenomenon, one possible chemical pathway was explored thanks to the preparation and micro&#8208;analysis of model oil paint media prepared by heating linseed oil and lead(II) oxide (PbO) drier as described in 17th century recipes. Synchrotron radiation based micro&#8208;XRPD (SR&#8208;&#956;&#8208;XRPD) and infrared microscopy were combined to identify and map at the micro&#8208;scale various neo&#8208;formed lead&#8208;based compounds in these model samples. Both lead(II) formate and lead(II) formate hydroxide Pb(HCOO)(OH) were detected and mapped, providing new clues regarding the reactivity of lead driers in oil matrices in historical paintings.

         <title>A Visible Light Driven Nickel Carbonylation Catalyst: The Synthesis of Acid Chlorides from Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light driven nickel carbonylation catalyst has been develop. This offers a method for carbonylative coupling reactions with an earth abundant metal at ambient temperature for the conversion of alkyl halides into synthetically versatile acid chlorides. The acid chlorides can then be transformed into an array of challenging ester, thioester and amide products.







Abstract
We describe here the development of a visible light driven nickel carbonylation catalyst. The combination of the large bite&#8208;angle Xantphos ligand with nickel(0) generates a catalyst capable of activating alkyl halides toward carbonylation at ambient temperature in the presence of blue light irradiation, and the reductive elimination of high energy acid chloride products. Unlike classical carbonylations, where the coordination of carbon monoxide inhibits the reactivity of earth abundant nickel catalysts, a CO&#8208;associated nickel is found to be the active catalyst in the reaction. Coupling the build&#8208;up of acid chlorides with nucleophile addition can be used to access various amides, esters and thioesters, including those of sterically encumbered substrates or with metal&#8208;reactive functionalities.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Adduct of Atomic P(&#8722;1) as a Source of Phosphinidenes (PR), Diphosphorus (P2), and Indium Phosphide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chelation approach was employed to access low&#8208;valent phosphorus centers. The resulting adducts act as P atom sources for phosphinidene (PR) transfer, indium phosphide synthesis, and neutral P2 transfer to organic substrates.







Abstract
We report phosphinidenes (PR) stabilized by an intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chelate. These adducts include the parent phosphinidene, PH, which is accessed via thermolysis of coordinated HPCO. The reported FLP&#8208;PH species acts as a springboard to other phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds, such as FLP&#8208;adducts of diphosphorus (P2) and InP3. Our new adducts participate in thermal&#8208; or light&#8208;induced phosphinidene elimination (of both PH and PR, R=organic group), transfer P2 units to an organic substrate, and yield the useful semiconductor InP at only 110&#8201;&#176;C from solution.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Mixed&#8208;Linker Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Switchable Semiconductive Characteristics for Tailorable Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;linker MOF system Mn2[TTF]x[NiS4]1&#8722;x (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and sensing performances. The variation of linker ratios changed the electrical conductivity of MOFs and induced a switch of n&#8208;type/p&#8208;type semiconducting behaviors. By adjusting the ratio of the two linkers in MOFs, we realized the fabrication and optimization of volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors for different application scenarios.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), with diverse metal nodes and designable organic linkers, offer unique opportunities for the rational engineering of semiconducting properties. In this work, we report a mixed&#8208;linker conductive MOF system with both tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) moieties, which allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and semiconductive characteristics. By continuously increasing the molar ratio between tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene), the switching of the semiconducting behaviors from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type was observed along with an increase in electrical conductivity by 3 orders of magnitude (from 2.88&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 to 9.26&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1). Furthermore, mixed&#8208;linker MOFs were applied for the chemiresistive detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), where the sensing performance was modulated by the corresponding linker ratios, showing synergistic and nonlinear modulation effects.

         <title>Spectroscopic Properties of a Biologically Relevant [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2] Diamond Core Motif with a Short Iron&#8208;Iron Distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;closed&#8208;core&#8221; FeIII2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 complex containing diminished Fe coordination and short Fe&#8722;Fe separation is shown to reproduce the large pre&#8208;edge intensity typically associated with the &#8220;open&#8208;core&#8221; structure in intermediate Q of soluble methane monooxygenase. This finding may broaden the scope of structural models considered for high&#8208;valent diiron intermediates formed upon O2 activation in biology.







Abstract
Diiron cofactors in enzymes perform diverse challenging transformations. The structures of high valent intermediates (Q in methane monooxygenase and X in ribonucleotide reductase) are debated since Fe&#8722;Fe distances of 2.5&#8211;3.4&#8197;&#197; were attributed to &#8220;open&#8221; or &#8220;closed&#8221; cores with bridging or terminal oxido groups. We report the crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization of a FeIII2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 complex (2) with tetrahedral (4C) centres and short Fe&#8722;Fe distance (2.52&#8197;&#197;), persisting in organic solutions. 2 shows a large Fe K&#8208;pre&#8208;edge intensity, which is caused by the pronounced asymmetry at the TD FeIII centres due to the short Fe&#8722;&#956;&#8722;O bonds. A &#8776;2.5&#8197;&#197; Fe&#8722;Fe distance is unlikely for six&#8208;coordinate sites in Q or X, but for a Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 core containing four&#8208;coordinate (or by possible extension five&#8208;coordinate) iron centres there may be enough flexibility to accommodate a particularly short Fe&#8722;Fe separation with intense pre&#8208;edge transition. This finding may broaden the scope of models considered for the structure of high&#8208;valent diiron intermediates formed upon O2 activation in biology.

         <title>Reduction of Sulfur Dioxide to Sulfur Monoxide by Ferrous Porphyrin
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SO2 could be reduced to SO by an iron porphyrin via a [FeIII&#8722;SO]+ intermediate. This intermediate, which is proposed to be involved in sulfite reductase enzymes, has not been observed outside the protein matrix previously and was characterized by EPR, Mossbauer and resonance Raman spectroscopy. The SO formed could be transferred to an organic diene through a cycloaddition reaction.







Abstract
The reduction of SO2 to fixed forms of sulfur can address the growing concerns regarding its detrimental effect on health and the environment as well as enable its valorization into valuable chemicals. The naturally occurring heme enzyme sulfite reductase (SiR) is known to reduce SO2 to H2S and is an integral part of the global sulfur cycle. However, its action has not yet been mimicked in artificial systems outside of the protein matrix even after several decades of structural elucidation of the enzyme. While the coordination of SO2 to transition metals is documented, its reduction using molecular catalysts has remained elusive. Herein reduction of SO2 by iron(II) tetraphenylporphyrin is demonstrated. A combination of spectroscopic data backed up by theoretical calculations indicate that FeIITPP reduces SO2 by 2e&#8722;/2H+ to form an intermediate [FeIII&#8722;SO]+ species, also proposed for SiR, which releases SO. The SO obtained from the chemical reduction of SO2 could be evidenced in the form of a cheletropic adduct of butadiene resulting in an organic sulfoxide.

         <title>Facilitated Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aerobic Environment on a Copper&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After aerobic pretreatment, the MOF node of the hybrid catalyst was hydroxylated and exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4. Intriguingly, the addition of 20&#8201;% O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; rather, a fivefold increase was found when compared to the lack of O2.







Abstract
Herein, we fabricated a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking hybrid photocatalyst by combining two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials: g&#8208;C3N4 and a Cu&#8208;porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). After an aerobic photocatalytic pretreatment, this hybrid catalyst exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4 under the typical level (20&#8201;%) of O2 in the air. Intriguingly, the presence of O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; instead, a fivefold increase compared with that in the absence of O2 was observed. Structural analysis indicated that during aerobic pretreatment, the Cu node in the 2D&#8208;MOF moiety was hydroxylated by the hydroxyl generated from the reduction of O2. Then the formed hydroxylated Cu node maintained its structure during aerobic CO2 reduction, whereas it underwent structural alteration and was reductively devitalized in the absence of O2. Theoretical calculations further demonstrated that CO2 reduction, instead of O2 reduction, occurred preferentially on the hydroxylated Cu node.

         <title>Accelerated Transfer and Spillover of Carbon Monoxide through Tandem Catalysis for Kinetics&#8208;boosted Ethylene Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique *CO transfer and spillover strategy was developed by fabricating Ni single atom supported on pyridinic N&#8208;enriched carbon as a *CO donor for feeding Cu NPs with *CO, boosting the coverage of *CO on Cu NPs and subsequently improving the selectivity for CO2&#8208;C2H4 conversion.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been widely applied in electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) to produce multicarbon (C2+) feedstocks (e.g., C2H4). However, the high energy barriers for CO2 activation on the Cu surface is a challenge for a high catalytic efficiency and product selectivity. Herein, we developed an in situ *CO generation and spillover strategy by engineering single Ni atoms on a pyridinic N&#8208;enriched carbon support with a sodalite (SOD) topology (Ni&#8208;SOD/NC) that acted as a donor to feed adjacent Cu nanoparticles (NPs) with *CO intermediate. As a result, a high C2H4 selectivity of 62.5&#8201;% and an industrial&#8208;level current density of 160&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of &#8722;0.72&#8197;V were achieved. Our studies revealed that the isolated NiN3 active sites with adjacent pyridinic N species facilitated the *CO desorption and the massive *CO intermediate released from Ni&#8208;SOD/NC then overflowed to Cu NPs surface to enrich the *CO coverage for improving the selectivity of CO2ER to C2H4.

         <title>On the Reactivity of Phosphaalumenes towards C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphaalumenes react with alkynes and alkenes. Depending on the steric profile of the alkyne either 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumetes in a formal [2+2] cycloaddition or zwitterionic 1,4&#8208;phosphaaluminabarrelenes through threefold insertion into the Al&#8722;P bond are obtained. With alkenes 1,2&#8208;phosphalumates and 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinanes are obtained. Computational studies corroborate the contrasting pathways and underline the role of the aluminum center.







Abstract
Heterocycles containing group 13 and 15 elements such as borazines are an integral part of organic, biomedical and materials chemistry. Surprisingly, heterocycles containing P and Al are rare. We have now utilized phosphaalumenes in reactions with alkynes, alkenes and conjugated double bond systems. With sterically demanding alkynes 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumetes were afforded, whereas the reaction with HCCH or HCCSiMe3 gave 1,4&#8208;phosphaaluminabarrelenes. Using styrene saturated 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumates were formed, which reacted further with additional styrene to give different regio&#8208;isomers of 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinanes. Using ethylene, a 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinane is obtained, while with 1,3&#8208;butadiene a bicyclic system containing an aluminacyclopentane and a phosphirane unit was synthesized. The experimental work is supported by theoretical studies to shed light on the mechanism governing the formation of these heterocycles.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;pre&#8208;division metal clusters&#8221; strategy is first conceived to fabricate dual&#8208;active center catalysts (Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500) with dispersed CoN4 and Co2P sites. The optimal catalyst executes superior ORR activity and applies in ultralong Zn&#8208;air batteries surpassing the benchmark 20&#8201;% Pt/C. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the dual&#8208;active sits synergistically quicken the formation energy of *OOH intermediate, greatly boosting the performance.







Abstract
To conquer the bottleneck of sluggish kinetics in cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of metal&#8208;air batteries, catalysts with dual&#8208;active centers have stood out. Here, a &#8220;pre&#8208;division metal clusters&#8221; strategy is firstly conceived to fabricate a N,S&#8208;dual doped honeycomb&#8208;like carbon matrix inlaid with CoN4 sites and wrapped Co2P nanoclusters as dual&#8208;active centers (Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500). A crystalline {CoII2} coordination cluster divided by periphery second organic layers is well&#8208;designed to realize delocalized dispersion before calcination.

     alt="A &#8220;Pre-Division Metal Clusters&#8221; Strategy to Mediate Efficient Dual-Active Sites ORR Catalyst for Ultralong Rechargeable Zn-Air Battery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;pre-division metal clusters&#8221; strategy is first conceived to fabricate dual-active center catalysts (Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P/CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NSC-500) with dispersed CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P sites. The optimal catalyst executes superior ORR activity and applies in ultralong Zn-air batteries surpassing the benchmark 20&#8201;% Pt/C. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the dual-active sits synergistically quicken the formation energy of *OOH intermediate, greatly boosting the performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conquer the bottleneck of sluggish kinetics in cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of metal-air batteries, catalysts with dual-active centers have stood out. Here, a &#8220;pre-division metal clusters&#8221; strategy is firstly conceived to fabricate a N,S-dual doped honeycomb-like carbon matrix inlaid with CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites and wrapped Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P nanoclusters as dual-active centers (Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P/CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NSC-500). A crystalline &lt;b&gt;{Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;}&lt;/b&gt; coordination cluster divided by periphery second organic layers is well-designed to realize delocalized dispersion before calcination. The optimal Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P/CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NSC-500 executes excellent 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR activity surpassing the benchmark Pt/C. Theoretical calculation results reveal that the CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites and Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P nanoclusters can synergistically quicken the formation of *OOH on Co sites. The rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB) assembled by Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P/CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NSC-500 delivers ultralong cycling stability over 1742&#8197;hours (3484&#8197;cycles) under 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and can light up a 2.4&#8197;V LED bulb for &#8776;264&#8197;hours, evidencing the promising practical application potentials in portable devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yields in Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Antimony (III) Chlorides with the [SbCl5] Geometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five pairs of antimony chlorides have been synthesized via two synthetic conditions to produce distinctively different structures and PL properties. The A2SbCl5 types with square pyramidal [SbCl5] geometry and near&#8208;unity PLQY can be synthesized via diffusion method in DMF. Alternatively, when growing via solution method in HCl, the non&#8208;emissive A2Sb2Cl8 types with seesaw dimmer geometry are obtained.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic antimony halides have attracted increasing attention due to the non&#8208;toxicity, stability, and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). To shed light on the structural factors that contribute to the high PLQY, five pairs of antimony halides with general formula A2SbCl5 and A2Sb2Cl8 are synthesized via two distinct methods and characterized. The A2SbCl5 type adopts square pyramidal [SbCl5] geometry with near&#8208;unity PLQY, while the A2Sb2Cl8 adopts seesaw dimmer [Sb2Cl8] geometry with PLQY&#8776;0&#8201;%. Through combined data analysis with the literature, we have found that A2SbCl5 series with square pyramidal geometry generally has much longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distances, leading to more expressed lone pairs of SbIII. Additional factors including Sb&#8722;Cl distance and stability of antimony chlorides may also affect PLQY. Our targeted synthesis and correlated insights provide efficient tools to precisely form highly emissive materials for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Catalytic Method for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Ketones, &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of versatile &#945;&#8208;quaternary acyclic ketones, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and aldehydes, by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles. Transformations employ simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a chiral phosphine, and generate a broad range of products bearing difficult to access dialkyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters in good yields and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A practical method for the efficient and enantioselective preparation of versatile ketones and aldehydes that contain an &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter is described. Reactions utilize simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a monodentate chiral phosphine, and afford a variety of aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and alkyl&#8208;substituted ketone and aldehyde products in 25&#8211;94&#8201;% yield and 90&#8201;:&#8201;10 to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio. Reactions proceed by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles, and display selectivity and conversion dependence on a protic additive. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through several product transformations.

         <title>Fully Delocalized Mixed&#8208;Valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 Complex: Strong Cu&#8208;Cu interaction and Fast Electron Self&#8208;Exchange Rate Despite Large Structural Changes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicopper complexes in the CuICuI and mixed&#8208;valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 states have been synthesized and comprehensively characterized, revealing a high delocalization energy of the mixed&#8208;valent species comparable with the biological CuA site. Fast electron self&#8208;exchange is suggested to occur via a sequential ET pathway, involving an active conformational isomer of the flexible CuICuI species, pointing to a potential gating scenario for ET.







Abstract
A flexible macrocyclic ligand with two tridentate {CNC} compartments can host two Cu ions in reversibly interconvertible states, CuICuI (1) and mixed&#8208;valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 (2). They were characterized by XRD and multiple spectroscopic methods, including EPR, UV/Vis absorption and MCD, in combination with TD&#8208;DFT and CASSCF calculations. 2 features a short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu distance (&#8776;2.5&#8197;&#197;; compared to &#8776;4.0&#8197;&#197; in 1) and a very high delocalization energy of 13&#8201;000&#8197;cm&#8722;1, comparable to the mixed&#8208;valent state of the biological CuA site. Electron self&#8208;exchange between 1 and 2 is rapid despite large structural reorganization, and is proposed to proceed via a sequential mechanism involving an active conformer of 1, viz. 1&#8242;; the latter has been characterized by XRD. Such electron transfer (ET) process is reminiscent of the conformationally gated ET proposed for biological systems. This redox couple is a unique pair of flexible dicopper complexes, achieving fast electron self&#8208;exchange closely related to the function of the CuA site.

         <title>Double Asymmetric Core Optimizes Crystal Packing to Enable Selenophene&#8208;based Acceptor with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomeric A&#8208;D1A&#8242;D2&#8208;A type double asymmetric selenophene&#8208;based small molecule acceptors (SMAs) were synthesized by a n&#8208;nonyl/undecyl regioisomeric strategy to optimize single&#8208;crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance. PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl achieved a superior PCE of 18.12&#8201;% compared to PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain tailoring is a promising method to optimize the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, asymmetric alkyl chain&#8208;based small molecular acceptors (SMAs) are still difficult to afford. Herein, we adopted a novel asymmetric n&#8208;nonyl/undecyl substitution strategy and synthesized two A&#8208;D1A&#8242;D2&#8208;A double asymmetric isomeric SMAs with asymmetric selenophene&#8208;based central core for OSCs. Crystallographic analysis indicates that AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl forms a more compact and order intermolecular packing compared to AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl, which contributed to higher electron mobility in neat AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl film. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl blend film shows a better morphology with appropriate phase separation and distinct face&#8208;on orientation than PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl. The OSCs with PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl obtain a superior PCE of 18.12&#8201;% compared to PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl (17.52&#8201;%), which is the best efficiency for the selenium&#8208;incorporated SMAs in binary BHJ OSCs. Our findings elucidate that the promising double asymmetric strategy with isomeric alkyl chains precisely modulates the crystal packing and enhances the photovoltaic efficiency of selenophene&#8208;incorporated SMAs.

&lt;p&gt;Two isomeric A-D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&#8242;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-A type double asymmetric selenophene-based small molecule acceptors (SMAs) were synthesized by a &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-nonyl/undecyl regioisomeric strategy to optimize single-crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance. &lt;b&gt;PM6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;AYT9Se11-Cl&lt;/b&gt; achieved a superior PCE of 18.12&#8201;% compared to &lt;b&gt;PM6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;AYT11Se9-Cl&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side-chain tailoring is a promising method to optimize the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, asymmetric alkyl chain-based small molecular acceptors (SMAs) are still difficult to afford. Herein, we adopted a novel asymmetric &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-nonyl/undecyl substitution strategy and synthesized two A-D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;A&#8242;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-A double asymmetric isomeric SMAs with asymmetric selenophene-based central core for OSCs. Crystallographic analysis indicates that &lt;b&gt;AYT9Se11-Cl&lt;/b&gt; forms a more compact and order intermolecular packing compared to &lt;b&gt;AYT11Se9-Cl&lt;/b&gt;, which contributed to higher electron mobility in neat &lt;b&gt;AYT9Se11-Cl&lt;/b&gt; film. Moreover, the &lt;b&gt;PM6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;AYT9Se11-Cl&lt;/b&gt; blend film shows a better morphology with appropriate phase separation and distinct face-on orientation than &lt;b&gt;PM6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;AYT11Se9-Cl&lt;/b&gt;. The OSCs with &lt;b&gt;PM6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;AYT9Se11-Cl&lt;/b&gt; obtain a superior PCE of 18.12&#8201;% compared to &lt;b&gt;PM6&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;b&gt;AYT11Se9-Cl&lt;/b&gt; (17.52&#8201;%), which is the best efficiency for the selenium-incorporated SMAs in binary BHJ OSCs.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Energy Storage Devices: Novel Benzothiadiazole Functionalized Two&#8208;Dimensional Olefin&#8208;Linked COFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel and structurally robust olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs), where benzothiadiazole units are explored as novel electrochemically&#8208;active groups. Our COFs exhibit an outstanding Zn2+ storage capability, delivering a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art capacity of 283.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. We shed light onto the charge&#8208;storage mechanism through the benzothiadiazole units in the COFs electrodes via computational and experimental analyses.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials for energy storage applications exhibiting enhanced electrochemical performance. While most of the reported organic cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion batteries use carbonyl groups as electrochemically&#8208;active sites, their high hydrophilicity in aqueous electrolytes represents a critical drawback. Herein, we report a novel and structurally robust olefin&#8208;linked COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT synthesized via the aldol condensation between 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TMT) and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;diyl)dibenzaldehyde (BT), where benzothiadiazole units are explored as novel electrochemically&#8208;active groups. Our COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT exhibits an outstanding Zn2+ storage capability, delivering a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art capacity of 283.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that the charge&#8208;storage mechanism in COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT electrodes is based on the supramolecularly engineered and reversible Zn2+ coordination by the benzothiadiazole units.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the new conjugated units, dinaphthylanthracene diimides (DNADIs) were designed and synthesized. By fine&#8208;tuning of substitution sites, good optoelectronic integration with high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 26&#8201;%, high electron mobility of 0.02&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and especially the feature of hot&#8208;exciton induced delayed fluorescence was obtained.







Abstract
The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is of great significance for the fabrication of miniaturized optoelectronic devices, such as organic light emitting transistors. However, great challenge exists in designing key materials, especially those who integrates triplet exciton utilization ability. Herein, dinaphthylanthracene diimides (DNADIs), with 2,6&#8208;extended anthracene donor, and 3&#8242;&#8208; or 4&#8242;&#8208;substituted naphthalene monoimide acceptors were designed and synthesized. By introducing acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor structure, both materials show high electron mobility. Moreover, by fine&#8208;tuning of substitution sites, good integration with high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 26&#8201;%, high electron mobility of 0.02&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the feature of hot&#8208;exciton induced delayed fluorescence were obtained in 4&#8242;&#8208;DNADI. This work opens a new avenue for developing high electron mobility emissive organic semiconductors with efficient utilization of triplet excitons.

         <title>Ultramicroporous Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with Functionality Pair for Membrane C2H2/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D covalent organic framework (COF) with ultramicroporous structure and paired functionalities is designed and synthesized. This COF is exfoliated into large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets, enabling the fabrication of compatible hybrid membranes. The COF membranes exhibit superior acetylene/ethylene separation with high selectivity and large permeability owing to collaborative acetylene recognition and gas&#8208;transport highways.







Abstract
Gas separation efficiency of covalent organic framework (COF) membrane can be greatly elevated through precise functionalization. A pair&#8208;functionalized COF membrane of 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and isoquinoline&#8208;5,8&#8208;diamine (IQD) monomers in two and three nodes is designed and synthesized. TP&#8208;IQD is crystallized in a two&#8208;dimensional structure with a pore size of 6.5&#8197;&#197; and a surface area of 289&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. This COF possesses N&#8722;O paired groups which cooperatively interact with C2H2 instead of C2H4. TP&#8208;IQD nanosheets of &#8776;10&#8197;&#956;m in width and &#8776;4&#8197;nm in thickness are prepared by mechanical exfoliation; they are further processed with 6FDA&#8208;ODA polymer into a hybrid membrane. High porosity and functionality pair of TP&#8208;IQD offer the membrane with significantly increased C2H2 permeability and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity which are 160&#8201;% and 430&#8201;% higher of pure 6FDA&#8208;ODA. The boosted performance demonstrates high efficiency of the pair&#8208;functionality strategy for the synthesis of separation&#8208;led COFs.

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of Isomeric Naphthalene&#8208;Based 2D Kagome Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted synthesis of two isomeric naphthalene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with Kagome topology is realized by rational design of isomeric &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomers with different length of substituents. The specific pore structures of the two isomeric frameworks result in a significant difference in spatial immobilization of C60 guests. Incorporation of C60 into m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF increases the photoconductivity of m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF, presumably due to the enhanced charge transfer effect.







Abstract
Targeted synthesis of kagome (kgm) topologic 2D covalent organic frameworks remains challenging, presumably due to the severe dependence on building units and synthetic conditions. Herein, two isomeric &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomers with different lengths of substituted arms based on naphthalene core (p&#8208;Naph and m&#8208;Naph) are elaborately designed and utilized for the defined synthesis of isomeric kgm Naph&#8208;COFs. The two isomeric frameworks exhibit splendid crystallinity and showcase the same chemical composition and topologic structure with, however, different pore channels. Interestingly, C60 is able to uniformly be encapsulated into the triangle channels of m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF via in situ incorporation method, while not the isomeric p&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF, likely due to the different pore structures of the two isomeric COFs. The resulting stable C60@m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF composite exhibits much higher photoconductivity than the m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF owing to charge transfer between the conjugated skeletons and C60 guests.

     alt="Targeted Synthesis of Isomeric Naphthalene-Based 2D Kagome Covalent Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted synthesis of two isomeric naphthalene-based covalent organic frameworks with Kagome topology is realized by rational design of isomeric &#8220;two-in-one&#8221; monomers with different length of substituents. The specific pore structures of the two isomeric frameworks result in a significant difference in spatial immobilization of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; guests. Incorporation of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; into &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-Naph-COF increases the photoconductivity of &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-Naph-COF, presumably due to the enhanced charge transfer effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted synthesis of kagome (&lt;b&gt;kgm&lt;/b&gt;) topologic 2D covalent organic frameworks remains challenging, presumably due to the severe dependence on building units and synthetic conditions. Herein, two isomeric &#8220;two-in-one&#8221; monomers with different lengths of substituted arms based on naphthalene core (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-Naph and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-Naph) are elaborately designed and utilized for the defined synthesis of isomeric &lt;b&gt;kgm&lt;/b&gt; Naph-COFs. The two isomeric frameworks exhibit splendid crystallinity and showcase the same chemical composition and topologic structure with, however, different pore channels. Interestingly, C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; is able to uniformly be encapsulated into the triangle channels of &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-Naph-COF via in situ incorporation method, while not the isomeric &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-Naph-COF, likely due to the different pore structures of the two isomeric COFs.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxylic Acids by Manganese Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Primary Alcohols
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthesis of highly demanded &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids via dehydrogenative coupling of two feedstock chemicals, ethylene glycol, and primary alcohols, is reported. An Earth's abundant metal complex catalyzes the reaction with high yields and selectivities. Water and hydrogen gas are produced as the sole byproducts.







Abstract
Herein, we report a straightforward synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid molecules via an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol and primary alcohols. A bench&#8208;stable manganese complex catalyzed the reaction, which is scalable, with the product being isolated with high yields and selectivities under mild conditions. The protocol is environmentally benign, producing water and hydrogen gas as the only byproducts. Methanol can also be used as a C1 source for producing the platform molecule lactic acid, with a high turnover of &gt;104. The methodology was also used to functionalize alcohols derived from natural products and fatty acids. Furthermore, it was applied for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;amino acid, &#945;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acid, and several drugs and bioactive molecules, including endogenous metabolites, Danshensu, Enalapril, Lisinopril, and Rosmarinic acid. Preliminary mechanistic studies were performed to shed light on the mechanism involved in the reaction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Doyle&#8211;Kirmse Reaction of Azide&#8208;Ynamides via &#945;&#8208;Imino Copper Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse of azide&#8208;ynamides via &#945;&#8208;imino copper carbenes is disclosed, enabling the practical and divergent assembly of chiral [1,4]thiazino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. This protocol represents the first asymmetric Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and the first asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.







Abstract
[2,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic rearrangement reaction involving sulfonium ylide (Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction) generated from metal carbenes represents one of the powerful methods for the construction of C(sp3)&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bonds. Although significant advances have been achieved, the asymmetric versions via the generation of sulfonium ylides from metal carbenes have been rarely reported to date, and they have so far been limited to diazo compounds as metal carbene precursors. Here, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via azide&#8208;ynamide cyclization, leading to the practical and divergent assembly of an array of chiral [1,4]thiazino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol represents a unique catalytic asymmetric Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and an unprecedented asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.

         <title>Synchronous Dual Electrolyte Additive Sustains Zn Metal Anode with 5600&#8197;h Lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synchronous dual electrolyte additive sustains reversible Zn metal anode: A dual electrolyte additive strategy is developed via the direct addition of xylitol and graphene oxide species into common zinc sulfate electrolyte. Progressive nucleation and orientational deposition can be readily obtained under the synergistic additive regulation, thus enabling a dense and uniform deposition with a lifespan of 5600&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Despite conspicuous merits of Zn metal anodes, the commercialization is still handicapped by rampant dendrite formation and notorious side reaction. Manipulating the nucleation mode and deposition orientation of Zn is a key to rendering stabilized Zn anodes. Here, a dual electrolyte additive strategy is put forward via the direct cooperation of xylitol (XY) and graphene oxide (GO) species into typical zinc sulfate electrolyte. As verified by molecular dynamics simulations, the incorporated XY molecules could regulate the solvation structure of Zn2+, thus inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. The self&#8208;assembled GO layer is in favor of facilitating the desolvation process to accelerate reaction kinetics. Progressive nucleation and orientational deposition can be realized under the synergistic modulation, enabling a dense and uniform Zn deposition. Consequently, symmetric cell based on dual additives harvests a highly reversible cycling of 5600&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Generation of Allylmagnesium Reagents by Hydromagnesiation of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes</title>

         <dc:description>
Magnesium hydride, generated in situ by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride and magnesium iodide in tetrahydrofuran, was found capable of inducing regio and stereocontrolled hydromagnesiation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes to form allylmagnesium species. Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium species with various electrophiles provided synthetically valuable synthons such as homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes.







Abstract
A protocol for the generation of allylmagnesium reagents from 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes was developed using magnesium hydride (MgH2) that is generated in situ by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride (NaH) and magnesium iodide (MgI2) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium reagents with carbonyl compounds or alkyl (pseudo)halides delivers branched products having an allylic quaternary carbon center, whereas that with chlorosilanes resulted in formation of linear allylsilanes in regio and stereoselective manners. Further derivatizations of the homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes were also demonstrated.

The (002) plane textured Zn metal is realized by using a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy in a low&#8208;cost Zn(CH3COO)2 aqueous electrolyte. Increasing the current density not only accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei but also boosts the growth rate of (100) crystal plane, thus enabling the final exposure of (002) surface for Zn electrodeposits.







Abstract
Crystallography modulation of zinc (Zn) metal anode is promising to promote Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes, but efficiently constructing Zn with specific crystallographic texture remains challenging. Herein, we report a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy to texture the Zn electrodeposits in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Using the electrolytic cell with low&#8208;cost Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte and Cu substrate as a model system, the texture of as&#8208;deposited Zn gradually transforms from (101) to (002) crystal plane as increasing the current density from 20 to 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the high current accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei, enabling uniform deposition. The (002) texture permits stronger resistance to dendrite growth and interfacial side reactions than the (101) texture. The resultant (002)&#8208;textured Zn electrode achieves deep cycling stability and supports the stable operation of full batteries with conventional V/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes.

         <title>Halide Layer Cathodes for Compatible and Fast&#8208;charged Halides&#8208;based All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insertion&#8208;type compounds based on oxides and sulfides have been widely identified and well&#8208;studied as cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, halides have rarely been used due to their high solubility in organic liquid electrolytes. Here, we reveal the insertion electrochemistry of VX3 (X&#8201;=&#8201;Cl, Br, I) by introducing a compatible halide solid&#8208;state electrolyte with a wide electrochemical stability window. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analyses reveal a two&#8208;step lithiation process and the structural transition of typical VCl3. Fast Li+ insertion/extraction in the layered VX3 active materials and favorable interface guaranteed by the compatible electrode&#8208;electrolyte design enables high rate capability and stable operation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;VX3 batteries. The findings from this study will contribute to developing intercalation insertion electrochemistry of halide materials and exploring novel electrode materials in viable energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state in chromophoric pair (DC&#8208;PDI2) that uniquely integrates the advantages of fundamental processes of photosynthetic reaction centers i) Symmetry&#8208;breaking charge&#8208;separation and ii) Marcus inverted&#8208;region dependence. The near&#8208;orthogonal bichromophoric DC&#8208;PDI2 manifests ultrafast evolution of the SB&#8208;CS state with a time constant of &#964;SB&#8208;CS&#160;= 0.35&#177;0.02 ps and slow charge recombination (CR) kinetics with &#964;CR= 4.09&#177;0.01 ns in ACN. The rate constant of CR of DC&#8208;PDI2 is 11686 times slower than SB&#8208;CS in ACN, as the CR of PDI radical ion&#8208;pair occurs in the deep inverted region of Marcus parabola ( [[EQUATION]] &gt;&#955;). While an analogous benzyloxy (BnO)&#8208;substituted DC&#8208;BPDI2 showcases ~10&#8208;fold accelerated CR kinetics with &#964;CR/&#964;SB&#8208;CS&#160;lowering to ~1538 in ACN, by virtue of decreased CR driving force. The present investigation demonstrates the control of molecular engineering to tune the energetics and kinetics of the SB&#8208;CS material, which is essential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, major advances have been made in homogenous gold catalysis. However, Au(I)/Au(III) catalytic cycle remains much less explored due to the reluctance of Au(I) to undergo oxidative addition and the stability of the Au(III) intermediate. Herein, we report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the development of a new class of L&#8208;shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy = imidazo[1,5&#8208;&#945;]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in combination with strong &#963;&#8208;donation of the carbene center in a rigid conformation, imposed by the ligand architecture. Detailed characterization and control studies reveal key ligand features for Au(I)/Au(III) redox cycle, wherein the hemilabile nitrogen is placed at the coordinating position of a rigid framework. Given the tremendous significance of homogenous gold catalysis, we anticipate that this ligand platform will find widespread application.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of facile methodologies to afford robust supported metal nanocatalysts under mild conditions is highly desirable yet challenging, particularly via strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) construction.  State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches capable of generating SMSI encapsulation mainly focus on high temperature annealing in reductive/oxidative atmosphere.  Herein,  ultra&#8208;stable metal nanocatalysts based on SMSI construction were produced by leveraging the instantaneous high&#8208;energy input from ultrasonication under ambient conditions in H  2  O, which could rapidly afford abundant active intermediates, Ti  3+  ions, and oxygen vacancies within the scaffolds to induce the SMSI overlayer formation. The encapsulation degree could be tuned and controlled via reducibility of the solvents and the ultrasonication parameters. This facile and efficient approach could be further extended to diverse metal oxide supports and noble metal NPs leading to enhanced performance in hydrogenation reactions and CO  2  conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Siloxane Bond Exchanges: from a Molecular Study to vitrimerization and recycling of Silicone Elastomers.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activity of various additives promoting siloxane equilibration reactions is examined and quantified on model compounds.&#160; We found in particular that the &#8220;superbase&#8221; phosphazene derivative P4&#8208;tBu &#160;can promote very fast exchanges (a few seconds at 90 &#176;C) even at low concentration (&lt;0.1 wt%). We demonstrate that permanent silicone networks can be transformed into reprocessable and recyclable dynamic networks by mere introduction of such additives. Annealing at high temperature degrades the additives and deactivates the dynamic features of the silicone networks, reverting them back into permanent networks. A simple rheological experiment and the corresponding model allow to extract the critical kinetic parameters to predict and control such deactivations.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Transition&#8208;Metal Migration in Layered Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes: Random Na Extraction and Na&#8208;Free Layer Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation migration often occurs in layered oxide cathodes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the similar ion radius of Li and transition metals (TMs).&#160;Although Na and TM show a big difference of ion radius, TMs in layered cathodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) can still migrate to Na layer, leading to serious electrochemical degeneration. To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na&#8208;free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru&#8208;contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na&#8208;free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conductive Supramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Superstructures for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8722;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With fast (de)coordination kinetics, the smallest and the lightest proton stands out as the most ideal charge carrier for aqueous Zn&#8722;organic batteries (ZOBs). Hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks with rapid Grotthuss proton conduction is particularly suitable for organic cathodes, yet not reported. We report the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of cyanuric acid and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triamine into organic superstructures through in&#8208;plane H&#8208;bonds and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. The supramolecular superstructures exhibit highly stable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key H&#8208;bonding networks with an ultralow activation energy for protonation (0.09 eV vs. 0.25 eV of zincification). Then, high&#8208;kinetics H+ coordination is prior to Zn2+ into protophilic C=O sites via a two&#8208;step nine&#8208;electron reaction. The assembled ZOBs show high&#8208;rate capability (135 mAh g&#8722;1 at 150 A g&#8722;1), high energy density (267 Wh kg&#8722;1cathode) and ultra&#8208;long life (50,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1), becoming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs in comprehensive performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomolecular click reactions using a minimal pH&#8208;activated Catcher/Tag pair for producing native&#8208;sized spider&#8208;silk proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A type of protein/peptide pair known as Catcher/Tag pair spontaneously forms an intermolecular isopeptide bond which can be applied for biomolecular click reactions. Covalent protein conjugation using Catcher/Tag pairs has turned out to be a valuable tool in biotechnology and biomedicines, but it is essential to increase the current toolbox of orthogonal Catcher/Tag pairs to expand the range of applications further, for example, for controlled multiple&#8208;fragment ligation. We report here the engineering of novel Catcher/Tag pairs for protein ligation, aided by a crystal structure of a minimal CnaB domain from Lactobacillus plantarum. We show that a newly engineered pair, called SilkCatcher/Tag enables efficient pH&#8208;inducible protein ligation in addition to being compatible with the widely used SpyCatcher/Tag pair. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the SilkCatcher/Tag pair in the production of native&#8208;sized highly repetitive spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like proteins with &gt;90% purity, which is not possible by traditional recombinant production methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Quadruple Catenation of Giant Chiral [8+12] Salicylimine Cubes Driven by Weak Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked structures are fascinating synthetic targets and the topological complexity achieved through catenation offers numerous possibilities for the construction of new molecules with exciting properties. In the structural space of catenated organic cage molecules, only few examples have been realized so far, and control over the catenation process in solution is still barely achieved. Herein, we describe the formation of a quadruply interlocked catenane of giant chiral [8+12] salicylimine cubes. The formation could be controlled by the choice of solvent used in the reaction. The interlocked structure was unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and weak hydrogen bonding was identified as a central driving force for the catenation. Furthermore, scrambling experiments using partially deuterated cages were performed, revealing that the catenane formation occurs through mechanical interlocking of preformed single cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Macromolecular Information Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macromolecular information transfer can be defined as the process by which a coded monomer sequence is communicated from one macromolecule to another. In such a transfer process, the information sequence can be kept identical, transformed into a complementary sequence or even translated into a different molecular language. Such mechanisms are crucial in biology and take place in DNA&#8594;DNA replication, DNA&#8594;RNA transcription and RNA&#8594;protein translation. In fact, there would be no life on Earth without macromolecular information transfer. Mimicking such processes with synthetic macromolecules would also be of major scientific relevance because it would open up new avenues for technological applications (e.g. data storage and processing) but also for the creation of artificial life. In this important context, this minireview summarizes recent research about information transfer in synthetic oligomers and polymers. Medium&#8208; and long&#8208;term perspectives are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Lone Pair Expression as Chemical Bonding Origin of Giant Phonon Anharmonicity in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Loosely bonded (&#8220;rattling&#8221;) atoms with s2 lone pair electrons are usually associated with strong anharmonicity and unexpectedly low thermal conductivity, yet their detailed correlation remains largely unknown. Here we resolve this correlation in thermoelectric InTe by combining chemical bonding analysis, inelastic X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering, and first principles phonon calculations. We successfully probe soft low&#8208;lying transverse phonons dominated by large In1+ z&#8208;axis motions, and their giant anharmonicity. We show that the highly anharmonic phonons arise from the dynamic lone pair expression with unstable occupied antibonding states induced by the covalency between delocalized In1+ 5s2 lone pair electrons and Te 5p states. This work pinpoints the microscopic origin of strong anharmonicity driven by rattling atoms with stereochemical lone pair activity, important for designing efficient materials for thermoelectric energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymeric Extracellular Matrix Nanoremodeler for Activatable Cancer Photo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer immunotherapy has shown potential to train the intrinsic immune system against malignancy. However, the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor microenvironment forms a formidable barrier to restrict the penetration of therapeutic drugs and prevent the infiltration of immune cells. We herein report a semiconducting polymer&#8208;based ECM nanoremodeler (SPNcb) for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy, which has photodynamic antitumor activity and cancer&#8208;specific inhibition of collagen&#8208;crosslinking enzymes (LOX: lysyl oxidase). SPNcb is an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer conjugated with a LOX inhibitor (&#946;&#8208;aminopropionitrile, BAPN) via a cancer biomarker&#8208;cleavable segment. BAPN can be released from SPNcb and activated to inhibit LOX activity in the presence of the cancer biomarker, blocking collagen crosslinking and decreasing ECM stiffness. Such an ECM nanoremodeler synergizes immunogenic phototherapy and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to improve the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.</dc:description>

BAPN can be released from SPNcb and activated to inhibit LOX activity in the presence of the cancer biomarker, blocking collagen crosslinking and decreasing ECM stiffness. Such an ECM nanoremodeler synergizes immunogenic phototherapy and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to improve the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the comparatively lower rotational barriers, the catalytic asymmetric construction of axially chiral biaryl structures, especially those containing a five&#8208;membered heterocycle, still remains a challenge. Herein, we described a general and modular protocol to access atropisomeric arylpyrazole scaffolds containing a phosphorus unit by a dipeptide phosphonium salt catalyzed reaction involving an oxidative central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion. This reaction features excellent yields and enantioselectivities, broad substrate scope, and a low catalyst loading, delivering axially chiral phosphine compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Nickel Thiolate Complexes for Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to C1&#8211;3 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bioinspired molecular nickel thiolate complexes exhibit impressive electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction on carbon paper, with a Faradaic efficiency of 41&#8201;% for hydrocarbons. C3 hydrocarbons were reported for the first time from molecular complexes.







Abstract
We report the unprecedented electrocatalytic activity of a series of molecular nickel thiolate complexes (1&#8211;5) in reducing CO2 to C1&#8211;3 hydrocarbons on carbon paper in pH&#8208;neutral aqueous solutions. Ni(mpo)2 (3, mpo=2&#8208;mercaptopyridyl&#8208;N&#8208;oxide), Ni(pyS)3&#8722; (4, pyS=2&#8208;mercaptopyridine), and Ni(mp)2&#8722; (5, mp=2&#8208;mercaptophenolate) were found to generate C3 products from CO2 for the first time in molecular complex. Compound 5 exhibits Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of 10.6&#8201;%, 7.2&#8201;%, 8.2&#8201;% for C1, C2, C3 hydrocarbons respectively at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Addition of CO to the system significantly promotes the FEC1&#8211;C3 to 41.1&#8201;%, suggesting that a key Ni&#8722;CO intermediate is associated with catalysis. A variety of spectroscopies have been performed to show that the structures of nickel complexes remain intact during CO2 reduction.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;ion Mobility in Li6B18(Li3N) and Li Vacancy Tuning in the Solid Solution Li6B18(Li3N)1&#8722;x(Li2O)x</title>

         <dc:description>
A new concept for compounds with high lithium ion mobility based on a rigid open&#8208;framework boron structure is reported. The host&#8211;guest structure Li6B18(Li3N) comprises large hexagonal pores filled with 
Li7N] strands. The formation of the solid solution of Li6B18(Li3N) and Li6B18(Li2O) over the complete compositional range allows the tuning of lithium defects in the template structure that is not possible for pristine Li3N and Li2O.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are promising candidates for safe energy&#8208;storage systems due to non&#8208;flammable solid electrolytes and the possibility to use metallic lithium as an anode. Thus, there is a challenge to design new solid electrolytes and to understand the principles of ion conduction on an atomic scale. We report on a new concept for compounds with high lithium ion mobility based on a rigid open&#8208;framework boron structure. The host&#8211;guest structure Li6B18(Li3N) comprises large hexagonal pores filled with 
Li7N] strands that represent a perfect cutout from the structure of &#945;&#8208;Li3N. Variable&#8208;temperature 7Li&#8197;NMR spectroscopy reveals a very high Li mobility in the template phase with a remarkably low activation energy below 19&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and thus much lower than pristine Li3N. The formation of the solid solution of Li6B18(Li3N) and Li6B18(Li2O) over the complete compositional range allows the tuning of lithium defects in the template structure that is not possible for pristine Li3N and Li2O.

         <title>Designing High&#8208;Donicity Anions for Rechargeable Potassium Superoxide/Peroxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following the concept of &#8220;Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Anion&#8221; design, the asymmetric anion (MPSA&#8722;) with high donicity was synthesized and validated to boost the reversibility of potassium superoxide/peroxide redox without any electrocatalysts. Such anions could effectively retard the electrode passivation with enhanced discharge capacity and facilitate the K2O2 decomposition out of the substrate.







Abstract
A battery cathode based on the superoxide/peroxide redox not only inherits the advantage of oxygen (O2) batteries in high capacities and low costs but also overcomes the disadvantages in O2 storage, electrolyte evaporation, and anode deactivation due to O2 crossover. Herein, we report an enhanced potassium superoxide (KO2)/peroxide (K2O2) conversion by adopting a high&#8208;donicity anion additive in the ether&#8208;based electrolyte. Such an anion was synthesized via a &#8220;Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Anion&#8221; strategy and validated to enhance the electron donicity of the electrolyte. The use of high&#8208;donicity anion could lead to enhanced KO2 utilization (&#8776;90.2&#8201;%) by retarding electrode passivation and allow the full charging back of K2O2 through the solution&#8208;mediated pathway without electrocatalysts. No apparent cell degradation is observed during the first 120&#8197;cycles by controlling the reversible depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge capacity at 292&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1
 within an O2&#8208;free region. The K&#8722;KO2 cell delivers a high energy efficiency (&gt;84.4&#8201;%) and a lifespan of over 1440&#8197;hours.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Incorporated Sn Catalysts for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our work, a facile hydrolysis method was developed to synthesize halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalysts. The introduction and retention of halogen dopants were verified by a collection of ex situ and in situ characterizations, which rendered a more positive valence state of Sn and as a result promoted CO2RR to formate, while suppressing the competing CO2RR to CO and HER.







Abstract
Electrochemically reducing CO2 to valuable fuels or feedstocks is recognized as a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the crises of fossil fuel shortage and carbon emission. Sn&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to make formic acid/formate, which unfortunately still suffer from low activity, selectivity and stability. In this work, halogen (F, Cl, Br or I) was introduced into the Sn catalyst by a facile hydrolysis method. The presence of halogen was confirmed by a collection of ex situ and in situ characterizations, which rendered a more positive valence state of Sn in halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalyst as compared to unmodified Sn under cathodic potentials in CO2RR and therefore tuned the adsorption strength of the key intermediate (*OCHO) toward formate formation.

     alt="Halogen-Incorporated Sn Catalysts for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our work, a facile hydrolysis method was developed to synthesize halogen-incorporated Sn catalysts. The introduction and retention of halogen dopants were verified by a collection of ex situ and in situ characterizations, which rendered a more positive valence state of Sn and as a result promoted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to formate, while suppressing the competing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to CO and HER.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemically reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to valuable fuels or feedstocks is recognized as a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the crises of fossil fuel shortage and carbon emission. Sn-based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) to make formic acid/formate, which unfortunately still suffer from low activity, selectivity and stability. In this work, halogen (F, Cl, Br or I) was introduced into the Sn catalyst by a facile hydrolysis method. The presence of halogen was confirmed by a collection of ex situ and in situ characterizations, which rendered a more positive valence state of Sn in halogen-incorporated Sn catalyst as compared to unmodified Sn under cathodic potentials in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and therefore tuned the adsorption strength of the key intermediate (*OCHO) toward formate formation. As a result, the halogen-incorporated Sn catalyst exhibited greatly enhanced catalytic performance in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to produce formate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast Li&#8208;ion Storage and Dynamics in TiO2 Nanoparticle Clusters Probed by Smart Scanning Electrochemical Cell Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (s&#8208;SECCM), achieved through in situ interference reflection microscopy, enables the high throughput analysis of individual TiO2 nanoparticle clusters to estimate the Li+ diffusivity and reveal the inherent fast charging capability of small TiO2 nanoparticle clusters.







Abstract
Anatase TiO2 is a promising material for Li&#8208;ion (Li+) batteries with fast charging capability. However, Li+ (de)intercalation dynamics in TiO2 remain elusive and reported diffusivities span many orders of magnitude. Here, we develop a smart protocol for scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) with in situ optical microscopy (OM) to enable the high&#8208;throughput charge/discharge analysis of single TiO2 nanoparticle clusters. Directly probing active nanoparticles revealed that TiO2 with a size of &#8776;50&#8197;nm can store over 30&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity at an extremely fast charge/discharge rate of &#8776;100&#8197;C. This finding of fast Li+ storage in TiO2 particles strengthens its potential for fast&#8208;charging batteries. More generally, smart SECCM&#8208;OM should find wide applications for high&#8208;throughput electrochemical screening of nanostructured materials.

         <dc:description>
We report the first catalytic example of PdII&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;selective &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H aza&#8208;heteroarylation of free carboxylic acids. A sequence of three consecutive mono&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H activation reactions of pivalic acid provides an unique platform for constructing diverse quaternary carbon centers containing heteroaryls which could serve as an enabling tool for escaping the flat land in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
PdII&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of free carboxylic acids represents a significant advance from conventional cyclopalladation initiated reactions. However, developing a modular synthetic platform for diverse quaternary and tertiary carbon centers based on this reactivity, two challenges remain to be addressed: mono&#8208;selectivity in each consecutive C&#8722;H functionalization step; compatibility with heteroatoms. While the exclusive mono&#8208;selectivity was achieved by &#946;&#8208;lactonization/nucleophilic attack, the latter limitation remains to be overcome. Herein, we report the PdII&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H heteroarylation of free carboxylic acids using pyridine&#8208;pyridone ligands capable of overcoming these limitations.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Amides Enabled by 5&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Bipyridine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mere introduction of a CF3 group at position&#8197;5 of a bipyridine ligand promotes a dramatic change in regioselectivity in the iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylation of benzamides and derivatives, from meta/para to ortho&#8208;substitution. Computational and experimental data suggest that this effect is associated to unusual outer&#8208;sphere dispersion interactions between the carbonyl group of the substrate and the CF3&#8208;bipy ring of the ligand.







Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylations of aromatic C&#8722;H bonds are highly attractive transformations because of the diversification possibilities offered by the resulting boronates. These transformations are best carried out using bidentate bipyridine or phenanthroline ligands, and tend to be governed by steric factors, therefore resulting in the competitive functionalization of meta and/or para positions. We have now discovered that a subtle change in the bipyridine ligand, namely, the introduction of a CF3 substituent at position&#8197;5, enables a complete change of regioselectivity in the borylation of aromatic amides, allowing the synthesis of a wide variety of ortho&#8208;borylated derivatives. Importantly, thorough computational studies suggest that the exquisite regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity stems from unusual outer&#8208;sphere interactions between the amide group of the substrate and the CF3&#8208;substituted aryl ring of the bipyridine ligand.

         <title>A Photoacoustic Probe with Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier Crossing Ability for Imaging Oxidative Stress Dynamics in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BODIPY&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with blood&#8208;brain barrier crossing ability for imaging oxidative stress dynamics in the mouse brain was designed. The probe shows reversible and ratiometric response behavior to oxidative stress. In vivo studies reveal the great potential of the probe in photoacoustic imaging of oxidative stress in neurodegeneration diseases.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal assessment of the oxidative stress dynamics in the brain is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing oxidative stress probes have poor blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability or poor penetration depth, making them unsuitable for brain imaging. Herein, we developed a photoacoustic probe that enables real&#8208;time imaging of oxidative stress dynamics in the mouse brain. The probe not only responds to oxidative stress in a reversible and ratiometric manner, but it can also cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier of the mouse brain. Notably, the probe displayed excellent photoacoustic imaging of oxidative stress dynamics in the brains of Parkinson's disease mouse models. In addition, we investigated the antioxidant properties of natural polyphenols in the brain of a Parkinson's disease mouse model using the probe as an imaging agent and suggested the potential of the probe for screening anti&#8208;oxidative stress agents.

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclization: A Convenient Strategy to Realize Efficient BT.2020 Blue Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;resonance emitter using intramolecular cyclization endows BT.2020&#8208;compliant deep blue emission with an ultranarrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16&#8197;nm and CIE coordinates of (0.153, 0.042) in toluene, thus achieving a high external quantum efficiency of 25.6&#8201;% in a hyper&#8208;fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Radical (H&#8901;) with GSH for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic photocatalytic hydrogen radical (H&#8901;) generator is activated by glutathione (GSH) for enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) against normoxic tumor cells via a hybrid ferroptosis&#8208;apoptosis pathway. H&#8901; therapy is also effective in fighting tumors under hypoxic conditions through biological reduction.







Abstract
As a reactive hydrogen species, the hydrogen radical (H&#8901;) scarcely sees applications in tumor biological therapy due to the very limited bio&#8208;friendly sources of H&#8901;. In this work, we report that TAF can act as an organic photosensitizer as well as an efficient photocatalytic H&#8901; generator with reduced glutathione (GSH) as a fuel. The photoactivation of TAF leads to cell death in two ways including triple amplification of oxidative stress via ferroptosis&#8208;apoptosis under normoxia and apoptosis through biological reductions under hypoxia. TAF presents excellent biosafety with ultrahigh photocytotoxicity index at an order of magnitude of 102&#8211;103 on both normoxic and hypoxic cells. The in vitro data suggest that H&#8901; therapy is promising to overcome the challenge of tumor hypoxia at low doses of both photocatalyst and light. In addition, the capability of near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon excitation would benefit broad biological applications.

         <title>Acid&#8208;catalyzed Disulfide&#8208;mediated Reversible Polymerization for Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid can catalyze the reversible polymerization of cyclic disulfides, enabling a robust methodology that produces long poly(disulfide)s within a few minutes under open&#8208;air condition. High&#8208;yield chemical recycling from materials to monomers is achieved at gram scale, showing the capability of intrinsic dynamic polymers toward sustainable materials.







Abstract
Poly(1,2&#8208;dithiolane)s are a family of intrinsically recyclable polymers due to their dynamic covalent disulfide linkages. Despite the common use of thiolate&#8208;initiated anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) under basic condition, cationic ROP is still not exploited. Here we report that disulfide bond can act as a proton acceptor, being protonated by acids to form sulfonium cations, which can efficiently initiate the ROP of 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes and result in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (over 1000&#8197;kDa) poly(disulfide)s. The reaction can be triggered by adding catalytic amounts of acids and non&#8208;coordinating anion salts, and completed in few minutes at room temperature. The acidic conditions allow the applicability for acidic monomers. Importantly, the reaction condition can be under open air without inert protection, enabling the nearly quantitative chemical recycling from bulk materials to original monomers.

         <title>Electrochemical Single&#8208;Cell Protein Therapeutics Using a Double&#8208;Barrel Nanopipette</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics was devised with an engineered &#952;&#8208;nanopipette and exemplified by protein DJ&#8208;1 enabled neuroprotection. Upon DJ&#8208;1 injection through the delivery lumen, upregulation of the antioxidant protein could protect neural PC&#8208;12 cells against oxidative stress from phorbol myristate acetate exposure, as deduced by targeting of the cytosolic H2O2 by the detecting lumen.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics is expected to promote our in&#8208;depth understanding of how a specific protein with a therapeutic dosage treats the cell without population averaging. However, it has not yet been tackled by current single&#8208;cell nanotools. We address this challenge by the use of a double&#8208;barrel nanopipette, in which one lumen was used for electroosmotic cytosolic protein delivery and the other was customized for ionic evaluation of the consequence. Upon injection of protein DJ&#8208;1 through the delivery lumen, upregulation of the antioxidant protein could protect neural PC&#8208;12 cells against oxidative stress from phorbol myristate acetate exposure, as deduced by targeting of the cytosolic hydrogen peroxide by the detecting lumen. The nanotool developed in this study for single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics provides a perspective for future single&#8208;cell therapeutics involving different therapeutic modalities, such as peptides, enzymes and nucleic acids.

         <title>Selective Formal Carbene Insertion into Carbon&#8208;Boron Bonds of Diboronates by N&#8208;Trisylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular reaction of N&#8208;trisylhydrazones with bis(boryl) methane led to the transformation of 1,1&#8208;diboronate into 1,2&#8208;bis(boronates) via 1,2&#8208;borylmethyl migration. With unsymmetric diboronates with two different boryl moieties, the reaction proceeded with excellent regioselectivity. DFT studies reveal an unusual neighbouring boryl group effect that accounts for the observed regioselectivity.







Abstract
Bisborylalkanes play important roles in organic synthesis as versatile bifunctional reagents. The two boron moieties in these compounds can be selectively converted into other functional groups through cross&#8208;coupling, oxidation or radical reactions. Thus, the development of efficient methods for synthesizing bisborylalkanes is highly demanded. Herein we report a new strategy to access bisborylalkanes through the reaction of N&#8208;trisylhydrazones with diboronate, in which the bis(boryl) methane is transformed into 1,2&#8208;bis(boronates) via formal carbene insertion. Since the N&#8208;trisylhydrazones can be readily derived from the corresponding aldehydes, this strategy represents a practical synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diboronates with broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies reveal an unusual neighboring group effect of 1,1&#8208;bis(boronates), which accounts for the observed regioselectivity when unsymmetric 1,1&#8208;diboronates are applied.

         <title>Ligand Hybridization for Electro&#8208;reforming Waste Glycerol into Isolable Oxalate and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybridizing chelating phenanthrolines with heterogeneous nickel hydroxides can efficiently tune the glycerol electrooxidation selectivities via controlling the catalyst electronic states. The selectivities almost linearly scale with the Hammett parameters of the functional groups on the phenanthrolines, creating new rationales for the design of selective catalysts.







Abstract
The electro&#8208;reforming of glycerol is an emerging technology of simultaneous hydrogen production and biomass valorization. However, its complex reaction network and limited catalyst tunability restrict the precise steering toward high selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Hybridizing chelating phenanthrolines with heterogeneous nickel hydroxides can efficiently tune the glycerol electrooxidation selectivities via controlling the catalyst electronic states. The selectivities almost linearly scale with the Hammett parameters of the functional groups on the phenanthrolines, creating new rationales for the design of selective catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electro-reforming of glycerol is an emerging technology of simultaneous hydrogen production and biomass valorization. However, its complex reaction network and limited catalyst tunability restrict the precise steering toward high selectivity. Herein, we incorporated the chelating phenanthrolines into the bulk nickel hydroxide and tuned the electronic properties by installing functional groups, yielding tunable selectivity toward formate (max 92.7&#8201;%) and oxalate (max 45.3&#8201;%) with almost linear correlation with the Hammett parameters. Further combinatory study of intermediate analysis and various spectroscopic techniques revealed the electronic effect of tailoring the valence band that balances between C&#8722;C cleavage and oxidation through the key glycolaldehyde intermediate. A two-electrode electro-reforming setup using the 5-nitro-1,10-phenanthroline-nickel hydroxide catalyst was further established to convert crude glycerol into pure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and isolable sodium oxalate with high efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superconductivity in an Orbital&#8208;Reoriented SnAs Square Lattice: A Case Study of Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of structure unit SnAs4 is realized via a topotactic phase transformation under high pressure, which leads to a record&#8208;high superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 7.5&#8197;K among all the synthesized SnAs&#8208;based compounds. It is the synergistic effect of orbital reorientation and charge redistribution from the pz to the px+py orbitals that facilitates the electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosts the superconductivity.







Abstract
Searching for functional square lattices in layered superconductor systems offers an explicit clue to modify the electron behavior and find exotic properties. The trigonal SnAs3 structural units in SnAs&#8208;based systems are relatively conformable to distortion, which provides the possibility to achieve structurally topological transformation and higher superconducting transition temperatures. In the present work, the functional As square lattice was realized and activated in Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs through a topotactic structural transformation of trigonal SnAs3 to square SnAs4 under pressure, resulting in a record&#8208;high Tc among all synthesized SnAs&#8208;based compounds. Meanwhile, the conductive channel transfers from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane pz orbital to the in&#8208;plane px+py orbitals, facilitating electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosting the superconductivity. The reorientation of p&#8208;orbital following a directed local structure transformation provides an effective strategy to modify layered superconducting systems.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Deficient Molybdenum Oxide Nanosensitizers for Ultrasound&#8208;Enhanced Cancer Metalloimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoOX nanomaterials were prepared as novel sonosensitizers and TME stimulants for ultrasound&#8208;enhanced cancer metalloimmunotherapy. Under US irradiation, they could generate a massive amount of ROS to induce cell damage and strong ICD. MoOX&#8208;PEG itself could also stimulate the maturation of dendritic cells and activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Thus, MoOX&#8208;triggered SDT combined with aCTLA&#8208;4 could elicit robust immune responses for antitumor therapy.







Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum oxide (MoOX) nanomaterials are prepared as novel nanosensitizers and TME&#8208;stimulants for ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced cancer metalloimmunotherapy. After PEGylation, MoOX&#8208;PEG exhibits efficient capability for US&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Under US irradiation, MoOX&#8208;PEG generates a massive amount of ROS to induce cancer cell damage and immunogenic cell death (ICD), which can effectively suppress tumor growth. More importantly, MoOX&#8208;PEG itself further stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and triggeres the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to enhance the immunological effect. Due to the robust ICD induced by SDT and efficient DC maturation stimulated by MoOX&#8208;PEG, the combination treatment of MoOX&#8208;triggered SDT and aCTLA&#8208;4 further amplifies antitumor therapy, inhibits cancer metastases, and elicits robust immune responses to effectively defeat abscopal tumors.

         <title>Ultrathin CuF2&#8208;Rich Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Induced by Cation&#8208;Tailored Double Electrical Layer toward Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin and CuF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase is formed on CuS anode via Cu cation&#8208;tailored double electrical layer in NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte, which ensures high ion&#8208;conductivity and greatly suppresses the electrolyte continuous decomposition. The modified CuS enables high reversible capacity and ultralong cycling life for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) seriously affects battery's cycling life, especially for high&#8208;capacity anode due to excessive electrolyte decomposition from particle fracture. Herein, we report an ultrathin SEI (3&#8211;4&#8197;nm) induced by Cu+&#8208;tailored double electrical layer (EDL) to suppress electrolyte consumption and enhance cycling stability of CuS anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unique EDL with SO3CF3&#8208;Cu complex absorbing on CuS in NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte is demonstrated by in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman, Cyro&#8208;TEM and theoretical calculation, in which SO3CF3&#8208;Cu could be reduced to CuF2&#8208;rich SEI. Dispersed CuF2 and F&#8208;containing compound can provide good interfacial contact for formation of ultrathin and stable SEI film to minimize electrolyte consumption and reduce activation energy of Na+ transport. As a result, the modified CuS delivers high capacity of 402.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 7000&#8197;cycles without capacity decay. The insights of SEI construction pave a way for high&#8208;stability electrode.

         <title>A Convergent, Modular Approach to Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Bearing 5&#8208;Membered Rings via Catalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach to access CF3&#8208;bearing 5&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles via catalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion is demonstrated. In the case of carbocycles, an asymmetric benzylic C&#8722;H insertion process allowed to reach high regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. This protocol can be applied to the synthesis of chiral CF3 analogues of medicinal agents and natural products. The origin of selectivity was investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl&#8208;bearing 5&#8208;membered rings are prevalent in bioactive molecules, but modular approaches to these compounds by functionalization of robust C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in a direct and selective manner are extremely challenging. Herein we report the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene insertion into C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of a broad range of substrates to access 7 types of CF3&#8208;bearing saturated 5&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. The reaction is particularly effective for benzylic C&#8722;H insertion exerting good site&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol, and applicable to the synthesis of chiral CF3 analogues of bioactive molecules. Ruthenium &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene complexes underwent stoichiometric reactions to give C&#8722;H insertion products, lending evidence for the involvement of metal &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene species in the catalytic cycle. DFT calculations revealed that the &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; attraction and intra&#8208;carbene C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bond elucidate the origin of selectivity of the benzylic C&#8722;H insertion reactions.

Ruthenium &#945;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-&#945;-alkyl carbene complexes underwent stoichiometric reactions to give C&#8722;H insertion products, lending evidence for the involvement of metal &#945;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-&#945;-alkyl carbene species in the catalytic cycle. DFT calculations revealed that the &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; attraction and intra-carbene C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bond elucidate the origin of selectivity of the benzylic C&#8722;H insertion reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computer&#8208;Driven Development of Ylide Functionalized Phosphines for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hiyama Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ylide functionalized phosphines were tailored supported by computational inverse catalyst design to fit the requirements of mild Hiyama couplings of aryl chlorides. YPhos/Pd catalyst is highly efficient for the coupling with aryl chlorides in general, and the reaction shows excellent functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings of silicon enolates with aryl electrophiles are of great synthetic utility, but often limited to expensive bromide substrates. A comparative experimental study confirmed that none of the established ligand systems allows to couple inexpensive aryl chlorides with &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilyl alkylnitriles. In contrast, ylide functionalized phosphines (YPhos) led to encouraging results. A statistical model was developed that correlates the reaction yields with ligand features. It was employed to predict catalyst structures with superior performance. With this cheminformatics approach, YPhos ligands were tailored specifically to the demands of Hiyama couplings. The newly synthesized ligands displayed record&#8208;setting activities, enabling the elusive coupling of aryl chlorides with &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilyl alkyl nitriles. The preparative utility of the catalyst system was demonstrated by the synthesis of pharmaceutically meaningful &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, &#945;&#8208;arylcarbonyls and biaryls.

         <title>Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H Functionalization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides with Thianthrenium Salts: Conjugation and Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with readily accessible and modular arylthianthrenium salts was investigated. The modular nature of this arylating agent allowed the expedient stitching of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with drug, natural product, and peptidic scaffolds by forging sterically congested biaryl linkages.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal late&#8208;stage diversification of structurally complex peptides bears enormous potential for drug discovery and molecular imaging, among other applications. Herein, we report on a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with readily accessible and modular arylthianthrenium salts. Under exceedingly mild reaction conditions, the late&#8208;stage diversification of structurally complex peptides was accomplished. The tunability and ease of preparation of arylthianthrenium salts allowed the expedient stitching of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with drug, natural product, and peptidic scaffolds by forging sterically congested biaryl linkages. The robustness of the palladium catalysis regime was reflected by the full tolerance of a plethora of sensitive and coordinating functional groups. Hence, our manifold enabled efficient access to highly decorated, labelled, conjugated, and ligated linear and cyclic peptides.

         <title>Light Alters the NH3 vs N2H4 Product Profile in Iron&#8208;catalyzed Nitrogen Reduction via Dual Reactivity from an Iron Hydrazido (Fe=NNH2) Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light irradiation of a tris(phosphine)borane iron (P3BFe) catalyst system during nitrogen reduction (N2R) catalysis alters its product selectivity profile, producing significant N2H4 alongside NH3. Only trace N2H4 is otherwise produced. This study provides insight into the dominant factors determining the selectivity of this catalysis and implicates dual reactivity from a singlet ground versus a triplet excited state hydrazido (Fe=NNH2) intermediate.







Abstract
Whereas synthetically catalyzed nitrogen reduction (N2R) to produce ammonia is widely studied, catalysis to instead produce hydrazine (N2H4) has received less attention despite its considerable mechanistic interest. Herein, we disclose that irradiation of a tris(phosphine)borane (P3B) Fe catalyst, P3BFe+, significantly alters its product profile to increase N2H4 versus NH3; P3BFe+ is otherwise known to be highly selective for NH3. We posit a key terminal hydrazido intermediate, P3BFe=NNH2, as selectivity&#8208;determining. Whereas its singlet ground state undergoes protonation to liberate NH3, a low&#8208;lying triplet excited state leads to reactivity at N&#945; and formation of N2H4. Associated electrochemical and spectroscopic studies establish that N2H4 lies along a unique product pathway; NH3 is not produced from N2H4. Our findings are distinct from the canonical mechanism for hydrazine formation, which proceeds via a diazene (HN=NH) intermediate and showcase light as a tool to tailor selectivity.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nickel on Carbon Nitride Photocatalyst Achieves Semihydrogenation of Alkynes with Water Protons via Monovalent Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven semihydrogenation of alkynes with water as the hydrogen source was achieved over single&#8208;atom Ni supported on carbon nitride (CN). The Ni site, paired up with the pyridinic N of the CN scaffold, mediated proton/deuterium transport from water/deuterium oxide (H2O/D2O) to alkynes, producing a diverse range of (deuterated) alkenes with high selectivity.







Abstract
Prospects in light&#8208;driven water activation have prompted rapid progress in hydrogenation reactions. We describe a Ni2+&#8722;N4 site built on carbon nitride for catalyzed semihydrogenation of alkynes, with water supplying protons, powered by visible&#8208;light irradiation. Importantly, the photocatalytic approach developed here enabled access to diverse deuterated alkenes in D2O with excellent deuterium incorporation. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, evolution of a four&#8208;coordinate Ni2+ species into a three&#8208;coordinate Ni+ species was spectroscopically identified. In combination with theoretical calculations, the photo&#8208;evolved Ni+ is posited as HO&#8722;Ni+&#8722;N2 with an uncoordinated, protonated pyridinic nitrogen, formed by coupled Ni2+ reduction and water dissociation. The paired Ni&#8722;N prompts hydrogen liberation from water, and it renders desorption of alkene preferred over further hydrogenation to alkane, ensuring excellent semihydrogenation selectivity.

We describe a Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; site built on carbon nitride for catalyzed semihydrogenation of alkynes, with water supplying protons, powered by visible-light irradiation. Importantly, the photocatalytic approach developed here enabled access to diverse deuterated alkenes in D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with excellent deuterium incorporation. Under visible-light irradiation, evolution of a four-coordinate Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; species into a three-coordinate Ni&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species was spectroscopically identified. In combination with theoretical calculations, the photo-evolved Ni&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is posited as HO&#8722;Ni&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with an uncoordinated, protonated pyridinic nitrogen, formed by coupled Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction and water dissociation. The paired Ni&#8722;N prompts hydrogen liberation from water, and it renders desorption of alkene preferred over further hydrogenation to alkane, ensuring excellent semihydrogenation selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Negative Hydrogen Production Strategy: CO2 Selective Capture with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of carbon&#8208;negative H2 production in which CO2 capture was coupled with H2 evolution at ambient temperature and pressure is reported. A universal photocatalysis reaction was adopted as driving force and carbonate&#8208;intercalated layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with electron storage/release function were employed as adsorption catalysts.







Abstract
We reported a strategy of carbon&#8208;negative H2 production in which CO2 capture was coupled with H2 evolution at ambient temperature and pressure. For this purpose, carbonate&#8208;type CuxMgyFez layered double hydroxide (LDH) was preciously constructed, and then a photocatalysis reaction of interlayer CO32&#8722; reduction with glycerol oxidation was performed as driving force to induce the electron storage on LDH layers. With the participation of pre&#8208;stored electrons, CO2 was captured to recover interlayer CO32&#8722; in presence of H2O, accompanied with equivalent H2 production. During photocatalysis reaction, Cu0.6Mg1.4Fe1 exhibited a decent CO evolution amount of 1.63&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and dihydroxyacetone yield of 3.81&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In carbon&#8208;negative H2 production process, it showed an exciting CO2 capture quantity of 1.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and H2 yield of 1.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Besides, this system possessed stable operation capability under simulated flu gas condition with negligible performance loss, exhibiting application prospect.

         <title>Optimized Sieving Effect for Ethanol/Water Separation by Ultramicroporous MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent ethanol/water separation has been achieved using two ultramicroporous MOFs (UTSA&#8208;280 and Co&#8208;squarate) owing to molecular sieving effect. The slightly larger rhombohedral channels in Co&#8208;squarate provide a further optimization of sieving effect by enhancing the guest&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;framework interactions. A benchmarking water adsorption capacity at ultralow pressure is obtained in Co&#8208;squarate.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity ethanol is a promising renewable energy resource, however separating ethanol from trace amount of water is extremely challenging. Herein, two ultramicroporous MOFs (UTSA&#8208;280 and Co&#8208;squarate) were used as adsorbents. A prominent water adsorption and a negligible ethanol adsorption identify perfect sieving effect on both MOFs. Co&#8208;squarate exhibits a surprising water adsorption capacity at low pressure that surpassing the reported MOFs. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations reveal that such prominent performance of Co&#8208;squarate derives from the optimized sieving effect through pore structure adjustment. Co&#8208;squarate with larger rhombohedral channel is suitable for zigzag water location, resulting in reinforced guest&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;framework interactions. Ultrapure ethanol (99.9&#8201;%) can be obtained directly by ethanol/water mixed vapor breaking through the columns packed with Co&#8208;squarate, contributing to a potential for fuel&#8208;grade ethanol purification.

         <title>Transient and Dissipative Host&#8211;Guest Hydrogels Regulated by Consumption of a Reactive Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to prepare dynamic hydrogel materials has been developed that uses a reactive and consumable chemical stimulus to temporarily upgrade host&#8211;guest affinity and drive hydrogelation. These hydrogels exist only transiently, autonomously transitioning back to a flowing suspension over time.







Abstract
The transient self&#8208;assembly of molecules under the direction of a consumable fuel source is fundamental to biological processes such as cellular organization and motility. Such biomolecular assemblies exist in an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium state, requiring continuous consumption of high energy molecules. At the same time, the creation of bioinspired supramolecular hydrogels has traditionally focused on associations occurring at the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Here, hydrogels are prepared from cucurbit[7]uril host&#8211;guest supramolecular interactions through transient physical crosslinking driven by the consumption of a reactive chemical fuel. Upon action from this fuel, the affinity and dynamics of CB[7]&#8211;guest recognition are altered. In this way, the lifetime of transient hydrogel formation and the dynamic modulus obtained are governed by fuel consumption, rather than being directed by equilibrium complex formation.

         <title>Complementary Design in Multicomponent Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction: Beyond the Leverage in Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is promising in place of the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for artificial N2 fixation. However, the high activity and selectivity of eNRR are challenging to achieve simultaneously due to the scaling relations. Such &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity has severely restricted eNRR. To overcome this bottleneck, the complementary design of electronic structures in multicomponent electrocatalysts has been recently pursued, aiming to maximize the advantages of each component and optimize the multistep reactions, which has stood at the cutting edge in this aspect. Here, we present a minireview of the design, performance, and mechanism of multicomponent electrocatalysts with complementary electronic structures. We particularly emphasize the interactions between N2 and elements from d&#8208;, p&#8208;, and s&#8208;blocks, which are essential for understanding how these electrocatalysts are beyond the &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Synergistic Catalysis on Cu&#8208;Se Dual Atom Sites via Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction and understanding of synergy in well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;atom active sites is an available avenue to promote multistep tandem catalytic reactions. Herein, we construct a dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;atom catalyst that comprises adjacent Cu&#8208;N4 and Se&#8208;C3 active sites for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations provide in&#8208;depth insights into this dual&#8208;atom synergy mechanism for ORR under realistic device operation conditions. The heteroatom Se modulator can efficiently polarize the charge distribution around symmetrical Cu&#8208;N4 moieties, and serve as synergistic site to facilitate the second oxygen reduction step simultaneously, in which the key OOH*&#8208;(Cu1&#8208;N4) transforms to O*&#8208;(Se1&#8208;C2) intermediate on the dual&#8208;atom sites. Therefore, this designed catalyst achieves satisfied alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.905 V vs. RHE and a maximum power density of 206.5 mW cm&#8208;2 in Zn&#8208;air battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Fusion Yields Guest Acceptors that Enable Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 18.77% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and selection of a suitable guest acceptor are particularly important for improving the photovoltaic performance of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we designed and successfully synthesized two asymmetric silicon&#8211;oxygen bridged guest acceptors, which featured distinct blue&#8208;shifted absorption, upshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, and larger dipole moments than symmetric silicon&#8211;oxygen&#8208;bridged acceptor. Ternary devices with the incorporation of 14.2wt% these two asymmetric guest acceptors exhibited excellent performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.22% and 18.77%, respectively. Our success in precise control of material properties via structural fusion of five&#8208;membered carbon linkages and six&#8208;membered silicon&#8211;oxygen connection at the central electron&#8208;donating core unit of fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors can attract considerable attention and bring new vigor and vitality for developing new materials toward more efficient OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triptycene&#8208;Based 2D MOF with Vertically Extended Structure for Improving the Electrocatalytic Performance of CO2 to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their unique structures and physical&#8208;chemical properties. However, the planarly extended structure of 2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs usually limited the accessibility of the active sites. Herein, we designed a triptycene&#8208;based 2D vertically conductive MOF (2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF) by coordinating 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexahydroxyltriptycene (HHTC) with Cu2+. The vertically extended 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) possesses a weak interlayer interaction, which leads to a facile exfoliation to the nanosheet. Compared with the classical 2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs with planarly extended 2D structures, 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) exhibits a 100% increased catalytic activity in terms of turnover number and a two&#8208;fold increased selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that higher activity originated from the lower energy barriers of the vertically extended 2D structures during the CO2 reduction reaction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Preparation&#160;of Large&#8208;Area Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Membranes via&#160;Alkynylated&#160;Surface&#8208;Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphdiynes (GDYs), two&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;like carbon systems, are considered as potential advanced membrane material due to their unique physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the scale&#8208;up of integrated GDY membranes&#160;is technologically challenging, and most studies remain at the theoretical stage. Herein, we report a simple and efficient alkynylated &#160;surface&#8208;mediated strategy to prepare hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) membranes on commercial alumina tubes. Surface alkynylation&#160;initiates an accelerated surface&#8208;confined coupling reaction&#160;in the presence of a copper catalyst and facilitates the nanoscale epitaxial&#160;lateral growth of HsGDY. A continuous and ultra&#8208;thin HsGDY membrane (~ 100 nm) can be produced within 15 min. The resulting membranes exhibit outstanding molecular sieving together with excellent water permeances (ca. 1100 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 MPa&#8208;1), and show a long&#8208;term durability in cross&#8208;flow nanofiltration, owing to the superhydrophilic surface and hydrophobic pore walls.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Colloidal Quantum Wells for Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite colloidal quantum wells (QWs) are promising to realize narrow deep&#8208;blue emission, but the poor optical performance and stability suppress their practical application. Here, we creatively propose a water&#8208;driven synthesis strategy to obtain size&#8208;homogenized and strongly confined deep&#8208;blue CsPbBr3 QWs, corresponding to three monolayers, which emit at the deep&#8208;blue wavelength of 456 nm. The water controls the orientation and distribution of the ligands on the surface of the nanocrystals, thus inducing orientated growth through the Ostwald ripening process by phagocytizing unstable nanocrystals to form well&#8208;crystallized QWs. These QWs present remarkable stability and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94%. Furthermore, we have prepared light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the QWs via the all&#8208;solution fabrication strategy, achieving an external quantum efficiency of 1% and luminance of 2946 cd m&#8208;2, demonstrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art brightness for perovskite QW&#8208;based LEDs.</dc:description>

In combination with visible&#8208;light copper(I)&#8208;photoredox catalysis, an easily accessible iodine(III) reagent containing monofluoroacetoxy ligands serves as a powerful source of monofluoromethyl (CH2F) radical, enabling the step economical synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;acetates from a broad range of olefinic substrates under mild conditions. Applications to late&#8208;stage diversification of alkenes derived from complex molecules, amino acids and synthesis of fluoromethylated heterocycles are also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;lived Multiple Charge Separation by Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple charge separation has been successfully realized via a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction in an organic cocrystal. Benefiting from the adjustable electronic energy level of the electron donor and acceptor via thermal&#8208;induced proton migration, distinct optical absorption behaviors combined with color evolvements to blue or green are observed in these charge separation states. It is of interest to note that such charge separation states exhibit a longer lifetime of over a month due to the excellent coplanarity and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction of the electron acceptors. Moreover, the enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths endows the charge separation state with near&#8208;infrared (808 nm) photothermal conversion for imaging and bacterial inhibition, of which the conversion performance can be controlled by the degree of proton migration.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Green Synthesis of Robust Ultra&#8208;Microporous Hofmann Clathrate Material with Record C3H6&#160;Storage Density for Efficient C3H6/C3H8&#160;Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing&#160;porous materials for C3H6/C3H8&#160;separation faces the challenge of merging excellent separation performance with high stability and easy scalability of synthesis. Herein, we report a robust Hofmann clathrate material (ZJU&#8208;75a), featuring high&#8208;density strong binding sites to achieve all the above requirements. ZJU&#8208;75a adsorbs large amount of C3H6with a record high storage density of 0.818 g mL&#8722;1, and concurrently shows high C3H6/C3H8&#160;selectivity (54.2)&#160;at&#160;296 K and 1 bar. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis unveil that the high&#8208;density binding sites in ZJU&#8208;75a not only provide much stronger interactions with C3H6&#160;but also enable the dense packing of C3H6. Breakthrough experiments on gas mixtures afford both high separation factor of 14.7 and large C3H6&#160;uptake (2.79 mmol g&#8208;1). This material is highly stable and can be easily produced at kilogram&#8208;scale using a green synthesis method, making it as a benchmark material to address major challenges for industrial C3H6/C3H8&#160;separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Detection of L&#8208;Lactate and D&#8208;Glucose Using DNA Aptamers in Human Blood Serum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>L&#8208;lactate is a key metabolite indicative of physiological states, glycolysis pathways, and various diseases such as sepsis, heart attack, lactate acidosis, and cancer. Detection of lactate has been relying on a few enzymes that need other substrates. In this work, DNA aptamers for L&#8208;lactate were obtained using a library&#8208;immobilization selection method and the highest affinity aptamer reached a Kd of 0.43 mM as determined using isothermal titration calorimetry. The aptamers showed up to 50&#8208;fold selectivity for L&#8208;lactate over D&#8208;lactate and had little responses to other closely related analogs such as pyruvate and 3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate. A fluorescent biosensor based on the strand displacement method showed a limit of detection of 0.55 mM L&#8208;lactate, and the sensor worked in 90% serum. Simultaneous detection of L&#8208;lactate and D&#8208;glucose in the same solution was achieved. This work has broadened the scope of aptamers to simple metabolites and provided a useful probe for continuous and multiplexed monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited State Mixed&#8208;Valence Complexes: From the Special Pair to the Creutz&#8208;Taube Ion and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds and complexes with mixed&#8208;valence ground electronic states such as the Creutz&#8208;Taube ion have proven to be excellent vehicles through which to study intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer processes. In a recent contribution by Cadranel and co&#8208;workers, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveals photo&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;bridge charge transfer within the homovalent analogue of the Creutz&#8208;Taube ion, [{(NH3)5Ru}(m&#8208;pz){Ru(NH3)5}]4+, giving rise to two closely lying excited states with mixed&#8208;valence character, one with a shorter lifetime (&#964; = 136 ps) and weakly&#8208;coupled (Robin&#8208;Day Class II) character, the other a longer&#8208;lived (&#964; = 2.8 ns) configurational isomer with more delocalized electronic structure. Electron transfer reactions from the longer&#8208;lived species demonstrate analogies with the photo&#8208;induced reactions of the photosynthetic special pair, suggesting this state as a reference system for excited&#8208;state mixed&#8208;valency, and a framework from which to explore photocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Galvanic Redox Potentiometry for Fouling&#8208;Free and Stable Serotonin Sensing in a Living Animal Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is a major neurotransmitter broadly involved in many aspects of feeling and behavior. Although its electro&#8208;active feature renders the electrochemical sensor promising, the persistent generation of fouling layers on electrode by its oxidation products presents a hurdle for reliable sensing. Here, we present a fouling&#8208;free 5&#8208;HT sensor based on galvanic redox potentiometry. The sensor efficiently minimizes electrode fouling as revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, ensuring a less than 3% signal change in a 2&#8208;hour continuous experiment, whereas amperometric sensors losing 90% within 30 min. Most importantly, the sensor is highly amenable for in vivo studies, permitting real&#8208;time 5&#8208;HT monitoring, and supporting the mechanism associated with serotonin release in brain. Our system offers an effective way to sensing different neurochemicals having significant fouling issues, thus facilitating the molecular&#8208;level understanding of brain function.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Stabilization of Lithium Anode and Cathode using Hyperconjugative Electrolytes for High&#8208;voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although great progress has been made in new electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), the intrinsic relationship between electrolyte composition and cell performance remains unclear due to the lack of valid quantization method. Here, we proposed the concept of negative center of electrostatic potential (NCESP) and Mayer bond order (MBO) to describe solvent capability, which highly relate to solvation structure and oxidation potential, respectively. Based on established principles, the selected electrolyte with 1.7 M LiFSI in methoxytrimethylsilane (MOTMS)/ (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFMTMS) shows unique hyperconjugation nature to stabilize both Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode. The 4.6 V 30 &#956;m Li||4.5 mAh cm&#8208;2 lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (low N/P ratio of 1.3) cell with our electrolyte shows stable cycling with 91% capacity retention over 200 cycles. The bottom&#8208;up design concept of electrolyte opens up a general strategy for advancing high&#8208;voltage LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Water Splitting and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provide promising solutions to global energy and environmental issues. In recent years, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of crystalline porous solids featuring well&#8208;defined and tailorable structures as well as high surface areas, have captured great interest toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction. In this review, the semiconductor&#8208;like behavior of MOFs is first discussed. We then summarize the recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction over MOF&#8208;based materials and focus on the unique advantage of MOFs for clarifying the structure&#8208;property relationship in photocatalysis. In addition, some representative characterization techniques have been presented to unveil the photocatalytic kinetics and reaction intermediates in MOF&#8208;based systems. Finally, the challenges, and perspectives for future directions are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically Controlled Recovery and Recycling of Homogeneous Organocatalysts Enabled by Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We address a critical challenge of recovering and recycling homogeneous organocatalysts by designing photoswitchable catalyst structures that display a reversible solubility change in response to light. Initially&#8208;insoluble catalysts are UV&#8208;switched to a soluble isomeric state, which catalyzes the reaction, then back&#8208;isomerizes to the insoluble state upon completion of the reaction to be filtered and recycled. The molecular design principles that allow for the drastic solubility change over 10 times between the isomeric states, 87% recovery by the light&#8208;induced precipitation, and multiple rounds of catalyst recycling are revealed. This proof of concept will open up opportunities to develop highly&#8208;recyclable homogeneous catalysts that are important for the synthesis of critical compounds in various industries, which is anticipated to significantly reduce environmental impact and costs.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Single Electron Redox Steps Convert Polycycles with a C3P3 core to a Planar Triphosphinine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of the imidazolium&#8208;stabilized diphosphete&#8208;diide IDP with trityl phosphaalkyne affords a mixture which contains the molecules 1a and 1b with a central C3P3 core, which formally carries a two&#8208;fold negative charge. In order to avoid the formation of an antiaromatic 8&#960; electron system within a conjugated dianionic six&#8208;membered [C3P3]2&#8208; ring, 1a adopts a bicyclic [3.1.0] and 1b a tricyclic [2.2.0.0] structure which are in a dynamic equilibrium. 1a,b can be reversibly oxidized to a triphosphinine dication [5]2+ with a central flat aromatic six&#8208;membered C3P3 ring. This two&#8208;electron redox reaction occurs in two single&#8208;electron transfer steps via the 7&#960;&#8208;radical cation [4]&#8729;+, which could also be isolated and fully characterized. The profound reversible structural change observed for the two&#8208;electron redox couple [5]2+/1a,b is in sharp contrast to the C6H6/ [C6H6]2&#8208; couple, which undergoes only a modest structural deformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments on Understanding Charge Transfer in Molecular Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge transfer (CT) in molecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems is pivotal for artificial photosynthesis, photocatalysis, photovoltaics and fundamental photochemistry. We summarized the recent development in study of CT and discussed its application in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. The direct experimental proof of the spin multiplicity of the charge separated (CS) state with pulsed laser excited time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy was discussed. Experimental determination of the electron exchange energy (J) of the CS state, with magnetic field effect on its yield or lifetime was introduced. The electron spin transfer accompanying the CT, studied with pulsed EPR spectra was briefly discussed. Tuning of the CT yield and kinetics with selective vibration excitation of the linker (the bridge) with IR pulse was presented. Above all, these studies show that there are more fun than simply monitoring the formation of the cation and anions and the kinetics or CS yields in this area.</dc:description>
