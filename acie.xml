This minireview introduces the scintillation mechanism and synthesis methods of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Mn(II) halides (OIMnHs) scintillators, and emphatically summarizes the research progress in fabrication strategies of OIMnHs&#8208;based scintillation screens for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging.







Abstract
Scintillators play a pivotal role in multiple fields such as medical imaging, radioactive contaminant detection, non&#8208;destructive testing, high&#8208;energy physics and homeland security. However, the traditional inorganic scintillators are faced with the shortcomings of high fabrication cost and low light yield. In recent years, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides have become the promising alternatives for their excellent luminescence properties, favorable air and irradiation stability, and low&#8208;cost preparation. Among them, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Mn(II) halides (OIMnHs) have attracted wide attention due to their particular flexible molecular structure design, easy synthesis and low toxicity. This minireview summarizes the latest progress in high performance Mn2+&#8208;Based scintillation screens. Herein, the scintillation mechanism of OIMnHs scintillators is firstly discussed. Then, the different synthesis methods of OIMnHs scintillators are briefly described, including solvent diffusion, cooling crystallization, evaporative crystallization and solid&#8208;state mechanochemical synthesis. After that, the recent strategies of OIMnHs for forming scintillation screens applying to X&#8208;ray imaging are emphatically reviewed, which are growing large single crystals, fabricating to glass or ceramic and blending with polymers. The fabrication progress and applications of OIMnHs&#8208;based scintillation screens were introduced and the structure&#8211;property relationship of these screens was discussed. Finally, the challenges of this new scintillator material are summarized, and the potential research directions for future exploration are proposed.

         <title>Fluorescent Artificial Receptor for Dopamine based on Molecular Recognition&#8208;driven Dynamic Covalent Chemistry in a Lipid Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic artificial receptor is introduced that synergically combines molecular recognition with dynamic imine bond formation inside a lipid nanoreactor, triggering a fluorescence ratiometric response. It enables dopamine detection with micromolar sensitivity and at the single&#8208;nanoprobe level, showing remarkable selectivity without interference of competing biogenic amines and multiple biological fluids.







Abstract
Molecular recognition and detection of small bioactive molecules, like neurotransmitters, remain a challenge for chemists, whereas nature found an elegant solution in the form of protein receptors. Here, we introduce a concept of a dynamic artificial receptor that synergically combines molecular recognition with dynamic imine bond formation inside a lipid nanoreactor, inducing a fluorescence response. The designed supramolecular system combines a lipophilic recognition ligand derived from a boronic acid, a fluorescent aldehyde based on push&#8208;pull styryl pyridine and a phenol&#8208;based catalyst. The recognition ligand specifically captures dopamine inside lipid nanodroplets and thus triggers imine bond formation with the aldehyde, producing the emission color change. The rational design of the fluorescent aldehyde, the catalyst, and the recognition ligand allows dramatic acceleration of the imine bond formation required for rapid sensing of dopamine. The nanoprobe enables dopamine detection with micromolar sensitivity and singe&#8208;nanoprobe imaging of dopamine gradients through its robust two&#8208;color ratiometric response. It displays remarkable selectivity without the interference of competing biogenic primary amines and biological media: blood serum, plasma, urine and cell lysate. The proposed concept of a dynamic artificial receptor offers a solution to the long&#8208;standing problem of molecular recognition and sensing of small molecules in complex biological media.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically&#8208;Stretchable Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Electron Acceptors with Flexible Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By novel molecular design, a dimerized acceptor (DY&#8208;FBrL) was synthesized. DY&#8208;FBrL&#8208;based rigid devices render an efficiency of 18.75&#8201;% and crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 18.54&#8201;%. A polymerized acceptor (PDY&#8208;FL) was prepared via polymerization of DY&#8208;FBrL. Compared to DY&#8208;FBrL, PDY&#8208;FL&#8208;based rigid devices display a higher COS of 23.45&#8201;% but a lower efficiency of 14.13&#8201;%. Importantly, intrinsically&#8208;stretchable devices based on DY&#8208;FBrL and PDY&#8208;FL exhibit excellent device stretchability.







Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are emerging as promising candidates for powering next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, developing molecular design strategies to achieve both high efficiency and mechanical robustness in IS&#8208;OSCs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present a novel approach by synthesizing a dimerized electron acceptor (DY&#8208;FBrL) that enables rigid OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.75&#8201;% and a crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of 18.54&#8201;%. The enhanced PCE and stretchability of DY&#8208;FBrL&#8208;based devices are attributed to its extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and elongated side chains. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative polymerized acceptor (PDY&#8208;FL), synthesized via the polymerization of DY&#8208;FBrL. While PDY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices exhibit a slightly lower PCE of 14.13&#8201;%, they achieve a significantly higher COS of 23.45&#8201;%, representing one of the highest PCEs reported for polymerized acceptors containing only flexible linkers. Consequently, IS&#8208;OSCs fabricated using DY&#8208;FBrL and PDY&#8208;FL achieve notable PCEs of 14.31&#8201;% and 11.61&#8201;%, respectively. Additionally, the device stretchability improves progressively from Y6 (strain at PCE80%=11&#8201;%), to DY&#8208;FBrL (strain at PCE80%=23&#8201;%), and PDY&#8208;FL (strain at PCE80%=31&#8201;%). This study presents a promising molecular design strategy for tailoring electron acceptor structures, offering a new pathway to develop high&#8208;performance IS&#8208;OSCs with enhanced mechanical properties.

         <title>Molecular Design for Dual Circularity: Polyester with Complementary Mechanical and Chemical Recyclability under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual circularity concept was demonstrated to prevent plastic waste accumulation, where rational design paved the way. Apart from fully recovery of mechanical and thermal properties after as many as six repeated mechanical recycling cycles, the polyesters could be closed&#8208;loop chemical recycled via facile, time and energy efficient manners. In case of polymers with dual circularity, it is recommended to proceed with mechanical recycling when we can, switch to chemical recycling when we must.







Abstract
The plastic waste accumulation requires facile yet effective solutions. Currently mechanical recycling typically leads to downcycling, while the environmental footprint of chemical recycling is often unacceptable. Here, we introduce a dual circularity concept, where rational molecular design paves the way for complementary closed&#8208;loop mechanical and chemical recyclability under mild conditions. Very small changes in macromolecular structures, thermal and mechanical properties were observed, after as many as six repeated mechanical recycling cycles, showing that a wide processing window could be the key for closing the mechanical recycling loop. Facile, time and energy efficient closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling into products with identical performance to original ones was also realized, thanks to the abundant free volume and accessible ester&#8208;functionalities. With these design criteria at hand, dual circulation in recyclability can be realized; proceeding with mechanical recycling when we can, and switching to chemical recycling when we must.

         <title>Synergistic Electrode and Electrolyte Polarities Lead to Outstanding Organic Potassium&#8208;based Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
When the polarities of the organic cathodes and the electrolyte are tuned, the batteries show high&#8208;capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency. For example, under the high polar electrolytes, the PANI||KC8 pouch cells deliver long stability of 2500&#8197;cycles with a high average CE of 99.85&#8201;%, and the PTCDA||KC8 pouch&#8208;cell displays a high capacity of 99.6&#8197;mAh and good stability.







Abstract
Organic materials are promising as battery electrodes due to their flexible design, low cost, and sustainability. Although high electrolyte concentrations are known to suppress organic cathode dissolution, the organic cathode solubility depends on the interplay between the electrode and electrolyte polarities, which remains unexplored. Here, we elucidate the delicate interplay of electrode and electrolyte polarities to achieve stable cycling of organic cathode. Notably, we demonstrate that the solubility of low&#8208;polar organic cathodes initially increases and subsequently decreases in electrolytes with increasing polarity. In contrast, high&#8208;polar organic cathodes display increasing solubility in electrolytes with increasing polarity. When the polarities of the organic cathodes and the electrolyte are tuned, the batteries show high&#8208;capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency. For example, polyaniline||potassiated graphite (KC8) pouch cells deliver 2500&#8197;cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;%. These new insights into low&#8208; and high&#8208;polar organic cathode behavior in electrolytes lay a theoretical foundation for designing new organic battery electrodes and optimizing their electrolyte formulation.

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Enhancement of Energetic Charge Carrier Extraction and Modulation of Local Charge Density to Impact Selectivity in Plasmonic Nanometals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, silver nanometals modified with various sulfhydryl ligands (re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;R) were synthesized via photoreduction. The modified surface effectively extracts and stabilizes excited&#8208;state electrons from plasmonic nanometals. By employing substituents with distinct electron donor/acceptor properties, the surface charge density was systematically tuned, thereby influencing the selectivity between CO2 reduction and H2 evolution.







Abstract
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) metals exhibit remarkable light&#8208;absorbing property and unique catalytic activity, attracting significant attention in photocatalysts recently. However, the practical application of plasmonic nanometal is hindered by challenge of energetic electrons extraction and low selectivity. The energetic carriers generated in nanometal under illumination have extremely short lifetimes, leading to rapid energy loss. In this work, silver nanometals modified with five distinct sulfhydryl ligands (re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;R) were synthesized via photoreduction of superlattice precursors. Modified surface efficiently extracts and preserves excited state electrons of plasmonic nanometals. By modulation the local charge density at catalytic active sites through substituents with varying electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, the selectivity of the photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction was influenced. The results demonstrated opposite selectivity between methoxy&#8208;modified re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;OCH3 (CO selectivity of 96.73&#8201;%) and amino&#8208;modified re&#8208;Ag&#8208;S&#8208;NH2 (H2 selectivity of 96.66&#8201;%) despite their similar structures. The changes in excited states and surface contact potentials induced by LSPR were monitored using femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Meanwhile, the detailed discussion of the LSPR mechanism in plasmonic nanometals will serve as valuable references and foundational elements for future research in this area.

         <title>Hierarchical Interface Enabled by a Guest&#8208;Anionic Chemistry for High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology that involves the guest anionic chemistry activated by introducing co&#8208;solute to design a hierarchical interface of zinc anode/electrolyte is presented, where the inner Helmholtz layer on the interface has been reconstructed and derived a robust amorphous&#8208;crystalline SEI, endowing the anode with enhanced reversibility and ultra&#8208;high rate property.







Abstract
The poor reversibility of the zinc anode caused by interfacial side reactions and dendritic growth poses significant constraints on the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a co&#8208;solute, acesulfame potassium, with strongly polar, zincophilic guest anions is introduced into a conventional low&#8208;concentration aqueous electrolyte. This regulation enhances the electrolyte&#8216;s ionic conductivity and accelerates the desolvation process of zinc ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Furthermore, the introduced acesulfame anions give rise to the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface with a hierarchical crystalline&#8208;amorphous bilayer structure that effectively suppresses side reactions and allows for uniform zinc ion diffusion&#8208;deposition. Results show that the zinc anode in the designed electrolyte possesses remarkable reversibility, achieving stable operation under a ultrahigh current density of 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 67.6&#8201;% depth of discharge, surpassing most previous reports. Zn//I2 full cells assembled with this electrolyte exhibit high rate capability (135.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and remarkable lifespan (96.3&#8201;% capacity retention after 40,000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). A large&#8208;sized Zn//I2 pouch cell is also demonstrated, delivering a total capacity of 170&#8197;mAh with 78.8&#8201;% capacity retention after 600 cycles at 3.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, highlighting the potential of the guest&#8208;anionic chemistry in practical applications.

         <title>AA&#8208;Stacked Hydrogen&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for Enhanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a highly&#8208;ordered AA&#8208;stacked hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) as the anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion battery prepared by a scalable alcohol&#8208;thermal method. Such unique architecture enables to increase lithium binding sites and to facilitate lithium rapid transfer through the formed well&#8208;organized pore channels, thereby leading to an excellent reversible capacity, rate performance as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY) has been considered a promising electrode material for application in electrochemical energy storage. However, studies on GDY featuring an ordered interlayer stacking are lacking, which is supposed to be another effective way to increase lithium binding sites and diffusion pathways. Herein, we synthesized a hydrogen&#8208;substituted GDY (HsGDY) with a highly&#8208;ordered AA&#8208;stacking structure via a facile alcohol&#8208;thermal method. Such unique architecture enables a rapid lithium transfer through the well&#8208;organized pore channels and endows a stronger adsorption capability to lithium atom as compared to the arbitrarily&#8208;stacked mode. The resultant HsGDY exhibits a reversible capacity of 1040&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 ranking among the most powerful GDY&#8208;based electrode materials, and an excellent rate performance as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability. The successful preparation of gram&#8208;level high&#8208;quality HsGDY products in batches implies the potential for large&#8208;scale lithium&#8208;storage applications.

The synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of aluminadiselenirane, aluminaditellurirane, aluminatriselenetane, aluminatritelluretane, and mixed Se/Te aluminatrichalcogenetane have been reported. These species are the first neutral aluminum/chalcogen analogs of dioxiranes and trioxetanes, and they serve as powerful synthons for creating unique aluminum heterocycles.







Abstract
Dioxiranes and their heavier chalcogen analogs have long been recognized as pivotal reagents and intermediates in synthetic chemistry, while trioxetanes have largely remained theoretical constructs. In this work, we present the synthesis of neutral, isoelectronic aluminum/chalcogen analogs of dioxiranes and trioxetanes, specifically aluminadiselenirane, aluminaditellurirane, aluminatriselenetane, aluminatritelluretane, and a mixed Se/Te analog of aluminatrichalcogenetane. These compounds, featuring strained AlCh2 and AlCh3 ring (Ch=Se, Te), exhibit significant polarization between the aluminum and chalcogen components. Reactivity studies have revealed that both aluminadiselenirane and aluminaditellurirane show pronounced ambiphilic behavior when interacting with proximal substrates, undergoing facile ring&#8208;opening (cyclo)additions. Additionally, the coordination chemistry of aluminatriselenetane with a Lewis acid has been documented. These investigations not only broaden the repertoire of unique main group species but also provide access to heterocyclic structures that present synthetic challenges through conventional methods.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Temperature Optical Thermometry via Dual Sensitivity of Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons Lifetime and Higher&#8208;Order Phonon Anharmonicity in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites</title>

We report a lead&#8208;free, vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite Cs2TeCl6, that achieves precise temperature sensing through a novel combination of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) photoluminescence (PL) lifetime modulation and unprecedented fifth&#8208;order phonon anharmonicity. The Eg phonon mode undergoes significant linewidth broadening due to five&#8208;phonon scattering processes, with a distinct nonlinear temperature dependence up to 500&#8197;K.







Abstract
Broad&#8208;temperature optical thermometry necessitates materials with exceptional sensitivity and stability across varied thermal conditions, presenting challenges for conventional systems. Here, we report a lead&#8208;free, vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite Cs2TeCl6, that achieves precise temperature sensing through a novel combination of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) photoluminescence (PL) lifetime modulation and unprecedented fifth&#8208;order phonon anharmonicity. The STEs PL lifetime demonstrates a highly temperature&#8208;sensitive response from 200 to 300&#8197;K, ideal for low&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate thermal sensing. In contrast, the Eg phonon mode undergoes significant linewidth broadening due to five&#8208;phonon scattering processes, with a distinct nonlinear temperature dependence up to 500&#8197;K. This fifth&#8208;order anharmonic effect enhances Raman&#8208;based temperature sensitivity, yielding a specific sensitivity (Sr) of 0.577&#8201;% K&#8211;1 at 330&#8197;K and remaining above 0.5&#8201;% K&#8211;1 at elevated temperatures. This study presents the first evidence of fifth&#8208;order anharmonic effects enhancing Raman&#8208;based temperature sensitivity, establishing Cs2TeCl6 as a versatile candidate for broad&#8208;temperature optical thermometry and opening new avenues for precise non&#8208;contact temperature sensing in advanced technological applications.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Solar&#8208;Driven Ammonia Coupled to C3&#8208;Dihydroxyacetone Production through Photoelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

The PEC integrated system consisting of CuPd/TSSS photocathode and Pd/BiVO4 photoanode is capable of producing ammonia and high value&#8208;added C3&#8208;DHA products from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater and biomass wastes by directly utilizing solar energy, which satisfies the increasing energy demand and reduces the environmental impact.







Abstract
Conversion of solar energy into value&#8208;added chemicals through photoelectrochemistry (PEC) holds great potential for advancing sustainable development but limits by high onset potential which affects energy conversion efficiencies. Herein, we utilized a CuPd cocatalyst&#8208;modified Sb2(S,Se)3 photocathode (CuPd/TSSS) to achieve an ultra&#8208;low onset potential of 0.83 VRHE for photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis. Meanwhile, we achieved unbiased NH3 production by synthesizing major value&#8208;added C3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA) through glycerol oxidation on the BiVO4 photoanode with the loading Pd cocatalyst, instead of a traditional solar water oxidation reaction. The PEC integrated system stably produced 11.98&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of NH3 and 201.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2 of DHA over 5&#8197;h with ~80&#8201;% faradaic efficiency without applying additional bias. In situ analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed high catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis at the CuPd/TSSS photocathode and enhanced selectivity for DHA at the Pd/BiVO4 photoanode. This design represents a breakthrough in directly utilizing solar energy, nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater, and biomass waste for ammonia and highly value&#8208;added C3 production, which addresses increasing energy demands while decreasing environmental impact.

         <title>Accelerating Tumor Immunotherapy Through a Synergistic Strategy of Increasing Throttle and Relaxing Brake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disodium hydrogen phosphate nanoparticles (Na2HPO4 NPs) release a large amount of ions within tumor cells, thereby activating pyroptosis and antitumor immune response, achieving &#8220;increasing throttle&#8221; of immunotherapy. Meanwhile, alkalescent Na2HPO4 NPs can further consume lactic acid and adenosine (Ado) to relieve two&#8208;tier immunosuppression, realizing &#8220;relaxing brake&#8221; on immunotherapy.







Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy has been widely used clinically, but it is still hindered by weak antitumor immunity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, a kind of simple disodium hydrogen phosphate nanoparticle (Na2HPO4 NP) is prepared to &#8220;accelerate&#8221; tumor immunotherapy by &#8220;increasing throttle&#8221; and &#8220;relaxing brake&#8221; simultaneously. The obtained Na2HPO4 NPs release a large amount of Na+ and HPO42&#8722; ions within tumor cells, thereby activating the caspase 1/GSDMD&#8208;mediated pyroptosis pathway to achieve immune activation. Meanwhile, alkalescent Na2HPO4 NPs can further consume lactic acid through acid&#8208;base neutralization, and regulate adenosine (Ado) metabolism via nanomaterial&#8208;induced biocatalytic process to relieve two&#8208;tier immunosuppression. Collectively, Na2HPO4 NPs effectively activate the antitumor immune process in vivo, and dramatically inhibit primary and distal tumor growth. This work will provide unique inspiration and strategy for the regulation of both positive and negative directions in immunotherapy.

Stabilize and improve! Mixed&#8208;linker synthesis and linker&#8208;installation both retrieved the activation&#8208;unstable framework of mesoporous NKM&#8208;809 and produced stabilized MOF derivatives. They established enhanced pyridyl&#8208;site density and mass transfer, and capable in self&#8208;calibrating pH&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;wavelength fluorescence. Extra quenching of emission&#8208;noise further distinguished NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, integrating quality&#8208;self&#8208;monitoring for practical usage.







Abstract
The practical applications of activation&#8208;unstable mesoporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often constrained by their structural instability. However, enhancing their stability could unlock valuable functionalities. Herein, we stabilized the otherwise unstable, post&#8208;activated structure of a novel mesoporous Zr(IV)&#8208;MOF, NKM&#8208;809, which constructed from a pyridine&#8208;containing amphiprotic linker (PPTB). We applied two strategies: mixed&#8208;linker synthesis and linker installation. In the mixed&#8208;linker approach, we incorporated an auxiliary linker, TPTB, which resembles PPTB, during synthesis to improve the framework's stability. In the linker installation approach, we introduced a ditopic carboxylate linker (BPDC) into the coordination&#8208;unsaturated sites of NKM&#8208;809. These strategies produced stabilized derivatives, named NKM&#8208;808.X (X=&#967;PPTB) and NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, which exhibit pH&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;wavelength fluorescence at distinct emission wavelengths. Remarkably, these emissions shift oppositely upon protonation and dissociation, distinguishing them as highly sensitive, self&#8208;calibrating acidity sensors. In NKM&#8208;809&#8208;BPDC, an additional quenching of the linker&#8208;emission (419&#8197;nm) minimizes inherent interference, enabling integrated quality and lifespan self&#8208;monitoring. Theoretical calculations identified transitions between (n, &#960;*) and (&#960;, &#960;*) emission states during the sensing process and highlighted the role of a stable mesoporous network in achieving stronger protonation response. These findings showcase the potential of stabilized mesoporous MOFs for practical applications, alongside valuable insights into strategies for optimizing such materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stabilize and improve&lt;/b&gt;! Mixed-linker synthesis and linker-installation both retrieved the activation-unstable framework of mesoporous NKM-809 and produced stabilized MOF derivatives. They established enhanced pyridyl-site density and mass transfer, and capable in self-calibrating pH-responsive dual-wavelength fluorescence. Extra quenching of emission-noise further distinguished NKM-809-BPDC, integrating quality-self-monitoring for practical usage.

         <title>Supramolecular Switching of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation for Orchestrating Enzyme Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple molecule comprising two naphthalene moieties linked by an ethylene glycol derivative was designed to undergo supramolecularly&#8208;regulated liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), offering a unique route to quantitively elucidating molecular&#8208;interaction variations within LLPS. The supramolecularly switched LLPS, along with selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, enables facilely orchestrating enzyme kinetics.







Abstract
Dynamic liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and associated assembly and disassembly of biomolecular condensates play crucial roles in cellular organization and metabolic networks. These processes are often regulated by supramolecular interactions. However, the complex and disordered structures of IDPs, coupled with their rapid conformational fluctuations, pose significant challenges for reconstructing supramolecularly&#8208;regulated dynamic LLPS systems and quantitatively illustrating variations in molecular interactions. Inspired by the structural feature of IDPs that facilitates LLPS, we designed a simplified phase&#8208;separating molecule, Nap&#8208;o&#8208;Nap, consisting of two naphthalene moieties linked by an ethylene glycol derivative. This compound exhibits LLPS under physiological conditions, forming coacervate microdroplets that undergo multiple cycles of disassembly and reassembly upon stoichiometric addition of Cucurbit[7]uril and Adamantane, respectively, based upon competitive host&#8211;guest interactions. Importantly, such reversible control offers a unique route to quantify entropically dominant nature (&#916;S=14.0&#8197;cal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K&#8722;1) within the LLPS process, in which the binding affinity of host&#8211;guest interactions (&#916;G=&#8722;14.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1) surpass that of the LLPS of Nap&#8208;o&#8208;Nap (&#916;G=&#8722;2.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1), enabling the supramolecular regulation process. The supramolecularly switched LLPS, along with selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, provides a promising platform for either boosting or retarding enzymatic reactions, thereby orchestrating biological enzyme kinetics.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Deconstruction of Polyolefins: A Strategy to Up&#8208;cycle Waste Polyethylene to Value&#8208;Added Alkene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed method for deconstructing polyethylene into value&#8208;added long&#8208;chain alkenes. The process involves dehydrogenation, introducing 3.38&#8201;% double bonds, followed by cross&#8208;metathesis with ethylene using the HG&#8208;II catalyst. This results in 58&#8201;% selective production of dodecene (C12) derivatives, with a 1:0.8 ratio of terminal to internal olefins. The method is effective for post&#8208;consumer polyethylene waste.







Abstract
Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from post&#8208;consumer waste polyolefins is fascinating as well as challenging. Here we report ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed up&#8208;cycling of the polyethylene to long&#8208;chain alkene derivatives. The developed methodology mainly involves two steps i.e., dehydrogenation of polyethylene through hydrogen atom transfer and its metathesis using the HG&#8208;II catalyst. The dehydrogenation of polyethylene using ruthenium catalysis derived up to 3.38&#8201;%, of double bonds; with 90&#8201;% of the recovered polyolefin material. The obtained unsaturated polyethylene was subjected to cross&#8208;metathesis with ethylene using HG&#8208;II catalytic system. This resulted in the synthesis of predominantly dodecene (C12) derivatives, with 58&#8201;% selectivity, along with other derivatives of varying chain lengths. The overall reaction produced terminal and internal olefins in the ratio 1:0.8 respectively. The dehydrogenation of polyethylene and its deconstruction was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The origin of C12 selectivity has been demonstrated by control experiments. The scope of the methodology was extended to post&#8208;consumer waste polyethylene which gave high conversion to value&#8208;added dodecene derivatives as a major product.

         <title>Impact of Pressure on Metavalent Bonding in BiTe Influencing Electronic Topological Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pressure enhances metavalent bonding in dual topological insulator, BiTe, influencing the electronic topological transitions (ETT) at 1 and 3&#8197;GPa. Pressure induced synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray pair distribution functional analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theoretical calculation of electronic structure reveal changes in chemical bonding nature and Fermi surface topology.







Abstract
BiTe, a member of the (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n homologous series, possesses natural van der Waals&#8208;like heterostructure with a Bi2 bilayer sandwiched between the two [Te&#8722;Bi&#8722;Te&#8722;Bi&#8722;Te] quintuple layers. BiTe exhibits both the quantum states of weak topological and topological crystalline insulators, making it a dual topological insulator and a suitable candidate for spintronics, quantum computing and thermoelectrics. Herein, we demonstrate that the chemical bonding in BiTe is to be metavalent, which plays a significant role in the pressure dependent change in the topology of the electronic structure Fermi surface. The enhancement of the metavalent bonding character with pressure in BiTe is evidenced from first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Due to the change in the Fermi surface topology, we have visualized electronic topological transitions (ETT) at ~1 and ~3&#8197;GPa through pressure dependent synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and Raman spectroscopy. The correlation between the metavalent bonding and ETT offers insights into chemical bonding influenced transitions in quantum materials.

Mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline FeFe(CN)6 microspheres are characterized by interconnected pores within the entire single&#8208;crystalline body, allowing the electrolyte to penetrate into the microspheres and alleviating side reactions. The resulting structurally unique FeFe(CN)6 cathode exhibits excellent rate capability of 86.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance over 2000 cycles in potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs), also known as Prussian blue analogues, are ideal cathodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their nontoxicity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, obtaining metal HCF cathode materials with both long&#8208;term cycling stability and high rate performance remains a daunting challenge. In this study, we present mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline iron hexacyanoferrate (MSC&#8208;FeHCF) microspheres, featuring a single&#8208;crystalline structure that contains interconnected pores spanning the entire crystal lattice. This unique architecture not only enables the electrolyte to fully penetrate into the single crystal, but also shorten the K+ diffusion distance. Additionally, the confinement effect of mesopores on interior water mitigates the excessive side reactions. The stress during battery cycling can be dispersed through multiple paths to alleviate the internal strain. The MSC&#8208;FeHCF microspheres exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performance, achieving a specific discharge capacity of 123.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 30&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 87.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, providing 85.8&#8201;% of the initial capacity. More importantly, the MSC&#8208;FeHCF microspheres exhibit high rate capability, delivering 86.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study introduces an innovative strategy for engineering metal HCF cathode materials, thereby opening a novel avenue for the development of high&#8208;efficiency electrode materials for PIBs.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Targeting Macrocyclic Peptides as Nanomolar Inhibitors of Self&#8208; and Cross&#8208;Seeded Amyloid Self&#8208;Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

Cross&#8208;seeding of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) amyloid self&#8208;assembly by islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) has been suggested to link type 2 diabetes to Parkinson's disease. Here we show that designed multi&#8208;targeting macrocyclic peptides previously found to inhibit IAPP and/or Alzheimer's amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;40(42)) are nanomolar inhibitors of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded &#945;Syn amyloid self&#8208;assembly and promising leads for multifunctional anti&#8208;amyloid drugs.







Abstract
Amyloid self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;Syn) is linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has recently emerged as a risk factor for PD. Cross&#8208;interactions between their amyloidogenic proteins may act as molecular links. In fact, fibrils of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) (T2D) can cross&#8208;seed &#945;Syn amyloidogenesis and &#945;Syn and IAPP colocalize in PD brains. Inhibition of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded &#945;Syn amyloidogenesis could thus interfere with PD pathogenesis. Here we show that macrocyclic peptides, designed to mimic IAPP self&#8208;/cross&#8208;interaction sites and previously found to inhibit amyloidogenesis of IAPP and/or Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide A&#946;40(42), are nanomolar inhibitors of both self&#8208; and IAPP&#8208;cross&#8208;seeded amyloid self&#8208;assembly of &#945;Syn. Anti&#8208;amyloid function is mediated by nanomolar affinity interactions with &#945;Syn via three &#945;Syn regions which are identified as key sites of both &#945;Syn self&#8208;assembly and its cross&#8208;interactions with IAPP. We also show that the peptides block A&#946;42&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;seeding of &#945;Syn as well. Based on their broad spectrum anti&#8208;amyloid function and additional drug&#8208;like features, these peptides are leads for multifunctional anti&#8208;amyloid drugs in PD, T2D, AD, and their comorbidities, while the identified &#945;Syn key segments are valuable targets for novel, multi&#8208;site targeting amyloid inhibitors in PD and related synucleinopathies.

         <title>Design of an Ultrafast and Controlled Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Photoiniferter RAFT Polymerization for Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel xanthate molecule was designed to facilitate highly controlled photoiniferter RAFT polymerization at fast rates under visible light. This approach was applied in aqueous photoinitiated polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (photo&#8208;PISA). The rapid photolysis and extended absorption of this xanthate enable ultrafast and scalable fabrication of polymeric nanoparticles with various well&#8208;defined morphologies, including spheres, worms, and vesicles.







Abstract
In this contribution, we designed a new xanthate RAFT agent by introducing (5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;naphthalenyl)oxy (TNO) as the Z group, namely 2&#8208;[(((5,6,7,8&#8208;Tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;naphthalenyl)oxycarbonothioyl)thio)ethyl propanoate] (TNXEP). Due to the presence of the TNO group, TNXEP enabled highly controlled and ultrafast photoiniferter RAFT polymerization under violet (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) and blue (&#955;=450&#8197;nm) light. This approach was effectively extended to aqueous media for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), facilitating the synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles. Leveraging the rapid photolysis and extended absorption of TNXEP, we demonstrated the first photoiniferter PISA system realizing ultrafast polymerization (&gt;90&#8201;% monomer conversion in minutes) under visible light irradiation. Enhanced visible light penetration improved photopolymerization uniformity, enabling rapid and scalable production of polymeric nanoparticles at a 30&#8197;g scale in just 10 minutes, with tunable morphologies, including spheres, worms, and vesicles.

         <title>Mapping Dynamic Protein Clustering with AIEgen&#8208;Active Chemigenetic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinctly different with misfolding&#8208;induced protein aggregation, protein clusters are often not typical phase&#8208;separated condensates, thus exhibiting extremely subtle changes in the clustering microenvironment. Here we describe a de novo design strategy of amphiphilic AIEgen&#8208;active chemigenetic probes, which has for the first time monitored precise dynamic condensed states of protein clustering/disassembling in living cells.







Abstract
Protein clustering/disassembling is a fundamental process in biomolecular condensates, playing a crucial role in cell fate decision and cellular homeostasis. However, the inherent features of protein clustering, especially for its reversible behavior and subtle microenvironment variation, present significant hurdles in probe chemistry for tracking protein clustering dynamics. Herein, we report a bilateral&#8208;tailored chemigenetic probe, in which an &#8220;amphiphilic&#8221; aggregate&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) QMSO3Cl is covalently conjugated to a protein tag that is genetically fused to protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest (POI). Prior to target POI, the &#8220;amphiphilic&#8221; AIE&#8208;active QMSO3Cl achieves a completely dark state in both aqueous biological environment and lipophilic organelles, thereby ensuring an ultra&#8208;low intrinsic background interference. Upon reaching POI, the combination of synthetic molecule and genetically encoded protein allows for protein clustering&#8208;dependent ultra&#8208;sensitive response, with a substantial lighting&#8208;up fluorescence (67.5&#8208;fold) as protein transitions from disassembling to clustering state. Such ultra&#8208;high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enables to monitor the dynamic and fate of inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) clustering/disassembling under both acute and chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in living cells. For the first time, we have demonstrated the use of chemigenetic probe to reveal therapy&#8208;induced ER stress and screen drugs in a three&#8208;dimensional scenario: microviscosity change, clustering dynamic, and cluster morphology. This chemigenetic probe design strategy would greatly facilitate the advancement of mapping protein dynamics in cell homeostasis and medicine research.

         <title>The Role of Open&#8208;Shell Organic Radical in Enhancing Anti&#8208;Tumor Photocatalysis Reaction of NIR Light&#8208;Activated Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activated open&#8208;shell photosensitizer shows exceptional type&#8208;I photodynamic activity. As the unpaired electrons in this open&#8208;shell photosensitizer are delocalized and generate additional electronic energy levels, photo&#8208;induced charge transfer is promoted to facilitate type&#8208;I photodynamic reaction. This finding inspires new strategies for developing high&#8208;performance photosensitizers adapted to treating deeper lesions.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell radical materials, which are characterized by unpaired electrons, have led to revolutionary breakthroughs in material science due to their unique optoelectronic properties. However, the involvement of organic radicals in photodynamic therapy (PDT) has rarely been reported or discussed. This work studies two photosensitizer analogs. 4AM&#8208;OS with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation exhibits open&#8208;shell radical characters and enhanced type&#8208;I photodynamic activity compared with closed&#8208;shell 2AM&#8208;CS. 4AM&#8208;OS displays the thermally accessible triplet&#8208;state character, resulting in more unpaired electrons delocalized along the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone at higher temperatures. Accordingly, the temperature&#8208;dependent photodynamic activity of 4AM&#8208;OS confirms its association with the open&#8208;shell electronic structure. As the unpaired electrons in open&#8208;shell 4AM&#8208;OS are more delocalized and generate additional electronic energy states, photo&#8208;induced charge transfer is promoted to facilitate type&#8208;I photodynamic reactions. This observation addresses the challenge associated with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, such as 4AM&#8208;OS, which often demonstrate low efficacy in PDT due to the limited energy provided by NIR light despite its superior tissue penetration depth. Overall, clarifying the beneficial role of organic radicals in photodynamic reactions will bring revolutionary breakthroughs to developing high&#8208;performance NIR photosensitizers and promoting the efficacy of PDT for deep&#8208;seated lesions.

         <title>Upcycling Polynorbornene Derivatives into Chemically Recyclable Multiblock Linear and Thermoset Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for upcycling crosslinked pDCPD and linear polynorbornene derivatives into recyclable multiblock crosslinked and linear polymers is reported. This work is accomplished through polymer deconstruction into distinct oligomeric buildings blocks and their repolymerization in different feed ratios. The obtained materials show highly tunable mechanical properties.







Abstract
Synthetic polymers have found widespread use, but their ineffective end&#8208;of&#8208;life treatment is causing a significant environmental and human health crisis. Here, we demonstrate the upcycling of polynorbornene derivatives (pNBEs) through their deconstruction into distinct oligomeric buildings blocks that can be repolymerized into chemically recyclable pNBEs&#8208;like multiblock polymers via dehydrogenative polymerization. The resulting materials exhibit diverse mechanical properties, while integrating high melting temperatures (Tm as high as 133&#8201;&#176;C). Notably, this method could also enable the selective deconstruction of permanently cross&#8208;linked polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets into telechelic&#8208;OH functionalized oligomers, overcoming the significant challenges posed by their robust network structure in recycling and degradation. The resulting pDCPD oligomers can subsequently be repolymerized with macrodiols to create multiblock thermosets with tunable mechanical properties, including Young's modulus and tensile elongation. After use, upcycled plastics could be effectively deconstructed back to the oligomers for recovery and repolymerization. Overall, this work establishes an approach that can be utilized to upcycle pNBEs into previously inaccessible multiblock thermosets and thermoplastics with full recyclability, and may be generalizable to a range of polymers to shift their end&#8208;of&#8208;life waste disposal toward sustainable recovery and reuse.

         <title>Manipulating Charge Distribution at Organic&#8208;inorganic Interface via Optimizing Substituents for Sustainable Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic&#8211;inorganic interfaces constructed by CoS and substituent&#8208;modified phthalocyanine nanosheets (CoPc&#8208;g) can precisely regulate spatial electric field intensity by controlling charge transfer, thus optimizing the electronic structure of interfacial dual active sites. As a result, CoPc&#8208;CH3/CoS with the strongest space charge region possesses the best performance and stability.







Abstract
The space charge effect induced by high&#8208;quality heterojunctions is essential for efficient electrocatalytic processes. Herein, we delicately manipulate intermolecular charge transfer by modifying substituents (&#8722;g=&#8208;CH3, &#8208;H, &#8208;NO2) with various electron donating/withdrawing capabilities in CoPc&#8208;g/CoS organic&#8211;inorganic heterostructures. CoPc&#8208;CH3, as a typical electron donor, transfers more electrons to CoS due to the presence of &#8208;CH3, forming the strongest space electric field and thus regulating the dual active sites at the interface. Furthermore, oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates preferentially adsorb on the positively charged CoPc&#8208;CH3 side, and the rapid accumulation of electrons on the CoS side decelerates catalyst dissolution at the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential, ensuring the stable OER process under the optimized adsorbate evolution mechanism. As a result, CoPc&#8208;CH3/CoS catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential and remains stable for 150&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The method provides a novel strategy for accurately regulating the space electric field of heterojunctions.

         <dc:description>
The pyrrolysyl pair has dominated noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) incorporation in eukaryotes, but additional engineerable pairs are needed to further expand this toolbox. Although E. coli leucyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS) is a promising candidate, engineering its substrate specificity has been much less successful. Here, we optimized a yeast&#8208;based directed evolution system to rapidly engineer EcLeuRS to charge diverse ncAAs in mammalian cells.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in eukaryotes has predominantly relied on the pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. However, access to additional easily engineered pairs is crucial for expanding the structural diversity of the ncAA toolbox in eukaryotes. The Escherichia coli&#8208;derived leucyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS)/tRNA pair presents a particularly promising alternative. This pair has been engineered to charge a small yet structurally diverse group of ncAAs in eukaryotic cells. However, expanding the substrate scope of EcLeuRS has been difficult due to the suboptimal yeast&#8208;based directed evolution platform used for its engineering. In this study, we address this limitation by optimizing the yeast&#8208;based directed evolution platform for efficient selection of ncAA&#8208;selective EcLeuRS mutants. Using the optimized selection system, we demonstrate rapid isolation of many novel EcLeuRS mutants capable of incorporating various ncAAs in mammalian cells, including ornithine and N&#1013;&#8208;acetyl&#8208;methyllysine, a recently discovered post&#8208;translational modification in mammalian cells.

Constructing covalent organic frameworks with a continuous and uniform distribution of nitrogen active sites along the 1D pore walls enables effective anchoring of iodine species and facilitates rapid chemical reaction kinetics. This design significantly enhances the framework&#8216;s potential as a cathode host material for aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, thereby improving the batteries&#8242; overall performance.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs) are gaining attention as next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical capacity, enhanced safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their practical application is hindered by challenges such as slow reaction kinetics and the persistent polyiodide shuttle effect. To address these limitations, we developed a novel class of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring electron&#8208;rich nitrogen sites with varied density and distribution (N1&#8208;N4) along the pore walls. These nitrogen sites enhance iodine species confinement and mass transport. Our experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the continuous and optimized distribution of nitrogen sites within the COF structure significantly reduces internal resistance and boosts redox activity. Moreover, the N4&#8208;COF demonstrates superior performance compared to other porous materials, due to its high density and strategic alignment of active sites. The I2@N4&#8208;COF cathode achieves a remarkable specific capacity of 348&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C, almost 1.8 times greater than that of the I2@N1&#8208;COF, while also maintaining excellent cycling stability. This integration of a porous framework with aligned nitrogen sites in the N4&#8208;COF structure not only enhances iodine redox behavior but also offers a promising design strategy for developing high&#8208;performance AZIB electrodes.

         <title>Revealing the CO Tolerance Mechanism in Acidic Hydrogen Oxidation Reactions on Platinum&#8208;Based Catalyst Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

A detailed schematic of attenuating CO adsorption on the basis of oxidizing CO to enhance CO tolerance at platinum&#8208;based catalysts under acidic HOR can be outlined by in situ Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
The presence of trace CO impurity gas in hydrogen fuel can rapidly deactivate platinum&#8208;based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts due to poisoning effects, yet the precise CO tolerance mechanism remains debated. Our designed Au@PtX bifunctional core&#8211;shell nanocatalysts exhibit excellent performance of CO tolerance in acidic solution during HOR and possess exceptional Raman spectroscopy enhancement. Through capturing and analyzing in situ Raman spectroscopy evidences on *OH, metal&#8208;O species and *CO evolution under 0.3&#8197;V, we confirm that oxygen&#8208;containing species on PtRu and PtSn catalysts promote the oxidation and desorption of *CO. While Ru enhances *CO adsorption on Pt, the primary CO tolerance performance of PtRu arises from *CO oxidation via a bifunctional pathway. Additionally, electronic structure of Sn reduces *CO adsorption on Pt sites, complementing the bifunctional mechanism to further enhance the CO tolerance performance of PtSn. These discoveries significantly deepen our understanding of the anti&#8208;poisoning mechanism of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the HOR process and offer valuable insights for rational catalyst design.

         <title>Harnessing Adsorbate&#8208;Adsorbate Interaction to Activate C&#8722;N Bond for Exceptional Photoelectrochemical Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

This work represents an outstanding photoelectrochemical urea oxidation performance on n&#8208;Si photoanodes, providing a quantitative understanding of adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction for urea oxidation on semiconductor surfaces at a molecular level for the first time.







Abstract
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) urea oxidation reaction (UOR) presents a promising half&#8208;reaction for green hydrogen production, but the stable resonance structure of the urea molecule results in sluggish kinetics for breaking the C&#8722;N bond. Herein, we realize the record PEC UOR performance on a NiO&#8208;modified n&#8208;Si photoanode (NiO@Ni/n&#8208;Si) by harnessing the adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction. We quantificationally unveil a dependence of the UOR activation barrier on the coverage of photogenerated surface high&#8208;valent Ni&#8208;oxo species (NiIV=O) by employing operando PEC spectroscopic measurements and theoretical simulations. The strong attraction between NiIV=O and adsorbed urea facilitates their N&#8722;O coupling while weakening the C&#8722;N bonding within urea, manifesting as the decreased UOR activation energy from 0.74 to 0.41&#8197;eV when the surface coverage of NiIV=O is enhanced from zero to full, corresponding to more than two orders of magnitude enhancement for the UOR rate. Furthermore, an industrial&#8208;grade photocurrent density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at a potential as low as 1.08 VRHE by stimulating the NiIV=O accumulation under 10 Suns, which is 300&#8197;mV lower than the potential required for most reported electrochemical counterparts. This work opens new prospects for achieving high&#8208;performance PEC urea oxidation via adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate interaction.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3 have been accomplished, in which 1.5&#8197;g of bryostatin 1 was obtained in a single sequence of the final three steps. The intramolecular geminal bis(silyl) Prins cyclization was employed to establish the complete cis&#8208;Z selectivity on the B&#8208;ring. The syntheses consist of 20&#8211;22 steps in the longest linear sequence and 33&#8211;35 total steps, with overall yields ranging from 3.3&#8201;% to 4.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Bryostatins are a family of marine natural products that have garnered significant interests, as evidenced by over 40 clinical trials. However, their extremely low natural abundance has severely limited further research. Despite significant efforts, which have led to the total synthesis of seven bryostatin members by eight independent research groups, these complex molecules present persistent challenges for stereocontrolled, large&#8208;scale, and especially divergent synthesis. Here, we report the divergent total syntheses of bryostatins 1, 7, 9 and 9&#8208;N3. Notably, 1.5&#8197;g of bryostatin 1 was obtained in a single sequence of the final three steps. Key transformations include Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling to rapidly assemble the northern fragment, the flow chemistry&#8208;assisted visible light&#8208;induced alkyl radical conjugate addition to convergently construct the southern fragment, and an intramolecular geminal bis(silyl) Prins cyclization to establish the cis&#8208;Z selectivity on the B&#8208;ring. The syntheses consist of 20&#8211;22 steps in the longest linear sequence and 33&#8211;35 total steps, with overall yields ranging from 3.3&#8201;% to 4.5&#8201;%.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixture through Adaptive Recognition Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

An adaptive microporous material with appropriate pore size and the match of electrostatic potentials shows excellent trace C2H2 and CO2 trapping capability at 0.01&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K with high C2H2/C2H4 and top&#8208;level CO2/C2H4 selectivity simultaneously, which can realize one&#8208;step record&#8208;high acquisition of C2H4 from ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixture under various conditions.







Abstract
One&#8208;step adsorptive purification of ethylene (C2H4) from ternary mixture comprising of acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is a great challenge in the chemical industry. Herein, a microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (FJI&#8208;H38) has been reported, which possesses high&#8208;density electronegative O/N binding sites and appropriate pore size. Notably, at 0.01&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K FJI&#8208;H38 shows excellent trapping capability for C2H2 (1.64&#8197;mmol/g) and CO2 (2.33&#8197;mmol/g), while the uptake of C2H4 is only 0.41&#8197;mmol/g, which endows FJI&#8208;H38 high C2H2/C2H4 and top&#8208;level CO2/C2H4 selectivity simultaneously. Polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&#8805;99.95&#8201;%) with record&#8208;high productivity can be successfully obtained from ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixture in one step under various conditions. Even at 318&#8197;K, the separation performance has no obvious decrease. Such excellent separation performance is due to the adaptive recognition of C2H2 and CO2 by FJI&#8208;H38 through the synergistic effect of appropriate pore size and the match of electrostatic potentials, where C2H2 and CO2 can be stabilized by the O/N and aromatic ring sites.

&lt;p&gt;An adaptive microporous material with appropriate pore size and the match of electrostatic potentials shows excellent trace C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; trapping capability at 0.01&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K with high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and top-level CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity simultaneously, which can realize one-step record-high acquisition of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from ternary C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixture under various conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-step adsorptive purification of ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) from ternary mixture comprising of acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a great challenge in the chemical industry. Herein, a microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (&lt;b&gt;FJI-H38)&lt;/b&gt; has been reported, which possesses high-density electronegative O/N binding sites and appropriate pore size. Notably, at 0.01&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K &lt;b&gt;FJI-H38&lt;/b&gt; shows excellent trapping capability for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1.64&#8197;mmol/g) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (2.33&#8197;mmol/g), while the uptake of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is only 0.41&#8197;mmol/g, which endows &lt;b&gt;FJI-H38&lt;/b&gt; high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and top-level CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity simultaneously. Polymer-grade C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8805;99.95&#8201;%) with record-high productivity can be successfully obtained from ternary C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixture in one step under various conditions. Even at 318&#8197;K, the separation performance has no obvious decrease. Such excellent separation performance is due to the adaptive recognition of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by &lt;b&gt;FJI-H38&lt;/b&gt; through the synergistic effect of appropriate pore size and the match of electrostatic potentials, where C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be stabilized by the O/N and aromatic ring sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Needle in a Haystack: Transient Porosity in a Closed Pore Square Lattice Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porosity &#8220;without pores&#8221;! We report a transiently porous coordination network that undergoes phase transformations between distinct closed pore phases in response to desolvation, humidity, or exposure to CO2 and C2H2 gases. Investigating its guest transport mechanism, we uncover a crystal engineering strategy with potential to enable the design of transient porosity in similar compounds.







Abstract
Guest transport through discrete voids (closed pores) in crystalline solids is poorly understood. Herein, we report the gas sorption properties of a nonporous coordination network, {[Co(bib)2Cl2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH}n (sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945;), featuring square lattice (sql) topology and the bent linker 1,3&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene (bib). The as&#8208;synthesized sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945; has 11.3&#8201;% (313&#8197;&#197;3) of its unit cell volume in closed pores occupied by methanol (MeOH). Upon desolvation and air exposure, sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945; underwent a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) phase transformation to sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946;&#8242;, wherein MeOH was replaced by water. Activation (vacuum or N2 flow) resulted in dehydration and retention of the closed pores, affording sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946; with 7.7&#8201;% (194&#8197;&#197;3) guest&#8208;accessible space. sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946; was found to preferentially adsorb C2H2 (at 265&#8197;K) over CO2 (at 195&#8197;K) through gate&#8208;opening mechanisms, at gate&#8208;opening pressures of 59.8 and 27.7&#8197;kPa, respectively, while other C2 gases were excluded. PXRD was used to monitor transformations between the three phases of sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl, while in situ DSC, in situ SCXRD under CO2 pressure, and computational studies provided insight into the guest transport mechanism, which we attribute to the angular, flexible nature of the bib ligand. Further, the preferential adsorption of C2H2 over CO2 and other C2 gases suggests that transiently porous sorbents might have utility in separations.

         <title>Tailored Polymer&#8208;Inorganic Bilayer SEI with Proton Holder Feature for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilayer/P&#8722;F SEI with proton holder feature is designed to stabilize Zn anode at high current densities and areal capacities. The inner ZnF2 has high stiffness and strength, effectively suppressing Zn dendrites. The outer polyaniline (PANI) regulates current distribution across the Zn surface and delays the Sand's time of dendrites growth. Meanwhile, the =N&#8722; group in PANI serves as a reversible proton holder, thereby inhibiting HER.







Abstract
Conventional solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries mainly acts as a physical barrier to prevent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while such SEI is prone to structural deterioration stemming from uneven Zn deposition at high current densities. Herein, we propose an in situ structural design of polymer&#8208;inorganic bilayer SEI with a proton holder feature by aniline&#8208;modulated electrolytes. The Zn(OTF)2 exhibits a lower LUMO energy level in comparison to aniline, resulting in the formation of a bilayer structure characterized by an inner ZnF2 layer and an outer polyaniline (PANI) layer. The ZnF2 with high stiffness and strength effectively suppresses Zn dendrites. Meanwhile, the PANI regulates the current distribution, minimizing the concentration gradient, and delays the Sand's time of dendrites growth. Furthermore, the =N&#8722; in PANI is capable of reversible proton holder, thereby inhibiting HER. With this bilayer SEI, the Zn anode achieves an impressive cycle life of 126&#8197;h under 40&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 &amp; 40&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (depth of discharge, DOD=70.8&#8201;%), solving the bottleneck of single&#8208;layer inorganic SEI that could not be cycled under these conditions. The Zn&#8201;||&#8201;NaVO pouch battery with bilayer SEI exhibits a high capacity of 1.2&#8197;Ah and a cycle life of 350&#8197;h with 78&#8201;% capacity retention. At &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, the same battery delivers a capacity of 335&#8197;mAh and a cycle life of 507&#8197;h with 72&#8201;% capacity retention, attributed to the modulation mechanism of the hydrogen bonding in the electrolyte. Our findings offer profound insights into the design of SEI with tailored structure and functionality, paving the way for the next generation of advanced high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Quantifying Asymmetric Coordination to Correlate with Oxygen Reduction Activity in Fe&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based Fe single&#8208;atom sites with quantified asymmetry coordination configurations are investigated to make up the structure&#8211;activity relationship study challenge for atom&#8208;level catalysts. The obtained volcano plots and experimental results verify that FeN4&#8208;SeC2 with a moderate asymmetry degree exhibits the best ORR activity, which refines and broadens the understanding of oxygen electrochemistry.







Abstract
Precisely manipulating asymmetric coordination configurations and examining electronic effects enable to tunethe intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the lackof a definite relationship between coordination asymmetry and catalytic activity makes the rational design of SACs ambiguous. Here, we propose a concept of &#8220;asymmetry degree&#8221; to quantify asymmetric coordination configurations and assess the effectiveness of active moieties in Fe&#8208;based SACs. A theoretical framework is established, elucidating the volcanic relationship between asymmetry degree and ORR activity by constructing a series of Fe&#8208;based SAC models doped with non&#8208;metal atoms (B, P, S, Se, and Te) in the first or second coordination sphere, which aligns with Sabatier principle. The predicted ORR activity of Fe asymmetric active moieties is then experimentally validated using asymmetry degree. The combined computational and experimental results suggest that single&#8208;atom moiety with a moderate asymmetry degree exhibits optimal intrinsic ORR activity, because breaking the square&#8208;planar symmetry of FeN4 can alter the electronic population of the Fe 3d&#8208;orbital, thereby optimizing the adsorption&#8208;desorption strength of intermediates and thus enhancing the intrinsic ORR activity. This fundamental understanding of catalytic activity from geometric and electronic aspects offers a rational guidance to design high&#8208;performance SACs with asymmetric configurations.

A theoretical framework is established, elucidating the volcanic relationship between asymmetry degree and ORR activity by constructing a series of Fe-based SAC models doped with non-metal atoms (B, P, S, Se, and Te) in the first or second coordination sphere, which aligns with Sabatier principle. The predicted ORR activity of Fe asymmetric active moieties is then experimentally validated using asymmetry degree. The combined computational and experimental results suggest that single-atom moiety with a moderate asymmetry degree exhibits optimal intrinsic ORR activity, because breaking the square-planar symmetry of FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can alter the electronic population of the Fe 3d-orbital, thereby optimizing the adsorption-desorption strength of intermediates and thus enhancing the intrinsic ORR activity. This fundamental understanding of catalytic activity from geometric and electronic aspects offers a rational guidance to design high-performance SACs with asymmetric configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Water Purification by Template&#8208;Free Nanoconfined Catalysts Derived from Municipal Sludge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;free approach transforms municipal sludge into high&#8208;performance nanoconfined catalysts by leveraging selective hydrofluoric acid corrosion to manipulate micro&#8208;mesoporous structures. Atomically dispersed Fe centers are confined, resulting in a shift of reaction mechanism and achieving a impressive 261&#8208;fold increase in catalytic pollutant degradation. This scalable method not only tackles waste management but also offers a sustainable route for manufacturing advanced catalysts, contributing to water purification and global waste upcycling efforts.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement at the interface of heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysts offers promising avenues for advancing oxidation processes in water purification. Herein, we introduce a template&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing nanoconfined catalysts from municipal sludge (S&#8208;NCCs), specifically engineered to optimize reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and utilization for rapid pollutant degradation. Using selective hydrofluoric acid corrosion, we create an architecture that confines atomically dispersed Fe centers within a micro&#8208;mesoporous carbon matrix in situ. This method maximizes the utilization of silicon and aluminum content from sludge, prevents metal agglomeration, and precisely regulates the chemical environment of Fe active sites. As a result, the S&#8208;NCCs promote a transition from nonradical to hybrid radical/nonradical reaction mechanisms, significantly enhancing ROS efficiency, stability, and pollutant degradation rates. These catalysts demonstrate exceptional pollutant removal performance, achieving a 261&#8208;fold increase in degradation efficiency for compounds such as phenol and sulfamethoxazole compared to unconfined analogs, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fenton&#8208;like systems. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of nanoconfined catalysis in environmental applications, providing an effective and scalable solution for sustainable water purification.

         <title>Exploiting Lattice Carbon&#8208;Induced Modulation Effect in Nickel towards Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the content of lattice carbon (LC), the electronic structure and adsorption properties of nickel are changed, and the volcanic relationship between the lattice carbon content and the alkaline HOR activity is revealed.







Abstract
Doping with non&#8208;metallic heteroatom is an effective approach to tailor the electronic structure of Ni for enhancing its alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalytic performance. However, the modulation of HOR activity of Ni by lattice carbon (LC) atoms has rarely been reported, especially to reveal the rule between the doping effect and activity caused by the content of LC atoms. Here, hydrogen is proposed as a scavenger for LC atoms in the pyrolytic reduction process to finely control the content of LC atoms in Ni. With the removal of LC atoms in Ni lattice, the electronic structure changes from Ni3C&#8208;like electronic structure to quasi&#8208;Ni structure. Furthermore, a volcanic relationship between the LC content and HOR activity of Ni is established for the first time. The Cless&#8208;Ni (LC0.44&#8208;Ni) with optimized LC content shows the best activity owing to the weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and optimal hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE). This work provides an inspiration for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts by tailoring the electronic structure of the metal via LC atoms doping.

         <title>Comprehensive Passivation of Surface and Bulk Defects in Perovskite for High Efficiency Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive strategy combining &#8220;wet film treatment&#8221; and &#8220;dry film treatment&#8221; was proposed to passivate surface and bulk defects of CsPbI3 films. The high diffusivity of choline in the intermediate phase film made the LD perovskite permeate through the grain boundaries of the bulk film. Benefiting from this strategy, the assembled carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cell (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, which is a new record efficiency for inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) have the advantages of high stability and low cost, but their mean efficiency has become an obstacle to commercialization. Defects, which are widely distributed on the surface and bulk of films, are an important factor in C&#8208;PSCs for low efficiency. The conventional post&#8208;treatment method through forming a low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskite layer usually fails in manipulating the bulk defects. Herein, we propose a strategy of combining wet film (uncrystallized) treatment with dry film treatment to in situ form LD perovskite throughout the grain boundaries inside of the film and on the surface of the film, thereby simultaneously passivating the bulk and surface defects in the CsPbI3 film. As a result, the photoluminescence lifetime is significantly improved from 22.5&#8197;ns to 92.1&#8197;ns. The assembled CsPbI3 C&#8208;PSCs based on the above strategy deliver a champion efficiency of 19.65&#8201;%, which is a new record efficiency for inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Stereochemistry&#8208;Tuned Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Synergistic Covalent Adaptable Networks: Towards Recycled Elastomers with Excellent Creep&#8208;Resistant Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

We develop a novel approach to enhance polyurethane&#8208;urea elastomer performance by manipulating the stereochemistry of rigid diamine chain extenders. The trans configuration (R,R or S,S) of 1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane imparts superior creep resistance, thermal stability, and mechanical properties. The elastomers are recyclable via urea bond exchange and retain performance post&#8208;recycling, demonstrating potential for high&#8208;performance, sustainable applications in aerospace and flexible materials.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) offer innovative solutions for the reprocessing and recycling of thermoset polymers. However, achieving a balance between easy reprocessing and creep resistance remains a challenge. This study focuses on designing and synthesizing polyurethane (PU) materials with tailored properties by manipulating the stereochemistry of diamine chain extenders. By employing cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;configurations of diamine extenders, we developed a series of PU materials with varying mechanical properties and creep resistance. The trans&#8208;configured materials (R,R&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU or S,S&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU) exhibited superior creep resistance and mechanical strength due to dense hydrogen bonding networks. The cis&#8208;configured materials (Cis&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU) exhibited enhanced processability and elasticity. Under 0.1&#8197;MPa stress, R,R&#8208;DAC&#8208;PU showed a mere 3.5&#8201;% strain change at 170&#8201;&#176;C over 60&#8197;minutes, highlighting its superior creep resistance. Both configurations can be recycled via urea bond exchange reactions using hot pressing or solvothermal methods. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that both the (R,R&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)2 and (S,S&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)2 segments form six hydrogen bonds with shorter bond lengths, leading to stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Conversely, the (Cis&#8208;DCA&#8208;UB&#8208;U)2 segment forms four hydrogen bonds with longer bond lengths, resulting in weaker interactions. This work highlights the critical role of stereochemistry in designing high&#8208;performance, recyclable polymer materials with tailored properties.

         <title>Tiny&#8208;Ligand Solvation Electrolyte Enabled Fast&#8208;Charging Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a guideline to fill this performance gap for designing tiny&#8208;ligand solvation electrolytes (TLSE) by using cosolvents with sterically hindered functional groups. The large&#8208;sized functional groups in the secondary solvation sheath weaken its solvation ability of oxygen atoms with Li+, thereby promoting H2O molecules to participate in the first Li+ solvation shell to form a fast ion&#8208;conduction tiny&#8208;ligand solvation.







Abstract
The H&#8208;bond network among H2O molecules enables ultrafast diffusion of H+ and OH&#8722; via a hopping mechanism, making aqueous batteries attractive competitors for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging energy storages. Ideal aqueous electrolyte for the widely used lithium&#8208;ion batteries is expected to have the wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;5&#8197;volts), fast charging (&#8804;15&#8197;minutes) without gas evolution, and low cost. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) associated with narrow voltage window of water (1.23&#8197;V) limits their practical applications. Herein, we built a new guideline for designing tiny&#8208;ligand electrolytes by utilizing sterically hindered groups with low binding energy. Cosolvent tetraethyl orthocarbonate (TEOC), with large&#8208;sized ethoxy groups and hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;captured ability, forces free H2O and anion TFSI&#8722; into the Li+ first solvation shell. Hence, inhibition of HER takes place by means of immobilized H2O activity and formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks &#8212;C&#8722;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H between TEOC and H2O. This unique structure with ultra&#8208;small sheath volume thereby facilitates the formation of LiF&#8208;rich SEI and fast ion&#8208;conduction. The lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in TEOC/H2O electrolyte exhibits wide electrochemical window of 5.7&#8197;V, enabling LiMn2O4/Li4Ti5O12 pouch cells to achieve 1200 cycles under rapid 10&#8197;C rate. This engineering of tiny&#8208;ligand solvation opens new pathways for developing advanced electrolyte that balance performance with sustainability.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers Incorporating Shape&#8208;Persistent Cyclobenzoin Macrocycles for Organic Solvent Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic porous organic polymer has been synthesized for the efficient separation of organic solvents. The resulting polymer exhibits high uptake capacities for small solvents, correlating with their kinetic diameters, and effectively differentiates between xylene isomers. These findings highlight the potential of porous organic polymers in advanced solvent separation technologies.







Abstract
The recovery and separation of organic solvents is highly important for the chemical industry and environmental protection. In this context, porous organic polymers (POPs) have significant potential owing to the possibility of integrating shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units with high guest selectivity. Here, we report the synthesis of a macrocyclic porous organic polymer (np&#8208;POP) and the corresponding model compound by reacting the cyclotetrabenzil naphthalene octaketone macrocycle with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene and 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene, respectively, under solvothermal conditions. Co&#8208;crystallization of the macrocycle and the model compound with various solvent molecules revealed their size&#8208;selective inclusion within the macrocycle. Building on this finding, the np&#8208;POP with a hierarchical pore structure and a surface area of 579&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 showed solvent uptake strongly correlated with their kinetic diameters. Solvents with kinetic diameters below 0.6&#8197;nm &#8211; such as acetonitrile and dichloromethane &#8211; showed high uptake capacities exceeding 7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Xylene separation tests revealed a high overall uptake (~34&#8197;wt&#8201;%), with o&#8208;xylene displaying a significantly lower uptake (~10&#8197;wt&#8201;% less than other isomers), demonstrating the possibility of size and shape selective separation of organic solvents.

         <title>Tunable Organic&#8208;Inorganic p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d Electron Conjugation Triggers d&#8208;&#960; Hybridization in Quinonized MnO2 Superlattice toward Ultrastable and High&#8208;Rate Zn&#8722;MnO2 Batteries</title>

The tunable organic&#8211;inorganic&#8208;extended p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d electron conjugation of quinonized superlattice, inducing more dxy orbitals occupancy, more polarons near Fermi level, the downshift of O p band center, and reinforced Mn&#8722;O &#960;&#8208;type orbitals hybrid, which successively contributes to the significant improvement of electrochemical activity, diffusion kinetics of Zn2+ and structure stability.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries with two&#8208;electron transfer harvest high energy density, high working voltage, inherent safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Zn2+ as the dominant charge carriers suffer from sluggish kinetics due to the strong Zn2+&#8722;MnO2 coulombic interaction, which is also the origin of pestilent MnO2 lattice deformation and performance degradation. Current studies particularly involve H+ insertion&#8208;dominating chemistry, where the long&#8208;term cycle stability remains challenging due to the accumulative Zn2+ insertion and structural collapse. Herein, a simultaneously enhanced and stabilized Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion chemistry is proposed by the quinone&#8208;hybridized MnO2 superlattice, a first&#8208;of&#8208;this&#8208;kind structure with a distinctive organic&#8211;inorganic&#8208;extended p&#8208;&#960;&#8208;d conjugation, which enables a tunable interlayer d&#8208;&#960; hybridization. Theoretical and experimental results substantiate that the interlayer d&#8208;&#960; hybridization triggers the enhancement of polarons occupancy near Fermi level, the downward shift of O p&#8208;band center, the elevated Mn t2g occupation and thus improved [MnO6] stability upon unprecedentedly high Zn2+ contribution. The notable d&#8208;&#960; hybridization endows MnO2 superlattice an ultrahigh specific capacity (435.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.25&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycle stability (~100&#8201;% capacity retention after 30,000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) with substantially enhanced rate performance. Our findings enlighten a new paradigm in the adjustment of Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion chemistry towards high&#8208;performance rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Facet Engineering of Mesoporous CuS Cascade Nanoreactors Enhances Photocatalytic C&#8722;C Coupling of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow mesoporous CuS nanoreactors with anisotropic (100)&#8208;(110) crystal&#8208;facets have been successfully synthesized via an interfacial&#8208;confined ion dynamic migration&#8208;rearrangement strategy. The cascade nanoreactors with spatially separated Au&#8208;(110) and Co&#8208;(100) sites are constructed by utilizing the directional transport of carriers along the (100)&#8208;(110) crystal&#8208;facets, which facilitates the conversion of CO2 to C2H4.







Abstract
Crystal&#8208;facet heterojunction engineering of mesoporous nanoreactors with highly redox&#8208;active represents an efficacious strategy for the transformation of CO2 into valuable C2 products (e.g., C2H4). Herein, hollow mesoporous cube&#8208;like CuS nanoreactors (~860&#8197;nm) with controlled anisotropic crystal&#8208;facets are prepared through an interfacial&#8208;confined ion dynamic migration&#8208;rearrangement strategy. The regulation of the S2&#8722; ion concentration facilitates the modulation of the highly active (110) to (100) crystal&#8208;facet ratios from 0.119 to 0.288, and induces the formation of anisotropic crystal&#8208;facet heterojunctions. The controllable crystal&#8208;facet heterojunctions trigger the directional charge carrier migration, and are accompanied with the formation of tandem S&#8208;defect sites (Cu0&#8208;S1@S3).

The hollow mesoporous CuS nanoreactors with optimized crystal&#8208;facet ratio of 0.224 (HMe&#8208;CuS&#8208;3) deliver a high selectivity of 72.7&#8201;% for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to acetylene (C2H2).

The *COH is further captured by Au&#8208;sites to accomplish the asymmetric *CO&#8208;*COH coupling and subsequent protonation, ensuring a high C2H4 generation rate of 4.11&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h with a selectivity as high as 90.6&#8201;%.

     alt="Crystal-Facet Engineering of Mesoporous CuS Cascade Nanoreactors Enhances Photocatalytic C&#8722;C Coupling of CO2-to-C2H4"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollow mesoporous CuS nanoreactors with anisotropic (100)-(110) crystal-facets have been successfully synthesized via an interfacial-confined ion dynamic migration-rearrangement strategy. The cascade nanoreactors with spatially separated Au-(110) and Co-(100) sites are constructed by utilizing the directional transport of carriers along the (100)-(110) crystal-facets, which facilitates the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal-facet heterojunction engineering of mesoporous nanoreactors with highly redox-active represents an efficacious strategy for the transformation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into valuable C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products (e.g., C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Herein, hollow mesoporous cube-like CuS nanoreactors (~860&#8197;nm) with controlled anisotropic crystal-facets are prepared through an interfacial-confined ion dynamic migration-rearrangement strategy. The regulation of the S&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion concentration facilitates the modulation of the highly active (110) to (100) crystal-facet ratios from 0.119 to 0.288, and induces the formation of anisotropic crystal-facet heterojunctions. The controllable crystal-facet heterojunctions trigger the directional charge carrier migration, and are accompanied with the formation of tandem S-defect sites (Cu&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;@S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Both of them promote the efficient electron-hole pair dissociation and attain asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling. The hollow mesoporous CuS nanoreactors with optimized crystal-facet ratio of 0.224 (HMe-CuS-3) deliver a high selectivity of 72.7&#8201;% for the photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Further constructed Au-(110) and Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-(100) spatially separated cascade nanoreactors (SS-Au@Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-CuS) achieve CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction, in which the Co-sites enhance H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation to provide protons and the protonation of *CO to *COH. The *COH is further captured by Au-sites to accomplish the asymmetric *CO-*COH coupling and subsequent protonation, ensuring a high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; generation rate of 4.11&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h with a selectivity as high as 90.6&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Reconstruction of An Integrated CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 Electrode Enabling Efficient Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Water or Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface reconstruction of the integrated CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 electrode leads to the formation of Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8, which has significantly low activation barrier for water dissociation and accelerates the catalytic reaction for the hydrogen evolution. It requires only 57.8 and 195.8&#8197;mV of overpotentials to achieve &#8722;100 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and also provides the stable operation at industrial level current densities in alkaline water or seawater.







Abstract
To accelerate the water dissociation in the Volmer step and alleviate the destruction of bubbles to the physical structure of catalysts during the alkaline hydrogen evolution, an integrated electrode of cobalt oxide and cobalt&#8208;molybdenum oxide grown on Ni foam, named CoO&#8208;Co2Mo3O8, is designed. This integrated electrode enhances the catalyst&#8208;substrate interaction confirmed by a micro&#8208;indentation tester, and thus hinders the destruction of the physical structure of catalysts caused by bubbles. Electrochemical testing shows the occurrence of a surface reconstruction of the integrated electrode, and CoO is transformed into Co(OH)2, denoted as Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8. Theoretical calculations determine that Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 has significantly low activation barrier for water dissociation and presents easy hydroxide desorption, which accelerate the catalytic reaction. Electrochemical experiments show that Co(OH)2&#8208;Co2Mo3O8 exhibits outstanding activity, reaching current density values of &#8722;100 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with overpotentials only 57.8 and 195.8&#8197;mV, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent stability at &#8722;500 and &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 200&#8197;h. Combined with the previously reported anode, the two&#8208;electrode system also provides the stable operation from 100 to 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 600&#8197;h in alkaline solution, and over 200&#8197;h at 500 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater.

A refined site&#8208;specific anisotropic assembly and etching co&#8208;mediation approach was fabricated to create a series of hierarchical MOF nanohybrids and single&#8208;crystal MOFs. This approach yields ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids with diverse topologies, alongside derived single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles exhibiting intricate morphologies such as hexapods, nested nanocages, and octopods.







Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse geometries has captivated considerable interest due to their manifestation of novel and extraordinary properties. While much progress has been made in shaping regular polyhedral single&#8208;crystal MOFs, the creation of more complex, topologically intricate nanostructures remains a largely unexplored frontier. Here, we present a refined site&#8208;specific anisotropic assembly and etching co&#8208;mediation approach to fabricate a series of hierarchical MOF nanohybrids and single&#8208;crystal MOFs. This approach yields ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids with diverse topologies, alongside derived single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles exhibiting intricate morphologies such as hexapods, nested nanocages, and octopods. Our method involves the selective growth of six mSiO2 nanoplates on the {100} facets of ZIF&#8208;8 nanocubes, forming the cubic&#8208;shaped ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2 nanohybrids, with the concurrent etching of the {110} facets of initial ZIF&#8208;8 nanocubes. By fine&#8208;tuning this balance between the growth and etching, we achieved precise morphological control, transforming cubic nanohybrids into intricate hexapods nanohybrids. Additionally, secondary epitaxial growth of homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;MOFs on these hybrids led to ZIF&#8208;8&amp;mSiO2&amp;MOF composites with six mSiO2 inlays. Finally, selective alkaline etching of the mSiO2 compartments result in single&#8208;crystal MOF nanoparticles with unprecedented and sophisticated morphologies, such as hexapods, nested nanocages, octopods. This work advances the field of MOF nanostructure design, opening new avenues for the development of sophisticated, multifunctional materials.

         <title>Dual Active Site Covalent Organic Framework Anode Enables Stable Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual active site covalent organic framework (TABQ&#8208;COF) was introduced as an anode for aqueous proton batteries (APBs). Benefiting from the extended large conjugated structure and high active site density, the TABQ&#8208;COF electrode features high capacity of 401&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability. When coupling with MnO2 cathode, the APB shows high energy density of 218&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention of 100&#8201;% over 10000 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries (APBs) have attracted increasing interest owing to their potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage with extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, there are limited anode materials and it remains a great challenge to effectively balance capacity and cycling performance. Here, we report a covalent organic framework containing C=O and C=N dual active sites (TABQ&#8208;COF) as a high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;cycle anode for proton batteries. The proton storage ability of the dual active sites and the up to nine proton redox chemistry mechanisms for each repetitive unit have been demonstrated by experiments and density functional theory calculations. The insoluble TABQ&#8208;COF electrode displayed a remarkably high specific capacity of 401&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, outstanding cycling stability (100&#8201;% capacity retention after 7500 cycles) and high rate performance (90&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). When coupling with a MnO2 cathode, the constructed TABQ&#8208;COF//MnO2 battery achieves a reversible capacity of 247&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a remarkable capacity retention of 100&#8201;% over 10000 cycles. Furthermore, the TABQ&#8208;COF//MnO2 battery can operate well and shows high capacity and cycle stability in a frozen electrolyte at &#8722;40&#176;C, implying great potential for energy storage at extreme temperatures.

The insoluble TABQ-COF electrode displayed a remarkably high specific capacity of 401&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, outstanding cycling stability (100&#8201;% capacity retention after 7500 cycles) and high rate performance (90&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). When coupling with a MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, the constructed TABQ-COF//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery achieves a reversible capacity of 247&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a remarkable capacity retention of 100&#8201;% over 10000 cycles. Furthermore, the TABQ-COF//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery can operate well and shows high capacity and cycle stability in a frozen electrolyte at &#8722;40&#176;C, implying great potential for energy storage at extreme temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dendritic Platinum Nanoparticles Shielded by Pt&#8208;S PEGylation as Intracellular Reactors for Bioorthogonal Uncaging Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

Bioorthogonal platinum chemistry! Dendritic Pt nanoparticles shielded by Pt&#8722;S PEGylation demonstrated high biocompatibility and the capacity to mediate uncaging reactions in cancer cells, enabling the in situ release of anticancer drugs in 2D and 3D culture, and in vivo.







Abstract
Beyond their classical role as cytotoxics, Platinum (Pt) coordination complexes recently joined the selected group of transition metals capable of performing bioorthogonal reactions in living environments. To minimize their reactivity towards nucleophiles, which limit their catalytic performance, we investigated the use of Pt(0) with different forms, sizes and surface functionalization. We report herein the development of PEGylated Pt nanodendrites with the capacity to activate prodyes and prodrugs in cell culture and in vivo. Their dendritic morphology together with their surface shielding through Pt&#8722;S&#8208;bonded PEGylation synergistically contributed to create catalytic nanoreactors compatible with the highly&#8208;crowded and reductive environment of the cell cytoplasm, thereby facilitating in situ bioorthogonal drug uncaging in cancer cells in 2D and 3D culture, including in microfluidic systems, and xenografted in zebrafish.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Induced Electron Localization Promotes D2O Dissociation and Nitrile Adsorption for Deuterated Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;coordinated Cu catalyst is designed to enable the electrosynthesis of the precursor of Melatonin&#8208;d4, 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine&#8208;d4, with a 68&#8201;% yield (FE) at a low overpotential, which is 4 times greater than that of highly coordinated Cu. The enrichment of electrons and enhanced local electric field decrease the energy of D2O dissociation and change the adsorption configuration of nitriles from a semibridge model to a flat model, thus facilitating the reaction dynamics.







Abstract
Electrochemical reductive deuteration of nitriles is a promising strategy for synthesizing deuterated amines with D2O as the deuterated source. However, this reaction suffers from high overpotentials owing to the sluggish D2O dissociation kinetics and high thermodynamic stability of the C&#8801;N triple bond. Here, low&#8208;coordinated copper (LC&#8722;Cu) is designed to decrease the overpotential for the electrosynthesis of the precursor of Melatonin&#8208;d4, 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine&#8208;d4, by 100&#8197;mV with a 68&#8201;% yield (Faradaic efficiency), which is 4 times greater than that of high&#8208;coordinated copper (HC&#8722;Cu). The low coordinated sites induced an enrichment of electrons to concentrate K+ ions hydrated deuterium water (K&#8901;D2O) and decrease the energy of the Volmer step via the polarization effect, leading to a continuous supplementation of *D for the reductive deuteration of nitriles. Moreover, the enhanced local electric field changes the adsorption configuration of nitriles from a semibridge model to a flat model, leading to faster reduction kinetics of nitriles with a high reaction rate at lower potentials. High deuterium incorporation, a wide substrate scope, and easy gram&#8208;scale synthesis over LC&#8722;Cu at 300&#8197;mA rationalize the design concept. Furthermore, the enhanced antitumor and antioxidation effects of Melatonin&#8208;d4 highlight the great promise of deuterated drugs.

         <title>Modulating Perovskite Surface Energetics Through Tuneable Ferrocene Interlayers for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional ferrocene (Fc)&#8208;based interlayers have been developed to exhibit adjustable passivating and electrochemical characteristics within inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The key role played by the highest occupied molecular orbital energies (EHOMO) of the Fc compounds relative to the perovskite valence band maximum (EVBM) is revealed, and this relationship is pivotal in controlling band bending and optimizing charge extraction.







Abstract
Achieving rational control over chemical and energetic properties at the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) interface is crucial for realizing highly efficient and stable next&#8208;generation inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To address this, we developed multifunctional ferrocene (Fc)&#8208;based interlayers engineered to exhibit adjustable passivating and electrochemical characteristics. These interlayers are designed to reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination, and to modulate the work function (WF) and uniformity of the perovskite surface, thereby enhancing device performance. The key role played by the highest occupied molecular orbital energies (EHOMO) of the Fc compounds relative to the perovskite valance band maximum (EVBM) is revealed. This relationship is pivotal in controlling band bending and optimizing charge extraction. Notably, the conformationally flexible and more easily oxidized ferrocenyl&#8208;bis&#8208;furyl&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate (2) is found to more effectively bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ surface sites and modulate interfacial energetics, resulting in inverted PSCs achieving champion efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;%. These cells also displayed excellent stability, retaining &gt;92&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 1,000&#8197;h of maximum power point operation at 65&#8201;&#176;C. By correlating the broadly tunable Fc&#8208;EHOMO with a decreased and homogenized perovskite surface WF, our work advances our understanding of Fc&#8208;based interlayers and opens new pathways for their application in high&#8208;efficiency solar technologies.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Layered Germanium Iodide Perovskite Ferroelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel series of 2D layered germanium iodide perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors was firstly developed through the approach of reduced lattice dimensionality. Such ferroelectrics manifest both large in&#8208;plane polarization over ~10.0&#8197;&#956;C/cm2 and highly anisotropic photoelectronic features, serving as a great platform for integrating ferroelectric order and photoelectronic features within the 2D lattice.







Abstract
The discovery of ferroelectricity in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors has opened a new and exciting chapter in next&#8208;generation electronics and spintronics due to their lattice&#8208;dimensionality&#8208;induced unique behaviors and fascinating functionalities brought by spontaneous polarization. The emerging layered halide perovskites with 2D lattices provide a great platform for generating reduced symmetry and low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectricity. Herein, inspired by the approach of reduced lattice dimensionality, a series of 2D layered germanium iodide perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors A2CsGe2I7 [where A=PA (propylammonium), BA (butylammonium) and AA (amylammonium)] was firstly developed, which demonstrates remarkable semiconducting features including narrow direct band gap (~1.8&#8197;eV) and high conductivity over 32.23&#8197;nS/cm. Emphatically, these layered germanium iodide perovskites manifest large in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization over ~10.0&#8197;&#956;C/cm2, mainly attributed to the large off&#8208;centering ion displacement induced by stereo&#8208;active lone&#8208;pairs of Ge2+. More specifically, in contrast to three&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric CsGeI3, the representative 2D layered BA2CsGe2I7 manifests a superior polarization&#8208;sensitive bulk photovoltaic effect with a polarization ratio of 1.68 and high short circuit current density up to 81.25&#8197;&#956;A/cm2, which is superior to those of reported layered halide perovskite ferroelectrics. This work provides an exciting pathway for the development of 2D ferroelectric semiconductors as well as sheds light on their further applications in photoelectronic fields.

Herein, inspired by the approach of reduced lattice dimensionality, a series of 2D layered germanium iodide perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsGe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; [where A=PA (propylammonium), BA (butylammonium) and AA (amylammonium)] was firstly developed, which demonstrates remarkable semiconducting features including narrow direct band gap (~1.8&#8197;eV) and high conductivity over 32.23&#8197;nS/cm. Emphatically, these layered germanium iodide perovskites manifest large in-plane ferroelectric polarization over ~10.0&#8197;&#956;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, mainly attributed to the large off-centering ion displacement induced by stereo-active lone-pairs of Ge&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. More specifically, in contrast to three-dimensional ferroelectric CsGeI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the representative 2D layered BA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsGe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; manifests a superior polarization-sensitive bulk photovoltaic effect with a polarization ratio of 1.68 and high short circuit current density up to 81.25&#8197;&#956;A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is superior to those of reported layered halide perovskite ferroelectrics. This work provides an exciting pathway for the development of 2D ferroelectric semiconductors as well as sheds light on their further applications in photoelectronic fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Developing Orthogonal Fluorescent RNAs for Photoactive Dual&#8208;Color Imaging of RNAs in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent RNA, mSquash/DFHBFPD, was developed using a SELEX&#8208;independent approach, enabling orthogonal RNA imaging alongside Broccoli/DFHBI&#8208;1T in live cells. Building on this, we engineered photoactivatable fluorescent RNAs with wavelength&#8208;specific activation, offering precise spatiotemporal control and advancing dual&#8208;color RNA imaging in live cells.







Abstract
Fluorogenic RNA aptamers have revolutionized the visualization of RNAs within complex cellular processes. A representative category of them employs the derivatives of green fluorescent protein chromophore, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzlidene imidazolinone (HBI), as chromophores. However, the structural homogeneity of their chromophoric backbones causes severe cross&#8208;reactivity with other homologous chromophores. This limitation impairs their multiplexing capabilities, which are essential for the simultaneous visualization of multiple RNA species in live cells. Herein, we rationally designed a series of red&#8208;shifted chromophores and employed SELEX&#8208;independent engineering to develop a novel fluorogenic RNA aptamer, mSquash. mSquash displays specific and intense fluorescence upon binding with our red&#8208;shifted chromophore DFHBFPD (Ex/Em=501/624&#8197;nm). The mSquash/DFHBFPD allows orthogonal imaging of selected RNA targets alongside the established Broccoli/DFHBI&#8208;1T (Ex/Em=472/501&#8197;nm), facilitating multiplexed live cell imaging of various targets. Moreover, we expanded the application of fluorescent RNA to photoactive imaging by constructing two genetically encoded photoactivatable fluorescent RNAs for the first time. This innovative approach allows photoactivatable control of fluorescent RNAs via specific light wavelengths (365&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm), enabling spatiotemporal dual&#8208;color imaging of RNAs in live cells. Our findings represent a significant advancement in fluorescent RNA&#8208;based orthogonal imaging and spatiotemporal analysis of RNAs.

         <title>Distinct Valence States of the [4Fe4S] Cluster Revealed in the Hydrogenase CrHydA1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the apo&#8208;form of FeFe&#8208;hydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii two different paramagnetic states arise from a single iron&#8208;sulfur cluster. EPR experiments found them to interconvert based on redox&#8208;potentials and pH&#8208;levels. Computational methods attribute this to secondary&#8208;sphere residues adopting distinct conformations around the cluster.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;sulfur clusters play a crucial role in electron transfer for many essential enzymes, including [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. This study focuses on the [4Fe4S] cluster ([4Fe]H) of the minimal [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrHydA1) and employs advanced spectroscopy, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics simulations, and QM/MM calculations. We provide insights into the complex electronic structure of [4Fe]H and its role in the catalytic reaction of CrHydA1, serving as paradigm for understanding [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. We identified at least two distinct species within the apo&#8208;form of CrHydA1, designated 4Fe&#8722;R and 4Fe&#8722;A, with unique redox potentials and pH sensitivities. Our findings revealed that these species arise from a complex interplay of structural heterogeneity and valence isomer rearrangements, influenced by second&#8208;sphere residues. We propose that the interconversion between 4Fe&#8722;R and 4Fe&#8722;A could provide control over electron transfer in the absence of accessory FeS clusters typically found in other [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. The insights gained from this study not only enhance our understanding of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases but also provide a crucial foundation for future investigations into analysis of other FeS clusters across diverse biological systems.

         <title>COF&#8208;Assisted Construction of Steric Mass&#8208;Charge Channels to Boost Activity for High&#8208;Performance Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reduce the mass transport resistance ascribed to the stacking issues when assembling catalysts into membrane electrode assembly of fuel cells, the steric mass&#8208;charge channels are constructed by implanting porous and rigid sulfonated covalent organic frameworks into the catalytic layer, stimulating the catalytic activity and boosting the device performance for electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional lamellar materials disperse platinum sites and minimize noble&#8208;metal usage for fuel cells, while mass transport resistance at the stacked layers spurs device failure with a significant performance decline in membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Herein, we implant porous and rigid sulfonated covalent organic frameworks (COF) into the graphene&#8208;based catalytic layer for the construction of steric mass&#8208;charge channels, which highly facilitates the activity of oxygen reduction reactions in both the rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements and MEA device tests. Specifically, the normalized mass activity is remarkably boosted by 3.7&#8197;times to 1.56&#8197;A&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 after additions of suitable COF modifications in the RDE tests. Especially, an excellent maximum power density of 1.015&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is realized on the MEA in H2/Air condition, representing a 22&#8201;% improvement through such constructions of steric mass&#8208;charge channels. Meanwhile, the open&#8208;circuit voltage of fuel cells demonstrates only 0.8&#8201;% reductions after 10,000 cycles of stability tests. We further extended such methodology of constructing mass&#8208;charge channels to granular PtCo and commercial Pt/C catalysts, which demonstrates a significant impetus for stimulating the catalytic activity in fuel cells.

         <title>Interstitial Doping in Ultrafine Nanocrystals for Efficient and Durable Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deposition&#8208;diffusion strategy is proposed for preparing heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi&#8208;C&#8208;N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon. The interstitial C and N atoms regulate the electronic structure of metal sites to promote the adsorption/dissociation process of HER intermediates, and accelerate the formation of high OER activity hydroxyl oxides on the surface.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;based catalysts with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting (OWS) offer significant potential for reducing green hydrogen production costs. Utilizing sputtering deposition technology, we propose a deposition&#8208;diffusion strategy to fabricate heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi&#8208;C&#8208;N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon (NC) on the pre&#8208;deposited NC micro column arrays. The diffusion of C and N atoms results in the formation of uniformly distributed TMISS nanocrystals, with an average diameter of ~1.9&#8197;nm, thus maximizing atomic utilization. The unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous heterojunction interface enhances electrocatalytic stability. Furthermore, the electronic regulation of metal sites by interstitial C and N atoms not only optimizes the adsorption&#8208;dissociation process in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also accelerates the surface reconstruction of hydroxyl oxides to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared coating achieved overpotentials of only 62&#8197;mV and 237&#8197;mV for the HER and OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolytes, and exhibited excellent OWS performance and long&#8208;term stability at high current densities. This work presents a new perspective for synthesizing TMISS nanocrystals and promotes their application in bifunctional electrocatalysts.

         <title>Lowering Linker Symmetry to Access Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Inverse Alkane/Alkene Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the linker desymmetrization and conformation engineering approach, a tritopic carboxylate linker with reduced symmetry and flexible triangular geometry was designed to construct three Zr&#8208;based MOFs, in which the resulting MOFs are potential adsorbents for relatively energy efficient inverse alkane/alkene separations.







Abstract
Enriching the structural diversity of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is of great importance in developing functional porous materials with specific properties. New MOF structures can be accessed through the rational design of organic linkers with diverse geometric conformations, and their structural complexity can be enhanced by choosing linkers with reduced symmetry. Herein, a series of Zr&#8208;based MOFs with unprecedented topologies were developed through a linker desymmetrization and conformation engineering approach. A tritopic carboxylate linker with reduced symmetry and flexible triangular geometry was designed to construct three Zr&#8208;based MOFs (denoted as NU&#8208;57, NU&#8208;58, and NU&#8208;59) by modulating synthetic conditions. Notably, the conformational flexibility and reduced symmetry of the linker generated two unprecedented topologies in NU&#8208;58 and NU&#8208;59. Furthermore, solvent removal in NU&#8208;58 via thermal activation process produced missing linker defects. Finally, the adsorption behavior of these MOFs toward alkanes and alkenes was studied to gain insights into their structure&#8211;property relationships, which demonstrated that NU&#8208;57 and NU&#8208;58 exhibit unusual reverse selectivity for alkanes in alkane/alkene separations. Overall, this work highlights the rational design of linkers using a desymmetrization strategy as a powerful method to enrich the structural diversity of MOFs and to access novel MOFs with unique properties.

         <title>Ligand Engineering Regulation toward Zn Ions and Zn Substrate for All&#8208;Climate Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

We have first performed the structurally strategic deployment of atomically precise architectures by ligand engineering regulation which select zinc ion trapping ligands and zinc substrate binding ligands. The successful structural design of OZSBPC explores a novel well&#8208;defined structural design concept as one criterion for artificial interphase materials as well as reveals the structure&#8211;activity relationship.







Abstract
The regulation of artificial interphase for advanced Zn anode is an effective solution to achieve superior electrochemical performance for aqueous batteries. However, the deployment of atomically precise architectures and ligand engineering to achieve functionalization&#8208;oriented regulatory screening is lacking, which is hindered by higher requirements for synthetic chemistry and structural chemistry. Herein, we have first performed ligand engineering which selected zinc ion trapping ligands (&#8722;CH3) based on the coordination effect, and zinc substrate binding ligands (&#8722;N=N&#8722;C6H5) based on the electrostatic interaction. Correspondingly, octa nuclear Zn(II)&#8208;Siloxane&#8208;PhPz/BiPhPz/TriPhPz Cluster (OZSPC/OZSBPC/OZSTPC) are accurately synthesized, and OZSBPC is verified to serve as the most suitable artificial interphase via balancing the interactions with both Zn2+ and Zn substrate (&#8220;Zn&#8722;Zn effect&#8221;). Consequently, at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, the assembled OZSBPC&#8208;Zn symmetric cells run for 3000&#8197;h and the assembled full cells with OZSBPC&#8208;Zn anode could be stable for 10,000&#8197;cycles. The pouch cells using OZSBPC&#8208;Zn anode deliver a reversible capacity of ~1.2 Ah and the energy density of 41&#8197;Wh kgtotal&#8722;1 with excellent cycling performance. The successful structural design of OZSBPC explores a novel well&#8208;defined structural design concept as one criterion for artificial interface as well as motivates batteries systems to meet the requirements of industrialization.

         <title>Carving Metal&#8211;Organic&#8211;Framework Glass Based Solid&#8211;State Electrolyte Via a Top&#8211;Down Strategy for Lithium&#8211;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a top&#8208;down strategy to carve MOF glass&#8208;based polymer solid electrolytes (PSEs) with different pore structures. The carved MOF glass&#8208;based PSEs retains safety while also possessing fast ions transport performance. The introduced dispersed macropores can act like bridges, connecting nearby transport units to accelerate ion transport and provides rich transport path for ions transfer. Taking advantage of the cross&#8208;linked ion&#8208;conductive paths constructed by hierarchical pore structure, a high ionic conductivity of 1.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 was achieved for the porous MOF glass &#8208;PSEs.







Abstract
Traditional polymer solid electrolytes (PSEs) suffer from low ions conductivity, poor kinetics and safety concerns. Here, we present a novel porous MOF glass gelled polymer electrolyte (PMG&#8208;GPE) prepared via a top&#8208;down strategy, which features a unique three&#8208;dimensional interconnected graded&#8208;aperture structure for efficient ions transport. Comprehensive analyses, including time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS), Solid&#8208;state 7Li magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS&#8197;NMR), Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, and electrochemical tests, quantify the pore structures, revealing their relationship with ions conductivity that increases and then decreases as macropore proportion rises. The introduced dispersed macropores (17&#8201;% fraction) can serve as bridges, connecting adjacent transport units to accelerate ions transport. Taking advantage of the cross&#8208;linked ion&#8208;conductive paths constructed by hierarchical pore structures, the PMG&#8208;GPE achieves a high ions conductivity of 1.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Additionally, the robust mechanical properties of PMG&#8208;GPE effectively suppress dendrite growth and penetration, outperforming crystal MOF&#8208;based electrolytes. The prepared Li symmetric batteries with PMG&#8208;GPE demonstrate a high critical current density of 5.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (two times higher than crystal MOF&#8208;electrolytes) and stable cycling for over 6000&#8197;hours without short circuits. Furthermore, a Li/PMG&#8208;GPE/LFP half&#8208;cell exhibits exceptional capacity retention of 83.12&#8201;% after 1400 cycles. These findings highlight the potential of structural design in advancing PSE performance, offering a promising pathway for the commercialization of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Easily Water&#8208;Synthesisable Iron&#8208;Chloranilate Frameworks as High Energy and High&#8208;Power Cathodes for Sustainable Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;chloranilate frameworks can be easily synthesised in aqueous solution. Lattice and coordination water removal under mild heating leads to a 2D honeycomb neutral framework, without counterions or solvent molecules, that displays high energy density as a cathode for sustainable lithium, sodium and potassium ion rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
Achieving high battery performance from low&#8208;cost, easily synthesisable electrode materials is crucial for advancing energy storage technologies. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) combining inexpensive transition metals and organic ligands are promising candidates for high&#8208;capacity cathodes. Iron&#8208;chloranilate&#8208;water frameworks are herein reported to be produced in aqueous media under mild conditions. Removal of reticular water from known [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O yields a new supramolecular metal&#8211;organic framework (SMOF), [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)4]. Removing coordination water, a new 2D honeycomb&#8208;like MOF forms, Fe2(CAN)3, stable without counterions and solvent. This MOF adopts the unusual ABC layer&#8208;stacking, as determined using a combination of ab initio random structure searching, electron diffraction, and Rietveld refinement of powder XRD data. Magnetometry, Mossbauer and Raman spectroscopy confirm that all three [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)x]&#8901;yH2O phases contain HS&#8208;Fe3+ and CAN2&#8722;, with magnetic ordering temperatures increasing (5&#8594;20&#8197;K) as the Fe&#8722;CAN connectivity increases. The SMOF and MOF show reversible (de)insertion of &gt;4Li+/f.u. at average 2,59&#8197;V and 2,76&#8197;V vs Li+/Li, respectively. [Fe2(CAN)3] achieves 146&#8197;mAh/g at 1&#8197;C, thus specific energy (563&#8197;Wh/kg) and power (446&#8197;W/kg) in Li half&#8208;cells competitive with conventional LiFePO4 (~580&#8197;Wh/kg and ~450&#8197;W/kg). Beyond Li, [Fe2(CAN)3] delivers 394&#8197;Wh/kg and 421&#8197;Wh/kg, for Na and K half&#8208;cells respectively, becoming a competitive cathode for sustainable batteries.

     alt="Easily Water-Synthesisable Iron-Chloranilate Frameworks as High Energy and High-Power Cathodes for Sustainable Alkali-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron-chloranilate frameworks can be easily synthesised in aqueous solution. Lattice and coordination water removal under mild heating leads to a 2D honeycomb neutral framework, without counterions or solvent molecules, that displays high energy density as a cathode for sustainable lithium, sodium and potassium ion rechargeable batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving high battery performance from low-cost, easily synthesisable electrode materials is crucial for advancing energy storage technologies. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) combining inexpensive transition metals and organic ligands are promising candidates for high-capacity cathodes. Iron-chloranilate-water frameworks are herein reported to be produced in aqueous media under mild conditions. Removal of reticular water from known [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CAN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O yields a new supramolecular metal&#8211;organic framework (SMOF), [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CAN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]. Removing coordination water, a new 2D honeycomb-like MOF forms, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CAN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, stable without counterions and solvent. This MOF adopts the unusual ABC layer-stacking, as determined using a combination of ab initio random structure searching, electron diffraction, and Rietveld refinement of powder XRD data. Magnetometry, Mossbauer and Raman spectroscopy confirm that all three [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CAN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O phases contain HS-Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and CAN&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, with magnetic ordering temperatures increasing (5&#8594;20&#8197;K) as the Fe&#8722;CAN connectivity increases. The SMOF and MOF show reversible (de)insertion of &amp;gt;4Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/f.u. at average 2,59&#8197;V and 2,76&#8197;V vs Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li, respectively. [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CAN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] achieves 146&#8197;mAh/g at 1&#8197;C, thus specific energy (563&#8197;Wh/kg) and power (446&#8197;W/kg) in Li half-cells competitive with conventional LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (~580&#8197;Wh/kg and ~450&#8197;W/kg). Beyond Li, [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CAN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] delivers 394&#8197;Wh/kg and 421&#8197;Wh/kg, for Na and K half-cells respectively, becoming a competitive cathode for sustainable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Hydrogen Production Coupled with Glucose Valorization through Modulating Au&#8208;Pt Coordination on Ultrathin Au3Pt Twin Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous hydrogen production coupled with selective glucose upgradation is achieved on ultrathin Au/Pt twin nanowires with tuned Au&#8722;Pt coordination. A low onset potential of ~0.07 VRHE for glucose oxidation is realized on Au3Pt twin nanowires with low loading through facilitated desorption of (C=O) intermediates via a &#8216;Pt&#8208;to&#8208;Au site transfer&#8217; path. An output voltage of 0.24&#8197;V is achieved on the cell with a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Organics electrooxidation coupled hydrogen production has attracted increasing attention due to the low operation voltage. Nevertheless, the spontaneous production of hydrogen coupled with organics valorization remains challenging. Herein, we develop ultrathin Au/Pt twin nanowire (NW) catalysts for both electrochemical glucose oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction towards a spontaneous hydrogen production system. The more Pt&#8722;Au coordination and the localized tensile strain generated on twin boundaries of Au3Pt NWs facilitate the selective glucose electro&#8208;oxidation to gluconic acid (GNA) compared to Pt NWs (a low onset potential of 0.07 VRHE and selectivity &gt;90&#8201;%). In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that Au3Pt NWs could reduce the energy barriers for GNA generation and alleviate the poisoning of Pt sites via a &#8242;Pt&#8208;to&#8208;Au site transfer&#8242; mechanism, which facilitates the desorption of strongly absorbed gluconolactone. Therefore, the asymmetric cell equipped with Au3Pt NWs catalysts realizes the spontaneous hydrogen production and glucose valorization with a peak power of 50&#8197;mW, which outputs the voltage of 0.24&#8197;V at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzers for hydrogen production. The production of 1&#8197;kg H2 of the device is accompanied with $64.2 valorization of the anode product ($1200 ton&#8722;1 for GNA), and 5.36&#8197;kW h of generated electricity.

         <title>Super Strong Bonding at the Interface between ETL and Perovskite for Robust Flexible Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskites have great potential in flexible optoelectronic devices. A multifunctional organic salt, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (TPH), is applied to enhance the interface between the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite layer through two&#8208;site bonding, and accelerates the nucleation rate of perovskite. The flexible perovskite solar cells retained 92.3&#8201;% of the original efficiency after bending 25,000 cycles.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have demonstrated great potential for flexible optoelectronic devices due to their superior optoelectronic properties and structural flexibility. However, mechanical deformation&#8208;induced cracks at the buried interface and delamination from the substrate severely constrain the optoelectronic performance and device lifespan. Here, we design a two&#8208;site bonding strategy aiming to reinforce the mechanical stability of the SnO2/perovskite interface and perovskite layer using a multifunctional organic salt, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (TPH). This approach significantly enhances the bonding at the buried interface between the electron transport layer and perovskite layer, which is demonstrated by TPH&#8208;modified SnO2/perovskite interface remaining intact after 10,000 bending cycles. Meanwhile, TPH mitigates void formation, enhances perovskite crystallinity at the buried interface, and inhibits ion migration inside the devices. Furthermore, incorporating TPH in perovskite bulk decreases the nucleation activation energy and accelerates nucleation, leading to high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Consequently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 21.64&#8201;% and 23.61&#8201;% are achieved for target flexible and rigid perovskite solar cells, respectively. The target flexible device retained 92.3&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 25,000 bending cycles. This approach provides a robust solution for enhancing the mechanical durability of flexible perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Superconjugated Anthraquinone Carbonyl&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework as Anode Material for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthraquinone carbonyl&#8208;containing COF has been designed, synthesized and used as anode material for aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion batteries. It is found that the anthraquinone carbonyls within the COF have a superconjugated structure, which enables them to form hydrogen bonds with NH4+ ions and act as active sites for NH4+ ion storage. In contrast, another class of carbonyls present in the same COF is prone to enol&#8208;keto tautomerism, which hinders hydrogen bond formation and is therefore not conducive to NH4+ ion storage.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently been emerged as promising anode candidates for aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AAIBs), but suitable COFs need to be developed and the energy storage mechanisms need to be further investigated. Here we report an anthraquinone carbonyl&#8208;containing COF as anode for AAIBs, which exhibits a high specific capacity of 141&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A g&#8722;1 and good cycling stability with 90&#8201;% retention after 8000 cycles at 6&#8197;A g&#8722;1. We find that the anthraquinone carbonyls (denoted as C=O1) with superconjugated structure in the COF can form hydrogen bonds with NH4+ ions, thus serving as optimal sites and providing the major contribution to NH4+ ion storage, whereas another type of carbonyls (denoted as C=O2) in the same COF suffers from enol&#8208;keto tautomerism, which prevents the formation of hydrogen bonds and is therefore unfavourable for NH4+ ion storage. This is further verified by the theoretical calculations where the hydrogen bonding rate of C=O1 groups is much faster than that of C=O2. This work not only provides insights into understanding the mechanism of NH4+ ion storage, but also offers new ideas for the design of advanced COF&#8208;based materials for AAIBs.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Six&#8208;Membered Cyclic Diaryl &#955;3&#8208;Bromanes and &#955;3&#8208;Chloranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of six&#8208;membered hypervalent bromine(III) and chlorine(III) compounds through their diazonium salts is demonstrated. High yielding chemo&#8208; and regioselective O&#8208; and S&#8208;arylations are possible at ambient temperature, which can also be utilized for intermolecular or intramolecular biaryl synthesis by modifying the reaction conditions.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable advancements in hypervalent iodine chemistry, exploration of bromine and chlorine analogues remains in its infancy due to their difficult synthesis. Herein, we introduce six&#8208;membered cyclic &#955;3&#8208;bromanes and &#955;3&#8208;chloranes. Through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses and conformational studies, we delineate the crucial bonding patterns pivotal for the thermodynamic stability of these compounds. Notably, these investigations reveal pronounced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking phenomena within the crystal lattice of hypercoordinated bromine(III) and chlorine(III) species. Their reactivity profile is explored as they are radical precursors or electrophilic reagents in metal&#8208;free intermolecular biaryl couplings, O&#8208; and S&#8208;arylations, and Cu(I)&#8208;promoted intramolecular biaryl couplings which is complementary to the known reactivity of five&#8208;membered bromanes and chloranes. Mechanistic insights are provided, elucidating the pathways governing their reactivity and underscoring the potential in organic synthesis.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Functionalized Triazolate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Diluted CO2 Capture Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NICS&#8208;24, a novel Zn(II)&#8208;based diaminotriazolate oxalate MOF, exhibits significant improvements in CO2 adsorption at low concentrations compared to compositionally related CALF&#8208;20. In humid conditions, competitive adsorption of water and CO2 occurs, facilitated by hydrogen bonding interactions between the framework and guest molecules, as well as between the guest molecules themselves.







Abstract
Efficient CO2 capture at concentrations between 400&#8211;2000&#8197;ppm is essential for maintaining air quality in a habitable environment and advancing carbon capture technologies. This study introduces NICS&#8208;24 (National Institute of Chemistry Structures No. 24), a Zn&#8208;oxalate 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate framework with two distinct square&#8208;shaped channels, designed to enhance CO2 capture at indoor&#8208;relevant concentrations. NICS&#8208;24 exhibits a CO2 uptake of 0.7&#8197;mmol/g at 2&#8197;mbar and 25&#8201;&#176;C, significantly outperforming the compositionally related Zn&#8208;oxalate 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate &#8211; CALF&#8208;20 (0.17&#8197;mmol/g). Improved performance is attributed to amino&#8208;functions that enhance CO2 binding and enable superior selectivity over N2 and O2, achieving 8&#8208;fold and 30&#8208;fold improvements, respectively, in simulated CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 atmospheric ratios. In humid environments, NICS&#8208;24 retained structural integrity but exhibited an 85&#8201;% reduction in CO2 capacity due to competitive water adsorption. Breakthrough sorption experiments, atomistic NMR analysis, and DFT calculations revealed that water preferentially adsorbs over CO2 due to strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the framework. Gained understanding of the interaction between CO2 and H2O within the MOF framework could guide the modification via rational design with improved performance under real&#8208;world conditions.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Enabled Resistance to Water Matrix Components for Selective Degradation of Micropollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an ultraviolet/chlorine/graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;wrapped defective TiO2 system that creates a nanoconfined space on the TiO2 surface within GO, enabling the selective degradation of micropollutants by excluding natural organic matter and anions. Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 promoted electron separation and oxygen adsorption, increasing hydroxyl radical concentrations 4.9 times within the nanoconfined space compared to the bulk solution.







Abstract
Despite recent substantial advances in water treatment, the ability to selectively degrade trace micropollutants in real waters with complex matrix components remains a grand challenge. Here we report rational crafting of graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;wrapped defective TiO2 composite catalysts that creates nanoscopic confinement over the TiO2 surface within GO, thereby enabling the selective degradation of micropollutants through effectively excluding natural organic matter (NOM) and anions from the nanoconfined catalytic sites. In contrast to unconfined counterparts, the nanoconfined composite catalysts retain high degradation efficiency when exposed to various concentrations of NOM and anions, even in real water samples. Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 promote electron separation and oxygen adsorption, leading to a 4.9&#8208;fold increase in hydroxyl radical concentration within the nanoconfined space compared to the bulk solution. In situ X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy unveil the nanoconfined catalytic sites on the TiO2 surface, where micropollutants smaller than the pores of GO are effectively degraded, while NOM with a larger size is excluded by GO. Furthermore, the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts is well controlled due to the exclusion of NOM. This work provides a simple yet viable strategy for designing 2D material&#8208;wrapped catalysts to selectively degrade target micropollutants in complex real waters.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Aptamer Chimeras for Enhanced Autophagic Degradation of Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent aptamer chimeras (CApTEC) engineered with sulfonyl fluoride groups and an LC3 ligand has been developed for the targeted degradation of membrane proteins via the autophagy&#8208;lysosomal pathway. CApTECs form covalent bonds with target proteins, resulting in enhanced and prolonged protein degradation compared to the non&#8208;covalent designs, highlighting their potential for designing safe and effective therapeutics.







Abstract
Targeted degradation of membrane proteins represents an attractive strategy for eliminating pathogenesis&#8208;related proteins. Aptamer&#8208;based chimeras hold great promise as membrane protein degraders, however, their degradation efficacy is often hindered by the limited structural stability and the risk of off&#8208;target effects due to the non&#8208;covalent interaction with target proteins. We here report the first design of a covalent aptamer&#8208;based autophagosome&#8208;tethering chimera (CApTEC) for the enhanced autophagic degradation of cell&#8208;surface proteins, including transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and nucleolin (NCL). This strategy relies on the site&#8208;specific incorporation of sulfonyl fluoride groups onto aptamers to enable the cross&#8208;linking with target proteins, coupled with the conjugation of an LC3 ligand to hijack the autophagy&#8208;lysosomal pathway for targeted protein degradation. The chemically engineered CApTECs exhibit enhanced on&#8208;target retention and improved structural stability. Our results also demonstrate that CApTECs achieve remarkably enhanced and prolonged degradation of membrane proteins compared to the non&#8208;covalent designs. Furthermore, the CApTEC targeting TfR1 is combined with 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) for synergistic tumor therapy in a mouse model, leading to substantial suppression of tumor growth. Our strategy may provide deep insights into the LC3&#8208;mdiated autophagic degradation, affording a modular and effective strategy for membrane protein degradation and precise therapeutic applications.

A Fe&#8208;doped ZnO hollow polyhedron has been successfully developed for selectively photocatalytic conversion of methane to methanol under mild conditions. The incorporation of Fe effectively lowered the center of the O 2p orbital, which passivated the activity of the lattice oxygen within the nanocrystals, significantly attenuating the interaction between lattice oxygen and *CH3 intermediate.







Abstract
An inevitable overoxidation process is considered as one of the most challenging problems in the direct conversion of methane (CH4) to methanol (CH3OH), which is limited by the uncontrollable cracking of key intermediates. Herein, we have successfully constructed a photocatalyst, the Fe&#8208;doped ZnO hollow polyhedron (Fe/ZnOHP), for the highly selective photoconversion of CH4 to CH3OH under mild conditions. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the introduction of Fe was able to decrease the energy level of the O 2p orbital, which passivated the activity of lattice oxygen in ZnO nanocrystals. This passivation effect greatly weakened the interaction between *CH3 and lattice oxygen, thus facilitating the conversion of *CH3O to *CH3 intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *CH3O. As a result, Fe/ZnOHP exhibited excellent CH3OH generation rate (ca. 1009&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (ca. 96&#8201;%) in the photocatalytic conversion of CH4 at room temperature and low pressure.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Carbon Perovskite Solar Cells via Cathode Interface Engineering by using CuPc Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers</title>

This study introduces Cu(II) phthalocyanine as an effective hole&#8208;transporting material induces a structural transformation from monoclinic to a tetragonal phase, facilitating the passivation of the Perovskite surface in conjunction with carbon electrodes. These findings mark a substantial advancement in developing commercially competitive C&#8208;PSCs, successfully combining high power conversion efficiency and stability.







Abstract
Carbon perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) represent a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology that addresses the long&#8208;term operating stability needed to compete with commercial Si solar cells. However, the poor interface contacts between the carbon electrode and the perovskite result in a gap between C&#8208;PSC&#8242;s performances and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PSCs based on metallic back electrodes. In this work, Cu (II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) was rediscovered as an effective hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) to be coupled with carbon electrodes. In particular, based on computational studies and VASP calculations, it is found that the tetragonal structure of CuPc could efficiently coordinated to perovskite (P) layer via N and Cu atoms to Pb and I atoms, respectively. By systematically optimizing the concentration of the CuPc HTL solution, and screening the coupling of CuPc HTL with two types of carbon electrodes, based on carbon black:graphite (C&#8208;G) mixture and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), respectively, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.4&#8201;% (the mean PCE value of 18.57 %) has been achieved. In addition, our cells exhibit satisfactory stability under thermal aging at 85&#176;C, showing less than 20% PCE loss after more than 200 hours. Furthermore, they maintain excellent shelf&#8208;life stability, with only 1.3% PCE loss over 20 days under ambient conditions (ISOS&#8208;D1). These findings represent a significant step forward in developing commercially competitive C&#8208;PSCs, as they combine both high PCE and stability.

         <title>A Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy to Simultaneously Boost the Site Density and Turnover Frequency of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Oxygen Reduction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treating a Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with NH4I vapor via a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process leads to the simultaneous improvements in the turnover frequency via the I&#8208;doping induced electronic structure tuning and site density via the etching of carbon substrate by the in&#8197;situ generated NH3, resulting in superior oxygen reduction activity in both acidic and alkaline media.







Abstract
Site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF) are the two fundamental kinetic descriptors that determine the oxygen reduction activity of iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) catalysts that represent the most promising alternatives to precious and scarce platinum. However, it remains a grand challenge to simultaneously optimize these two parameters in a single Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst. Here we show that treating a typical Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with ammonium iodine (NH4I) vapor via a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process not only increases the surface area and porosity of the catalyst (and thus enhanced exposure of active sites) via the etching effect of the in&#8197;situ released NH3, but also regulates the electronic structure of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C moieties by the iodine dopants incorporated into the carbon matrix. As a result, the NH4I&#8208;treated Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst possesses both high values in the SD of 2.15&#215;1019 sites g&#8722;1 (&#215;2 enhancement compared to the untreated counterpart) and TOF of 3.71 electrons site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (&#215;3 enhancement) that correspond to a high mass activity of 12.78 A g&#8722;1, as determined by in&#8197;situ nitrite stripping technique. Moreover, this catalyst exhibits an excellent oxygen reduction activity in base with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.924&#8201;V and acceptable activity in acid with E1/2 =0.795&#8201;V, and superior power density of 249.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a zinc&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of Nanoscale Metal Borides for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borides based on alkaline earth to rare&#8208;earth metals can be synthesized using the flash Joule heating technique within 60&#8197;seconds. The ultrafast synthesis methods confer exceptional physicochemical properties upon these materials, thereby enabling diverse application potentials across various fields.







Abstract
Nanoscale metal borides, with exceptional physicochemical properties, have been attracted widespread attention. However, traditional synthesis methods of metal borides often lead to surface coking and large particle sizes. Herein, we have employed a flash Joule heating (FJH) technique to enable the ultrafast synthesis of metal boride nanomaterials. The synthesized materials encompass a wide range of diverse categories, including alkaline&#8208;earth metal borides (CaB6), transition metal borides (TiB2, VB2, CrB2, MoB, MoB2, MnB2, MnB4, FeB, CoB, NiB), noble&#8208;metal borides (RuB2, RuB1.1), and rare&#8208;earth metal borides (LaB6, CeB6). As an example, the RuB2 demonstrates highly desirable electrocatalytic performance for all&#8208;pH hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Especially, under the acidic condition, it exhibits an overpotential as low as 15&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8197;cm&#8722;2, with a nearly 100&#8201;% faradic efficiency. Additionally, in&#8197;situ Raman spectra confirm that both Ru and B sites serve as active sites for the HER. Moreover, the stability of RuB2 can be further enhanced by optimizing the microenvironments of the anolyte composition (H+, K+). More importantly, the experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the co&#8208;existence of H+ and K+ localized around the RuB2 plays a crucial role in further enhancing the stability.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Solid Additive Enables Eco&#8208;friendly All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency and Excellent Stability</title>

Green solvent&#8208;processed all&#8208;polymer solar cells utilizing the dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additive have achieved a record efficiency of 19.19&#8201;%.







Abstract
The optimization of morphology in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) often relies on the use of solvent additives. However, their tendency to remain trapped in the device due to high boiling points leads to performance degradation over time. In this study, we introduce a novel approach involving the design and synthesis of one dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additive featuring mono&#8208;brominated&#8208;asymmetric dithienothiophene (SL&#8208;1). Leveraging the synergistic effects of asymmetric substitution and core structures, fine&#8208;tuning the molecule dipole moment enhancing solid additive interactions with host materials, thereby regulating polymer aggregation and influencing blend morphology during device fabrication. This results in highly ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and a favorable phase&#8208;separated morphology within all&#8208;polymer active layer. Our work achieved a record efficiency of 19.19&#8201;% in eco&#8208;friendly all&#8208;PSCs, significantly outperforming SL&#8208;0 (18.37&#8201;%) and SL&#8208;2 (16.60&#8201;%), both featuring an asymmetric core. Furthermore, SL&#8208;1&#8208;treated all&#8208;PSCs retain over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2140&#8197;hours of operation, with an extrapolated T80 lifetime reaching 12400&#8197;hours. This represents a significant improvement in stability compared to devices treated with solvent additive (1&#8208;CN), which typically exhibits a T90 lifetime of 700&#8197;hours. Our findings underscore the efficacy of utilizing dual&#8208;asymmetric solid additives as a straightforward and viable strategy for optimizing all&#8208;polymer morphology. SL&#8208;1 represents a promising advancement towards eco&#8208;friendly fabrication and application of high&#8208;efficiency and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The optimization of morphology in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) often relies on the use of solvent additives. However, their tendency to remain trapped in the device due to high boiling points leads to performance degradation over time. In this study, we introduce a novel approach involving the design and synthesis of one dual-asymmetric solid additive featuring mono-brominated-asymmetric dithienothiophene (SL-1). Leveraging the synergistic effects of asymmetric substitution and core structures, fine-tuning the molecule dipole moment enhancing solid additive interactions with host materials, thereby regulating polymer aggregation and influencing blend morphology during device fabrication. This results in highly ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and a favorable phase-separated morphology within all-polymer active layer. Our work achieved a record efficiency of 19.19&#8201;% in eco-friendly all-PSCs, significantly outperforming SL-0 (18.37&#8201;%) and SL-2 (16.60&#8201;%), both featuring an asymmetric core. Furthermore, SL-1-treated all-PSCs retain over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2140&#8197;hours of operation, with an extrapolated &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Proximal Oblique&#8208;Packing of Heptamethine Cyanines through Spiro&#8208;Connection Boosts Triplet State Generation in Near&#8208;Infrared</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proximal oblique&#8208;packed (V&#8208;shaped packing) of heptamethine cyanine dimer can induce multi&#8208;channel ultrafast triplet state generation with the rate constants up to ~1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, leading a triplet state quantum yield of 18.9&#8201;% upon excitation at 750&#8197;nm, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the monomer (IR780, 2.1&#8201;%).







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) triplet dyes are the cornerstones of cutting&#8208;edge biomedical and material applications. The difficulty in rational development of triplet dyes increases exponentially as the absorption wavelength shifts deeper into the NIR range. Although classical H&#8208;/J&#8208;typed packing of NIR dyes has the potential to enhance intersystem crossing (ISC) compared with that in single&#8208;chromophore dyes, the triplet state quantum yields remain limited in such strategy. Herein, proximal oblique&#8208;packed (V&#8208;shaped) heptamethine cyanines (SZ780) through spiro&#8208;connection were achieved. Multi&#8208;channel ultrafast ISC were direct observed in SZ780 and a record high ISC rate constant (up to ~1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) is registered among all the reported NIR triplet dyes. SZ780 exhibits a triplet state quantum yield of 18.9&#8201;% upon excitation at 750&#8197;nm, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the monomer (IR780, 2.1&#8201;%) and nearly threefold increase compared to that of the H&#8208;packed dimer (SC780) (6.7&#8201;%). Moreover, SZ780 efficiently generates singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, inducing cancer cell apoptosis in vivo. These findings demonstrate that constructing V&#8208;aggregated dyes system by spiro&#8208;connection offers a powerful approach for the design of high&#8208;performance NIR triplet sensitizers.

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Methane to Ethane and Propane Using Cobalt&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Activated GaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Type GaN nanowires with trace metallic cobalt clusters significantly boost the photocatalytic nonoxidative coupling of methane into ethane and propane with exceptional activity, selectivity and stability, which results from the critical methane activation and C&#8722;C coupling on Co clusters, accelerated by ultrafast photogenerated charge transfer from p&#8208;GaN, with GaN support enhancing methane activation and anti&#8208;overoxidation.







Abstract
The photocatalytic nonoxidative coupling of methane (PNOCM) offers a promising route to synthesize valuable C2+ hydrocarbons while minimizing side reactions. Oxide&#8208;based photocatalysts have been predominant in this field, but suffering from limited conversion rates, selectivity, and durability due to poor C&#8722;C coupling as well as overoxidation of CH4 by lattice oxygen. Here, we introduce an advancement in PNOCM for methane conversion into ethane and propane using GaN, one of the most produced semiconductors, together with trace amounts of metallic cobalt clusters (0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The photocatalytic system exhibits outstanding stability, maintaining performance over 110&#8197;hours, achieving conversion rates of approximately 192.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethane and ~17.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for propane, with virtually no coke byproducts detected, representing the highest activity and stability ever reported to our knowledge. This high activity is attributed to the critical methane activation and C&#8722;C coupling on Co cluster, which can be greatly accelerated via the ultrafast photogenerated charge transfer from p&#8208;GaN to Co cluster. Additionally, the GaN support further synergistically enhances methane activation by in situ generating N&#8722;H and O&#8722;H species under reaction, as well as provides a vital anti&#8208;overoxidation effect to CH4 for high selectivity and stability.

         <title>In&#8208;tandem Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia on Ultrathin&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Assembled Iron&#8208;Nickel Alloy Nanoflowers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis of an ultrathin&#8208;sheet&#8208;like nanoflower Fe&#8722;Ni (Fe80Ni20) alloy on a carbon cloth and electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 through an in&#8208;tandem mechanism.







Abstract
The development of alternative routes for ammonia (NH3) synthesis with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) is crucial for energy conservation and to achieve zero carbon emissions. Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to NH3 (e&#8208;NO3RRA) is a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive, fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven Haber&#8211;Bosch process. The implementation of this innovative NH3 synthesis technique requires an efficient electrocatalyst and in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of e&#8208;NO3RRA. In this study, we developed an ultrathin sheet (&#956;m) iron&#8211;nickel nanoflower alloy through electrodeposition and used it for e&#8208;NO3RRA under alkaline conditions. The prepared Fe&#8722;Ni alloy exhibited an FE of 97.28&#177;1.36&#8201;% at &#8722;238&#8197;mVRHE and an NH3 yield rate up to 3999.1&#177;242.59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Experimental electrolysis, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations showed that the adsorption and reduction of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; occurred on the Fe surface, whereas subsequent hydrogenation of NO2&#8722; to NH3 occurred preferentially on the Ni surface. The catalysts exhibited comparable FE for at least 10 cycles, with a long&#8208;term stability of 216&#8197;h. Electron paramagnetic resonance results confirmed that adsorbed hydrogen was consumed during e&#8208;NO3RRA. This work introduces a sustainable, robust, and efficient Fe&#8722;Ni alloy electrocatalyst, offering an environmentally friendly approach for synthesizing NH3 from NO3&#8722;&#8208;contaminated water.

The prepared Fe&#8722;Ni alloy exhibited an FE of 97.28&#177;1.36&#8201;% at &#8722;238&#8197;mV&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; and an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate up to 3999.1&#177;242.59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Experimental electrolysis, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations showed that the adsorption and reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; occurred on the Fe surface, whereas subsequent hydrogenation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; occurred preferentially on the Ni surface. The catalysts exhibited comparable FE for at least 10 cycles, with a long-term stability of 216&#8197;h. Electron paramagnetic resonance results confirmed that adsorbed hydrogen was consumed during e-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RRA. This work introduces a sustainable, robust, and efficient Fe&#8722;Ni alloy electrocatalyst, offering an environmentally friendly approach for synthesizing NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Transient Allosteric Regulation of Catalysis by Effector Switching in a Pt2L4 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of alkynoic tosylamides by cage C is moderated by its guest effector. Dissipative acid/anhydride switching is initiated by carbodiimide addition. &#8216;Medium binding&#8217; guest fumaronitrile displaces weakly binding anhydride upon DIC addition, which is replaced by acid upon anhydride hydrolysis, thus modulating substrate cyclization under temporal control.







Abstract
The complexity of allosteric enzymatic regulation continues to inspire synthetic chemists seeking to emulate interconnected biological systems. In this work, a Pt2L4 cage capable of catalyzing the cyclization reaction of an alkynoic tosyl amide is orthogonally coupled to a diacid&#8208;catalyzed carbodiimide&#8208;hydration cycle. This new Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction is demonstrated to exhibit electronic regulation by inclusion of different guest effectors. The orthogonal diacid&#8208;catalyzed carbodiimide hydration cycle produces transiently diverse guests that influence the rate of the Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction to different extents. Further complexity can be introduced to the system through displacing the transiently&#8208;formed, weakly bound anhydride guest with the stronger binding fumaronitrile, affecting the catalytic rate to a larger extent for the duration of the orthogonal reaction cycle. The modulation of a Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction can thus be regulated transiently over the course of the reaction&#8212; either up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulating the turnover frequency (TOF)&#8212;via coupling with a temporally controllable orthogonal process. This study demonstrates that principles of allosteric enzymatic regulation can also be applied to simple artificial systems.

         <title>Pi&#8208;Stacking Geometry Directed Supramolecular Secondary Building Units Shaping Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks for Intensive NH3 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8208;stacking of conjugated building blocks stabilizes supramolecular secondary building units (SSBUs) containing multiple NH4+ nodes, enabling the construction of robust porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks bearing Br&#248;nsted acid sites for intensive NH3 adsorption with an ultrahigh capacity.







Abstract
Exploiting supramolecular secondary building units (SSBUs) for developing porous crystalline materials represents an exciting breakthrough that extends the boundaries of reticular chemistry. However, shaping polynuclear clusters sustained by non&#8208;covalent interactions for the assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks remains a critical challenge. This study presents a novel strategy to stabilize SSBUs by tuning the &#960;&#8208;stacking geometry of conjugated building blocks, facilitating the creation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with tailored architectures for demanding gas separation. Specifically, parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stackings of aromatic heterocycles bearing carboxyls promote the formation of SSBUs bridged by ammonium cations [NH4+]8[COO&#8722;]8 (SSBU&#8208;4), enabling the assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks with permanent porosity and structural diversity influenced by the solvent effect. Comparatively, the non&#8208;heterocyclic building units exhibit geometrically&#8208; or energetically&#8208;unfavorable &#960; stackings, resulting in fragile frameworks that collapse after removing disordered guests. Significantly, the heterocycle conjugated frameworks contain abundant open Br&#248;nsted acid N&#8722;H sites within pore channels, demonstrating remarkable NH3 adsorption ability among diverse industrial gases with a high capacity (275.7&#8197;mL/g, at 273&#8197;K, 100&#8197;kPa) as compared to reported porous molecular crystals.

         <title>Tunable Catalytic Vertex Wall Chemistry in Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a tunable catalytic vertex&#8208;wall chemistry by incorporating diverse triazine and thiophene units, enabling the precise modulation of COF catalytic performance. This catalytic vertex&#8208;wall strategy facilitates the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic states, thereby enhancing intermediate adsorption characteristics and accelerating oxygen reduction reaction activity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) because of their unique structural properties and notable stability. To enhance both catalytic activity and selectivity, a variety of linkers and linkages have been investigated in efforts to precisely engineer COFs. However, the impact of vertex structures within COFs on ORR catalysis remains largely underexplored. Here, to modulate COF catalytic performance, we introduce tunable catalytic vertex wall chemistry by introducing diverse triazine and thiophene units. The catalytic vertex wall approach allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic surface states, leading to improved intermediate adsorption characteristics and accelerated ORR activity. Remarkably, the engineered COF achieved a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V, surpassing COFs modified by linker or linkage strategies. Theoretical calculations suggest that this enhanced activity arises from the strong binding affinity of OOH* intermediates to carbon atoms adjacent to the thiophene vertex, facilitating OOH* reduction to a O2 molecule, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step of the ORR. These findings reveal the pivotal role of vertex wall engineering in conjugated COF frameworks, and offer critical insights to advance COFs design toward superior ORR performance.

         <title>Monomer Design Enables Mechanistic Mapping of Anionic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Aromatic Thionolactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BINOL&#8208;derived thionolactone exhibits exceptional anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerizability, which helps unravel the mechanistic imbalance between initiation and propagation, leading to first facile preparation of well&#8208;defined aromatic polythioesters. This approach also allows monomer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer atropisomerism transfer to create optically active polymeric materials with designed topology.







Abstract
Degradable chalcogenide polyesters, e.g., polythioesters (PTEs), typically exhibit improved thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of thionolactones, an intrinsically promising yet underexplored approach to accessing PTEs, however, is still limited by: intolerance of metal catalysts, inadequate control over chain growth, and the absence of aromatic system. Monomer design&#8208;boosted mechanistic studies may address the above challenges. Here, we present a new and highly reactive thionolactone synthesized from 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol (BINOL). Our investigations into polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics have underscored the importance of rapid initiation, eventually leading to the discovery of tetrabutylammonium 2&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;thiocarboxylate as a distinctive initiator that enables genuinely controlled and living polymerization of thionolactones. Ultimately, the atropisomerism inherent in BINOL has resulted in the creation of axially chiral PTE materials with tailored molecular weights, enantiomeric compositions, and topologies.

         <title>Disturbance&#8208;Triggered Instant Crystallization Activating Bioinspired Emissive Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Pennatula phosphorea, a new class of smart luminescence gels is constructed by integrating hydrophilic polymeric networks, metastable supersaturated salt and aggregated fluorophores in one system. Upon external disturbance such as gentle touch, the composite gels demonstrate Pennatula phosphorea&#8208;like emission including intense fluorescence and long&#8208;lived afterglow resulting from their instant soft&#8208;rigid state transition.







Abstract
Many marine organisms feature sensitive sensory&#8208;perceptual systems to sense the surrounding environment and respond to disturbance with intense bioluminescence. However, it remains a great challenge to develop artificial materials that can sense external disturbance and simultaneously activate intense luminescence, although such materials are attractive for visual sensing and intelligent displays. Herein, we present a new class of bioinspired smart gels constructed by integrating hydrophilic polymeric networks, metastable supersaturated salt and fluorophores containing heterogenic atoms. Upon external disturbance, the composite gels undergo an instant and reversible soft&#8208;rigid state transition, simultaneously turning on intense fluorescence and activating ultralong afterglow emission with a maximum lifetime of 877.15&#8197;ms. The experimental results and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the disturbance&#8208;induced luminescence mainly results from the geometrical confinement of aggregated fluorophores and enhanced molecular interactions to immensely suppress the non&#8208;radiative dissipation. Given their versatile and sensitive disturbance&#8208;responsiveness, dynamic interactive painting and 3D smart optical displays are demonstrated. This study paves a new avenue to achieve disturbance&#8208;sensing soft materials and promotes the development of smart visual sensors and interactive optical displays.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;CO2 Battery at Elevated Temperatures: Advances with Fluorine&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne and Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with high stability at elevated temperatures were assembled using fluorine&#8208;graphdiyne (FGDY) as cathode catalysts and imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid as electrolyte solvent. At temperature of 80&#8201;&#176;C, the batteries could operate at high current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1 and stably run for 240 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1, the corresponding pouch cell showed high energy density of 536&#8197;Wh&#8901;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries demonstrate promising prospects in terms of high&#8208;density energy storage and efficient CO2 fixation. However, their practical application is impeded by sluggish reaction kinetics and leakage of volatile and flammable organic electrolytes, especially for high temperature application scenarios, leading to large polarization and limited cycling stability. Herein, we fabricate a highly rechargeable and stable Li&#8208;CO2 battery with high temperature adaptability by employing fluorine&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (FGDY) as cathode catalysts and imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid as electrolyte solvents. The employed FGDY, which possesses homogeneous sp&#8208;hybridized carbon, high specific surface area, and uniform pores, significantly enhances the battery reaction kinetics. Consequently, the fabricated Li&#8208;CO2 batteries operate consistently at a large current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8901;g&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C while showcasing high discharge capacity of 29050&#8197;mAh&#8901;g&#8722;1 along with excellent cycling stability. As proof of concept, Li&#8208;CO2 pouch cells achieve a high energy density of 536&#8197;Wh&#8901;kg&#8722;1 based on the total mass of the device, and show outstanding cycling stability at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This study underscores the effectiveness of graphdiyne&#8208;derived carbon catalysts in achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Highly Tension&#8208;Strained Copper Concentrates Diluted Cations for Selective Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly tension&#8208;strained copper creates an electron&#8208;rich surface that concentrates diluted cations, which enables highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion under pH&#8197;1 electrolyte with 1&#8197;M potassium ions, showing 44.3&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency toward C2H4 over 100&#8197;hours at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cell voltage of 3.1 volts in a proton&#8208;exchange membrane electrolyser.







Abstract
Electrolysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) in acid offers a promising route to overcome CO2 loss in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, but requires concentrated alkali cations (typical &#8805;3&#8197;M) to mitigate the trade&#8208;off between low pH and high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate, causing salt precipitation. Here we report a strategy to resolve this problem by introducing tensile strain in a copper (Cu) catalyst, which can selectively reduce CO2 to valuable multicarbon products, particularly ethylene, in a pH&#8197;1 electrolyte with 1&#8197;M potassium ions. We find that the tension&#8208;strained Cu creates an electron&#8208;rich surface that concentrates diluted potassium ions, contributing to CO2 activation and HER suppression. With this catalyst, we show constant ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 44.3&#8201;% over 100&#8197;hours at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cell voltage of 3.1 volts in a proton&#8208;exchange membrane electrolyser. Moreover, selective electrosynthesis of ethylene oxide using the as&#8208;produced ethylene was demonstrated in an integrated system.

         <title>Dehydration&#8208;enhanced Ion Recognition of Triazine Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;resolution Li+/Mg2+ Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking biological ion channels constructed negative electrical energy Well in the TAT&#8208;TP&#8208;P membrane and precisely modulated the pore environment, which endowed the TAT&#8208;TP&#8208;P membrane with excellent ion recognition capability. This property enabled the TAT&#8208;TP&#8208;P membrane to exhibit high&#8208;precision Li+/Mg2+ separation performance, realizing the efficient extraction of lithium resources.







Abstract
The precise and rapid extraction of lithium from salt&#8208;lake brines is critical to meeting the global demand for lithium resources. However, it remains a major challenge to design ion&#8208;transport membranes with accurate recognition and fast transport path for the target ion. Here, we report a triazine covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with high resolution for Li+ and Mg2+ that enables fast Li+ transport while almost completely inhibiting Mg2+ permeation. The remarkably high rejection of Mg2+ by the COF membrane is achieved via imposed ion dehydration and the construction of the energy well. The proper hydrophilic environment of the COF channel promotes the dissociation of Li+ from the negatively charged functional groups, allowing Li+ for hopping transport supported by the sulfonate side&#8208;chains to shorten the diffusion path of Li+. Under high&#8208;salinity electrodialysis conditions, the COF membrane demonstrates robust Li+/Mg2+ separation performance (No Mg2+ were detected in the collected solution), achieving efficient lithium recovery and high product purity (Li2CO3: 99.3&#8201;%). This membrane design strategy enables high energy efficiency and powerful lithium extraction in the electrodialysis lithium extraction process, and can be generalized to other energy and separation related membranes.

         <title>W&#8208;Mediated Electron Accumulation in Ru&#8722;O&#8722;W Motifs Enables Ultra&#8208;Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn and W were co&#8208;doped to establish a W&#8208;mediated electron accumulation strategy. The incorporation of highly electronegative W facilitates the efficient capture of electrons released by sacrificial Zn during the OER process. These electrons are subsequently directed to the Ru site, forming a stable Ru&#8722;O&#8722;W motif and significantly enhancing the anti&#8208;overoxidation performance of the Ru active site







Abstract
The development of efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is crucial for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology, especially in the pursuit of non&#8208;iridium alternatives. Herein, we report a Zn, W co&#8208;doped Ru3Zn0.85W0.15Ox (RZW) ternary oxide catalyst that exhibits a low overpotential of 200&#8197;mV and remarkable stability for over 4000&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4. The incorporation of highly electronegative W facilitates the efficient capture of electrons released from the sacrificial Zn species during OER, and subsequently mediated to Ru sites. The observed enhancement in electron density within the stable Ru&#8722;O&#8722;W motifs substantially improves the anti&#8208;overoxidation properties of the Ru active sites. Our findings highlight the importance of strategic metal doping in modulating the electronic structure of OER catalysts during operation, thereby facilitating the development of practical and long&#8208;lasting water electrolysis technologies.

         <title>Saturated F2&#8208;Rings from Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating fluorine into aliphatic rings induces significant changes in molecular conformation, acidity/basicity, and lipophilicity. A general method has been developed to transform exocyclic alkenes into saturated F2&#8208;rings. This reaction utilizes the reagent C6F5I(OAc)2, enabling the straightforward synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated macrocyclic, fused, spiro, bridged, and natural product&#8208;derived structures. The practicality of this protocol is demonstrated through several decagram&#8208;scale syntheses.

         <title>Breaking Anionic Solvation Barrier for Safe and Durable Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries Under Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Operation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through breaking the anion solvation barrier, a weakly solvating fluorinated electrolyte with intrinsic nonflammability is designed for advanced potassium&#8208;ion batteries with simultaneously enhanced safety and durability under ultrahigh&#8208;voltage operation. As proof of concept, a representative KVPO4F cathode sustains 1600 cycles with 84.4&#8201;% of capacity retention under a cutoff voltage of 4.95&#8197;V due to synergistic interfacial modulation.







Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;voltage potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) with cost competitiveness represent a viable route towards high energy battery systems. Nevertheless, rapid capacity decay with poor Coulombic efficiencies remains intractable, mainly attributed to interfacial instability from aggressive potassium metal anodes and cathodes. Additionally, high reactivity of K metal and flammable electrolytes pose severe safety hazards. Herein, a weakly solvating fluorinated electrolyte with intrinsically nonflammable feature is successfully developed to enable an ultrahigh&#8208;voltage (up to 5.5&#8197;V) operation. Through breaking the anionic solvation barrier, synergistic interfacial modulation can be achieved by the formation of robust anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces on both the cathode and anode. As proof of concept, a representative KVPO4F cathode can sustain 1600 cycles with 84.4&#8201;% of capacity retention at a high cutoff voltage of 4.95&#8197;V. Meanwhile, K plating/stripping process in our designed electrolyte also demonstrates optimized electrochemical reversibility and stability with effectively inhibited potassium dendrites. These findings underscore the critical impact of anion&#8208;dominated solvation configuration on synergistic interfacial modulation and electrochemical properties. This work provides new insights into rational design of ultrahigh&#8208;voltage and safe electrolyte for advanced PIBs.

         <title>Dissociation&#8211;Precipitation Chemistry of Lithium Polysulfides and Its Correlation to Dynamic Evolution of Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte Interphase in Highly Solvating Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly solvating electrolyte strategy using hexamethylphosphoramide is proposed to elucidate the dissociation&#8211;precipitation chemistry of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and its correlation to the dynamic evolution of cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI), which leads to effective regulation of the LiPSs solvation to initiate a radical&#8208;assisted conversion pathway, control of three&#8208;dimensional Li2S electrodeposition to boost sulfur utilization, and formation of a stable CEI to enhance reversibility.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries has been regarded as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries is still hindered by the unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase and the early passivation of charge product (Li2S), leading to poor cycling stability and low S utilization. Herein, we propose an electrolyte engineering strategy using highly solvating hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) as a co&#8208;solvent to elucidate the dissociation&#8211;precipitation chemistry of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The multimode optical spectroscopies confirm that this electrolyte engineering is able to effectively regulate the solvation of LiPSs to initiate a radical&#8208;assisted conversion pathway and control three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Li2S electrodeposition to boost sulfur utilization. More importantly, the dynamic evolution of cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase, featuring with S&#8208;/P&#8208;containing species, is also assessed by both distribution of relaxation times technology and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which can suppress the passivation of Li2S to enhance conversion reversibility. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a Li&#8722;S cell with high S loading mass of 7.75&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 demonstrates an extremely high area capacity of 7.86&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 1.30&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, representing a significant advancement in promoting the development of practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor AlaCOS could undergo a self&#8208;immolative process once activated by aminopeptidase N, an inflammatory biomarker, to generate H2S via carbonyl sulfide (COS), showing potent capacity to reduce cellular oxidative stress and inflammatory response. By reprogramming macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype, this compound could accelerate wound healing significantly.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays crucial inflammatory modulating roles, representing a promising candidate for anti&#8208;inflammatory therapies. However, current H2S delivery approaches lack sufficient specificity against inflammatory response. Herein, regarding the overexpressed aminopeptidase N (APN) at the inflammation sites, an APN&#8208;activated self&#8208;immolative carbonyl sulfide (COS)/H2S donor (AlaCOS) was developed for inflammatory response&#8208;specific H2S delivery. The compound showed sustained H2S generation upon APN activation in the presence of carbonic anhydrase (CA), and the responsiveness could be well regulated by modulating the amino acid sequence. Due to the inflammatory response&#8208;specific sustained H2S delivery, AlaCOS provided potent anti&#8208;inflammatory capability, which was further validated by RNA sequencing. In vivo experiments on a full&#8208;thickness cutaneous wound murine model also showed the strong promoting effect on wound healing, mainly due to the regulation of the inflammatory response by AlaCOS. By introducing a caged coumarin fluorophore to the molecular architecture, self&#8208;reporting fluorescence could be generated accompanied with APN&#8208;mediated COS/H2S release, which achieved the visualization of H2S delivery in vitro and in vivo. This work not only offers a useful tool for studying the bioactivity of H2S on inflammation, but also provides new insights for developing novel therapies to cope with inflammation&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Amorphization Stabilizes Te&#8208;Based Aqueous Batteries via Confining Free Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>

Trapped with the sluggish reduction kinetics, the easy dissolution of Te4+ species, and a controversial energy storage mechanism, achieving complete and stable hypervalent Te0/Te4+ electrochemistry in an aqueous environment is challenging. Herein, an amorphization strategy is introduced to stabilize aqueous TeO2/Te electrochemistry via confining free water, triggering impressive Te redox utilization, high&#8208;rate performance, and long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Tellurium (Te), with its rich valence states (&#8722;2 to +6), could endow aqueous batteries with potentially high specific capacity. However, achieving complete and stable hypervalent Te0/Te4+ electrochemistry in an aqueous environment poses significant challenges, owing to the sluggish reduction kinetics, easy dissolution of Te4+ species, and a controversial energy storage mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a crystallographic regulation strategy for robust aqueous Te redox electrochemistry. With strong hydrogen bonding, NH4Ac confines free water, prompting the amorphization of TeO2 (a&#8208;TeO2). In&#8197;situ synchrotron characterization, spectroscopy analysis, electrochemical evaluation, and theoretical calculations reveal a specific 4&#8201;e&#8722; solid&#8208;solid transition pathway (Te to a&#8208;TeO2) with accelerated diffusion and charge transfer kinetics, attributed to a closer unoccupied electron orbital to the Fermi level and a reduced water desorption energy barrier in a&#8208;TeO2. Impressively, the a&#8208;TeO2/Te redox exhibits a high reversible capacity of 834&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (99% of Te redox utilization), superior rate performance (644&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and an ultralong lifespan (over 3000 cycles). These findings prove a new tactic to advance aqueous Te redox electrochemistry toward high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.

         <title>Regulating Water Molecules via Bioinspired Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired covalent organic framework membrane enables highly reversible Zn metal anode: Drawing inspiration from biological transmembrane transport mechanism, a covalent organic framework membrane is developed to tailor active water molecules at the anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. The derived Zn anode achieves improved transport kinetics, oriented Zn deposition, and enhanced cyclic lifespan.







Abstract
The Zn metal anode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) faces daunting challenges including undesired water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and sluggish ion migration kinetics. Herein, we develop three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with bioinspired ion channels toward stabilized Zn anodes. These COFs, featured by zincophilic pyridine&#8208;N sites, enable effective regulation of water molecules at the anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Systematic experimental analysis and theoretical simulations reveal the optimized COF&#8208;320N membrane functions as ion pumps, accordingly facilitating Zn2+ transport and inhibiting direct contact between Zn anode and free water molecules. Consequently, the bio&#8208;inspired strategy achieves improved Zn2+ transference number (0.61), rapid de&#8208;solvation kinetics, and suppressed hydrogen evolution. The assembled Zn||MnO2 pouch cell integrated with COF&#8208;320N membrane exhibits favorable electrochemical performances. Such a bioinspired concept for optimizing Zn anodes opens new pathways in developing advanced energy storage devices.

         <title>Liquid Crystal&#8208;Engineered Polydimethylsiloxane: Enhancing Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity through High Grafting Density of Mesogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a novel strategy to enhance the intrinsic thermal conductivity of liquid crystal polydimethylsiloxane by achieving high grafting density of mesogens, resulting in the high intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;) of 0.56&#8197;W/(m&#8901;K), showing a 180&#8201;% improvement over ordinary polydimethylsiloxane while maintaining excellent electrical and thermal properties.







Abstract
The increasing power and integration of electronic devices have intensified serious heat accumulation, driving the demand for higher intrinsic thermal conductivity in thermal interface materials, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Grafting mesogens onto PDMS can enhance its intrinsic thermal conductivity. However, the high stability of the PDMS chain limits the grafting density of mesogens, restricting the improvement in thermal conductivity. This work proposes a new strategy to efficiently introduce mesogens onto PDMS through ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of liquid crystal cyclosiloxane and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, enhancing the grafting density. The relationship between the grafting density and intrinsic thermal conductivity of liquid crystal polydimethylsiloxane (LC&#8208;PDMS) is investigated by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. Based on the simulation results, LC&#8208;PDMS with enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity is synthesized. When the grafting density of mesogens reaches 77.4&#8201;%, its intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;) increases to 0.56&#8197;W/(m&#8901;K), showing a 180.0&#8201;% improvement over ordinary PDMS (0.20&#8197;W/(m&#8901;K)). The LC&#8208;PDMS also exhibits the low dielectric constant (&#1013;, 2.69), low dielectric loss tangent (tan&#948;, 0.0027), high insulation performance (volume resistivity, 3.51&#215;1013&#8197;&#937;&#8901;cm), excellent thermal stability (heat resistance index, 217.8&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 137.4&#176;), fulfilling the comprehensive requirements of advanced thermal interface materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable surface states play a crucial yet poorly understood role in catalysis. However, they are difficult to isolate and even harder to identify. In their Communication (e202423880), Christian Reece et al. successfully isolate and identify a highly active metastable surface state over Pt nanoparticles, which forms after CO desorbs from well&#8208;coordinated Pt sites. The cover image is a stylised representation of how this state emerges following CO desorption.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Molecular Design for Dual Circularity: Polyester with Complementary Mechanical and Chemical Recyclability under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual circularity concept to prevent plastic waste accumulation is presented by Yue Han and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202421431). The concept is exemplified for triarylmethane&#8208;containing polyesters and their facile closed&#8208;loop recyclability via complementary mechanical and chemical routes. For the polymers with dual circularity, it is recommended to proceed with mechanical recycling when we can, and switch to chemical recycling when we must.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: In&#8208;tandem Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia on Ultrathin&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Assembled Iron&#8211;Nickel Alloy Nanoflowers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction to ammonia occurs with exceptional performance on ultrathin&#8208;sheet&#8208;assembled Fe80Ni20 nanoflowers, as described by Jason Lam et al. in their Research Article (e202500167). Mechanistic studies revealed that NO3&lt;M&#8208;&gt; preferentially adsorbs and is reduced to NO2&lt;M&#8208;&gt; on the Fe surface. Subsequently, NO2&lt;M&#8208;&gt; is efficiently hydrogenated to NH3 on the Ni surface. This in&#8208;tandem mechanism between Fe and Ni significantly enhances the electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&lt;M&#8208;&gt; to NH3.

         <title>Frontispiece: Fluorescent Artificial Receptor for Dopamine based on Molecular Recognition&#8208;driven Dynamic Covalent Chemistry in a Lipid Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their Research Article (e202419905), Andrey S. Klymchenko et&#8197;al. introduce a dynamic artificial receptor for neurotransmitter dopamine that synergically combines molecular recognition with dynamic imine bond formation of a fluorescent dye inside a lipid nanoreactor, triggering its emission color change. This nanoprobe enables dopamine detection with remarkable selectivity without interference of competing biogenic amines and biological fluids, such as blood serum, plasma, urine and cell lysate.

A nacre&#8208;inspired composite membrane with &#8220;brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8221; structure is reported by J&#252;rgen Caro, Heqing Jiang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202416919). Dominant &#8220;brick&#8221; microporous zeolitic imidazolate framework nanoparticles allow fast H2 transport, while the &#8220;mortar&#8221; coordination polymer interlayer combined with an adhesive interface reduces the intercrystalline transport and provides a highly H2 selective transport pathway, resulting in an exceptional H2/CO2 separation performance.

         <title>Towards Surface&#8208;Enhanced Homogeneous Catalysis: Tailoring the Enrichment of Metal Complexes at Ionic Liquid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article reviews strategies to deliberately anchor metal complexes at the liquid/vacuum&#8197;(gas) interface of ionic liquids in a buoy&#8208;like fashion; this surface enrichment is achieved by targeted functionalization of the catalytic complexes with surface&#8208;active ligands and the appropriate choice of the ionic liquid.

When talking about homogeneous catalyst systems, it has long been assumed that the system at hand consists of a transition metal complex in solution with the liquid interface representing the composition of the bulk solution. Now, in light of considerable developments in the study of metal complexes dissolved in ionic liquids with their negligible vapor pressures, more detailed studies of the composition at the liquid/gas interface became possible. These investigations revealed pronounced surface enrichment and segregation effects of high relevance for practical applications. This article reviews recent advancements in tailoring the interfacial composition of ionic liquid&#8208;based catalytic systems. A particular focus is dedicated to surface enrichment phenomena, and a variety of parameters are presented for deliberate control of the local concentration of the complexes at the surface, that is, the nature of the ligands, the bulk concentration, the temperature, and the nature of the IL solvent. As experimental methods, angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and vacuum&#8208;based pendant&#8208;drop surface tension measurements were applied. The reviewed results are intended to provide the basis for the advancement of catalytic systems with high surface areas, such as in supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis, where the interface design is directly interconnected with catalytic performance.

This review discusses diverse chemical reactions that propel out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium micro&#8208;/nanomotors, emphasizing the emerging implications of their products on biological systems. The key applications discussed include neural modulation, ROS regulation, synergistic tumor therapy, antibacterial strategies, and tissue regeneration. This review suggests that these advancements represent a significant shift towards active therapies that transcend conventional approaches.







Abstract
Developing micro&#8208;/nanomotors that convert a chemical energy input into a local gradient field and motion is an appealing but challenging task that holds particular promise for the intersection of materials and nanoengineering. Over the past two decades, remarkable advancements have refined these out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium chemically powered micro&#8208;/nanomotors, enabling them to orchestrate in situ chemical transformations that dynamically change local environments. The ionic products, radicals, gases, and electric fields from these active materials reshape the microenvironment, paving the way for ecofriendly disease interventions. This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reactions that propel these energy&#8208;consuming micro&#8208;/nanomotors and elucidates the emerging implications of their products on biological systems. Particular emphasis has been placed on their potential for neural modulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, synergistic tumor therapy, antibacterial strategies, and tissue regeneration. Collectively, these sketches provide a landscape of therapeutic modalities, heralding a new era of biomedicine. By harnessing the in situ product field of this active matter, we envision a paradigm shift toward active therapies that transcend conventional approaches, promising breakthroughs in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

Composite membranes with nacre&#8208;like &#8220;brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8221; structure were developed. Dominant &#8220;brick&#8221; microporous ZIF&#8208;8 allows fast H2 transport, while &#8220;mortar&#8221; Zn&#8208;polyethyleneimine coordination polymer interlayer combined with adhesive interface reduces intercrystalline transport and provides highly H2 selective transport pathway, resulting in a record&#8208;high H2 permeability along with an excellent H2/CO2 selectivity.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) with high stability and porosity is a promising candidate for hydrogen separation membranes. However, most ZIF&#8208;8 polycrystalline membranes exhibit low H2/CO2 (kinetic diameters of 2.9/3.3&#8197;&#197;) mixed gas selectivity, due to the intercrystalline defects and the unprecise molecular sieving originated from framework flexibility of ZIF&#8208;8 structure with a theoretical aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197;. Here, inspired by nacre's &#8220;brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8221; structure, we develop mixed matrix type composite membranes in which dominant crystalline ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles (bricks) are interconnected by ultrathin zinc coordination polymer interlayers (mortar) via self&#8208;assembling. Driven by coordination bonds between Zn2+ from precursor colloid and branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), a zinc coordination polymer network is formed to connect ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles through interactions between Zn2+ of coordination polymer and surface terminal groups on ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles, thus eliminating intercrystalline void defects and providing a highly selective H2 transport pathway. Meanwhile, the micropores and large cavities in ZIF&#8208;8 allow fast H2 transport. Benefitting from both highly selective pathway and fast H2 transport through porous ZIF&#8208;8, the optimized ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;PEI membrane exhibits a record&#8208;high H2 permeability of ~1.78&#215;105 Barrer with a high mixed gas H2/CO2 selectivity of 176, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. This bioinspired multifunctional membrane expands the scope of molecular sieving membrane.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation to Ethylene with High Energy Efficiency</title>

Zinc&#8208;doped copper catalysts exhibit exceptional performance in electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH), achieving an ethylene partial current density of &#8722;0.29&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at &#8722;0.62&#8197;V vs. RHE, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Zinc doping significantly promotes acetylene adsorption and activation, accelerates reaction kinetics, and effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and over&#8208;hydrogenation, offering a highly efficient strategy for sustainable ethylene production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH) provides a petroleum&#8208;independent strategy for ethylene production. However, the challenges of high overpotentials and strong hydrogen evolution competition reaction over conventional electrocatalysts at industrial current densities result in substantial energy consumption, limiting the practical application of EASH technology. Herein, zinc&#8208;doped copper catalysts are designed and prepared via a facile impregnation and electroreduction relay method. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;2.7Zn catalyst exhibits an ethylene partial current density of &#8722;0.29&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 96&#8201;% and a reaction potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing the previously reported electrocatalysts. The combined results of experimental tests and theoretical calculations demonstrate zinc doping significantly enhances acetylene adsorption and accelerates reaction kinetics, leading to a notable decrease in overpotential. Furthermore, the increased *H&#8208;*H binding energy barrier and the improved ethylene desorption on Cu&#8208;2.7Zn effectively suppress hydrogen evolution and acetylene over&#8208;hydrogenation, contributing to the enhancement of ethylene Faradaic efficiency.

         <title>Pyridoxal&#8208;Inspired Photo&#8208;Decarboxylase Catalysis: Photochemical Decarboxylation of Unprotected Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic method for the decarboxylation (deCO2) of unprotected amino acids inspired by pyridoxal&#8208;dependent decarboxylases is described. Catalytic condensation of amino acids onto a pyridoxal&#8208;mimicking organocatalyst enables hyperconjugation&#8208;enabled photoexcitation can occur, which in combination with a thiol hydrogen atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) co&#8208;catalyst facilitates a net biomimetic transformation via non&#8208;natural photo&#8208;decarboxylase catalysis.







Abstract
A photochemical organocatalytic method for the protodecarboxylation of unprotected amino acids is reported. Inspired by pyridoxal 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent decarboxylase enzymes, the catalytic activation of amino acid substrates by 3&#8208;hydroxyisonicotinaldehyde enables a photochemical decarboxylation event, which can be leveraged in combination with a thiol co&#8208;catalyst. The necessary and sufficient structural features of the pyridoxal&#8208;like framework for photoactivity are determined using ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy. A broad scope of unprotected amino acids can be decarboxylated in this system, with selectivity between multiple carboxylates realized on the possible basis of hyperconjugation. The ability to engage simple amino acids in decarboxylative functionalization at ambient conditions using a pyridoxal&#8208;mimicking organocatalyst enables new possibilities for the translation of biogenic amino acids into medicinally valuable amines.

&lt;p&gt;A photocatalytic method for the decarboxylation (deCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of unprotected amino acids inspired by pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases is described. Catalytic condensation of amino acids onto a pyridoxal-mimicking organocatalyst enables hyperconjugation-enabled photoexcitation can occur, which in combination with a thiol hydrogen atom-transfer (HAT) co-catalyst facilitates a net biomimetic transformation via non-natural photo-decarboxylase catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photochemical organocatalytic method for the protodecarboxylation of unprotected amino acids is reported. Inspired by pyridoxal 5&#8242;-phosphate-dependent decarboxylase enzymes, the catalytic activation of amino acid substrates by 3-hydroxyisonicotinaldehyde enables a photochemical decarboxylation event, which can be leveraged in combination with a thiol co-catalyst. The necessary and sufficient structural features of the pyridoxal-like framework for photoactivity are determined using ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. A broad scope of unprotected amino acids can be decarboxylated in this system, with selectivity between multiple carboxylates realized on the possible basis of hyperconjugation. The ability to engage simple amino acids in decarboxylative functionalization at ambient conditions using a pyridoxal-mimicking organocatalyst enables new possibilities for the translation of biogenic amino acids into medicinally valuable amines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metabolism&#8208;inspired chemical reaction networks for chemically driven dissipative oligoesterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Behind the seemingly simple process of dissipative oligoesterification is a complex network of chemical reactions.&#160;Within this network, oligoesters undergo parasitic exchanges, consuming one another to sustain the system's dynamic state&#8212;an emergent behavior reminiscent of the self&#8208;sustaining processes observed in natural metabolism.







Abstract
Metabolism is a complex network of chemical reactions in which transient biomolecules are continuously produced and degraded. Mimicking this dynamic process in synthetic systems poses a considerable challenge, as it requires designs that enable the exchange of energy and matter among transient molecules. In this study, we explored a chemically driven oligoesterification process operating within a highly intricate reaction network and constructed a dynamic library of transient oligoesters. Our kinetic analysis uncovered an intriguing phenomenon: oligoesters undergo parasitic exchanges, consuming one another to sustain the system's dynamics before reaching thermodynamic equilibrium. This discovery opens new opportunities for designing synthetic systems that replicate the complexity and self&#8208;sustaining behavior of metabolic processes.

         <title>Selective and Efficient Upcycling of Polyesters from Waste Plastic Blends Enabled by a Rationally Designed Manganese Pincer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient hydrogenative upcycling of polyesters was developed enabled by rationally designed PNNH&#8208;pincer manganese catalysts, which not only allow the upcycling of single&#8208;component polyester, but also enable the selective hydrogenolysis of polyester from waste plastic blends or contaminants into highly valuable oxygenated products under very mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies supported that the high efficiency of this protocol is attributed to the improved stability and reactivity of the catalyst with the extended &#960;&#8208;system and the N&#8722;H moiety on the side arm.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new class of earth&#8208;abundant pincer manganese catalysts that not only enable the efficient conversion of single&#8208;component post&#8208;consumer polyesters with a turnover number (TON) of up to 5300, but more importantly, allow the selective upcycling of polyesters from waste plastic blends (e.g., nylon, PA; polyethylene, PE; polyurethane, PU; polyvinyl chloride, PVC; cotton) or contaminants such as pigment, aluminum, or glass into highly valuable oxygenated products under mild conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations revealed that the exceptional efficiency of this protocol is due to the use of rationally designed quinaldine&#8208;based PNNH&#8208;type Mn complexes with an extended &#960;&#8208;system and an N&#8722;H moiety on the side arm to simultaneously enhance the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. In addition, the incorporation of dual metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) relay catalysis more effectively facilitates the key steps of this transformation, including H2 activation and hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted hydride transfer.

         <title>A Metastable State Facilitates Low Temperature CO Oxidation over Pt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 14, April 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining transient pressure pulse experiments with Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy a high&#8208;activity metastable state was identified on Pt nanoparticles, characterised by its ability to oxidise CO* to CO2 at room temperature. Access to this state requires a mild thermal treatment in the presence of adsorbed CO*. We hypothesise that this state is highly localised to the surface of the nanoparticle, and we find that it collapses upon elevated thermal treatments, or upon adsorption of CO at low temperature.







Abstract
The dynamic response of heterogeneous catalytic materials to their environment opens a wide variety of possible surface states which may have increased catalytic activity. In this work, we find that it is possible to generate a surface state with increased catalytic activity over metallic 2&#8197;nm Pt nanoparticles by performing a thermal treatment of the CO*&#8208;covered Pt catalyst. This state is characterised by its ability to oxidise CO to CO2 at room temperature. By combining pressure pulse experiments with in situ spectroscopy we correlate the formation of this high&#8208;activity state with the desorption of weakly bound CO* molecules from well&#8208;coordinated Pt sites. This high&#8208;activity state is metastable, degrading after elevated thermal treatments or upon readsorption of CO at room temperature. We conclude that this metastable state is highly localised to the surface of the nanoparticle, however its exact atomic structure remains open to speculation.

         <title>Anode Engineering with pH&#8208;Neutral Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Enabling Over 19% Efficiency in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a novel p&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE)&#8208;based HTL with an optimized molecular design was developed, featuring an enhanced planar conformation and reduced density of states (DOS), which realized efficient charge transport. With POM4 doping, the constructed OSCs achieved a high PCE of 19.16%. This work demonstrates CPE&#8208;based HTLs as promising acid&#8208;free HTL alternatives for high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.








Abstract
The lack of effective hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) materials has become a significant bottleneck in the advancement of organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, to obtain sufficient doping properties, most HTLs have to be used by mixing with substantial amounts of acid, which causes serious corrosion problems. Herein, by optimizing molecular conformation, we designed and synthesized two conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) that exhibited superior hole&#8208;transporting capability without involving acid addition. The PEP&#8208;BT features a planar conjugated backbone constructed from the nonfused segment, which leads to an enhanced doping effect and highly ordered molecular arrangement. and reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking from 4.13 to 3.85&#160;&#197;. These contributed to the outstanding hole collection performance of polyoxometalate&#8208;doped PEP&#8208;BT:POM4 while maintaining a neutral pH. The binary OSC showed a photovoltaic efficiency of 19.16%, illustrating an unprecedented example that a CPE&#8208;based HTL can provide a photovoltaic efficiency exceeding 19% in OSCs. Moreover, as another evidence of high&#8208;performance HTL, the organic light&#8208;emitting diode incorporating PEP&#8208;BT:POM4 exhibited a superior luminous efficiency to the reference device, along with a decrease of 0.4&#160;V for turn&#8208;on voltage. The results from this work demonstrate the great potential of CPEs as HTL materials.

         <title>Anchor Peptide&#8208;Based Immobilization Strategy Promote the Applications of Pickering Emulsion System in Natural Products Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designs an anchor peptide&#8208;based immobilization strategy to expand the application of Pickering emulsion to glycosyltransferases (GTs) for the first time, addressing low conversion challenge in aqueous solutions. The glycosylation Pickering emulsion achieved more than 90% conversion of natural product glycosides with high recyclability, offering a practical approach to broaden the applications of natural enzymes in Pickering emulsion.








Abstract
Pickering emulsion systems serve&#160;as an advanced platform for efficient fine chemical production in biphasic enzymatic catalysis, though their applications are currently limited to a few commercial enzyme classes. Herein, we designed an anchor peptide&#8208;based immobilization strategy for Pickering emulsions to achieve efficient glycosylation of natural products by glycosyltransferases (GTs). Firstly, through enzyme mining, natural GTs were utilized to synthesize pharmaceutically important acacetin glucoside and galactoside. However, the best&#8208;performing enzymes, BacGT and BarGT&#8208;3, still showed low conversions for acacetin glucoside (&lt;40%) and galactoside (&lt;10%). Then, Spy chemistry was employed to cyclize these two GTs (Spy_BacGT and Spy_BarGT&#8208;3) for improved robustness, and a Pickering emulsion was formed with the free two Spy_GTs, using 20% 2&#8208;hexanone and 1% mesoporous silica nanoparticles (carriers of mesoporous, CM), achieving 70% and 66% conversions of acacetin glucoside and galactoside, respectively. Further immobilization of the cyclized GTs onto CM via the anchor peptide liquid chromatography peak I (LCI) (Spy_BacGT/BarGT&#8208;3_LCI@CM) further enabled the system to reach more than 90% conversions of acacetin glycosides, retaining 90% conversions after 6&#8211;8 cycles. Moreover, this strategy was applied to GTs exhibiting substrate selectivity, achieving efficient nonselective catalysis. This study provides a simple and efficient immobilization strategy to broaden the applications of the Pickering emulsion system in enzymatic glycosylation.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Sensitized Activated Formation of Lophyl Radicals by Heptamethine Cyanines Enables Dry Film Photoresists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;intensity NIR radiation around 800&#160;nm enables the manufacture of dry film resists (DFRs) using a combination of hexa&#8208;arylbisimidazole (HABI) and N&#8208;phenyl imino acetic acid. The mechanism is based on activated electron transfer processes supported by the respective product analysis.








Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) sensitized generation of lophyl radicals (L&#183;) by heptamethine cyanine led to initiation of radical photopolymerization of multifunctional acrylates when different hexa&#8208;arylbisimidazoles (HABIs) and N&#8208;phenylglycine (NPG) operated as coinitiator. The latter functioned as donor. For a deeper understanding, heptamethine cyanines were used following a photoinduced electron transfer (PET). HABI derivatives with electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituents demonstrated that those with electron acceptors resulted in a higher photopolymerization efficiency of multifunctional acrylates. Tri&#8208;(propylene glycol) diacrylate (TPGDA) and tri&#8208;methylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) served as the monomers. Sensitizers (Sens) exposed with a high intense NIR&#8208;light source at 808 nm exhibiting a positive charge in the cyanine pattern significantly operate more efficiently for radical photopolymerization than a Sens without a positive charge. Differences in efficiency of PET can give an explanation for these differences. The heat generated by the cyanine's internal conversion from S1 to S0 additionally influenced the endothermic reaction between L&#183; and NPG. These systems worked in practical applications for dry film photoresists (DFRs), reported here for the first time.

         <title>Tailoring Molecular Diffusion in Core&#8208;Shell Zeolite Imidazolate Framework Composites Realizes Efficient Kinetic Separation of Xylene Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8211;shell construction strategy enables precise heterogeneous diffusion control, facilitating the kinetic separation of xylene isomers. The distinctive heterogeneous pore channels in the core&#8211;shell ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67 composite allow the shell layer to effectively exclude larger isomers while selectively screening PX. Simultaneously, the inner core provides rapid diffusion kinetics for PX, ensuring efficient separation.







Abstract
The separation of xylene isomers is a critical and energy&#8208;intensive process in the petrochemical industry, primarily due to their closely similar molecular structures and boiling points. In this work, we report the synthesis and application of a novel core&#8211;shell zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) composite, ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67, designed to significantly enhance the kinetic separation of xylene isomers through a synergistic &#8220;shell&#8208;gated diffusion and core&#8208;facilitated transport&#8221; strategy. The external ZIF&#8208;67 shell selectively restricts the diffusion of larger isomers (MX and OX), while the internal ZIF&#8208;65 core accelerates the diffusion of PX, thereby amplifying the diffusion differences among the isomers. This architecture yields remarkable improvements in both selectivity and diffusion rates, as demonstrated by vapor&#8208;phase adsorption studies and molecular dynamics simulations. The ZIF&#8208;65@ZIF&#8208;67 composite exhibits up to 12.5 times higher PX/OX selectivity in liquid&#8208;phase adsorption and 3.4 times higher dynamic selectivity in fixed&#8208;column breakthrough experiments compared to the individual ZIF components. Theoretical simulations further corroborate the heterogeneous diffusion control mechanism, revealing the time&#8208;dependent diffusion regulation within the core&#8211;shell architecture. This work underscores the great potential of core&#8211;shell MOF composites in optimizing molecular sieving processes for industrially significant separations and highlights a new route for enhancing kinetic separation efficiency in complex multicomponent systems.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Boosts Circularly Polarized Radioluminescence in Chiral Mn(II) Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a pair of Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers, R/S&#8208;1, were designed, exhibiting intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (gPL &gt;&#160;3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;3) and strong scintillation (light yields &gt;&#160;70&#160;000 photons/MeV). Their circularly polarized radioluminescence (CPRL) properties were evaluated using our home&#8208;built setup. By incorporating hydrogen bonds, another pair, R/S&#8208;2, achieved a nearly seven&#8208;fold increase in gPL and a nearly fifteen&#8208;fold enhancement in gRL. This study provides a new strategy for advancing chiral scintillators.








Abstract
Chiral scintillators combining scintillation and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) present a novel avenue for controlling light propagation and reducing optical crosstalk in conventional scintillators. However, quantitative evaluation of circularly polarized radioluminescence (CPRL) and strategies for enhancing performance under X&#8208;ray excitation remain underexplored. Herein, we conducted the designed synthesis of Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers, (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;(N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine)2MnBr4&#183;2Br&#8722; (R/S&#8208;1), which exhibit intense CPL with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of 94.4% (R&#8208;1) and 94.1% (S&#8208;1) and PL dissymmetry factors (gPL) of &#8722;3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 (R&#8208;1) and&#160;+&#160;3.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 (S&#8208;1). They demonstrate strong scintillation performance with record&#8208;breaking light yields of 70&#160;061 and 68&#160;514 photons/MeV in chiral scintillators. We pioneered quantitative evaluation of the CPRL of R/S&#8208;1, achieving radioluminescence (RL) dissymmetry factors (gRL) of &#8722;2.04&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and&#160;+&#160;2.55&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. By incorporating hydrogen bonds into the structures through rational ligand design to facilitate chiral transfer, Mn(II) hybrid enantiomers (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;(N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine)MnBr4 (R/S&#8208;2) achieve the gPL values of &#8722;2.56&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and&#160;+&#160;2.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 with nearly seven times higher than those of R/S&#8208;1. More inspiringly, the gRL value of R&#8208;2 increased to &#8722;2.96&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 with a 15 times increase relative to R&#8208;1, representing the highest CPRL in lead&#8208;free chiral scintillators. This work not only manifests a new design strategy for advancing chiral scintillators but also establishes a standard approach for evaluating CPRL properties.

&lt;sub&gt;RL&lt;/sub&gt; value of &lt;b&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Computational Screening of Small Molecular Crystals for Sustainable Piezoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a high&#8208;throughput computational screening of organic molecular crystals for piezoelectric applications. Using DFT calculations, the study identifies key organic materials with significant piezoelectric responses and introduces CrystalDFT, a comprehensive database for scalable analysis, providing a data&#8208;driven foundation for future material discovery in organic piezoelectrics. These sustainable materials can be used for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting applications.








Abstract
Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next&#8208;generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor&#8208;made solid&#8208;state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles and techniques such as cocrystallization, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterized by methods such as X&#8208;ray diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here, we present our database of small molecular crystals and their density functional theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring (unpoled) longitudinal piezoelectric response (d11/d22/d33). This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.

         <title>Propylene&#8208;Bridged Associative Bis(bipyridinium) Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Lifetime Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present two propylene&#8208;bridged bis(bipyridinium) compounds, M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV, as anolytes for aqueous organic redox flow batteries. These compounds undergo intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, resulting in Gibbs free energy change of less than &#8722;100&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, which mitigates degradation by forming Gibbs free energy wells. TMAP&#8208;bisV exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 66.5 Ah L&#8722;1 and demonstrates negligible capacity fade in a 1.5&#160;M e&#8722; cell. 








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) represent a potent technology in low&#8208;cost storage and grid&#8208;scale adoption of renewable electricity, whereas bipyridinium derivatives, the most extensively adopted anolyte, undergo diverse side reactions causing severe loss of battery lifetime. Here, we propose a strategy to promote the formation of intramolecular radical &#960; dimers of reduced bipyridinium electrolytes and stabilize the radical intermediates during charge and discharge, resulting in significant improvements in battery lifetime. Density functional theory calculations reveal that proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrolytes, M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV, demonstrate Gibbs free energy change of &#8722;101.49&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 and &#8722;103.90&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for the formation of radical &#960; dimers, as opposed to the less favored &#8722;14.36&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for methyl viologen. Electron paramagnetic resonance and UV&#8211;vis spectra studies confirmed the significantly facilitated intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV radicals. This translates to a more than one order of magnitude improvement in electrolyte stability for M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV in flow cells. Specifically, TMAP&#8208;bisV possesses a theoretical capacity of 66.5 Ah L&#8722;1 and exhibits negligible capacity fade at 1.5&#160;M e&#8722;, which represents a new record in this area. We believe the concept may open a promising avenue toward the design of capacity&#8208;dense and super&#8208;stable AORFB electrolytes.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Fluoride Dual&#8208;atom Synergistic Regulated Interface Coating Enables Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8722;fluoride dual&#8208;atom&#8208;regulated solid electrolyte interphase coating on Zn anodes (ZnBOF/Zn) is presented, which introduces a unique synergy between B&#8208;compound protective layers and zincophilic F atoms. This dual regulation not only ensures preferential Zn deposition along the (002) plane, thereby mitigating dendrite growth, but also suppresses side reactions and accelerates Zn2+ desolvation for enhanced electrochemical stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries provide promising opportunities for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries. Nevertheless, Zn anode encounters severe challenges, such as Zn dendrite formation, surface corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report a strategy to spontaneously construct a boron&#8722;fluoride dual&#8208;atom regulated SEI (ZnBOF), which involves the formation of a B&#8208;compound coating through an etching process followed by an in situ F substitution during the initial electrochemical cycling. The ZnBOF/Zn anode benefits preferential deposition of Zn2+ along the (002) plane without Zn dendrite, and the side reactions including by&#8208;product and HER are dramatically suppressed. A combination of characterization methods, such as X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, shows that the B&#8208;containing passivation layer facilitates the transport of Zn2+ and mitigates water&#8208;related side reactions, and the F atoms serve as zincophilic sites that enhance the transfer kinetics of Zn2+. As expected, the well&#8208;designed ZnBOF/Zn anode exhibits ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping for 5000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The assembled ZnBOF/Zn||MnO2 batteries show impressive cycling stability, remaining 96.2% of the initial capacity (234.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) after 1700 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Therefore, this work reveals a dual&#8208;atom synergistic regulated strategy to fabricate a robust SEI for Zn anode, which contributes to the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Simple &#8220;Directional Trimming&#8221; Strategy Engineered Platinum Atomic Clusters with Controllable Coordination Numbers for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the gardeners trimming branches and theoretical guidance, a &#8220;directional trimming&#8221; strategy is proposed and applied to obtain a series of atomic clusters catalysts with wide range of Cl coordination number (CN). Particularly, Pt/CB&#8208;90 (moderate Cl CN of 3.7) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 22.94&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and outstanding mass activity (25 times to commercial Pt/C). Additionally, the strategy helps us to establish the inverted volcano relationship between the CN and catalytic activity. This fundamental understanding of the role of CN in catalytic activity offers valuable guidance to promote performance in various catalytic reactions.








Abstract
The coordination number (CN) in atomic cluster (AC) catalysts endows their catalytic performance with flexible tunability. However, the quantitative relationship between the CN and catalytic activity of atomic cluster catalysts remains ambiguity. Herein, inspired by the gardeners trimming plants branches to obtain ornamental value shape, we propose a &#8220;directional trimming&#8221; strategy to obtain a series of AC catalysts with wide range of Cl CN and establish an inverted volcano curve to explain the effect of CN on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, Pt/CB&#8208;90 (moderate Cl CN of 3.7) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 22.94&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and outstanding mass activity (25 times to commercial Pt/C). This proposed synthesis strategy fully utilizes the precursor atoms and is widely applicable.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the gardeners trimming branches and theoretical guidance, a &#8220;directional trimming&#8221; strategy is proposed and applied to obtain a series of atomic clusters catalysts with wide range of Cl coordination number (CN). Particularly, Pt/CB-90 (moderate Cl CN of 3.7) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 22.94&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and outstanding mass activity (25 times to commercial Pt/C). Additionally, the strategy helps us to establish the inverted volcano relationship between the CN and catalytic activity. This fundamental understanding of the role of CN in catalytic activity offers valuable guidance to promote performance in various catalytic reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordination number (CN) in atomic cluster (AC) catalysts endows their catalytic performance with flexible tunability. However, the quantitative relationship between the CN and catalytic activity of atomic cluster catalysts remains ambiguity. Herein, inspired by the gardeners trimming plants branches to obtain ornamental value shape, we propose a &#8220;directional trimming&#8221; strategy to obtain a series of AC catalysts with wide range of Cl CN and establish an inverted volcano curve to explain the effect of CN on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, Pt/CB-90 (moderate Cl CN of 3.7) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 22.94&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and outstanding mass activity (25 times to commercial Pt/C). This proposed synthesis strategy fully utilizes the precursor atoms and is widely applicable. The reaction liquid can be reused up to 20 times to obtain 1130&#160;mg catalysts without introducing any other chemicals. Additionally, theoretical calculations highlight the appropriate Cl CN benefits the HER on Pt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ACs. This fundamental understanding of the role of CN in catalytic activity offers valuable guidance to promote performance in various catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Proteomics Reveals Human Off&#8208;Targets of Fluoroquinolone Induced Mitochondrial Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic overview of the adverse effects of Ciprofloxacin related to mitochondrial toxicity. AIFM1 plays a role in the MIA40&#8208;mediated import into the IMS and oxidative folding of nuclear&#8208;encoded proteins, including ETC complexes I and IV subunits. Ciprofloxacin disrupts the IMS import machinery, impairing ETC function. Dysfunction, especially of complex I, leads to a reduction in the NAD+/NADH ratio. This alteration in redox homeostasis, coupled with a shortage of NAD+, a crucial cofactor for the TCA cycle, can trigger metabolic reprogramming involving IDH2.







Abstract
Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are an important class of potent broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotics. However, their general use is more and more limited by adverse side effects. While general mechanisms for the fluoroquinolone&#8208;associated disability (FQAD) have been identified, the underlying molecular targets of toxicity remain elusive. In this study, focusing on the most commonly prescribed FQs Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin, whole proteome analyses revealed prominent mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells, specifically of the complexes I and IV of the electron transport chain (ETC). Furthermore, global untargeted chemo&#8208;proteomic methodologies such as photo&#8208;affinity profiling with FQ&#8208;derived probes, as well as derivatization&#8208;free thermal proteome profiling, were applied to elucidate human protein off&#8208;targets of FQs in living cells. Accordingly, the interactions of FQs with mitochondrial AIFM1 and IDH2 have been identified and biochemically validated for their contribution to mitochondrial dysfunction. Of note, the FQ induced ETC dysfunction via AIFM1 activates the reverse carboxylation pathway of IDH2 for rescue, however, its simultaneous inhibition further enhances mitochondrial toxicity. This off&#8208;target discovery study provides unique insights into FQ toxicity enabling the utilization of identified molecular principles for the design of a safer FQ generation.

         <title>A Crystalline Polymer Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered crystalline polymer (PTABQ) was designed as a cathode for SOBs. Benefiting from the crystalline structure with one&#8208;dimensional O&#8208;channels and highly conjugated backbone, PTABQ features high electronic conductivity and fast ion diffusion ability. The as&#8208;prepared PTABQ cathode displays a discharge capacity of 380 mAh g&#8722;1 and nearly 90% capacity retention after ultra&#8208;long 2800 cycles at 3 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;organic batteries (SOBs) are widely recognized as a rising star in large&#8208;scale energy storage technology because of their abundant resources, high energy density, and environmental friendliness. However, the poor cyclability and rate performance due to high solubility and poor conductivity with organic electrode materials limit their practical applications. Here, we constructed a new crystalline polymer, poly(tetraaminobenzoquione) (PTABQ), featuring a layered structure with a conjugated backbone and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Benefiting from the crystalline structure with one&#8208;dimensional O&#8208;channels and highly conjugated backbone, PTABQ shows high electronic conductivity (10&#8722;7 S cm&#8722;1) and fast ion diffusion ability (&#8764;10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1). PTABQ displays a discharge capacity of 380 mAh g&#8722;1 with an average voltage of 2.0&#160;V and nearly 90% capacity retention after ultra&#8208;long 2800 cycles at 3 A g&#8722;1 (&#8764;8 C), which is superior to the reported organic cathode materials. It also exhibits an impressive rate performance of 290 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 A g&#8722;1 (&#8764;20 C). Our work highlights the importance of constructing the crystal structure for effective utilization of active sites and fast ion diffusion, which sheds light on the development of an efficient and sustainable energy storage system.

         <title>Mannich&#8208;Type Polymers: A Versatile Platform for Water&#8208;Degradable, Malleable, and Environmentally Responsive Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address critical environmental challenges caused by current recycling strategies of polymer wastes, our work presents water&#8208;degradable, malleable, environmentally responsive, and low&#8208;cost polymer networks synthesized via a Mannich&#8208;type reaction, offering a novel, scalable, and sustainable pathway for the next&#8208;generation polymers. 








Abstract
Polymer waste poses a significant environmental challenge, with current recycling strategies often hindered by inefficient waste collection systems, high production costs, and limited material recyclability. While extensive efforts have been directed toward upcycling or degrading commercial polymers, as well as developing sustainable alternatives, many approaches remain constrained by their reliance on harsh conditions, specialized catalysts, or complex processing methods. In this study, we present a novel strategy to address the challenges by developing mechanically robust polymer networks that are readily degradable in water within 30 days. Our approach leverages a guanidine&#8208;based Mannich&#8208;type reaction utilizing three low&#8208;cost starting materials&#8212;guanidine hydrochloride, aldehyde, and diamine&#8212;under mild conditions. Unlike traditional thermosets, which are often difficult to recycle, our polymer networks exhibit exceptional processability, enabling the fabrication of various forms, and demonstrate responsiveness to moisture. These properties, coupled with degradability, make them viable candidates for diverse applications. By introducing a scalable and sustainable pathway for designing next&#8208;generation recyclable polymers, our work advances the field of dynamic covalent chemistry and presents a novel class of sustainable polymer networks with significant potential for reducing environmental impact.

         <title>Unraveling the Cause of Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Formation: Disparities in Metal Nanoparticle Anchoring Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt atoms strongly prefer to anchor to oxygen vacancies (Ov) rather than hydroxyl sites on the anatase TiO2 support. Instead, Pd atoms lack this preference for Ov and occupy more hydroxyl sites. Ultimately, the high concentration of residual Ov on the support causes Pd NPs to be in a more severe encapsulation state in the high&#8208;temperature hydrogen environment.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) can be normally induced by the surface free energy differences between metal nanoparticles and supports. To gain deeper insights into the effect of SMSI on heterogeneous catalysis, we use prototype Pt, Pd/TiO2(anatase) systems to demonstrate different reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction activity changes, especially with increasing the metal nanoparticle (NP) loading. Our experiments show that the conventional surface&#8208;free&#8208;energy change law regarding the incremental NP size is no longer applicable to these systems due to the overlook of the change of support properties owing to the disparities of the metal anchoring mechanisms. Both experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that Pt atoms strongly favor anchoring on the oxygen vacancies (Ov) over the OH&#8208;sites on the anatase TiO2 support. In contrast, Pd atoms lack such Ov&#8208;site preference compared to Pt atoms, thereby leaving higher content of Ov on the support than the Pt counterpart. Moreover, high density of residual Ov on the support can cause the Pd NPs to be in higher degree of contact with the support, either in NP&#8208;encapsulation state (experiment) or NP&#8208;spreading state (simulation). The enhanced CO2 conversion of Pt/TiO2A is attributed to the synergistic effect of Ov and hydrogen spillover from Pt sites.

         <title>Selective Hydrogenolysis of Biomass&#8208;Derived Aromatic Alcohols over 2D&#8208;Mo2COx MXene by a Reversible Redox&#8208;Relay Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;Mo2COx with strong CH2&#8722;OH affinity and H2 activation ability shows a selective hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural to 5&#8208;methyl furfural at a mild reaction temperature. The catalyst shows a great catalytic stability and broad universality for various furfuryl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, and hydroxycyclopentenone substrates.







Abstract
Selective CH2&#8722;OH hydrogenolysis of biomass&#8208;derived aromatic alcohols to produce methyl aromatics is crucial for synthesizing sustainable fuels and chemicals; yet traditional metal&#8211;acid bifunctional catalysis possesses significant challenges owing to its complex reaction network. Herein, a 2D&#8208;Mo2COx MXene was fabricated, demonstrating an efficient hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural into 5&#8208;methyl furfural, achieving an impressive yield (99.5&#8201;%) at the mild reaction temperature of 90&#8201;&#176;C. Catalytic mechanism investigations reveal that 2D&#8208;Mo2COx facilitate the activation and cleavage of the CH2&#8722;OH bond through a redox mechanism, driven by the strong CH2&#8722;OH affinity of the Mo&#8211;Mo metallic plane. In the absence of H2, hydrogen from O&#8722;H group is the source for methyl formation from CH2&#8722;OH. Under a H2 atmosphere, H2 is activated to remove residual oxygen species, boosting selective hydrogenolysis while suppressing furan and CH=O hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited broad universality for synthesizing methyl aromatics from various furfuryl alcohols, benzyl alcohols, and hydroxycyclopentenones. This study presents a novel redox&#8208;relay mechanism in advanced MXene catalysis, offering a straightforward hydrogenolysis pathway for challenging substrates.

         <title>Mechanism Switch Between Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover and Radical Buffering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical buffering scenario, which features the reversible radical dissociation from alkyl chromium(III) followed by the metal&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;coupled (MCC) radical addition to form the C&#9472;C bond, is established for Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl alkylation. This new radical bonding model provides an orthogonal avenue to radical&#8208;polar crossover for the design of radical coupling reactions.








Abstract
Radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) is a classic concept that bridges one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron chemistry. It has been widely used in Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl addition reactions to clarify the formation of alkyl chromium(III) intermediate and subsequent carbonyl insertion. Herein, we proposed an orthogonal bonding model, the radical buffering scenario, for Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl alkylation. This radical bonding model features the radical dissociation from the alkyl chromium(III) complex followed by the Cr(II)&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;coupled radical addition to form the C&#9472;C bond. The mechanism switch between the radical and polar bonding models is affected by the radical stability, radical nucleophilicity, radical size, and the presence of an &#945;&#8208;heteroatom or &#945;&#8211;&#960; bond. The collaborative computational and experimental studies have verified the reliability of the radical mechanism. More importantly, we demonstrated that this radical buffering scenario possesses a different stereoselectivity control model from that in the RPC scenario. A general enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity control model derived from the multiple ligand&#8208;radical interactions is thus established for CrCl2/bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric radical addition.

         <title>Leveraging Polaron Effect for Solar&#8208;Driven Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation in Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface electron polaron&#8208;modified Cu1&#8211;Ov/TiO2 with optimized electron transfer performance was formed. Under illumination, with the help of photogenerated electrons and polaron hopping, a record photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reaction rate constant was reached through an efficient radical&#8208;dominated pathway, which realized a balance between cost and efficiency, favorable for promising PMS applications.








Abstract
Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) represents a promising advanced oxidation technique for the treatment of refractory pollutants; however, its application is limited by high costs resulting from excessive usage due to low activation efficiency. In this study, we formulated a sunlight&#8208;driven Cu1&#8211;Ov/TiO2 catalyst with surface electron polaron sites to activate PMS for the degradation of contaminants, achieving a record reaction rate of k&#160;=&#160;2.998&#160;min&#8722;1 even with a low PMS dosage of 0.3&#160;mM. The adsorption process and electron transfer kinetics were significantly enhanced with surface polaron sites in Cu1&#8211;Ov/TiO2, which facilitated the activation of PMS and increased the reaction rate constant k by 29.1 times compared with that of TiO2/PMS under illumination. Additionally, we verified that light irradiation promotes transfer from the non&#8208;free&#8208;radical pathway to the efficient free&#8208;radical pathway in mechanism of PMS activation. Our designed sunlight&#8208;driven flow&#8208;through PMS setup achieves a removal rate exceeding 90% for 7 days of outdoor operation at 3.2&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, the feasibility of which is further proven in regions around the world by analysis of solar intensity. This study presents a demonstration of economical PMS application in water purification worldwide, with an estimated cost of 0.135&#160;$&#160;m&#8722;3.

         <title>Sustainability&#8208;Inspired Upcycling of Organophosphorus Pollutants into Phosphatic Fertilizer in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First report of organophosphorus pollutants selective degradation, via the synergistic effect of peroxymonosulfate and sodium percarbonate, into phosphates that are continually converted into phosphatic fertilizer by struvite precipitation on a continuous&#8208;flow reactor.








Abstract
With the increasing requirement for phosphorus resources and their shortage in nature, cyclic utilization of organophosphorus pollutants into phosphatic fertilizer might offer a sustainable approach to achieve the recycling of phosphorus. Herein, we first report the selective degradation of organophosphorus pollutants, via the synergistic effect of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and sodium percarbonate (SPC), into phosphates (o&#8208;PO43&#8722;), which are continually converted into phosphatic fertilizer by struvite precipitation on the continuous&#8208;flow reactor. Quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results, electrochemical analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggest that the transfer of electrons from SPC to PMS results in the synthesis of catalytically active species (i.e., &#183;OH, &#183;O2&#8722;, 1O2, and CO3&#183;&#8722;) for hydroxyethylidene&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphosphonicacid (HEDP) degradation. For the real glyphosate wastewater, the PMS/SPC system exhibits excellent catalytic activity with 69.20% decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 37.80% decrease in the total organic carbon (TOC) after 90&#160;min. Indeed, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirms that glyphosate is completely degraded in 90&#160;min with the formation of 271.93&#160;&#181;mol/L of o&#8208;PO43&#8722;, which is further converted into phosphatic fertilizer by the precipitation of struvite with 87.20% yield on continuous&#8208;flow reactor. Finally, biotoxicity of glyphosate to zebrafish and wheat seeds are significantly deceased after treatment of PMS/SPC system by zebrafish toxicology assays and germination tests of wheat seeds.

Quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results, electrochemical analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggest that the transfer of electrons from SPC to PMS results in the synthesis of catalytically active species (i.e., &#183;OH, &#183;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) for hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonicacid (HEDP) degradation. For the real glyphosate wastewater, the PMS/SPC system exhibits excellent catalytic activity with 69.20% decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 37.80% decrease in the total organic carbon (TOC) after 90&#160;min. Indeed, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirms that glyphosate is completely degraded in 90&#160;min with the formation of 271.93&#160;&#181;mol/L of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which is further converted into phosphatic fertilizer by the precipitation of struvite with 87.20% yield on continuous-flow reactor. Finally, biotoxicity of glyphosate to zebrafish and wheat seeds are significantly deceased after treatment of PMS/SPC system by zebrafish toxicology assays and germination tests of wheat seeds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Cobalt Centers Realized by Rational p&#9472;&#960; Conjugation Regulation for High&#8208;Performance Li&#9472;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the correlation between p&#9472;&#960; conjugation strength and LUMO energy level, we designed a unique coordination environment that can result in an electron&#8208;deficient state at the Co sites (CNT@f&#8208;CoNC). Compared to the commonly reported porphyrin&#8208;like Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (CNT@CoSA), the chemisorption and catalytic activity of the CNT@f&#8208;CoNC towards lithium polysulfides are significantly enhanced, due to the Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. With the CNT@f&#8208;CoNC electrode, high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries are successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Rational design of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can enhance their catalytic activity, which is of great significance for high&#8208;loading and lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries. Inspired by the Lewis acid&#8211;base theory, we design a unique coordination environment for constructing electron&#8208;deficient Co SACs on carbon nanotubes (named as CNT@f&#8208;CoNC), which function as a Lewis acid, to enhance the chemisorption and catalytic activity towards polysulfides (Lewis base). Compared with porphyrin&#8208;like Co SACs, electron&#8208;deficient Co SACs (Lewis acid) exhibit much stronger binding affinity towards polysulfides (Lewis base) and a significantly lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the sulfur reduction reaction. As expected, even with a high sulfur loading (6.9&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) and lean electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio (4.0&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1), the areal capacity still reaches 7.7&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a 1.6&#160;Ah&#8208;class pouch cell is successfully assembled under the harsh conditions and delivers an energy density of 422&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into enhancing the electrochemical performance of Li&#9472;S batteries by modulating the local electronic density of metal sites through the rational design of the coordination environment.

         <title>A Triatomic Cobalt Catalyst for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an ultrafast printing technique, we have successfully embedded triatomic cobalt cluster precursors into graphene nanosheets, resulting in a triatomic Co3&#8208;NG catalyst with excellent bifunctional OER/ORR activity. The triangular pyramidal active sites effectively regulate the d&#8208;band center and electronic structure and promote the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates.








Abstract
The advancement of rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries significantly depends on bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts to provide outstanding oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) performance. However, it is still challenging to design electrocatalysts with excellent bifunctional activity and stability. Here, we adopt an ultrafast printing method to efficiently embed a triatom cobalt complex precursor onto graphene nanosheets to obtain a triatomic catalyst (Co3&#8208;NG), exhibiting a durable and excellent bifunctional catalyst in the electrocatalytic ORR (Ehalf&#8208;wave&#160;=&#160;0.903&#8201;V) and OER (Ej&#160;=&#160;10&#160;=&#160;1.596&#8201;V). The Co3&#8208;NG&#8208;assembled zinc&#8211;air battery can output a maximum power density of 189.0&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 330&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and can be charged and discharged over 3000 cycles, significantly outperforming the Pt/C&#160;+&#160;RuO2 benchmark (146.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 360 cycles) under testing conditions of 25 &#176;C. In situ XAS analysis and theoretical calculations disclose that Co3ON6 is the catalytic site for bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysis. The constructed triangular pyramidal active sites effectively regulate the d&#8208;band center and electronic configuration and promote the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates. This work uncovers that the geometry and electronic structure of triatomic active centers play a key role in improving bifunctional ORR/OER performance for electrochemical energy applications.

         <title>Metalized Porphyrin&#8208;Based COFs for Conductive Porous Layers in Perovskite Solar Cells to Enhance Electron Injection, Defect Passivation, and Lead&#8208;Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2+&#8208;loaded metalized porphyrin&#8208;based COF (Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF) enhances electron transport and perovskite film quality, leading to improved carrier extraction and defect passivation, achieving an efficiency of 25.41% and maintaining excellent stability under various environments.








Abstract
In perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the introduction of an intermediate layer to bridge the transport and photoactive layers has become a key strategy for enhancing carrier extraction efficiency. However, traditional approaches are often limited by the seesaw effect, making it challenging to achieve an optimal balance between electron transport and defect passivation. In this study, we employed a Cu2+&#8208;loaded metalized porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF) as a conductive porous layer (CPL) at the perovskite bottom interface. Experimental results showed that a Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF coverage of 19% significantly enhanced electron transport and effectively suppressed long&#8208;distance electron diffusion. Moreover, the carefully designed Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF provided abundant active sites, which improved the film&#8208;forming quality of the perovskite layer, thereby facilitating the beneficial synergy of electron injection and defect passivation. The n&#8208;i&#8208;p type devices achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41% (0.09&#160;cm2) and 21.99% (1.01&#160;cm2). Using Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF to stabilize the perovskite crystal structure, the unencapsulated devices retained over 81% of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h. Additionally, Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF effectively chelated lead ions and thus enhanced the environmental sustainability of PSCs.

         <title>Imino&#8208;Pyrrole Zn(II) Complexes for the Rapid and Selective Chemical Recycling of Commodity Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three imino&#8208;pyrrole zinc (II) catalysts were prepared and applied to the chemical recycling of PLA, PET, and BPA&#8208;PC. Rapid PLA degradation was accomplished in solution and under solvent&#8208;free conditions, the latter giving full conversion at relatively mild temperatures after 11 min. Mixed plastic feedstock experiments were carried out, including the first example of sequential PLA/BPA&#8208;PC methanolysis using a single catalyst, with selectivity controlled by temperature.








Abstract
Three imino&#8208;pyrrole zinc complexes were prepared and applied to the rapid degradation of polylactic acid (PLA) and the depolymerization of bisphenol A polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PLA alcoholysis proceeded rapidly at a range of conditions, including reflux in air. Remarkable activity was demonstrated for the solvent&#8208;free methanolysis of PLA at mild conditions with full conversion reached in 11 min at 80&#160;&#176;C. Various conditions were investigated including a range of PLA sources and, importantly, catalyst recycling was demonstrated. The methanolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and the glycolysis of PET were achieved, the latter giving full conversion after 1.5 h for all catalysts. The chemical recycling of mixed plastic feedstocks was investigated, including the selective and sequential degradation of a PLA/BPA&#8208;PC mixture with a single catalyst and solvent.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrotrifluoromethoxylation of Aromatic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of optically pure benzyl trifluoromethoxy (OCF3) compounds remains a challenging task. Here, we present the first enantioselective intermolecular hydrotrifluoromethoxylation reaction between aromatic alkenes and TFMS, catalyzed by chiral salen&#8208;Co complexes. This approach efficiently yields a variety of chiral benzylic&#160;trifluoromethoxy compounds with 75%&#8211;99% ee.








Abstract
The construction of optically pure benzyl trifluoromethoxy (OCF3) compounds continues to present challenges due to limited enantioselectivity&#8208;control or the necessity for OCF3&#8208;containing substrates in the only two previous reports. Herein, we have developed a salen&#8208;Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrotrifluoromethoxylation reaction involving aromatic alkenes and trifluoromethyl arylsulfonate (TFMS). This method effectively produces a range of chiral benzyl trifluoromethoxy compounds with enantiomeric excesses ranging from 75% to 99%.

         <title>High Performance Electron Acceptors Containing Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecular platform characteristic of multiple transition metals (CH&#9472;Zn, CH&#9472;Ni, CH&#9472;Pt) on conjugated backbones, is first established by fusing porphyrin core with the widely used S,N&#8208;heteroacene. 








Abstract
A novel molecular platform characteristic of multiple transition metals (CH&#9472;Zn, CH&#9472;Ni, CH&#9472;Pt) on conjugated backbones is first established as high&#8208;performance electron acceptors. The CH&#9472;Pt&#8208;based ternary organic photovoltaics render an excellent power conversion efficiency surpassing 20%, more importantly, the unexplored dependency of central metals on intrinsic physicochemical properties of acceptors, nanoscale morphologies of donor/acceptor blends and final photovoltaic outcomes is fully disclosed. By demonstrating such a rare case of metal&#8208;containing acceptor, our work provides insight into whether metal complexes can serve as the building blocks of high&#8208;performance acceptors and gives guidance to rational design of metal&#8208;containing acceptors.

         <title>Reaction of Nitrate Radicals and DMPO in Non&#8208;Aqueous Media: A Novel Detection Tool to Highlight the Nitrate Radical Role in Photocatalytic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin trapping agent DMPO reacts with nitrate radicals in non&#8208;aqueous environment producing its oxidized adduct DMPOX. The peculiar EPR spectral features of DMPOX can be considered fingerprint of the presence of nitrate radicals. Results support in a more direct way the proposed generation and reactivity of nitrate radicals in heterogeneous photocatalysis.








Abstract
The reaction of DMPO as the spin trapping agent with nitrate radicals photocatalytically generated results in the formation of DMPOX showing a highly specific EPR spectrum. The method can be used as a semi&#8208;quantitative and convenient way to detect nitrate radicals in non&#8208;aqueous solutions/suspensions, which was never achieved up to now through EPR spectroscopy. Results support in a more direct way the proposed generation and reactivity of nitrate radicals in photocatalytic media and open a new chapter in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Induced Fast Li&#8208;Ion Channels in Ionic Plastic Crystal Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed the structural design principles of ionic plastic crystals for solid&#8208;state electrolytes and prepared an ionic plastic crystal electrolyte with low self&#8208;mobility and high ionic conductivity. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries with ionic plastic crystal electrolyte achieved stable cycling in a wide temperature range (0&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C). 








Abstract
The practical use of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is hindered by the intractable electrolyte/electrode interfacial resistance and discontinuous ion transport networks within electrodes. Ionic plastic crystals offer a potential solution to these challenges due to their melt&#8208;permeable properties to the electrodes. However, their limited ionic conductivity restricts their application. Here, we propose a design principle for solid&#8208;state electrolytes based on an electric field&#8208;induced strategy by using ionic plastic crystals with low self&#8208;migrating and high conductivity toward target ions. Through the external potential difference, an ordered internal electric field is generated within the ionic plastic crystal&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (IPCEs), which mitigates the coordination limitations of anions on target ions to facilitate rapid ion conduction. The prepared IPCE demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.08&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and a Li+ transfer number (0.77), enabling the application of ASSBs over a wide temperature range (from 0 to 60&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the assembled Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 ASSBs exhibit stable cycling, maintaining 97.5% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a fresh perspective on the practical application of ASSBs, highlighting the potential of IPCEs in enhancing battery performance.

         <title>Construction of Local&#8208;Ion Trap in Phase&#8208;Reversed Mixed Matrix COF Membranes for Ultrahigh Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the unprecedented local&#8208;ion trap was constructed by the development of a type of phase&#8208;reversed mixed matrix COF (PRCOF) membrane. Fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironments of local&#8208;ion trap affords moderate binding force, additional repulsion force, and assisted dehydration toward Li+, rendering the ultrahigh Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of PRCOF membranes in binary mixture. 








Abstract
Artificial molecular/ion traps afford grand potential in membrane&#8208;based separation processes. However, the existing trap&#8208;based architectures often confer over&#8208;strong binding forces, which severely impede the release of bound solutes during their transmembrane diffusion processes. Herein, we propose an unprecedented local&#8208;ion trap bearing moderate binding force and additional repulsion force in a type of phase&#8208;reversed mixed matrix covalent organic framework (PRCOF) membrane. By implementing COF as a continuous phase and polymer as a dispersed phase at the molecular level, the local&#8208;ion trap is formed in the COF channels equipped with free amino groups from polyethyleneimine (PEI). This unique local&#8208;ion trap built by electronegative COF nano&#8208;domains and electropositive PEI nano&#8208;domains offers appropriate interaction toward Li+, which allows the precise recognition and rapid transport of Li+ in the membrane channels. By tuning the microenvironments of local&#8208;ion trap, the optimum PRCOF&#8208;1 membrane exhibits considerably high actual selectivity of 190 along with a rapid Li+ permeation rate of 0.262&#160;mol h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 in dealing with a Li+/Mg2+ binary mixture. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into the design of high&#8208;performance membranes with appropriate chemical interactions.

         <title>Stereochemistry at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level: From Monitoring to Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines major advances in stereochemistry, emphasizing real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule isomerization tracking via scanning probe microscopies and molecular junctions, alongside dynamic control strategies using light, electricity, and force. It explores the chirality from detection to manipulation, highlights nanotechnology&#8208;integrated molecular devices, and predicts critical challenges that bridge basic research with practical applications.








Abstract
Traditional stereochemistry analysis is crucial for understanding the molecular behavior, but relies on measurements that encompass multiple molecules and obscure individual molecular dynamics. Single&#8208;molecule techniques enable real&#8208;time tracking of stereochemical transformations. These techniques include electrical methods (such as scanning probe microscopy, single&#8208;molecule junction techniques, and nanopore technology) and non&#8208;electrical approaches (such as circular dichroism spectroscopy and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy). This review highlights recent advances in monitoring and regulation of stereochemical properties at the single&#8208;molecule level. Techniques that bridge macroscopic observations with molecular&#8208;scale dynamics are emphasized. Key isomerization phenomena (constitutional, configurational, and conformational isomerizations) are explored to demonstrate how light, electric field, and mechanical force regulate molecular states. The use of chiral molecules in optical tweezers, chiral&#8208;modified scanning tunneling microscopies, and graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule junctions to leverage the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect for enantiomer discrimination and manipulation is highlighted. Despite progress in this field, challenges persist in resolving ultrafast isomerization pathways, understanding chiral origin mechanisms, and integrating single&#8208;molecule devices. Emerging strategies combining multimodal stimuli, machine learning, and nanofabrication are promising for advancing stereochemical research and applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This work underscores the transformative potential of single&#8208;molecule techniques in unveiling fundamental chemical dynamics and designing functional molecular systems.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Oxindole Photochromic Dyads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photochromic azobenzene&#8208;oxindole dyad is reported. The combination of the two switches promotes drastic molecular geometry changes and allows for precise NMR quantification. This enables the study of the photokinetic behavior under different irradiation conditions and the discovery of a unique photokinetic relationship between the two photoswitches.








Abstract
Manipulation of molecular geometry using photoresponsive units is a powerful tool in supramolecular chemistry, smart materials, and photopharmacology. Current synthetic chemistry offers many responsive molecules that perform such a task. However, the incorporation of various photoresponsive units in a single molecule to achieve several geometrical changes remains scarce, particularly when they are in close proximity. The development of such systems is limited by challenges arising from selectively addressing the photoresponsive moieties and the analysis of complex mixtures. Here, we overcome these challenges by constructing a novel hetero&#8208;photochromic azobenzene&#8208;oxindole dyad (AOD). Both chromophores can be addressed and quantified in solution by in situ NMR irradiation analysis. Additionally, this method allows us to unravel the intricate photokinetic relationships between the two chromophores, leading to the observation of an unprecedented molecular motion: an azobenzene E&#160;&#8594;&#160;Z&#160;&#8594;&#160;E isomerization at a single wavelength due to the oxindole influence. By functionalizing the azobenzene ring, we showed that the responsiveness of the system is maintained in seven distinct AODs. Overall, the photochromic dyad offers dramatic geometrical changes over its four isomers, making it a useful tool for further applications in which such behavior is desired, such as host&#8208;guest systems, responsive materials, photopharmacology, and molecular machines.

         <title>Substituent Modulation of Contorted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene&#8208;Based Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Capacitor</title>

         <dc:description>
Three c&#8208;MOFs with twisted significant &#960;&#8208;system conformation were designed and synthesized, the crystallinity, conductivity, and pore environment of which can be tuned by halogen substitution. The F&#8208;substituted FHBCOH&#8208;Cu demonstrates superior crystallinity and conductive properties exhibiting a record&#8208;breaking specific capacitance of 943&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at a rate of 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) exhibiting graphite&#8208;like van der Waals stacked layers have been recognized as a new type of crystalline conductive materials and have shown rapid progress in the last decade. However, the purposive design and modulation of their conductive properties and related application performance remains a challenge. Herein, we present a new type of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with contorted conformation and substituent&#8208;modulated structures for highperformance of the capacitor. Octahydroxy&#8208;hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;benzocoronene (HBCOH) with a contorted graphene nanosheet core is designed and synthesized as the ligand. The F&#8208;substituted 2D c&#8208;MOF FHBCOH&#8208;Cu demonstrates superior crystallinity and conductive properties exhibiting a record&#8208;breaking specific capacitance of 943&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at a rate of 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The improved crystallinity, enhanced conductivity, and pore environment control enabled by halogen substitution, combined with the contorted conformation synergistically accomplish high performance of 2D c&#8208;MOFs as electrode materials in supercapacitors. This study introduces a novel molecular design strategy for the construction of 2D c&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based high&#8208;performance energy storage materials.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Driven Electrochromic Materials&#8208;Based Nanomotor for H2S&#8208;Controlled Drug Release in Synergistic Cancer Chemotherapy Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomotor efficiently target and penetrate tumors deeply through &#945;v&#946;3 integrin&#8208;mediated delivery, chemotactic behavior of chemoattractant HS&#8722; and local thermal gradient under the 780&#160;nm laser irradiation, achieving HS&#8722;&#8208;induced release of anticancer drug (OXA) to enhance synergistic chemotherapy and immunotherapy for tumors.








Abstract
Nanomotors hold tremendous potential for drug delivery. However, current nanomotors face limitations that compromise efficiency of drug utilization, including the use of inorganic materials with suboptimal soft interface and biocompatibility, uncontrollable drug release, insufficient directional control, and slow movement speeds. Herein, we present a novel near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven porous unsymmetric nanomotor with ultrafast motion, which utilizes hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;responsive cationic organic &#960;&#8208;electron structure&#8208;based electrochromic material (F12+) for the payload and controlled release of anionic anticancer drugs, enabling synergistic cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. We demonstrate that the nanomotor can precisely target tumors driven by thermophoresis, tumor&#8208;targeting peptide (RGD), and H2S (highly expressed in tumors and acted as chemoattractants), which induces chemotactic behavior to guide nanomotors into tumors. Once in the tumors, the cationic F12+ is reduced to the diene F2 upon reaction with H2S, activating the nanomotor's NIR fluorescence for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery and release in vivo. Upon exposure to H2S, the nanomotor undergoes disassembly due to the disruption of electrostatic interactions between the anionic anticancer drugs and the cationic F12+, leading to the precise and controlled drug release, ensuring uniform distribution across the tumor. This innovative strategy would open avenues for delivering mRNA vaccines or other anionic drugs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Optical Anisotropy with UV Transmission Achieved by Rational Arrangement of Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid birefringent material with large optical anisotropy has been prepared by employing the strategy of appropriately aligned extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups.








Abstract
Birefringent material serves as a cornerstone in photonic applications, including optical communications, polarization control, and laser technologies. The development of birefringent materials with large birefringence (&#916;n &gt;&#160;0.3) and short ultraviolet (UV) cut&#8208;off edge (&#955;cut&#8208;off edge &lt;&#160;400&#160;nm) remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that properly aligned expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups provide a solution to balance the birefringence and UV transmittance. We report a new birefringent material, Li3(C9N13)&#183;6H2O (LCN), in which the Li atoms and water molecules act as linkers to connect the birefringence&#8208;active group [C9N13]. This crystal material exhibits a giant optical anisotropy (&#916;nexp&#160;=&#160;1.031 @ 546&#160;nm), which is one of the highest among bulk crystal materials known to date. In addition, LCN shows a band gap of 3.62&#160;eV, indicating its applicability in the UV optical range. Owing to favorable Li cation linkers and hydrogen bonding, the [C9N13] groups achieve a perfectly coplanar arrangement, thereby maximizing the optical anisotropy. This work offers a novel strategy for the rational design of advanced birefringent materials.

&lt;p&gt;Birefringent material serves as a cornerstone in photonic applications, including optical communications, polarization control, and laser technologies. The development of birefringent materials with large birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;&#160;0.3) and short ultraviolet (UV) cut-off edge (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cut-off edge&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt;&#160;400&#160;nm) remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that properly aligned expanded &#960;-conjugated groups provide a solution to balance the birefringence and UV transmittance. We report a new birefringent material, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;)&#183;6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;LCN&lt;/b&gt;), in which the Li atoms and water molecules act as linkers to connect the birefringence-active group [C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;]. This crystal material exhibits a giant optical anisotropy (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;1.031 @ 546&#160;nm), which is one of the highest among bulk crystal materials known to date. In addition, &lt;b&gt;LCN&lt;/b&gt; shows a band gap of 3.62&#160;eV, indicating its applicability in the UV optical range. Owing to favorable Li cation linkers and hydrogen bonding, the [C&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;] groups achieve a perfectly coplanar arrangement, thereby maximizing the optical anisotropy. This work offers a novel strategy for the rational design of advanced birefringent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stable Sn&#9472;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Phenol&#8208;Functionalized Hole Transporting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stability is the key challenge for Sn&#9472;Pb perovskites. This work tackles the critical stability issue by introducing phenol hydroxylation in the hole transporting material (HTM). The phenol group enhances oxidation resistance and regulates crystallization kinetics, while fluorine improves energy alignment. This strategy boosts device stability by 40 times and achieves a 23.61% power conversion efficiency (PCE), offering a universal approach for advancing Sn&#9472;based perovskites.








Abstract
Sn&#9472;Pb perovskites, a most promising low bandgap semiconductor for multi&#8208;junction solar cells, are often limited by instability due to the susceptibility of Sn2+ to oxidation. Inspired by the antioxidative properties of polyphenolic compounds, we introduce the reductive phenol group and strong electronegative fluorine into an organic conjugated structure and design a multi&#8208;functional polymer with fluorine and phenol units (PF&#9472;OH). The design of PF&#9472;OH allows the effective rise in the energy barrier of Sn2+ oxidation, leading to a significant enhancement in the stability of Sn&#9472;Pb perovskite devices from 200 to 8000 h&#8212;an improvement of around 100 times. Additionally, the strong binding energy between Sn2+ and the phenol in PF&#9472;OH critically influences Sn&#9472;Pb perovskite's crystallization and grain growth, resulting in perovskite films with fewer pinholes at the buried interface and extended carrier lifetimes. This enhancement not only boosts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 23.61%, but also significantly improves the operational stability of the devices. Ultimately, this design strategy has been proven universal through the phenolization of a series of molecules, marking a milestone in enhancing the stability of Sn&#9472;Pb perovskites.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Ni@TiN/CNT Heterostructure with Tandem Catalysis for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni@TiN/CNT heterostructure is constructed by combining a molten salt etching strategy and CVD. The residual zero&#8208;dimension Ni NPs are cleverly used as the active site of NO2RR and the catalyst for CNT growth. Two&#8208;dimensional MXene&#8208;derived TiN exerts the tandem catalysis with residual Ni NPs. Meanwhile, 1D CNT enhances the durability of NO2RR through the chainmail effect.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) is considered a sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis strategy. However, there are still significant challenges in designing efficient NO2RR catalysts. Here, carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;encapsulated Ni nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on MXene&#8208;derived TiN (Ni@TiN/CNT) heterostructure is constructed by combining molten salt etching strategy and chemical vapor deposition. Ni@TiN/CNT exhibits an excellent NH3 yield rate (15.6&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), Faradaic efficiency (95.6%), and record cycle stability (NO2RR performance is virtually unattenuated after 60 cycles) at &#8722;0.7&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (versus RHE). In addition, the Zn&#8208;nitrite battery with Ni@TiN/CNT as the cathode shows high power density (9.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and NH3 synthesis performance. Combining validation experiments and density functional theory calculations reveals that Ni@TiN/CNT follows the tandem catalytic mechanism. The TiN site preferentially adsorbs and activates NO2&#8722;, while the Ni site provides abundant active hydrogen for the subsequent reduction process. Meanwhile, the chainmail structure of CNT prevents the oxidation and leaching of active sites, thereby significantly enhancing the stability of Ni@TiN/CNT. This work provides a new inspiration for the preparation of durable and efficient NO2RR electrocatalysts with tandem catalytic sites.

         <title>Intermolecular Toroidal Conjugation: Circularly Stacked 16 &#960;&#8208;Planes Formed by Supramolecular Assembly Enabling Cyclic Charge and Energy Delocalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evidence is provided for intermolecular toroidal conjugation in a cyclic &#960;&#8208;stacking array of 16 &#960;&#8208;planes formed through supramolecular assembly. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a circularly stacked arrangement of 16 dihydrodiazapentacene units around a stacked phthalocyanine pair. Spectroscopic studies, supported by theoretical calculations, indicated positive charge migration within the toroidal array in both cationic and photoexcited states.








Abstract
Toroidal conjugation is a unique mechanism for charge and exciton delocalization via through&#8208;space overlap among circularly stacked &#960;&#8208;orbitals, but the examples have been limited to intramolecular phenomena, where &#960;&#8208;planes are arranged around a hub molecule. In this study, we extend this concept to intermolecular phenomena and provide strong evidence for intermolecular toroidal conjugation in designed systems, in which a circular &#960;&#8208;stacked array is formed by molecular self&#8208;assembly. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analysis unequivocally revealed a toroidal array of 16 &#960;&#8208;planes formed by the supramolecular dimerization of phthalocyanines substituted with eight pillar&#8208;like diazapentacenes interdigitating their &#960;&#8208;pillars. The experimentally determined interplanar distances in the toroidal &#960;&#8208;stacking array were close enough to realize through&#8208;space conjugation. Various steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies, supported by theoretical calculations, indicated the possibility of positive charge migration within the toroidal &#960;&#8208;stacking array in the cationic and photoexcited states.

         <title>Synthetic Reversible Fibrous Network Hydrogels Based on a Double&#8208;Helical Polyelectrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study first reports a reversible fibrous network hydrogel based on double&#8208;helix polyelectrolytes and elucidates its formation process and key influencing factors. Owing to its rapid gelation, the hydrogel enables vertical spraying on inert surfaces. Furthermore, its unique properties make it highly promising for applications in antimicrobial fabric coatings and wildfire suppression.








Abstract
The unique mechanical properties of fibrous networks in biological tissues have inspired the development of synthetic fibrous network hydrogels, yet few polymers can reversibly form such structures. Here, we report the first reversible fibrous network hydrogel composed of synthetic polyelectrolytes with extremely rigid conformation (persistence length is &#8764;1&#160;&#181;m), made up of double&#8208;helical poly(2,2&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT) and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide ([P4444]Br). The hydrogel exhibits a unique sol&#8211;gel transition, triggered by the hydrophobicity increase of [P4444]Br above lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This drives PBDT aggregation into fibrous bundles through electrostatic interactions. These bundles grow and branch into a continuous network, with the molecular rigidity of PBDT's double&#8208;helix conformation being key to gel formation. The hydrogel displays strain&#8208;stiffening mechanical responses akin to biological systems and shows a significant hysteresis (21 &#176;C) between heating and cooling cycles. Uniquely, the effects of salts on the transition temperature deviate from the Hofmeister series, highlighting coordination with sulfonate groups as the dominant factor. Leveraging its modulus change during gelation, the hydrogel was successfully applied as a spray coating on superhydrophobic vertical Teflon surfaces. This study broadens the scope of thermoreversible hydrogels introducing gelation mechanisms for rigid polyelectrolytes and demonstrates their potential in advanced coatings.

&lt;p&gt;The unique mechanical properties of fibrous networks in biological tissues have inspired the development of synthetic fibrous network hydrogels, yet few polymers can reversibly form such structures. Here, we report the first reversible fibrous network hydrogel composed of synthetic polyelectrolytes with extremely rigid conformation (persistence length is &#8764;1&#160;&#181;m), made up of double-helical poly(2,2&#8242;-disulfonyl-4,4&#8242;-benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT) and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide ([P&lt;sub&gt;4444&lt;/sub&gt;]Br). The hydrogel exhibits a unique sol&#8211;gel transition, triggered by the hydrophobicity increase of [P&lt;sub&gt;4444&lt;/sub&gt;]Br above lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This drives PBDT aggregation into fibrous bundles through electrostatic interactions. These bundles grow and branch into a continuous network, with the molecular rigidity of PBDT's double-helix conformation being key to gel formation. The hydrogel displays strain-stiffening mechanical responses akin to biological systems and shows a significant hysteresis (21 &#176;C) between heating and cooling cycles. Uniquely, the effects of salts on the transition temperature deviate from the Hofmeister series, highlighting coordination with sulfonate groups as the dominant factor. Leveraging its modulus change during gelation, the hydrogel was successfully applied as a spray coating on superhydrophobic vertical Teflon surfaces. This study broadens the scope of thermoreversible hydrogels introducing gelation mechanisms for rigid polyelectrolytes and demonstrates their potential in advanced coatings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving 32% Efficiency in Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells with Bidentate&#8208;Anchored Superwetting Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bidentate&#8208;anchored superwetting aromatic self&#8208;assembled monolayer is employed as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs. The reversely substituted carbazole approach is crucial in promoting the formation of a robust HSL, improving hole extraction efficiency. The optimized wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs attain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.83%, and the fabricated P/S&#8208;TSCs achieve an impressive efficiency of 32.19% (certified 31.54%) while maintaining excellent photostability.








Abstract
The inhomogeneity of hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled molecular layers (SAMLs) often arises from the insufficient bonding between anchors and metal oxide, particularly on textured silicon surfaces when fabricating monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (P/S&#8208;TSCs) and the hydrophobic carbazole complicates the fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite films. To address this, we developed a novel bidentate&#8208;anchored superwetting aromatic SAM based on an upside&#8208;down carbazole core as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL), denoted as ((9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;3,6&#8208;diyl)bis(4,1&#8208;phenylene))bis(phosphonic acid) (2PhPA&#8208;CzH). The bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored exhibited enhanced adsorption capabilities and efficient hole extraction/transport, and the reversely substituted carbazole ring contributed a friendly super wetting underlayer that enabled high&#8208;quality perovskite films with minimized energetic mismatches, which 2PhPA&#8208;CzH played a pivotal role in dual interfacial energy regulation. Through these advancements, the optimized wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68&#160;eV) PSCs demonstrated an improved PCE of 22.83% and excellent stability with T90 exceeding 1000&#160;h under damp&#8208;heat conditions (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;3, 85% RH, 85&#160;&#176;C), representing one of the best performances for SAMs as HSL&#8208;based PSCs. Notably, 2PhPA&#8208;CzH&#8208;functionalized recombination layers extended to submicron&#8208;pyramid texture SHJ to fabricate P/S&#8208;TSCs, achieving an impressive efficiency of 32.19% at an active area of 1&#160;cm2 (certified 31.54%) while maintaining excellent photostability. This work offers guidance for designing multidentate&#8208;anchored SAMs to realize record PCE and excellent stability in P/S&#8208;TSCs.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Dehydrofluorination of Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Binder on the Failure of Graphite Anode in Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dehydrofluorination reaction of PVDF triggered by potassium ethoxide (EtOK) was deciphered in PIBs; the reaction not only corrodes the binder but also releases detrimental ethanol into the electrolyte. The released ethanol will dissolve the organic components of the SEI and result in a more serious electrolyte decomposition. The reaction is the key factor leading to the inferior Coulombic efficiency of graphite and the rapid failure of PVDF.








Abstract
The poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder has been successfully employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but it unexpectedly exhibits detrimental effects on the anode performance in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). The PVDF&#8208;based graphite electrode shows a low Coulombic efficiency and even fails to maintain the electrode integrity after several cycles in the 0.8&#160;M KPF6 ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate electrolyte. In this study, we unveil that the dehydrofluorination reaction of PVDF initiated by potassium ethoxide may be the key factor causing the above issues. The dehydrofluorination not only disables the binder but also releases detrimental ethanol into the electrolyte. The released ethanol can dissolve the organic components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and deplete the potassium resource, thereby resulting in a reduction of Coulombic efficiency and a more severe accumulation of SEI. The crowding of more accumulated SEI coupled with the large volume expansion of intercalated graphite results in the failure of PVDF&#8208;based graphite electrodes. This fundamental finding may provide a deeper insight into the failure mechanism of PVDF as a binder in PIBs, and meanwhile, give valuable guidance for the use of PVDF in battery communities containing sodium&#8208;ion batteries and LIBs.

         <title>A Rigid, Stable, and Scalable Aliphatic MOF Adsorbent for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation with Record Acetylene Packing Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylated aliphatic acids effectively modulate the heterogeneity of secondary building units, yielding a rigid framework with enhanced C2H2 capture capacity and achieving record&#8208;high storage density. Furthermore, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) simulations demonstrate exceptional C2H2/CO2 separation performance.








Abstract
Integrating separation parameters such as high adsorption capacity and selectivity, moderate adsorption enthalpy (Qst), along with industrial factors including cyclic stability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and scalability into a single adsorbent remains highly challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs among these properties. Herein, we strategically leverage the coordination modes of aliphatic ligands to significantly enhance C2H2/CO2 separation performance. The structure flexibility and pore metrics are finely modulated by hydroxylated aliphatic acid (DLmal). As a result, the rigid Zn&#8208;bpy&#8208;DLmal exhibits an exceptional C2H2 adsorption capacity of 1.4&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#160;bar, high C2H2/CO2 selectivity (49), and moderate C2H2 Qst value (38.4&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). Notably, it achieves record&#8208;high C2H2 packing densities of 347&#160;g L&#8722;1 at 0.01&#160;bar and 747&#160;g L&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;bar. Furthermore, the scale&#8208;up production of Zn&#8208;bpy&#8208;DLmal to kilogram quantities has been successfully achieved at an estimated cost of $74 per kilogram. Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm its practical C2H2/CO2 separation performance with excellent cyclability under high flow rates and both dry and humid conditions. Moreover, two&#8208;bed pressure swing adsorption simulations demonstrate a high&#8208;purity C2H2 (&gt;99%) yield of 14.64&#160;mol with a recovery of 88.2% per cycle.

         <title>A Sustainable and Scalable Approach for In Situ Induction of Gradient Nucleation Sites in Biomass&#8208;Derived Interface Layers for Ultra&#8208;Stable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A biomass&#8208;based Cu2+&#8208;carboxymethyl chitosan&#8208;kaolin (CuCK) layer composed of in situ galvanically and galvanostatically induced gradient alloy nucleation sites to achieve durable Zn anodes (Zn@CuCK) is designed, which significantly enhances adhesion to the Zn anode, demonstrates abundant zincophilicity, promotes continuous vertical zinc deposition with high plating/stripping reversibility, regulates Zn2+ flux, and facilitates Zn2+ transfer and desolvation. This study provides a sustainable and scalable method to in situ induce gradient nucleation sites in interface layer for engineering durable Zn anodes, promising for practical aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;grid energy storage due to their safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and durability. However, challenges like dendrite growth, corrosion, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the zinc anode hinder their performance. Herein, we propose a sustainable and scalable approach to form a copper gluconate@carboxymethyl chitosan@kaolin (CuCK) interface layer, inducing gradient nucleation sites via in situ galvanic and galvanostatic processes. The biomass&#8208;based CuCK coating features a gradient CuxZny alloy structure that homogenizes interfacial electric field distribution and enhances electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the incorporated Cu2+&#8208;loaded kaolin and carboxymethyl chitosan regulate Zn2+ flux, accelerate Zn2+ desolvation, and suppress HER. The resulting Zn@CuCK anode achieves a high cumulative capacity of 5500&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, exhibits excellent durability in Zn@CuCK//NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells across a wide temperature range (&#8722;30 to 60&#160;&#176;C), and endows the assembly of pouch cells with high energy density.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc metal batteries are promising candidates for large-grid energy storage due to their safety, cost-effectiveness, and durability. However, challenges like dendrite growth, corrosion, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the zinc anode hinder their performance. Herein, we propose a sustainable and scalable approach to form a copper gluconate@carboxymethyl chitosan@kaolin (CuCK) interface layer, inducing gradient nucleation sites via in situ galvanic and galvanostatic processes. The biomass-based CuCK coating features a gradient Cu&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Zn&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; alloy structure that homogenizes interfacial electric field distribution and enhances electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the incorporated Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-loaded kaolin and carboxymethyl chitosan regulate Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux, accelerate Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation, and suppress HER. The resulting Zn@CuCK anode achieves a high cumulative capacity of 5500&#160;mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in symmetrical cells, exhibits excellent durability in Zn@CuCK//NaV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;1.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O full cells across a wide temperature range (&#8722;30 to 60&#160;&#176;C), and endows the assembly of pouch cells with high energy density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Management of Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions in Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular planarity, crystallization behavior and stacking orientation, as well as film morphology of hole transport materials (HTMs) can be regulated by constructing different noncovalent conformational locks. The use of TzTzTPA&#8208;NH, with its intramolecular hydrogen bonds, as a dopant&#8208;free HTM affords excellent PCEs of 24.2% for single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and 25.4% for perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs).








Abstract
Organic semiconductors with intramolecular noncovalent interactions are promising hole transport materials (HTMs) for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the effects of different types of noncovalent bonds on the properties of HTMs are rarely reported. Here, three thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (TzTz)&#8208;based HTMs with different side chains were developed. Compared with alkyl side chains, functional side chains can improve the crystallinity and charge transport ability of HTMs by forming intramolecular noncovalent interactions. However, the steric hindrance of S&#183;&#183;&#183;O in TzTzTPA&#8208;SO distorted the molecular skeleton, leading to edge&#8208;on stacking and local aggregation of film. Fortunately, TzTzTPA&#8208;NH with intramolecular hydrogen bond showed high planarity, proper crystallinity, and preferred stacking orientation. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.2% with a nice long&#8208;term stability was achieved by dopant&#8208;free TzTzTPA&#8208;NH&#8208;based PSCs, which is superior to the doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based PSCs. In addition, TzTzTPA&#8208;NH is well used as HTM in wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Encouragingly, the TSCs based on TzTzTPA&#8208;NH achieved an excellent PCE of 25.4%, which is the highest PCE of n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite/organic TSCs. This work clearly illustrates the effect of intramolecular noncovalent interactions on the properties of HTMs, and provides guidance for designing high&#8208;performance dopant&#8208;free HTMs in PSCs.

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of Dynamic Conjugated Oligomers Displaying Length&#8208;Dependent Configuration Metastability, State&#8208;Dependent Properties, and Helix Emergence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precision conjugated oligomer with alternating di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;arylsubstituted alkenes is designed and constructed via liquid&#8208;phase iterative synthesis, exhibiting a chain length&#8208;dependent conformation transition to induce helix assembly. The dynamic stereoisomeric system also shows distinct state&#8208;dependent responsiveness to light and thermal stimuli.








Abstract
The emergence of structure and function at the mesoscale is critical for the design of complex molecular materials. In this work, we report an iterative liquid&#8208;phase construction of precision conjugated oligomers with alternating di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;arylsubstituted alkene (DAA and TAA) building blocks. Due to the dynamically reversible isomerization of TAA building blocks in the backbone, this system exhibited a complex library of constitutional stereoisomers with configurational metastability, as characterized by HRMS, chiral HPLC, and 2D excitation&#8208;emission fluorescence mapping analysis. The dynamic oligomer system exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced absorption shifts and state&#8208;dependent fluorescence and shows constitutional responses to thermal and light stimuli. During the self&#8208;assembly process, mesoscale helicity emerges in the P5 oligomer and evolves into regular helices (40&#8211;66&#160;nm pitch) in the P9 oligomer, which can also be tuned by side group modulation. Experimental and computational studies suggest a dynamic transition of conjugated backbone conformations with increasing chain length from linear, rich in trans&#8208;alkenes, to twisted with alternating trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;alkenes, resulting in a stereoregular triangular chain segment for secondary structure generation and property emergence.

         <title>Chiral Zinc Sulfide Nanoparticles Scavenging Reactive Oxygen Species for Remodeling Intestinal Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gut microbiota dysbiosis are crucial factors that exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To address this, we successfully synthesized zinc sulfide nanoparticles (ZnS NPs) with a particle size of approximately 500 nm and a maximum g&#8208;factor of 0.07, utilizing l&#8208;/d&#8208;cysteine as chiral ligands. In vitro experiments revealed that these chiral ZnS NPs could enter macrophages through the CD44 and clathrin pathways, which enhanced the ability to scavenge ROS, in turn significantly inhibited the NF&#8208;&#954;B and NLRP3 signaling pathways, thereby reducing the secretion of TNF&#8208;&#945;, IL&#8208;6, and IL&#8208;1&#946;, while upregulating IL&#8208;10. In vivo experimental data showed that l&#8208;ZnS NPs outperformed 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, significantly improving body weight, reducing the IBD activity index, and attenuating tissue damage, concurrently, l&#8208;ZnS NPs exhibited a marked prophylactic effect. The benchmark studies verified that l&#8208;ZnS NPs increased the abundance of the beneficial Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 by 10.55&#8208;fold and decreased harmful Enterobacter by 2914.00&#8208;fold, thereby reshaping the intestinal microecological balance. Pharmacokinetic and biosafety assessments confirmed the safety of l&#8208;ZnS NPs. Our findings indicate that chiral ZnS NPs hold great potential as nanodrugs for the treatment and prevention of IBD, providing an important foundation for the development of IBD therapeutic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Inside the Catalyst Layer on Gas Diffusion Electrodes in Electrochemical Reduction of CO and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are widely used in electrochemical CO and CO2 reduction reactions (CO(2)RR) in flow cells due to their ability to alleviate mass transport limitations of gaseous reactants. The flow cell configuration makes uniform distribution of reactants, intermediates, products, and speciation within the catalyst layer (CL) unlikely. In this work, a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind in situ characterization technique capable of probing the cross section of the CL with confocal Raman spectroscopy was developed to investigate the speciation distribution across the Cu CL in CO(2)RR with a spatial resolution of ~4 &#956;m. In both CORR in alkaline medium and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte, the active region of CL was identified as that with the presence of the Raman band for adsorbed CO (COad). The strong correlation of COad and CO32&#8208; bands provides the first spectroscopic evidence that CO2RR only occurs in an alkaline microenvironment.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Z&#8208;selective Styrene Synthesis via Dual Cobalt and Photocatalysis through Coupling of Unactivated Alkyl Iodides with Terminal Arylalkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient Z&#8208;selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydroalkylation of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides has been achieved, providing a straightforward and modular route to access 1,2&#8208;disubstituted Z&#8208;styrenes. This reaction operates under mild conditions without requiring over&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of metal terminal reductants. Excellent Z/E ratios and good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds with remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. One potential utility of this reaction is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of several syn homoallylic alcohols in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step sequence. Control experiments strongly support that the halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) process is the key to generating carbon radicals. DFT studies suggest that the catalytic system involves Co(II)/Co(III) cycle and the steric repulsion between the Co(II) catalyst and the alkenyl radical in radical capture by Co(II) is the dominant factor controlling the Z/E selectivity. This approach represents the first example of merging photo&#8208;XAT with cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides.</dc:description>

Control experiments strongly support that the halogen-atom transfer (XAT) process is the key to generating carbon radicals. DFT studies suggest that the catalytic system involves Co(II)/Co(III) cycle and the steric repulsion between the Co(II) catalyst and the alkenyl radical in radical capture by Co(II) is the dominant factor controlling the Z/E selectivity. This approach represents the first example of merging photo-XAT with cobalt-catalyzed reductive coupling of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Anthraquinones via J&#8208;Type Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence materials based on cost&#8208;effective point&#8208;chiral luminophores are highly desirable; however, their performance is often hindered by weak exciton&#8208;chirality coupling between the luminophore and its adjacent stereocenters. Here we introduce J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization as an effective strategy to address this challenge. By attaching amide groups to point&#8208;chiral anthraquinone luminophores, the formation of directional hydrogen bonds facilitates efficient chirality transfer from peripheral stereocenters to anthraquinones, resulting in supramolecular polymers with amplified chiroptical asymmetry. More importantly, the incorporation of acetylene spacers reduces torsional angle of the anthraquinone core compared to the non&#8208;acetylene control compound (1.81&#8304; vs. 33.4&#8304;), promoting J&#8208;aggregation and increasing emission intensity. This structural optimization enables the supramolecular polymers to achieve a circularly polarized luminescence brightness of 13.8 M&#8315;&#185;cm&#8315;&#185;, marking a significant advancement in point&#8208;chiral luminophore systems. Furthermore, the integration of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer into these supramolecular polymers allows for the fabrication of color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized electroluminescent devices. Overall, J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization represents a promising approach for developing high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials by simultaneously optimizing emission dissymmetry and quantum efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Biocatalysis to Generate Hydrogen Sulfide and Promote Endogenous Antioxidant Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoting cellular protective responses during oxidative stress conditions through the generation of antioxidant persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has tremendous therapeutic potential. Here, we report a bioinspired glycoconjugate, a candidate for tandem biocatalysis and generates persulfide/ H2S in response to oxidative stress. The glycoconjugate is cleaved by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, an enzyme that is expressed during oxidative stress; the product of this reaction is a substrate for 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme that is involved in persulfide/ H2S biosynthesis. The catalytic systems are orthogonal to one another, and the glycoconjugate is efficiently cleaved by these enzymes to generate the potent antioxidant glutathione persulfide as well as H2S. We demonstrate the efficacy of this conjugate in mitigating inflammation in the brain in an animal model. Together, using rationally designed substrates and fully catalytic steps, we leverage tandem biocatalysis to direct the generation of persulfide/ H2S, and promote cells&#8217; own antioxidant response.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Classical Hydrogen Bond Based Efficient Solid&#8208;State Organic Emitters Enabled by a Synergistic Anion and Mechanical Bond Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional fluorophores often face aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), limiting their efficacy in high&#8208;concentration applications. We demonstrate that a combined effect of anion and mechanical bond can significantly increase fluorescence intensity, up to 14&#8208;fold and a quantum yield of 97.0%. A large number of crystal analysis reveal that this enhancement is primarily driven by non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonds, which stabilizes the structure and restricts molecular motion. The versatility of this synergistic effect opens new avenues for applications, including circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) facilitated by chiral anions, and the development of a novel fluorescence switchable rotaxane shuttle that operates without charge transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nucleus&#8208;Targeting Ruthenium(II) Complex Induces DNA Condensation in Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the conventional ways to eradicate tumor cells is to utilize chemotherapy agents, e.g., cisplatin, to induce DNA damage. However, DNA damage repair mechanisms can significantly limit the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin. These mechanisms enable tumor cells to repair the DNA damage caused by the drug, leading to resistance. Cisplatin and similar drugs bind to specific DNA sites without significantly altering their conformation. As a result, DNA repair enzymes can still attach to and repair the damaged DNA. To address this issue, we designed four Ru(II) complexes (RuC3, RuC6, RuC9, and RuC12) with high positive charges of +8 valence and regulated their nuclear accumulation levels by adjusting the length of alkyl chains. RuC9 exhibits the highest nucleus accumulation level. DNA conformation was significantly altered by inducing DNA condensation through indiscriminately neutralizing the negative charge of the DNA backbone. This significant change prevents DNA&#8208;related enzymes from binding to DNA, ultimately leading to the efficient eradication of various tumor cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that kills tumor cells and overcomes cisplatin resistance through inducing DNA condensation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Borate Esterification for Evolved Supramolecular Chirality and Chiral Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topological chemical reactions in confined environments offer unique opportunities for constructing dynamically tunable crystalline materials and architecturally defined polymers. However, their potential within functional supramolecular systems and chiral materials remains largely untapped. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, a borate esterification reaction to achieve dynamic modulation of supramolecular chirality and chiroptical properties under aggregation conditions. Pyrene&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives, following functionalization with phenylboronic acid groups, co&#8208;assemble with catechol&#8208;functionalized pyrene derivatives. This co&#8208;assembly undergoes spontaneous and highly efficient borate esterification under ambient conditions, inducing nanoscale morphological evolution and an inversion of supramolecular chirality. Both experimental results and DFT&#8208;based computations reveal that the supramolecular chirality inversion is primarily driven by a transition from &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking to CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between pyrene moieties. This co&#8208;assembly&#8208;borate esterification process represents a powerful integration of non&#8208;covalent assembly and covalent chemistry, providing a versatile platform for the design of soft materials and chiral functional systems. Moreover, the introduction of alizarin derivatives containing catechol motifs enables the transfer of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), resulting in tunable emission shifts from blue and cyan to red. This work broadens the functional scope of chiral luminescent materials and opens new avenues for their application.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Glycolysis by Endogenous 31P CEST Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel approach to investigate glycolysis by&#160; &#179;&#185;P CEST applied to&#160; substrates at their endogenous concentration. The method relies on the assessment of the Saturation Transfer (ST) observed on the &#179;&#185;P signals of inorganic phosphate (Pi) or phosphocreatine (PCr) following the selective irradiation of phosphate groups of endogenous molecules exchanging with ATP, Pi, and indirectly with PCr in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The concentrations of these substrates&#160; fall below the threshold for direct detection. &#179;&#185;P CEST technique amplifies their responses, making them detectable via the ST effect to the &#179;&#185;P resonance of the selected reference signal. The method was validated in vitro on mouse breast adenocarcinoma cell pellets (TS/A), where the intracellular Pi signal was monitored to assess the ST effect associated with the saturation of phosphoester&#8208;containing molecules. The use of a glycolysis inhibitor and different experimental temperatures (37&#176;C or 4&#176;C) provided insights supporting the rationale behind the method. A comparison of &#179;&#185;P Z&#8208;spectra was carried out on murine breast cancer cell lines with different degrees of aggressiveness, showing the ability to assess metabolic differences.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a novel approach to investigate glycolysis by&#160; &#179;&#185;P CEST applied to&#160; substrates at their endogenous concentration. The method relies on the assessment of the Saturation Transfer (ST) observed on the &#179;&#185;P signals of inorganic phosphate (Pi) or phosphocreatine (PCr) following the selective irradiation of phosphate groups of endogenous molecules exchanging with ATP, Pi, and indirectly with PCr in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The concentrations of these substrates&#160; fall below the threshold for direct detection. &#179;&#185;P CEST technique amplifies their responses, making them detectable via the ST effect to the &#179;&#185;P resonance of the selected reference signal. The method was validated in vitro on mouse breast adenocarcinoma cell pellets (TS/A), where the intracellular Pi signal was monitored to assess the ST effect associated with the saturation of phosphoester-containing molecules. The use of a glycolysis inhibitor and different experimental temperatures (37&#176;C or 4&#176;C) provided insights supporting the rationale behind the method. A comparison of &#179;&#185;P Z-spectra was carried out on murine breast cancer cell lines with different degrees of aggressiveness, showing the ability to assess metabolic differences. Finally, in vivo experiments on mice models of mammary adenocarcinoma demonstrated that &#179;&#185;P CEST can differentiate tumor and healthy tissue based on their metabolic characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Buried Interface/Bulk Synergistic Passivation via Chlorophyll Derivative for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the ultra&#8208;high solubility in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, a portion of the chlorophyll derivative molecules that would be passivating nickel oxide diffuse into the perovskite with the perovskite precursor, thus achieving a buried interface/bulk synergistic passivation of perovskite films.








Abstract
Buried interfacial engineering is crucial for NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while most passivation measures focus only on the interface and neglect the perovskite bulk. In this work, a stable free&#8208;base chlorin possessing an amino acid terminal (serinyl pyropheophorbide&#8208;a, SPPa) was synthesized as a functional chlorophyll derivative, and its trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen chloride salts (SPPaX; X&#160;=&#160;TFA, HCl) were introduced into the NiOx/perovskite interface. Thanks to the high solubility in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, SPPaX can diffuse into the perovskite through the precursor. Insertion of SPPaX optimizes the interfacial energy band bending and minimizes interfacial defects, while the growth sites provided by SPPaX facilitate the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite film with less lattice strain and high crystal orientation. Additionally, diffused SPPaX molecules in perovskite improve the crystallization process and decrease the internal defects of perovskite films. As a result, the SPPaX distributed throughout perovskite achieves a bulk/interface synergistic passivation effect at both the bulk and buried interface of the perovskite film. SPPaTFA&#8208;modified PSCs deliver a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.54% with a superior long&#8208;term stability under both light and thermal stress.

         <title>Weak Attractive Noncovalent Interactions in Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of utilizing weak attractive noncovalent interactions, including only CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N interactions, has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the activity and/or enantioselectivity of metal catalysts in asymmetric hydrogenations, particularly for low&#8208;activity Earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts. Among these interactions, the weakest CH&#8943;HC interactions, when present in multiple instances, have been shown to exert a significant synergistic effect. This review summarizes recent progress in this field and provides a brief outlook on its future development.








Abstract
Weak attractive noncovalent interactions, specifically CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N contacts, between catalysts and substrates have recently gained renewed attention in asymmetric hydrogenations, despite their historical underappreciation due to challenges in detection. Emerging evidence underscores the significant role of these interactions in improving reactivity and/or enantioselectivity, particularly in sustainable catalytic systems that utilize Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. This minireview summarizes advancements in asymmetric hydrogenations catalyzed by both noble and Earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes under an H&#8322; atmosphere, with a focus on the roles of CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N noncovalent interactions in improving reactivity and/or enantioselectivity. Taking into account the weak attractive character of these noncovalent interactions, it is expected to help the design of novel chiral transition metal catalysts and develop more efficient asymmetric hydrogenation systems for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of diverse chiral compounds.

         <title>An Activatable Caged Palladium Nanocomposite for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduced a multi&#8208;functional composite consisting of Pd nanoparticles, encapsulated in molecular cages, co&#8208;loaded with glucose oxidase and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;hyaluronic acid conjugate, acting as an effective activatable carrier for cancer therapy. It exhibits bioorthogonal catalytic and multi&#8208;enzyme mimicking activities, which can be selectively activated in the tumor and enable spatially targeted intracellular catalysis for therapy.








Abstract
Pd&#8208;based intracellular catalysis has attracted increasing interest in modulating biological processes or disease treatment. The unsatisfactory catalytic efficiency arising from limited active sites and poor water solubility of palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and their &#8220;always on&#8221; catalytic activities pose, however, significant limitations. Herein, we develop a high&#8208;performance nanocomposite based on ultrafine Pd NPs confined within molecular cages, and incorporated with glucose oxidase (GOx) and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HA). The cage&#8208;confined strategy enables facile synthesis of ultrafine Pd NPs with more accessible active sites, significantly improving the catalytic activities of Pd NPs for enhanced bioorthogonal catalysis. Importantly, the nanocomposite exhibits targeting ability and activatable activity in response to both the acidic pH and hyaluronidase overexpressed in the tumor environment, enabling selective drug synthesis. Besides, it features CAT&#8208;, OXD&#8208;, and GPx&#8208;like activities, promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and intracellular GSH depletion to elevate oxidative stress for enhanced therapy. The cage&#8208;confined configuration makes it possible to establish metal&#8208;based intracellular catalytic systems with high performance, enabling the synthesis of desired molecules for effective disease theranostics.

         <title>Cascaded Metalation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Electrochemical CO Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascaded metalation in a 2D covalent organic framework (COF) shifts the overall d&#8208;band center upwards and enhances CO adsorption. The secondary metal sites facilitate the hydrogenation of CO. Consequently, the barriers associated with the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) are significantly lower, leading to substantial improvements in the CO reduction reaction with a 23&#8208;fold enhancement in the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of methanol production.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) to high&#8208;value methanol requires the delicate design of catalysts due to the large overpotential. Especially, achieving precise modification of electrocatalysts while preserving the periodic alignment of active sites to optimize performance remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the cascaded metalation of phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs for selective reduction of CO to methanol. After implanting the secondary metal (Ni), CityU&#8208;35 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 48.4% at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus RHE, significantly surpassing that of CityU&#8208;34 (2.1%) with only Co atoms. Enhanced methanol production originates from the optimization of electronic structure with improved *CO adsorption, as substantiated by the in situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the cascaded metalation with the introduction of secondary Ni sites not only strengthens *CO adsorption but also accelerates proton generation for the hydrogenation of *CO toward CH3OH. The cascaded metalation with synergistic effects between Co and Ni sites reduces the energy barriers and improves the overall electroactivity. Our results demonstrate cascaded metalation as an effective strategy to tailor the catalytic activities of 2D&#160;COFs, extending the functional design of reticular frameworks in electrocatalysis.

The secondary metal sites facilitate the hydrogenation of CO. Consequently, the barriers associated with the rate-determining step (RDS) are significantly lower, leading to substantial improvements in the CO reduction reaction with a 23-fold enhancement in the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of methanol production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) to high-value methanol requires the delicate design of catalysts due to the large overpotential. Especially, achieving precise modification of electrocatalysts while preserving the periodic alignment of active sites to optimize performance remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the cascaded metalation of phthalocyanine-based COFs for selective reduction of CO to methanol. After implanting the secondary metal (Ni), CityU-35 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 48.4% at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus RHE, significantly surpassing that of CityU-34 (2.1%) with only Co atoms. Enhanced methanol production originates from the optimization of electronic structure with improved &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO adsorption, as substantiated by the in situ attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the cascaded metalation with the introduction of secondary Ni sites not only strengthens &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO adsorption but also accelerates proton generation for the hydrogenation of *CO toward CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH. The cascaded metalation with synergistic effects between Co and Ni sites reduces the energy barriers and improves the overall electroactivity. Our results demonstrate cascaded metalation as an effective strategy to tailor the catalytic activities of 2D&#160;COFs, extending the functional design of reticular frameworks in electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase Engineered by Catalysis Chemistry Toward Durable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalysis chemistry strategy was applied to construct a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for suppressing the sodium dendrites growth and enhancing the reversibility of sodium plating/stripping toward advanced anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are considered one of the most promising large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their extremely high energy density. Nonetheless, their practical application is hindered by the uncontrolled growth of sodium dendrites. Constructing a mechanically robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an effective strategy to suppress dendrite formation. Herein, we report a catalysis chemistry approach to construct an ultra&#8208;thin (&#8764; 5&#160;nm), NaF&#8208;rich and high&#8208;strength (203&#160;MPa) SEI layer by introducing Ru catalytic sites on the current collector, which promotes rapid Na&#8314; diffusion and effectively inhibits dendrite growth. Benefiting from this design, the Ru modified&#8208;Cu//Na asymmetric cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability over 2000&#160;h (1000 cycles at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 2 mAh cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, the AFSMBs with Ru modified&#8208;Cu current collector also deliver excellent cycling performance and maintains nearly 98.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. The results demonstrate great potential of catalysis chemistry in developing advanced sodium metal anodes and provide a new perspective to engineering efficient SEI toward battery applications.

         <title>Aminomethyl Phosphonic Acid as Highly Effective Multifunctional Additive for Modification of Electron Transport Layer and Perovskite in Photovoltaic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The passivation of detrimental perovskite&#8208;based defects is critically acknowledged for fabricating highly effective perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The presence of a high&#8208;quality electron transport layer (ETL) is also considered a pivotal factor for effective charge extraction and transport dynamics. Herein, a simple small organic molecule, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), is introduced as a multifunctional additive in the SnO2 ETL. The defects in the SnO2 ETL are effectively suppressed by passivating the oxygen vacancies upon the SnO2 surface. Simultaneously, the carrier mobility and crystallinity of SnO2 are enhanced, and the upward&#8208;regulated conduction band minimum (CBM) is beneficial for constructing a favourable energy level alignment with the perovskite layer. Notably, the introduced residuals on the SnO2 surface can function as crystalline seeds for growth of large perovskite grains, which can passivate the defects in the perovskite bulk phase, boundaries, as well as the SnO2/perovskite interface. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of the AMPA&#8208;modified PSCs is enhanced from 19.91% to 24.22%. Most importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs with AMPA maintained 94.9% of the initial PCE during 720 h of storage at a relative humidity of 10%, attributed to the improved hydrophobicity of both the SnO2 and perovskite layers after AMPA modification.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Within the family of halide solid electrolytes (SEs), Li2ZrCl6 demonstrates high oxidative stability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and mechanical deformability, positioning it as a promising candidate for SEs. However, the application of Li2ZrCl6 as a SEs was hindered by its low ionic conductivity at room temperature. Current strategies to enhance the ionic conductivity of Li2ZrCl6 primarily are focused on single cation or anion sublattice&#8208;engineering, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Here, we propose a novel cation and anion&#8208;sublattice&#8208;engineering strategy, termed CASE, to increase the amorphous content and thus enhance ionic conductivity. The incorporation of Cu2+ and O2&#8208; induces distinctive structural modifications within Li2ZrCl6. This structure corroborated through analytic data of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the neutron diffraction, and ab initio molecular dynamics. Consequently, the amorphous Li2.1Zr0.95Cu0.05Cl4.4O0.8 achieves an enhanced ionic conductivity of 2.05 mS cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C. Furthermore, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries utilizing the amorphous Li2.1Zr0.95Cu0.05Cl4.4O0.8 as an electrolyte and LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 as a cathode exhibit a superior long&#8208;term cycling stability retaining 90.3% of capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C under room temperature, which are much higher than those of Zr&#8208;based halide electrolytes in publications. Such a result might stimulate the development of more amorphous structures with high ionic conductivity in the CASE strategy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a mixed halogen(I) complex (2), containing three distinct iodine(I) moieties ([N&#8213;I&#8213;N]+, O&#8213;I&#8213;N, and [O&#8213;I&#8213;O]&#8208;) within the same structure was synthesised with 4&#8208;styrylpyridine (4&#8208;stypy) and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalate as the stabilising Lewis bases. This complex was observed to be in equilibrium with its respective bis(OIN) complex (1a), with isolated samples of 2 also being found to convert to 1a in solution.

         <title>Microporous Hard Carbon Support Provokes Exceptional Performance of Single Atom Electrocatalysts for Advanced Air Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts embracing metal&#8208;nitrogen (MNx) moieties show promising performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The modification on spatially confined microenvironments, which won copious attention with respect to achieving efficient catalysts, are auspicious but yet to be inspected for MNx moieties from modulating the energetics and kinetics of ORR. Here, Fe single atoms (SAs) are immobilized in microporous hard carbon (Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC), in which the microporous structure with crumpled graphene sheets serves confined microenvironment for catalysis. Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC holds a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.927&#160;V and excellent stability for ORR. Theoretical studies unveil that hydrogen bonding between the intermediate of O* and micropore interior surfaces substantially promotes its protonation and accelerates overall ORR kinetics. Both the aqueous and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries driven by Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC air cathode show excellent stability with small charging/discharging voltage gaps. Importantly, when used as the air cathode for industrial chlor&#8208;alkali process, the applied voltage of Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC&#8208;based flow cell to reach 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is 1.57&#160;V, which is 210&#160;mV smaller than Pt/C&#8208;based one. These findings provide in&#8208;depth insights into the confined microenvironment of MNx moieties for boosted electrochemical performance, and pave the pathways for future catalyst development satisfying the requirement of industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Designing high&#8208;efficiency ultraviolet organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (UV OLEDs) remains challenging due to the need for efficient utilization of&#160;triplet excitons while maintaining a wide bandgap. In this study, we designed double boron&#8211;oxygen&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (dBON&#8208;PAHs) with rigid planar structures and developed a novel UV emitter, BO&#8208;N, featuring hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) properties. BO&#8208;N exhibited UV emission in toluene solution and 1,3&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene (mCP) film, with photoluminescence (PL) peaks of 391 and 400 nm and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of 15 and 34 nm, respectively. The device doped with 5 wt% BO&#8208;N achieved a narrowband UV emission with an FWHM of 37 nm, an electroluminescence peak (&#955;EL) of 399 nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.166, 0.030). Moreover, the device attained a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 18.6% among reported HLCT&#8208;based UV OLEDs with CIEy &lt; 0.05. These findings highlight the great potential of double BON&#8208;PAHs as robust emitters for high&#8208;performance UV OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright and Versatile Azetidinecarboxamide&#8208;Based Fluorophore&#8208;Ligand Conjugates for High&#8208;Resolution Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophore&#8208;ligand conjugates play a pivotal role in cellular imaging, providing high target specificity. However, simultaneously achieving conjugates with high brightness and ligand&#8208;targeting diversity presents significant challenges. Traditional strategies often require complex, multi&#8208;step modifications for fluorophore enhancement and ligand conjugation. Here, we present an azetidinecarboxamide strategy that addresses these challenges by integrating brightness enhancement and ligand conjugation capabilities within a single molecular framework. The azetidinecarboxamide core suppresses twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), thereby enhancing fluorescence quantum yield. Its carbonyl group provides a versatile site for conjugating a wide range of targeting ligands, enabling the rapid development of diverse and tunable fluorophore&#8208;ligand conjugates. This streamlined approach reduces synthetic complexity, accelerates probe development, and is compatible with a wide variety of fluorophores, such as coumarin, naphthalimide, NBD, rhodol, rhodamine, and silicon&#8208;rhodamine, facilitating the creation of high&#8208;performance, multifunctional probes for advanced cellular imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible CO2 Hydrogenation, Neutron Crystallography, and Hydride Reactivity of a Triiridium Heptahydride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel triiridium heptahydride cluster catalyzes reversible CO2 hydrogenation. Foundational structural and reactivity studies that combine neutron crystallography and spectroscopy, electrochemistry, synthetic studies, and kinetics uncover previously elusive metal&#8211;metal cooperative reactivity that enables a unique approach to functionalizing CO2.








Abstract
The authors report the structure, reactivity, and catalytic utility of a triiridium complex, [Ir3H6(&#956;3&#8208;H)(PN)3]2+ (2&#8208;H, PN = (2&#8208;pyridyl)CH2PBut2). Despite its unusual stability to unsaturated organics, electrophiles, and even CF3SO3D, they find that complex 2&#8208;H catalyzes hydrogenation of CO2 to formate (TONIr&#160;=&#160;9600) and reverse formic acid dehydrogenation (TONIr&#160;=&#160;54&#160;400). The hydrogenation operates via a reactive intermediate [Ir3H4(&#956;&#8208;H)4(PN)3]+ (5). Neutron crystallography and DFT&#8208;supported neutron vibrational spectroscopy of 2&#8208;H reveal Ir&#9472;H bond lengths and elucidate the vibration modes within the Ir3H7 core. Stoichiometric oxidation of 2&#8208;H produces four classes of iridium complexes of varied nuclearity and hydride structure: tetra&#8208; and pentanuclear clusters [Ir3H6(&#956;3&#8208;AuPPh3)(PN)3]2+ (2&#8208;Au) and [Ag{Ir2H4(&#956;&#8208;OAc)(PN)2}2]3+ (6) are generated using AuPPh3+ and AgOAc, respectively. Further oxidation to class [Ir2H3(&#956;&#8208;X)2(PN)2]+ is possible with AgOAc, Hg(OAc)2, or I2. Finally, a TEMPO/HCl system completely oxidizes the hydrides and gives [Ir2Cl4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(PN)2] (11).

An improved stereoselective and regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization enables the formation of completely alternating poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA), as reported by Guangqiang Xu, Qinggang Wang et al. in their Communcation (e202417075).

         <title>Engineering Oxygen Intermediates Adsorption on Amorphous NiFe Alloys for Highly Active and Selective Electrochemical Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple doping strategy is developed to engineer reactive intermediates adsorption on amorphous NiFe alloy catalysts. Mn&#8208;doping into amorphous NiFe alloy can significantly reduce the onset potential to generate active Ni3+ species, which spontaneously react with HMF via nucleophile dehydrogenation to form FDCA.







Abstract
Electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (HMFOR) offers a promising route to transform biomass into value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) greatly limits the HMFOR selectivity. Herein, we report a facile doping strategy to engineer oxygen intermediates adsorption on amorphous NiFe alloys to boost highly selective electrochemical HMF oxidation to produce 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), among which, amorphous Mn&#8208;doped NiFeB alloy displays a low HMFOR onset potential of 1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE, achieving 100&#8201;% HMF conversion with 88&#8201;% FDCA selectivity at an applied potential of 1.4&#8197;V vs. RHE, outperforming amorphous NiFeB (73&#8201;% FDCA selectivity) and Mo&#8208;doped NiFeB (65&#8201;% FDCA selectivity) alloys. Experimental characterizations suggest that the introduction of Mn/Mo into amorphous NiFeB alloy can increase/decrease its electronic density and thus strengthen/weaken oxygen intermediates adsorption. Operando experiments indicate that the amorphous Mn&#8208;doped NiFeB alloy can significantly reduce the onset potential to form active Ni3+ species, which spontaneously react with HMF via nucleophile dehydrogenation to form FDCA. Furthermore, in situ infrared spectroscopy measurements verify that the HMF oxidation pathway follows the 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) route rather than the 2,5&#8208;diformyfuran (DFF) route.

RHE, outperforming amorphous NiFeB (73&#8201;% FDCA selectivity) and Mo-doped NiFeB (65&#8201;% FDCA selectivity) alloys. Experimental characterizations suggest that the introduction of Mn/Mo into amorphous NiFeB alloy can increase/decrease its electronic density and thus strengthen/weaken oxygen intermediates adsorption. &lt;i&gt;Operando&lt;/i&gt; experiments indicate that the amorphous Mn-doped NiFeB alloy can significantly reduce the onset potential to form active Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species, which spontaneously react with HMF via nucleophile dehydrogenation to form FDCA. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; infrared spectroscopy measurements verify that the HMF oxidation pathway follows the 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) route rather than the 2,5-diformyfuran (DFF) route.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Profiling Allosteric Modulators of CB1R with an Allosteric Fluoroprobe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#8208;based assay to directly profile CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) independently of orthosteric radioligands. Our fluorescent tracer allows for distinction between allosteric and orthosteric ligands and reliable determination of CB1R AM binding affinities. (TOC Figure created in BioRender. Ganzoni, R.

Abstract
Allosteric modulation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) offers a promising alternative to conventional therapeutic approaches using orthosteric ligands (OLs). Currently, CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) are characterized based on their ability to modulate binding or functional response of OLs, preventing isolation of individual contributions by allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Herein, we develop the first allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant FRET&#8208;based assay allowing for the direct profiling of CB1R AMs without coincubation with an OL. Our allosteric tracer enables differentiation of allosteric and orthosteric ligands as well as their pharmacological profiling at CB1R. The utility of this work is highlighted by addressing ambiguities surrounding the binding of cannabidiol (CBD). CBD was found to interact with both allosteric and orthosteric sites of CB1R with comparable affinity (pKi=5.34 and 5.67, respectively).

         <title>Self&#8208;Optimized Reconstruction of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Introduces Cation Vacancies for Selective Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway represents a green production process that has gained increasing importance. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of efficacious catalysts to attain high activity under industrial current density. In this study, we present a strategy for cation vacancy generation through metal&#8208;organic frameworks self&#8208;optimized reconfiguration for the efficient electrosynthesis of H2O2 under industrial current densities in solid&#8208;electrolyte cell.&#160; The ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo electrocatalyst exhibits significant H2O2 selectivity of 97.8%, and the H2O2 productivity is up to 24.53 mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a direct and continuous output of ~3.36 wt% H2O2 aqueous solutions under industrial current density (400 mA cm&#8722;2). Impressively, the ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo possesses superb long&#8208;term durability for over 220 h and can output H2O2 aqueous solution with a concentration of ~8.03 wt% in the pilot experiment. Theoretical calculations confirm that the introduction of modest cation vacancies optimizes the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate and reduces both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers, thus balancing the selectivity of the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction. This work provides valuable insights into the rapid, eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of H2O2 and the rational design of highly active catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of a DNA&#8208;Stabilized Ag16Cl2 Nanocluster in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray total scattering and pair distribution function analysis are used to determine the first solution&#8208;state structure of a DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag nanocluster.








Abstract
We determine the first solution&#8208;state structure of a DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag16Cl2 nanocluster using X&#8209;ray total scattering and pair distribution function analysis. We find that the structure in solution exhibits both displacive and rotational distortions compared to the known crystal structure. Additionally, our measurements are sensitive toward changes in DNA conformation, revealing that the DNA scaffold in solution exhibits significantly more flexibility than when conformationally locked in the crystalline form. Our results demonstrate the capability to determine the structure of DNA&#8208;stabilized clusters beyond their crystallized form, an essential step toward understanding differences between their solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;state photophysical properties.

         <title>Why Mental Health Literacy Can Improve STEM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite its widely appreciated significance, most research on mental health is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. This contribution intends to enhance discussion between those disciplines and the STEM field by pointing toward relevant studies, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.








Abstract
In recent years, an increasing number of articles have outlined the mental health crisis in academia. Despite its widely appreciated significance, most of the related research is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. Despite stakeholders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) being disproportionately affected, they are often left in the dark about important findings unless they seek out relevant information themselves. This contribution attempts to spark interdisciplinary discussion between psychology, psychiatry, and STEM by highlighting relevant research, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods of assembling low&#8208;symmetry heterometallic cage architectures are limited to stepwise construction and combinations of inert and labile metal ions, affording complex, anisotropic cage structures by sacrificing synthetic ease. Herein, a heterometallic [Cu2PdL4]2+ lantern&#8208;type cage has been assembled in a single self&#8208;assembly step through the use of a heteroditopic ligand with two different metal&#8208;binding groups. The resultant cage complex is a fusion of two common lantern&#8208;type cage motifs &#8211; carboxylate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic Cu4L4 cages and pyridyl&#8208;based Pd2L4 coordination cages. Evidence for heterometallic cage formation in solution was provided by 1H and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) data, while circular dichroism (CD) spectra confirmed the helical nature of the assembly. The heterometallic cage was then exploited in binding heterotopic guests. It is envisioned that the simple design strategy presented herein will ease the assembly of other structurally complex, low&#8208;symmetry cage architectures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inorganic perovskites are known for their excellent photothermal stability; however, the photothermal stability of all&#8208;inorganic n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is compromised due to ion diffusion and free radical&#8208;induced degradation caused by the use of doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport materials (HTMs). In this study, two isomeric D&#8208;A&#8208;D type small molecules, namely HBT and HiBT, were developed and used as dopant&#8208;free HTMs, using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole or benzo[d][1,2,3]thiadiazole as acceptor moieties. The HiBT molecule, with its symmetry&#8208;breaking features, exhibits a large dipole moment, enhanced coordination&#8208;active sites, and a well&#8208;aligned energy level structure, all of which contribute to passivating perovskite surface defects and improving free charge separation. As a result, inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with HiBT HTM achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.58%, the highest reported for dopant&#8208;free HTM&#8208;based inorganic PSCs. Moreover, the enhanced hydrophobic properties of HiBT molecules, coupled with their ability to passivate perovskite surface defects, contribute to significantly improved device stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Autonomous Mannosylated Nanomotors for Dynamic Cancer Cell Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An attractive strategy in cancer cell therapy is to employ motile nanoparticles that can actively search for their target. Herein, we introduce mannosylated compartmentalized cross&#8208;linked enzyme&#8208;driven nanomotors (c&#8208;CLEnM), which exhibit specific and efficient targeting of Hep G2 cells through elevated autonomous motion. In this design, we constructed biodegradable bowl&#8208;shaped stomatocytes encapsulating the enzymes glucose oxidase and catalase within their nanocavity. A subsequent enzyme crosslinking reaction was performed to guarantee their stability. Furthermore, the c&#8208;CLEnM were surface modified with a mannose&#8208;functional glycopolymer, enabling binding with receptors expressed on Hep G2 cells. Interestingly, the targeting ligands on the nanomotors not only improved their specificity towards cancer cells but also enhanced motility. Compared to the non&#8208;mannosylated nanomotors, mannosylated c&#8208;CLEnM exhibited enhanced motion and higher targeting efficiency to cells in glucose&#8208;containing ionic environments. The unexpected acceleration in speed resulted from the surface modification of these nanomotors with a glycopolymer layer, which increased the zeta potential and created a shielding effect that mitigated the influence of the surrounding ions. This nanomotor design highlights the synergistic effect of functional glycopolymer&#8208;modification on cellular uptake, adding an additional level of control to nanomotors for application in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Chemistry Development for Sodium&#8208;Based Batteries: A Blueprint from Lithium or a Step Towards Originality?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, electrolyte design for sodium&#8208;based batteries is largely inherited from their lithium&#8208;based counterparts, which often present critical challenges that hinder forging new perspectives and thus further improvements. This work delves into the key properties of representative sodium and lithium&#8208;based electrolytes, encompassing prevailing salt anions. It aims to evaluate the impact of cation chemistry, including their nature and the degree of interactions with counter anions, thereby bridging the gap in effectively transferring the know&#8208;how accumulated in lithium batteries to sodium&#8208;based batteries. The results demonstrate that the unique impact of salt anions on the properties of metal&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is tightly correlated with the nature of metal cations. By synchronizing the anionic structures with the critical feature of sodium cations, the solvating dynamics and transport properties, chemical stability, aluminum corrosion behavior, and other key properties of the electrolytes could be finely tuned to fit the specific requirements of advanced sodium&#8208;based batteries. This work gives an in&#8208;depth insight into the chemical and physical features of sodium&#8208;based electrolytes, with a potential avenue to accelerate the deployment of high&#8208;performance sodium batteries and simultaneously inspire and guide the design of other electrolytes for emerging mono&#8208; and multi&#8208;valent cations&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Ligand Design and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Isoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of rac&#8208;&#223;&#8208;Butyrolactone&#160;using Salan and Salalen Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report the influence of the ligand framework on the isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of rac&#8208;&#946;&#8208;butyrolactone using highly active in situ generated salan [ONNO]H2 and salalen [ONNO]H rare&#8208;earth metal complexes. The stereochemistry was found to be highly dependent on the ortho&#8208;substituents, enabling the synthesis of either isotactic poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) (up to Pm = 0.92) or syndiotactic PHB (up to Pr = 0.91). To obtain further information on the mechanism of the isoselective ROP, which exhibits an enantiomorphic site control, the new hybrid Y[ONNO]H(N(SiHMe2)2)(THF) complex was isolated and characterized via NMR, DFT and mass&#8208;spectrometry experiments. The impact of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) was demonstrated by the addition of NCI inhibitors. Kinetic studies revealed a secondary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.14, indicating that the pre&#8208;coordination of the monomer plays a significant role in the mechanism. These findings provide a foundation for the future design of catalysts for isoselective ROP.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobicity&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Peptide Nanotubes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;conjugated peptides are attractive building blocks for the construction of new nanomaterials. However, the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of these materials remains a major limitation to their wider utilization. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fine&#8208;tune the assembly of water&#8208;soluble hydrophilic polymer&#8208;conjugated cyclic peptides by incorporating a defined, short hydrocarbon linker between the polymer and peptide. This addition creates a well&#8208;defined hydrophobic &#8216;inner shell&#8217; that suppresses water from disrupting the organized peptide hydrogen bond network. Our approach is demonstrated using a series of cyclic peptide&#8208;linker&#8208;PDMA conjugates which were evaluated by asymmetric flow field flow fractionation, small angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations were also used to show how the polymer and the peptide stacks interact and illustrate the impact of this hydrophobic inner shell approach. This strategy provides a modular approach to fine control the nanotube self&#8208;assembling behavior. We expect that this technique will improve the versatility of peptide nanotubes for the engineering of advanced nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Robust Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries show great promise for energy storage, but are plagued by poor cycling stability, which can be attributed to unfavorable electrode/electrolyte interphases for both anode and cathode. Here we design and achieve the anion&#8208;moderate solvation structure based interconnected clusters in electrolyte by regulating the interactions of solvent with Li+ and diluent to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases simultaneously for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;SPAN batteries. The optimal electrolyte endows Li plating/stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.47% at 1 mA cm&#8211;2 in Li||Cu cells. The Li&#8211;SPAN batteries show excellent cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 94.21% after 1215 cycles. Moreover, the assembled pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;SPAN battery under limited electrolyte condition (2.40 g Ah&#8211;1) achieves a capacity of 3.75 Ah, corresponding to a high energy density of 180 Wh kg&#8211;1 based on the total mass of the battery. This work provides a good electrolyte design principle to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases for batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing molecular recognition for small molecule&#8208;mediated, reversible photochemical control over mRNA translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical probes that control the function of complex RNA molecules offer unique opportunities to interrogate biological systems. In this study, we demonstrate that a small molecule ligand selectively recognizes and undergoes traceless, reversible photocrosslinking to PreQ1 RNA aptamers. This effect is selective and dependent on both the chemical structure and RNA sequence/structure. A homogeneously modified, caged mRNA construct containing a PreQ1 aptamer and an eGFP or wild type p53 coding sequence displayed repressed translation in vitro or in cells until irradiated with 302 nm light, resulting in cleavage of the photocage and restoration of translation. This method demonstrates for the first time that aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition of a small molecule ligand can be used to precisely and photochemically activate the translation of a complex mRNA in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Chromophores of Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert low&#8208;concentration CO2 into the value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is particularly interesting yet remains highly challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized three metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) through the Schiff&#8208;base condensation reactions between trinuclear copper complex and different BDP&#8208;based chromophores (BDP = 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (15%) to HCOO&#8208;. As a result, MCOF&#8208;ANT containing anthracene (ANT) group achieves the highest HCOO&#8208; production rate of 1658 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (HCOO&#8208; selectivity, ~100%) in the absence of any additional noble&#8208;metal photosensitizers under a laboratory light source, which is 7.2 and 2.1 times higher than those of MCOF&#8208;Ph and MCOF&#8208;Nap with phenyl (Ph) and naphthalene (Nap) groups, respectively. Furthermore, MCOF&#8208;ANT also exhibits an excellent photocatalytic activity for the reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (15%) to HCOO&#8208; under natural sunlight, with a HCOO&#8208; production rate of 1239 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (HCOO&#8208; selectivity, ~100%). Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the presence of ANT in MCOF&#8208;ANT is favorable to the visible&#8208;light harvesting and charge separation, as well as the formation of *OCO intermediate, which clearly accounts for its superior catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Potassium Tetraiodatoiodate(III) Iodate(V): A Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Exceptional Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Full&#8208;Wavelength Phase Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nonlinear optical materials with large nonlinear optical susceptibilities, wide transmission ranges, and comprehensive full&#8208;wavelength phase matching capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized a novel potassium tetraiodatoiodate(III) iodate(V) via an in situ reduction and complexation reaction. The resulting compound, K2[IIII(IVO3)4]IVO3, exhibits exceptional second harmonic generation responses (21.6KH2PO4 at 1064 nm, 1.0KTiOPO4 at 2050 nm), a wide transparency range from the visible to the mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths (0.37&#8211;6.05 &#956;m and 7.03&#8211;13.40&#160;&#956;m), and a high birefringence (0.358 at 543 nm) to achieve full&#8208;wavelength phase matching. These properties are primarily ascribed to the synergistic substantial hyperpolarizability and polarizability anisotropy exhibited by the [IIII(IVO3)4]&#8722; complex ions, which comprise square&#8208;planar coordinated trivalent iodine and optimally arranged iodate ligands. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of nonmetallic cation centered coordination entities in influencing linear and nonlinear optical properties, a discovery that has significant implications for the development of innovative inorganic functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the chirality of Metallo&#8208;cages by Manipulating the Stereochemistry of the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control over the chirality of metallo&#8208;cages by maniplating the stereochemistry of metal centers is important in many practical applications, but is extremely challenging. In this study, two isostructural metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra (1&#8208;ZnII12L18 and 2&#8208;CdII12L18) have been assembled using ligand L1 and two kinds of metal ions (ZnII and CdII) with similar coordination lability. The chiral&#8208;induction by the same guests (D&#8208;/L&#8208;camphorsulfonate, D&#8208;/L&#8208;SCS) results in a completely opposing stereochemical output of 1 and 2: D&#8208;SCS induced host&#8208;guest complex of [D&#8208;SCS&#8834;&#916;12&#8208;1] and [D&#8208;SCS&#8834;&#923;12&#8208;2], respectively, with reverse handedness. The distinct stereochemical configuration of metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra can be manipulated by participant metal ions that exhibit similar dynamics. Furthermore, a subtle variation of the ligand peripheral substituent group facilitates spontaneous resolution of metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra 3&#8208;ZnII12L28 from a racemic mixture as (R24, &#923;12)&#8208;3/(S24, &#916;12)&#8208;3 enantiopure entities. The dynamic stereochemistry of MII12L8 cuboctahedra described in this work allows a chiral manipulation based on the nature of metal centers and ligands, enabling the design and control of the chirality of metallo&#8208;cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Removing &#945;&#8208;H in Carboxylate&#8208;based Electrolytes for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although carboxylate esters greatly improve the cold weather performance of graphite&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries utilized in arctic expeditions, the underlying cause of the incompatibility between carboxylates and lithium (Li) anodes has not been sufficiently explained, resulting in the greatly restricted usage of carboxylate in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we reveal the serious parasitic reactions between carboxylate &#945;&#8208;H atoms and Li metal are the culprits that render carboxylate&#8208;based ineffectiveness for LMBs. By replacing all &#945;&#8208;H atoms with fluorine atoms and methyl groups, we successfully construct inert carboxylates and find the ions/molecules distribution in electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer (EDL) can be manipulated at a molecular&#8208;level. The unique structure ensuring more anions are positioned closer to the Li surface in the EDL of the inert carboxylate&#8208;based electrolyte, the morphology of the deposited Li is significantly regulated and the chemical corrosion gets effectively inhibited. As a consequence of remarkable extending lifespan of carboxylate&#8208;based LMBs with routine salt concentration and few additives. More generally, using carboxylates lacking &#945;&#8208;H atoms offers a realistic approach to increase the variety of solvents that can be used in LMBs electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens Enable Optical Logic Gates toward Lighting, Scintillators and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pressure&#8208;induced emission luminogens (PIEgens) opened the door to highly emissive materials. However, the high&#8208;pressure phase with excellent optoelectrical properties is difficult to be stabilized at ambient conditions, seriously limiting the practical applications. Here, we firstly lighted up non&#8208;emissive zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halide (C25H22P)2SnCl6 via pressure engineering, ultimately yielding the bright emission. Note that the quenched (C25H22P)2SnCl6 after pressure treatment of 20.0 GPa exhibited the very bright blue&#8208;white emission. This irreversible photoluminescence (PL) transition was associated with the irreversible amorphization by increasing the potential barrier of phase transition through the steric hindrance effect. The increased distortion of inorganic octahedra and the enhanced hydrogen bond interaction within the amorphous (C25H22P)2SnCl6 after pressure treatment were responsible for the bright emission. Thus pressure&#8208;triggered PL turn&#8208;on behavior can serve as a robust optical switchable logic gate from the initially dark state &#8220;0&#8221; to the bright state &#8220;1&#8221;. Furthermore, the pressure&#8208;treated (C25H22P)2SnCl6 exhibited an unexpected excitation&#8208;dependent emission. The unique characteristic of &#8220;PIE&#8221; with different colors can be decoded the Morse code encrypted with the pressure&#8208;treated (C25H22P)2SnCl6 and different excitations. The quenched (C25H22P)2SnCl6&#8208;based phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs), X&#8208;ray dose rate detection and centimeter&#8208;level patterns highlighted great potentials in lighting, display, scintillators, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Atom Migration Dominates Anomalous Reversible Oxidation of Ru Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidation is a ubiquitous reaction in nature. For most metals (especially metal nanoparticles), they will be completely oxidized under suitable conditions, except ruthenium (Ru). In this work, in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy (in&#8208;situ TEM) and ex&#8208;situ spectroscopy were employed to investigate the oxidation process of Ru nanosheets. &#160;Ex&#8208;situ spectroscopic analysis demonstrates the incomplete oxidation of Ru nanosheets to RuO&#8322;, while the in&#8208;situ TEM observations uncover an anomalous reverse phase transformation from the oxidized to metallic phase during oxidation. Combined with theoretical calculations, the oxygen atom migration dominates the reversible oxidation process, strikingly distinct from the unidirectional oxidation pathways in conventional metallic systems. The as&#8208;generated abundant Ru&#8208;RuO2 heterointerfaces formed through reversible oxidation provide a wealth of active sites for electrochemical alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the study not only lays a foundation for the understanding complex dynamic oxidation processes, but also offers new insights into for the design of nanocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Nickel&#8208;catalyzed Hydroarylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes for the Synthesis of the ArCF2&#8208; Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The incorporation of fluorine and fluorinated functional groups into organic molecules alters their physicochemical properties, thereby facilitating the advancement of novel therapeutics, agricultural chemicals, biological probes, and materials. Nevertheless, there remains a deficiency of methodologies for the catalytic synthesis of certain significant fluorine&#8208;containing groups, such as ArCF2&#8208;, under mild conditions utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metals. Herein, we report a method for the regioselective hydroarylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under mild conditions with the aid of Ni&#8208;H intermediate catalysis, which is capable of efficiently synthesizing compounds containing the ArCF2&#8208; structural motifs and possesses good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Cold&#8208;Optimized Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries: Enhanced Stability at &#8208;5&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have been extensively studied under room and ultralow temperature conditions. However, mechanism studies at intermediate temperature ranges remain limited. In this work, we investigate the electrochemical performance of an AZIB using a commonly employed 3 M ZnSO4 electrolyte across the intermediate temperature range of 25 to &#8208;15 &#176;C. Notably, we find that the battery with a double hydroxide cathode exhibits optimized performance at &#8208;5 &#176;C, demonstrating significantly enhanced cycling stability compared to 25 &#176;C. Mechanistic studies reveal that unfavorable H+&#8208;associated reactions at both the cathode and anode are effectively alleviated at &#8208;5 &#176;C, contributing to improved cycling stability. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses show that changes in the electrolyte environment at &#8208;5 &#176;C&#8212;such as reduced electrochemical activity of H2O, increased H&#8208;bond strength, and decreased total number of H bonds&#8212;impede H+ diffusion through the H&#8208;bond network via the Grotthuss mechanism. These effects collectively suppress harmful H+&#8208;associated reactions, allowing Zn2+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion to dominate the charge storage process. This work provides valuable insights into the enhanced performance of AZIBs at sub&#8208;low temperatures and presents opportunities for extending battery operation in near&#8208;freezing environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Self&#8208;Fenton&#160;Reaction Mediated by Silver Single Atom&#160;and Cluster&#160;Photocatalysts for Highly Selective Generation of Singlet Oxygen toward Efficient Organic Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The persistent organic pollutants in wastewater have caused the heavy threat to ecosystems and humans, but selective removal of these pollutants still faces challenges due to low efficiency, extra addition of oxidation agents and many highly toxic intermediate products. Herein, we report an efficient fast kinetic conversion via a photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like system of *OOH intermediate&#8208;involved oxidation pathway with high selection generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) from the novel in&#8208;situ H2O2 heterolytic activation route for the first time. The single&#8208;atom and cluster doped zinc oxide (AgSA&#8208;AgC/ZnO) was successfully synthesized to achieve the 100 % degradation yield and 80 % total of carbon (TOC) of the p&#8208;chlorophenol (4&#8208;CP) as the typical pollutant under solar&#8208;light irradiation and exhibit long&#8208;term activity in a self&#8208;design photo&#8208;Filter reactor for 4&#8208;CP degradation. It was attributed to the accelerated cycles from Aghigh&#948;+ site to Aglow&#948;+ site in Fenton&#8208;like catalysis achieving the rapid selection conversion from the H2O2 heterolytic cleavage to ~100 % 1O2 via the intermediate *OOH at the Ag SA sites for ring&#8208;opening reaction and reactive H* at the Ag clusters sites for dechlorination reaction, respectively. This discovery gives the deep understanding of the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction through in&#8208;situ cycles of variable metals for the organic contaminants treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorophores Nucleate and Stabilize Collagen Triple Helices &#8211; En Route to Better Diagnostic Tools for Fibrosis and Tissue Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescently labeled collagen model peptides (CMPs) are emerging as valuable diagnostic tools for fibrosis and tissue repair. We show that fluorophores markedly impact the folding behavior of CMPs and enhance the stability of the resulting collagen triple helices. Our results highlight that careful selection of the fluorophore is essential when designing CMPs for applications in biology and medicine.








Abstract
Fluorescently labeled collagen model peptides (CMPs) are useful tools for monitoring fibrotic processes and tissue repair. Fine&#8208;tuning the propensity of the CMP to form a collagen triple helix is crucial since only single&#8208;stranded but not triple&#8208;helical CMPs integrate efficiently into damaged or remodeling tissue. Yet the impact of fluorophores on the folding behavior of CMPs and triple helix stability has so far been underappreciated. Here, we show that N&#8208;terminal fluorophores enhance triple helix stability and nucleation. Thermal denaturation and temperature jump experiments showed that triple helix stability and nucleation are proportionally affected by the accessible surface area of the fluorophore. For biological applications, fluorophores with a small surface area are therefore beneficial. Furthermore, we show that fluorophores bearing ionizable groups with an appropriate pKa value, such as commonly used fluorescein, can be used to create pH&#8208;responsive assemblies. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting appropriate fluorophores and spacers when developing fluorescent probes for biological applications.

         <title>In Situ Light&#8208;driven pH Modulation for NMR Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to control pH in NMR samples using light&#8208;activated photoacids. By combining light stimuli with pH&#8208;sensitive molecules, we demonstrate the ability to precisely modulate pH without physically manipulating the sample. This method enables noninvasive pH titration in NMR studies, where pH plays a key role in protein function. Our findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;induced pH control to overcome existing limitations in NMR, providing a powerful tool for advancing protein research under controlled pH conditions.








Abstract
Proton exchange is a fundamental chemical event, and NMR provides the most direct readout of protonation events with site&#8208;specific resolution. Conventional approaches require manual titration of sample pH to collect a series of NMR spectra at different pH values. This requires extensive sample handling and often results in significant sample loss, leading to reduced signal or the need to prepare additional samples. Here, we introduce a novel approach to control pH in NMR samples using water soluble photoacids, which alters the pH of the solution from near neutral to acidic pH upon in situ photo illumination. We show that the solution pH can be precisely controlled by choice of illumination wavelength and intensity, and sufficient protons are released from the photoacid to achieve meaningful pH change in samples where the molecule of interest has significant buffering capacity, such as a&#160;&gt;100&#160;&#181;M protein sample. The pH is monitored in situ using internal standards with pH&#8208;sensitive chemical shifts. This method enables precise, calibrated, and noninvasive change of sample pH within an NMR magnet, dramatically reducing the necessary sample handling. These findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;induced pH control in NMR experiments and increase the robustness and reliability of pH&#8208;dependent studies.

         <title>Catalytic Ring Expansion of Furyl Hydrosilanes: Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Oxasilines as Diels&#8208;Alder Diene Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Ru&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion of readily available silylfurans has been achieved, allowing access to 1,2&#8208;oxasilines in excellent yields. Featuring cyclic dienes with a Si&#9472;O linker, 1,2&#8208;oxasilines display high reactivity in DA cycloaddition with a broad range of electron&#8208;deficient dienophiles. The Si&#9472;O linker could be reserved, transformed or extruded in the DA cycloadducts, enabling flexible assembly of diverse molecular skeletons with high complexity.








Abstract
The development of new methods for aromatic ring&#8208;expansion offers a strategic means of transforming abundant aromatic feedstocks into intricate structures via skeletal editing, thereby unlocking valuable avenues for organic synthesis. We report herein a mild and efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;expansion of 2&#8208;silylfurans to form 1,2&#8208;oxasilines with wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest the reaction proceeds through regioselective insertion of furan double bond into a Ru&#9472;H bond, followed by skeletal rearrangement, 1,2&#8208;hydride transfer, and elimination steps. The resulting 1,2&#8208;oxasilines are electron&#8208;rich cyclic dienes with an extrudable and transformable Si&#9472;O linker, which exhibit unique and versatile reactivity in Diels&#8211;Alder cyclization with electron&#8208;deficient dienophiles, enabling modular assembly of molecular skeletons with higher complexity.

         <title>Isoselenourea&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Pyrazolo&#8208;Heterocycle Synthesis Enabled by Self&#8208;Correcting Amide and Ester Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isoselenourea catalyzed route to fused pyrazolo&#8208;pyridone and &#8208;pyranone heterocycles has been developed. Mechanistic and computational studies highlight the significance of an intermediate amide or ester product derived from 1,2&#8208;addition that can be diverted to the desired pathway through isoselenourea acylation.








Abstract
Pyrazole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of medicinal and agrochemical compounds, and as such, the development of methods for their enantioselective incorporation into molecular scaffolds is highly desirable. This manuscript describes the effective formation of fused pyrazolo&#8208;pyridones and &#8208;pyranones in high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99:1 er) via an isoselenourea (HyperSe) catalyzed enantioselective [3&#160;+&#160;3]&#8208;Michael addition&#8208;cyclization process using readily available pyrazolylsulfonamides or pyrazolones as pronucleophiles and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides as starting materials. Mechanistic analysis indicates an unusual self&#8208;correcting reaction pathway involving preferential [1,2]&#8208;addition of the pronucleophile to initially generate an intermediate amide or ester that can be intercepted by isoselenourea acylation, leading to productive formation of the fused heterocyclic products with high enantiocontrol. The scope and limitations of this process are developed across a range of examples, with insight into the factors leading to the observed enantioselectivity provided by density functional theory (DFT) analysis.

         <title>Spatially Controlled Co&#8208;Delivery of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Agents Using DNA Nanoframeworks for Pancreatic Cancer Precision Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanoframework is constructed via precipitation polymerization, achieving the spatially controlled codelivery of molecular beacon and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, enabling simultaneous specific optical detection and efficient gene therapy. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, the platform demonstrates significant detection&#8208;guided antitumor efficacy, highlighting its potential for precision medicine.








Abstract
Theranostic platforms that integrate diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities offer promising strategies for precision medicine, particularly in the treatment of major diseases. However, the development of platforms capable of achieving spatially controlled detection and therapy at the lesion site remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanoframework that achieve spatially controlled codelivery of molecular beacon (MB) and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), enabling simultaneous specific optical detection and efficient gene therapy for pancreatic cancer. The DNA nanoframeworks are synthesized via precipitation polymerization, utilizing acrylamide&#8208;modified DNA to initiate a hybridization chain reaction that facilitates the effective loading of MB&#8208;extended and sgRNA&#8208;conjugated DNA hairpins. The Cas9 protein is efficiently loaded into the nanoframeworks through phase transition&#8208;induced polymer chain rearrangement, overcoming steric hindrance. Upon aptamer&#8208;mediated internalization into PANC&#8208;1 cells, the overexpressed apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 and ribonuclease H in cancer cells induce site&#8208;specific cleave of MB and DNA&#8211;RNA hybrid duplex, respectively. This cleavage restores fluorescence for specific optical detection, whereas the released Cas9 RNP performs gene editing for efficient therapy. Low fluorescence background and favorable biocompatibility are observed in normal cells. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, the platform demonstrates significant detection&#8208;guided antitumor efficacy, highlighting its potential for precision medicine in cancer therapy.

         <title>Annulated Radical Cations with a C4E2&#8208;Core (E = P, As, Sb): Stable Pnictogen Analogs of Elusive Aryl Radical Anions of Birch Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The benzene radical anion (C6H6)&#9679;&#8211;, possessing a 7&#960;&#8208;electron count, is a crucial intermediate in the Birch reduction and has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Herein, we report the tricyclic pnictogen radical cations [(ADC)E]2[B], [2&#8208;E][B] (ADC = PhC{N(Dipp)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; E = P, As, Sb; [B] = [B1] = B(C6F5)4 or [B2] = {3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}) featuring a central 7&#960;&#8208;electron planar C4E2 ring embedded between two 1,3&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks, as crystalline solids. [2&#8208;E][B] are prepared by one&#8208;electron (1e) oxidations of the corresponding base&#8208;stabilized cyclic pnictinidene compounds [(ADC)E]2 (1&#8208;E). Calculated spin densities (for E = P 76%, As 80%, Sb 88%) and EPR measurements suggest that [2&#8208;E]&#9679;+ are pnictogen&#8208;centered radicals and stabilized by the delocalization of the unpaired electron over the C4E2 ring. The EPR spectra of [2&#8208;E][B] exhibit characteristic signals for S = &#189; systems with clear hyperfine coupling constants for the two similar P, As or Sb nuclei. Further 1e&#8208;oxidations of [2&#8208;E][B] result in the dicationic 6&#960;&#8208;electron C4E2&#8208;species [(ADC)E]2[B]2 [3&#8208;E][B]2, which readily undergo comproportionations with 1&#8208;E to afford [2&#8208;E][B]. The radical reactivity of [2&#8208;E][B2] is shown with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) and diphenyl diselenide (PhSeSePh) in yielding compounds [(ADC)2E{E(TEMPO)}][B2] (4&#8208;E) (E = P, Sb) and [(ADC)2P{P(SePh)}][B2] (5&#8208;P), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Growth of Oligophenylene&#8208;Structures on Graphene for Facile Secondary functionalization.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of graphene derivatives is a common approach to tune material properties for use in various applications. Due to the low reactivity of the unsaturated carbon lattice of graphene, not only are few chemical approaches suitable for successful functionalization, such as those involving highly reactive in situ formed radical species or nitrene and carbene compounds, but also the degree of functionalization is usually limited, modifying only a few percent of the carbon atoms. Typically, uncontrolled side reactions such as homocoupling and oligomerization of newly introduced functional groups can occur instead of direct coupling to the carbon lattice. We want to turn this unwanted side reaction into an advantage and use intentionally formed covalent dendrimeric oligophenylene structures for secondary functionalization. We show that these oligomeric structures can be grown to specific thicknesses and used for further functionalization with bromomethyl groups at high density on the surface. This functionalization opens further avenues for subsequent nucleophilic substitution, as exemplified by the introduction of versatile azide, nitrile, and phosphonate groups. The results presented here are not only applicable to large oligophenylene structures, but also demonstrate that, in principle, single aryl moieties on graphene of any size and density can be successfully functionalized.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolable Three&#8208;coordinate Base&#8208;Stabilized Alumylene: A Precursor of Persistent Acceptor&#8208;Free Monomeric Aluminum Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An isolable monomeric alumylene stabilized by two donating ligands (phosphine and&#160;NHC) has been synthesized. Experimental and theoretical analysis confirms that the&#160;NHC ligand in the Al(I)&#8208;complex is labile and reversibly dissociates from the AlI center&#160;above &#8208;20 &#176;C. Of particular interest, despite being thermodynamically stabilized by the&#160;two ligands, alumylene complex exhibits a high reactivity with a considerably higher&#160;nucleophilicity compared to the mono&#8208;ligated complex. It is interesting to note that the&#160;Al(I)&#8208;complex reacts immediately with N2O at &#8208;90 &#176;C, allowing the synthesis of bisligated aluminum oxide, which is stable up to &#8208;70 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Total Syntheses of Leuconoxine&#8208;Type Alkaloids Enabled by Palladium/Norbornene&#8208;Catalyzed Pyrrole Difunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concise total syntheses of five leuconoxine&#8208;type alkaloids, i.e., chloromelodinine, leuconodine A, leuconodine F, melodinine E, and leucinixine, are achieved through a pyrrole&#8208;centered strategy. The approach features a newly developed palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed pyrrole double C&#8722;H functionalization reaction to generate the core skeleton and a divergent oxidative dearomatization to complete the end game. In addition, no protecting group was employed, and the strategic use of a chloro substituent offers a number of advantages in these syntheses, which could have implications beyond this work. The discovery of an unusual chloro 1,2&#8208;migration reaction enabled the first total synthesis of chloromelodinine E. This work represents the shortest syntheses of these natural products to date with 10&#8208;11 total steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion of Nitriles into a Gold(III)/Carbene Bond: A Direct and Powerful Entry to Imino&#8208;Substituted Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strikingly, very little is known so far about gold(III) carbenes. They have been proposed as key intermediates in a few reactions but remain chemical curiosities. Taking into account the enhanced electrophilicity of cationic Au(III) carbene complexes, we were intrigued by their reactivity with nitriles. Thus, we discovered a simple and efficient entry to imino&#8208;substituted carbenes. The transient (N^C^C)Au(III)&#8592;:CH(dmp)+ carbene readily reacts with acetonitrile, benzonitrile and diisopropyl cyanamide, affording stable and isolable Au(III) carbene complexes. Here, the imino group acts either as a strongly &#960;&#8208;donating or a spectator substituent. Ligand exchange at Au(III) or protodeauration/deprotonation provides access to the corresponding free species which display dual imino&#8208;carbene / nitrile&#8208;ylide reactivity, as substantiated by stoichiometric and catalytic dimerization, O&#8211;H insertion and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Type Two&#8208;Dimensional Poly(arylene vinylene) for Efficient Electron Transport and Sensitive Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene&#8208;linked robust 2D conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;COFs), i.e., layered 2D poly(arylene vinylene)s (2D PAVs), are emerging as promising polymer semiconductors for electronics and photocatalysis. However, achieving narrow optical band gaps and efficient electron transport remains a significant challenge for this class of materials to enhance the device performance. Here, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type 2D PAV (2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, where TBDT = thienyl&#8208;benzodithiophene, IT = s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetraone) synthesized via an Aldol&#8208;type 2D polycondensation approach. Notably, 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT benefits from an effective intralayer donor&#8208;acceptor effect, exhibiting an optical band gap of 1.15 eV, the smallest among the reported 2D c&#8208;COFs and 2D conjugated polymers. Density functional theory calculations reveal a unique electron&#8208;dominating transport for 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, with a strongly dispersive conduction band minimum and, thus, a small effective mass for electrons half that for holes. Additionally, terahertz spectroscopy measurements indicate a high charge mobility of 26&#8201;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at room temperature for the powder sample. Given the high electron&#8208;deficiency of 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT for facile electron injection from hazardous gases and the high&#8208;mobility electron&#8208;dominating transport in the material, we further fabricate chemiresistors from 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, showing ultrasensitive SO2 analyte detection with limit of detection of 0.088 ppb, significantly surpassing the reported chemiresistive SO2 sensors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thoroughly data&#8208;driven review on chemistry&#8211;properties&#8211;applications of aerogels is provided. Aerogel is a category of solid materials having homogeneous, highly porous nanostructures. Unique physicochemical properties of aerogels have attracted much attention in wide fields due to their potentials for energy/environmental issues in the 21st century, while an exponentially increasing number of papers are causing an academic fever and unreliable data issues. Statistical analysis based on an exhaustive literature survey from almost all the papers with &#8220;aerogel&#8221; in their titles reveals a flood of freeze&#8208;dried aerogels mainly consisting of organic polymers and organic&#8208;inorganic composites. Process&#8211;property data from polymer aerogel papers are analyzed by machine&#8208;learning approach aiming to establish data infrastructure toward future aerogel studies. Data&#8208;evidenced critical discussion specifies a tendency in unreliable thermal conductivity data of these papers.</dc:description>

         <title>Peripheral Engineering of Multiple&#8208;Resonance Framework Targeting Efficient Organic Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have emerged as promising candidates for organic laser applications due to the potential for simultaneously achieving large oscillator strength and triplet utilization. In this study, we investigate the impact of peripheral tert&#8208;butyl (t&#8208;Bu)&#8208; and phenyl (Ph)&#8208;substituents on the typical 9&#8208;(phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;3&#8208;carbonitrile (CzBN) MR framework. While these modifications preserve the frontier molecular orbital distribution with large oscillator strengths, they significantly influence excited&#8208;state dynamics and molecular aggregation at even low doping concentrations. Introducing Ph substituents extends the &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension of CzBN, promoting closer molecular packing, detrimental molecular aggregation, and significantly broadening the excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) band, which negatively impacts lasing performance. In contrast, CzBN&#8208;tBu, incorporating t&#8208;Bu groups as non&#8208;conjugated substituents, demonstrated reduced molecular aggregation and a distinct separation between the ESA band and stimulated emission region. Consequently, the optimal distributed feedback lasing performance is achieved by CzBN&#8208;tBu across various doping concentrations, resulting in the lowest lasing threshold of 3.4 &#181;J cm&#8722;2. These findings underscore the impact of inherent aggregation at low doping ratio on lasing activities, highlighting the crucial role of rational peripheral engineering in modulating molecular interactions and excited&#8208;state dynamics, offering design strategies for developing MR lasing molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterionic Dipeptide Surface Functionalization of Detonation Nanodiamond for Enhanced Control in Biological Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing nanoparticles as innovative theranostic agents for biomedical applications requires full control over the material&#8217;s properties to dictate their interactions within a biological environment. Owing to its versatile surface chemistry and high biocompatibility, nanodiamond (ND) represents a promising platform for novel healthcare treatments. To ensure the performance and safety of NDs, their properties and behavior must remain unchanged upon administration, a key challenge in nanomedicine. Recently, zwitterionic surface modifications have emerged as new strategies to substantially improve protein&#8208;repelling properties and biocompatibility of nanomaterials. Using for the first time covalently conjugated zwitterionic dipeptides as surface modulators for ND particles, we were able to provide a readily accessible, reproducible and tunable functionalization. The obtained particles demonstrate enhanced colloidal stability and conservation of particle size over a broad pH range and in different protein&#8208;containing media compared to the starting material. By simple selection of different dipeptides, we can carefully tailor the biocompatibility and cellular uptake of functionalized NDs. We reveal the functionalized NDs&#8217; behavior in biologically relevant 3D organotypic models and how different dipeptide functionalized NDs interact with squamous epithelium ex&#8208;vivo. The results pave the way for various applications, e.g., biosensing, tissue engineering or targeted drug delivery of these highly biologically suitable nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Concentrated Formate via CO2 Electrolysis Integrated with Cl2 Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating CO2 electrolysis with an industrially relevant anodic reaction enhances the economic feasibility and reduces carbon emissions in practical operations. In this study, we present an electrosynthesis strategy that integrates the CO2 reduction reaction to produce concentrated formate solution with the Cl2 formation in cation exchange membrane&#8208;based electrolyzers, scaling from 1 cm2 to 100 cm2 electrode areas. Our process, equipped with two automated pH regulation strategies, achieved selectivities over 80% for formate and 95% for chlorine in a 25 cm2 electrolyzer. Additionally, it demonstrated the ability to achieve formate concentrations up to 5.4 M during extended operation periods, establishing a new benchmark for electrochemical formate/formic acid synthesis. Techno&#8208;economic assessment and life cycle assessment further validated the process' sustainability, demonstrating a realistic path to profitability for valuable chemical production from CO2 even without considering potential subsidies and carbon taxes.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Substituted Porous C2N Frameworks as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a green avenue for decarbonizing the conventional chemical industries. Here, a structure&#8211;selectivity relationship of catalysts is pivotal for the control of a highly selective and active CO2RR pathway. We report the fabrication of an oxygen&#8208;substituted C2N as metal&#8208;free catalyst (O&#8208;C2N) for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with tunable O microenvironment. Combined spectroscopic analysis reveals a fine tailored N&#8208;C&#8208;O moiety in O&#8208;C2N, where C&#8208;O&#8208;C species (e.g. ring in&#8208;plane ether) become the dominant oxygen configurations at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Based on experimental observations, a correlation between the exocyclic O&#8208;substituted N&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208;C moieties and CO selectivity is established, giving clear chemical tools for active structure design. The optimized O&#8208;C2N electrocatalysts with the dominant appearance of C&#8208;O&#8208;C moieties exhibits an outstanding 2e&#8208; CO2RR performance with a CO selectivity up to 94.8%, which can be well maintained in a practical flow&#8208;cell reactor with an adjustable syngas feature.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Homojunction Solar Cells by Buried Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing a strong p&#8208;n junction is an effective strategy to drive the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and boost the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. However, forming p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type semiconductors in metal halide perovskites is not as straightforward as in the archetypal Si by doping electron&#8208;accepting and electron&#8208;donating elements. Here we observe the transition of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type characteristics in a monolithic perovskite layer via buried interface engineering. The perfluorinated copper phthalocyanine (F16CuPc) molecules with strong electronegativity are employed to modify the NiOx/Me&#8208;2PACz substrate, which not only facilitates the crystallization of perovskite, but also induces the formation of p&#8208;type perovskite at its buried interface. We observe a gradual shift of the Fermi level across bandgap from near valence band at perovskite buried interface to near conduction band at perovskite top surface, manifesting the transition of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type within the monolithic perovskite layer. Such p&#8208;n homojunction in a perovskite solar cell provides an extra electric field for accelerating charge carrier transportation and thus enhances the corresponding device photovoltaic performance. The F16CuPc induced perovskite homojunction solar cells achieved a champion efficiency of 25.0% and it retained over 80% of its initial efficiency for more than 1100 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Gels as Active Tools for Reaction Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular gels assembled from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) are fascinating soft materials for use in synthesis, combining aspects of hetero&#8208; and homogeneous systems. The unique combination of environments within a gel offers the ability to control reactivity in new ways. For example, self&#8208;assembly into a gel network can modify the reactivity of catalytic sites on the LMWG. Controlling the assembly of multiple LMWGs can result in integrated gels with orthogonal activities that could not normally co&#8208;exist. Enzymes encapsulated within self&#8208;assembled gels can exhibit superactivity, extending their use into solvent media more appropriate for organic synthesis. Highly reactive species, such as ligand&#8208;free nanoparticles or moisture/air&#8208;sensitive organometallics can be protected within the unique environment of a supramolecular gel, facilitating their use in ambient conditions, potentially opening up the use of such species to non&#8208;specialist researchers. Beyond fundamental chemistry, performing reactions in gels leads to the emerging concept of gels as &#8216;nanoreactors&#8217;. Smart chemical engineering methods are enabling the fabrication of materials and devices for use in a variety of synthetic workflows, potentially transforming the way synthesis is done. In summary, this review provides an overview of key concepts and signposts the way towards future developments of gels as active tools for reaction engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Coordination Induced Crystallization Regulation for Efficient and Stable Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The faster crystallization rate of Sn perovskite compared with Pb perovskite leads to the spatial component inhomogeneity and inferior quality of the Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films, which increases the quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) deficit and accelerates the oxidative degradation of the films, thus undercutting the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells. Herein, we propose a thermodynamic selective strategy to mediate the crystallization rate between the Sn&#8208; and Pb&#8208;based perovskite by introducing methyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (5&#8208;AH) in perovskite precursor solution. The SnI2 competes with PbI2 in coordinating with 5&#8208;AH to form the thermodynamically favored SnI2&#8208;5&#8208;AH adducts with stronger SnI2&#8208;Cl&#8722; according to molecular orbital interactions, thereby delaying the crystallization of Sn&#8208;based perovskite. Such crystallization regulation improves the composition uniformity and the crystallization quality, which effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and reduces the QFLS deficit. Additionally, the strong interaction between Sn2+ and 5&#8208;AH as well as reductive grain boundaries inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+. Therefore, the optimal devices with 5&#8208;AH exhibit an improved PCE of 23.76% with a high voltage of 0.885 V and long&#8208;term stability, maintaining 89% of initial efficiency under continuous irradiation for 1100 h at the maximum power point under AM 1.5G.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose a thermodynamic selective strategy to mediate the crystallization rate between the Sn- and Pb-based perovskite by introducing methyl 5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride (5-AH) in perovskite precursor solution. The SnI2 competes with PbI2 in coordinating with 5-AH to form the thermodynamically favored SnI2-5-AH adducts with stronger SnI2-Cl&#8722; according to molecular orbital interactions, thereby delaying the crystallization of Sn-based perovskite. Such crystallization regulation improves the composition uniformity and the crystallization quality, which effectively suppresses non-radiative recombination and reduces the QFLS deficit.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase engineering plays a crucial role in tuning the physicochemical properties of noble metal nanomaterials. However, synthesis of high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase noble metal nanomaterials remains highly challenging via current wet&#8208;chemical methods. Herein, we develop a unique synthetic methodology to prepare freestanding unconventional hexagonal&#8208;close packed (2H) Rh nanoplates (NPLs) via a rationally designed two&#8208;step strategy. By extracting C from pre&#8208;synthesized rhodium carbide of different sizes and morphology, phase&#8208;controlled synthesis of Rh nanomaterials can be achieved. Impressively, the obtained parallelogram 2H Rh NPLs have high phase purity, well&#8208;defined 2H (0001)h and (10[[EQUATION]]0)h facets, and good thermostability (stable up to 300 &#176;C). In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), the 2H Rh NPLs achieve higher ammonia (NH3) Faradaic efficiency (91.9%) and NH3 yield rate (156.97 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1) with lower overpotentials compared to the conventional face&#8208;centered cubic Rh nanocubes with (100)f facets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional (0001)h surface has energetically favored NO3RR pathway and stronger H*absorption ability compared to the (100)f surface, which may lead to the higher activity and selectivity of NH3 production on 2H Rh NPLs. This work opens new avenues to the rational synthesis of unconventional&#8208;phase metal nanomaterials and provides important guidelines to design high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Interfacial Ion Exchange in Composite Electrolyte to Realize High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycling Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, the poor cross&#8208;phase Li+ transport restricts the rate performance and cycle life of the batteries. Herein, we revealed the Li+ percolation behavior in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based CSEs with Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 filler. The de&#8208;coordination barrier from Li+ clusters determines interfacial Li+ transport capability. We then employed a designed N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetamide (NMTFA) ligand to lower the de&#8208;coordination energy and activate interfacial Li+ exchange, The ionic conductivity is therefore increased from 3.32&#215;10&#8208;4 to 7.30&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1. By tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution process, it was identified that the proportion of interfacial Li+ transport increases from 11% to 26%. The NMTFA also contributes to the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich interphases with electrodes. As a result, the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 solid&#8208;state batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 2400, 3000 and 10000 times at 2, 5 and 10C, respectively, as well as achieve 1000 cycles at 50 &#176;C and 300 cycles at &#8208;30 &#176;C. This work highlights the critical role of interfacial Li+ transport for the CSEs with &#8220;polymer&#8208;Li+ clusters&#8208;filler&#8221; configuration to realize high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Heteronuclear Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites in Ordered Macroporous Architectures for Enhanced C2H4 Production from CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic C2H4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O by utilizing solar energy represents a promising sustainable process, yet its efficiency remains significantly limited. Herein, we proposed a dual&#8208;engineered strategy integrating three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) architectures with heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal active sites to synergistically promote the photocatalytic C2H4 production. As an example, the Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst was synthesized by in situ incorporating Cu single atoms (Cu SAs) into 3DOM In2O3 through a template&#8208;assisted pyrolysis process. The strong interaction between Cu SAs and In2O3 resulted in the formation of charge&#8208;polarized Cu&#8211;In active sites along with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs). 3DOM architectures serving as special nanoreactors displayed significant advantages in promoting CO2 enrichment and confining key intermediates, thereby increasing *CO coverage. Meanwhile, the charge&#8208;polarized Cu&#8208;In active sites effectively mitigated electrostatic repulsion and promoted the formation of *CO+*CHO intermediates, resulting in a thermodynamically spontaneous C&#8208;C coupling step. Therefore, the Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst exhibited robust CO2 reduction to C2H4, achieving high C2H4 evolution rates under various CO2 concentrations, including pure CO2, 10% CO2 in Ar, and 0.04% CO2 in Ar. This work offers a novel strategy for the construction of photocatalysts with tailored microstructures and specific active sites to promote the conversion of CO2 and H2O into multicarbon products.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature and Solvent Dual Switch Photochromic Chiral Ionic Hydrogen Bonded Organic Framework for Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Advanced Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;response encryption materials with temperature control and time resolution have attracted widespread attention due to their unique response characteristics and higher application security. The design and development of photochromic crystalline materials with multiple stimulus responses remain challenging. In this study, we report a pair of responsive photochromic chiral ionic hydrogen bonded organic framework (iHOF) R/S&#8208;iHOF&#8208;19 controlled by both temperature and solvent through charge&#8208;assisted synthesis. The chromophore tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE) acts as an electron donor and (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine (R/S&#8208;DPEN) as an electron acceptor and chiral source. Water and methanol molecules connect the donor and acceptor and interact to build a 3D supramolecular framework. Notably, water and methanol molecules form independent hydrogen&#8208;bonding channels within the iHOF structural framework providing a transfer path for the photoinduced electrons. Surprisingly, the formation of a continuous chiral supramolecular framework by R/S&#8208;DPEN while generating photo&#8208;induced radicals under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at &#8208;20 &#176;C imparts excellent circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) properties to R/S&#8208;iHOF&#8208;19. The glum values reach &#8208;1.8 &#215; 10&#8208;3 and +3.75 &#215; 10&#8208;3, respectively, and show an enhancement of the circular polarisation of light with decreasing temperature. This CPL with unique low&#8208;temperature stimulus&#8208;responsive photochromism provides new guidance and perspectives for the development of information security and multiple encryption materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual MurC Ligase and Peptidoglycan Discovered in Lachnospiraceae Using a Fluorescent&#160; L&#8208;Amino Acid Based Selective Labeling Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing selective labeling probes for specific bacterial taxa can not only facilitate the study of target bacteria but also deepen our understanding of the microbial diversity at structural and molecular levels. The availability of such probes, however, remains very limited. In this study, by exploiting the variation of amino acids in peptidoglycan stem peptide, we designed a fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid probe and found that it could&#160;selectively target the family Lachnospiraceae (a major Gram&#8208;positive family in murine gut microbiome) in vivo. The following in vitro test using two Roseburia species validated the probe's labeling. We then discovered that the labeling site was the first amino acid (L&#8208;alanine in most bacteria), which links the stem peptide with&#160;N&#8208;acetylmuramic acid, a process catalyzed by a highly conserved enzyme MurC. Enzyme assay of Roseburia MurC demonstrated its ability to conjugate a fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid and other non&#8208;L&#8208;Ala amino acids to UPD&#8208;N&#8208;acetylmuramic acid. Subsequent X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis uncovered a substantially enlarged inner space in this enzyme, which can partially explain its tolerance to these atypical substrates. The resulting unusual peptidoglycan structures lead to significantly reduced activation of the NOD immune receptors, suggesting a new mechanism for the host to accommodate these highly abundant commensals.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Coordinated Electrolytes for Fast&#8208;charging and Low&#8208;temperature Energy&#8208;dense Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes are known as the dominant factors for fast&#8208;charging affordability and low&#8208;temperature capability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the current electrolytes can hardly simultaneously satisfy all the required characteristics, including sufficient ion transport, high oxidation/reduction interfacial stability, and fast de&#8208;solvation process over a wide&#8208;temperature range. Here, we report a solution by designing electrolyte solvents that coordinate with Li+ in steric configuration. The steric coordinated electrolytes (SCEs) can overcome the dilemma of quasi&#8208;planer coordinated ether electrolytes that has to be weakly coordinated with Li+ to avoid solvent co&#8208;intercalation towards graphite (Gr) anode, therefore enabling the merits including sufficiently dissociation of Li&#8208;salt with high ionic conductivity, low de&#8208;solvation energy, and forming electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with low energy barrier.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrolytes are known as the dominant factors for fast-charging affordability and low-temperature capability of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the current electrolytes can hardly simultaneously satisfy all the required characteristics, including sufficient ion transport, high oxidation/reduction interfacial stability, and fast de-solvation process over a wide-temperature range. Here, we report a solution by designing electrolyte solvents that coordinate with Li+ in steric configuration. The steric coordinated electrolytes (SCEs) can overcome the dilemma of quasi-planer coordinated ether electrolytes that has to be weakly coordinated with Li+ to avoid solvent co-intercalation towards graphite (Gr) anode, therefore enabling the merits including sufficiently dissociation of Li-salt with high ionic conductivity, low de-solvation energy, and forming electrode-electrolyte interphase with low energy barrier. As results, the SCEs with only single-salt and single-solvent (trimethoxymethane) achieve fast kinetics towards Gr anode and high oxidation stability. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Gr LIBs can reach 80% state of the charge in 6 min, and the Ah-level energy-dense pouch cells (4.5-volt) retain 82.96% (500 cycles) and 85.94% (200 cycles) of initial capacities at room temperature and -20&#176;C, respectively. Our work deepens the fundamental understanding of Li-ion solvation structures and affords an effective approach to design sustainable fluro-free electrolytes for battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Equilibrium in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Supported Transition Metal Complexes: Selective Isolation of Multinuclear Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The AgI&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes (3a,b) derived from a bis(NHC) ligand 1, which exhibit a temperature&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent equilibrium between the trinuclear and tetranuclear forms has been successfully isolated, that is slow on NMR time scale. Intriguingly, by freezing this slow equilibrium, facilitated by strong and stable H&#8208;bonding, we could achieve selective isolation of the tetranuclear species (3a,b&#8208;II). On the other hand, encapsulation of an anionic guest, ClO4, led to exclusive formation of the guest encapsulated trinuclear AgI&#8208;NHC complex, 3a&#8208;I. This is unprecedented and marks the first instance where selective isolation of both the species involved in an equilibrium using a C&#8208;donor ligand could be attained. In contrast, distinct behavior was observed with the AuI&#8208;ion, possessing the same linear geometry however with stronger M&#8208;CNHC bonds. In this context, a stable non&#8208;exchangeable &#8776; 1:1 mixture (4a,b) of the tri&#8208; and tetranuclear AuI&#8208;NHC complexes were obtained via transmetalation of both the equilibrating (3a,b) and the H&#8208;bonded tetranuclear AgI&#8208;NHC complexes (3a,b&#8208;II). Moreover, by aptly adjusting the reaction parameters of transmetalation process, the trinuclear AuI&#8208;NHC complex (4a,b&#8208;I) could indeed be obtained selectively. Overall, this study highlights a pioneering approach for the control of an equilibrium between different nuclearity metallo&#8208;supramolecular species engaging C&#8208;donor ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Surface Lattice On&#8208; (0&lt;n&lt;2) for Long&#8208;Term Durability of LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The instability of surface lattice On&#8208;&#160;(0&lt;n&lt;2) in the charged LiCoO&#8322;&#160;(LCO) limits its long&#8208;term cycling stability&#160;beyond 4.55 V vs. Li/Li&#8314;. Herein, the spinel and rock&#8208;salt (RS) phases are constructed on the&#160;LCO surface to stabilize lattice On&#8208;, namely S&#8208;LCO and R&#8208;LCO, respectively.&#160;Upon long&#8208;term cycling at 4.6 V, the loss of lattice On&#8208;&#160;leads to a progressive deterioration of surface spinel phase, which ultimately transfers to&#160;a strong Li+&#8208;blocking phase. In contrast,&#160;for R&#8208;LCO, the surface lattice On&#8208;&#160;in the&#160;RS phase&#160;retains stable in&#160;long&#8208;term cycles. Theoretical calculations reveal that the migration barriers of lattice On&#8208;&#160;are significantly higher in the RS phase than that in the spinel&#160;phase. Due to the stabilized surface lattice On&#8208;, the R&#8208;LCO||Li cell shows a impressive capacity&#160;retention&#160;of&#160;78.6%&#160;in&#160;1000 cycles at 4.6 V (current of 1 C), and superior floating charge durability at 45&#8451;.&#160;This study highlights the importance of surface structure tailoring&#160;in developing the&#160;advanced LCO cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ruthenium(II) Complex Inhibits BRD4 for Synergistic Seno&#8208; and Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy in Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug resistance is a significant challenge for tumor therapy. Activating immunity is an effective method to combat drug&#8208;resistant tumors. Utilizing metallic chemotherapeutic agents to induce non&#8208;apoptotic programmed cell death is a practical approach to stimulate immunity. Besides, triggering tumor cell senescence, named senotherapy, is also an effective but often ignored method to induce immune responses. Despite some progress, reports on metallic immunotherapeutic stimuli are sparse and mainly delve into the level of organelle targeting, with vague drug&#8211;target mechanisms. Here, we report a Ru(II) complex (Ru2c) inhibits BRD4 with high affinity at a nanomolar constant. After encapsulated in to biotin&#8208;DNA cage, Ru2@biotin&#8208;DNA cage was demonstrated to kill drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells through a synergistic apoptosis&#8208;ferroptosis&#8208;senescence pathway, exhibiting 51&#8208;fold anticancer activity compared to the commercial inhibitor JQ&#8208;1. Ru2c effectively erased drug&#8208;resistant tumors and activated innate and acquired immunity in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, Ru2c is the first metal&#8208;based BRD4 inhibitor to achieve synergistic seno&#8208;immunotherapy and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular photoswitches are used for precise and reversible control over the properties and function of chemical, biological and material systems, offering exceptional spatiotemporal control. Their current development focuses on enabling operation with non&#8208;damaging and deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating visible/near&#8208;IR light. In this context, tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions play a leading role thanks to their unique photophysical properties and easily modifiable structure. However, it is only recently that synthetic approaches to those sterically demanding systems have been established and their structure&#8208;photochemistry relations have been understood to provide general rules for their tuning to a given application. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of this family of molecular photoswitches, providing an analysis of their photophysical properties, followed by a discussion of the available synthetic methodologies. Finally, we showcase the versatility of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions for enabling light&#8208;control in biological and material sciences, providing multiple insights for future application.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722; Revisited: The Surprisingly Stable Uncoordinated Pentaphospholide Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of [2.2.2]cryptand to alkali metal heptaphosphides M3P7 (M = Na, K) leads to the formation of the salts [M([2.2.2]cryptand)][cyclo&#8208;P5]. Although the cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722; anion is spectroscopically known since the 1980s it was so far prepared and handled only in solution. By complexing the alkali metal cation with [2.2.2]cryptand, the product was found to be surprisingly stable in the solid state. Cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722;, which is isolobal to the well&#8208;known cyclopentadienide anion, was now characterized crystallographically for the first time. The structural elucidation proves its planar D5h symmetry, not only as ligand in different sandwich complexes but also in its uncoordinated form. Cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722; was further characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy in solution and in the solid&#8208;state by Raman and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy. Accompanying DFT studies were performed to support the experimental results.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The addition of [2.2.2]cryptand to alkali metal heptaphosphides M3P7 (M = Na, K) leads to the formation of the salts [M([2.2.2]cryptand)][cyclo-P5]. Although the cyclo-P5&#8722; anion is spectroscopically known since the 1980s it was so far prepared and handled only in solution. By complexing the alkali metal cation with [2.2.2]cryptand, the product was found to be surprisingly stable in the solid state. Cyclo-P5&#8722;, which is isolobal to the well-known cyclopentadienide anion, was now characterized crystallographically for the first time. The structural elucidation proves its planar D5h symmetry, not only as ligand in different sandwich complexes but also in its uncoordinated form. Cyclo-P5&#8722; was further characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy in solution and in the solid-state by Raman and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy. Accompanying DFT studies were performed to support the experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
