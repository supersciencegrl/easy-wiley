         <title>Engineering an Oxygen&#8208;Binding Protein for Photocatalytic CO2 Reductions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>

We report a homogeneous photocatalytic system based on cobalt porphyrin substituted myoglobin (CoMb) for CO2 to CO conversion in water. By optimizing the reaction conditions, our catalysts achieved up to 2000 TON(CO) at low enzyme concentrations, and a product selectivity of 
80&#8201;% with an increased enzyme loading. We show that the efficiencies of CO generation and overall TON(CO) can be improved by introducing positively charged residues near the active site of CoMb.







Abstract
While native CO2&#8208;reducing enzymes display remarkable catalytic efficiency and product selectivity, few artificial biocatalysts have been engineered to allow understanding how the native enzymes work. To address this issue, we report cobalt porphyrin substituted myoglobin (CoMb) as a homogeneous catalyst for photo&#8208;driven CO2 to CO conversion in water. The activity and product selectivity were optimized by varying pH and concentrations of the enzyme and the photosensitizer. Up to 2000 TON(CO) was attained at low enzyme concentrations with low product selectivity (15&#8201;%), while a product selectivity of 74&#8201;% was reached by increasing the enzyme loading but with a compromised TON(CO). The efficiency of CO generation and overall TON(CO) were further improved by introducing positively charged residues (Lys or Arg) near the active stie of CoMb, which demonstrates the value of tuning the enzyme secondary coordination sphere to enhance the CO2&#8208;reducing performance of a protein&#8208;based photocatalytic system.

         <title>Proton Tunneling Distances for Metal Hydrides Formation Manage the Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a series of manganese polypyridine complexes, the intramolecular proton tunnelling distances for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) vary from 2.400 to 2.696&#8197;&#197; while the other structural, energetic, and electronic factors remain essentially similar. The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity of these catalysts is dominated by the intramolecular PTD&#8208;MH and the main product shifts from CO to HCOOH with a PTD&#8208;MH difference of ca. 0.3&#8197;&#197;.







Abstract
A series of manganese polypyridine complexes were prepared as CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Among these catalysts, the intramolecular proton tunneling distance for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) vary from 2.400 to 2.696&#8197;&#197; while the structural, energetic, and electronic factors remain essentially similar to each other. The experimental and theoretical results revealed that the selectivity of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is dominated by the intramolecular PTD&#8208;MH within a difference of ca. 0.3&#8197;&#197;. Specifically, the catalyst functionalized with a pendent phenol group featuring a slightly longer PTD&#8208;MH favors the binding of proton to the [Mn&#8722;CO2] adduct rather than the Mn center and results in ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO product. In contrast, decreasing the PTD&#8208;MH by attaching a dangling tertiary amine in the same catalyst skeleton facilitates the proton binding on the Mn center and switches the product from CO to HCOOH with a selectivity of 86&#8201;%.

         <title>An Optochemical Oxygen Scavenger Enabling Spatiotemporal Control of Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optochemical oxygen scavenging system is reported that enables spatiotemporal control of hypoxia in cellular conditions. In this system, a selenium&#8208;containing rhodamine derivative works as an oxygen scavenging photocatalyst with glutathione as a co&#8208;reductant. This system consumed oxygen quickly and can establish localized hypoxic conditions even in cultured cells, providing a new chemical tool for hypoxia research.







Abstract
We present an optochemical O2 scavenging system that enables precise spatiotemporal control of the level of hypoxia in living cells simply by adjusting the light intensity in the illuminated region. The system employs rhodamine containing a selenium or tellurium atom as an optochemical oxygen scavenger that rapidly consumes O2 by photochemical reaction with glutathione as a coreductant upon visible light irradiation (560&#8211;590&#8197;nm) and has a rapid response time, within a few minutes. The glutathione&#8208;consuming quantum yields of the system were calculated as about 5&#8201;%. The spatiotemporal O2 consuming in cultured cells was visualized with a hypoxia&#8208;responsive fluorescence probe, MAR. Phosphorescence lifetime imaging was applied to confirmed that different light intensities could generate different levels of hypoxia. To illustrate the potential utility of this system for hypoxia research, we show that it can spatiotemporally control calcium ion (Ca2+) influx into HEK293T cells expressing the hypoxia&#8208;responsive Ca2+ channel TRPA1.

         <title>A Metabolic&#8208;Tag&#8208;Based Method for Assessing the Permeation of Small Molecules Across the Mycomembrane in Live Mycobacteria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a method to systematically address the structural determinants of permeability in Mtb. This workflow, Peptidoglycan Accessibility Click&#8208;Mediated AssessmeNt (PAC&#8208;MAN), provides a screening platform to measure the permeation of any molecule that is modified with a small azide handle. When molecules reach the peptidoglycan layer, they react with DBCO (site selectively anchored by metabolic labeling), thus imprinting their permeation.







Abstract
The general lack of permeability of small molecules observed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is most ascribed to its unique cell envelope. More specifically, the outer mycomembrane is hypothesized to be the principal determinant for access of antibiotics to their molecular targets. We describe a novel assay that combines metabolic tagging of the peptidoglycan, which sits directly beneath the mycomembrane, click chemistry of test molecules, and a fluorescent labeling chase step, to measure the permeation of small molecules. We showed that the assay workflow was robust and compatible with high&#8208;throughput analysis in mycobacteria by testing a small panel of azide&#8208;tagged molecules. The general trend is similar across the two types of mycobacteria with some notable exceptions. We anticipate that this assay platform will lay the foundation for medicinal chemistry efforts to understand and improve uptake of both existing drugs and newly&#8208;discovered compounds into mycobacteria.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the basis of the de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways, diverse dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides, which are important but difficult to access, were successfully prepared on a large scale from readily available starting materials. This high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy avoids the need for complicated purification procedures.







Abstract
Deoxythymidine diphosphate (dTDP)&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides are the most diverse sugar nucleotides in nature. They serve as the glycosylation donors of glycosyltransferases to produce various carbohydrate structures in living organisms. However, most of the dTDP&#8208;sugars are difficult to obtain due to synthetic difficulties. The limited availability of dTDP&#8208;sugars has hindered progress in investigating the biosynthesis of carbohydrates and exploring new glycosyltransferases in nature. In this study, based on the de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways, a variety of dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides were successfully prepared in high yields and on a large scale from readily available starting materials. The produced sugar nucleotides could provide effective tools for fundamental research in glycoscience.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Bound Diarylethene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films as Photoactuators with a Directed Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators is presented. The DAE units are assembled in a surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. The light&#8208;induced length changes of the DAE linkers multiply to anisotropic mesoscopic length changes. Due to the architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, here, bending a cantilever and performing work.







Abstract
Molecular machines and responsive materials open a plethora of new opportunities in nanotechnology. We present an oriented crystalline array of diarylethene (DAE)&#8208;based photoactuators, arranged in a way to yield an anisotropic response. The DAE units are assembled, together with a secondary linker, into a monolithic surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) film. By Infrared (IR) and UV/Vis spectroscopy as well as by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, we show that the light&#8208;induced extension changes of the molecular DAE linkers multiply to yield mesoscopic and anisotropic length changes. Due to the special architecture and substrate&#8208;bonding of the SURMOF, these length changes are transferred to the macroscopic scale, leading to the bending of a cantilever and performing work. This research shows the potential of assembling light&#8208;powered molecules into SURMOFs to yield photoactuators with a directed response, presenting a path to advanced actuators.

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution on Electrode&#8208;Supported Ptn Clusters: Ensemble of Hydride States Governs the Size Dependent Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution on size&#8208;selected subnano Pt clusters supported on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) originates from hydride&#8208;like species (ca. 2&#8197;H/Pt), which form at a reductive electrode potential and are distinct from single atoms and bulk Pt. The size dependence of activity and stability were understood based on a grand canonical ensemble representation of the catalyst states and chemical bonding analysis.







Abstract
We report the size&#8208;dependent activity and stability of supported Pt1,4,7,8 for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, and show that clusters outperform polycrystalline Pt in activity, with size&#8208;dependent stability. To understand the size effects, we use DFT calculations to study the structural fluxionality under varying potentials. We show that the clusters can reshape under H coverage and populate an ensemble of states with diverse stoichiometry, structure, and thus reactivity. Both experiment and theory suggest that electrocatalytic species are hydridic states of the clusters (&#8776;2&#8197;H/Pt). An ensemble&#8208;based kinetic model reproduces the experimental activity trend and reveals the role of metastable states. The stability trend is rationalized by chemical bonding analysis. Our joint study demonstrates the potential&#8208; and adsorbate&#8208;coverage&#8208;dependent fluxionality of subnano clusters of different sizes and offers a systematic modeling strategy to tackle the complexities.

         <title>Structurally Simple Osmium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy in the Near Infrared
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osmium&#8208;based polypyridyl complexes have been developed as photosensitizers for one&#8208;photon photodynamic therapy in the near infrared.







Abstract
Five osmium(II) polypyridyl complexes of the general formula [Os(4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2L]2+ were synthesized as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy by varying the nature of the ligand L. Thanks to the pronounced &#960;&#8208;extended structure of the ligands and the heavy atom effect provided by the osmium center, these complexes exhibit a high absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (up to 740&#8197;nm), unlike related ruthenium complexes. This led to a promising phototoxicity in vitro against cancer cells cultured as 2D cell layers but also in multicellular tumor spheroids upon irradiation at 740&#8197;nm. The complex [Os(4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)]2+ was found to be the most efficient against various cancer cell lines, with high phototoxicity indexes. Experiments on CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing BALB/c mice also indicate that the OsII complexes could significantly reduce tumor growth following 740&#8197;nm laser irradiation. The high phototoxicity in the biological window of this structurally simple complex makes it a promising photosensitizer for cancer treatment.

         <title>Carbon Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield Bandgap Emission for Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We perform radical&#8208;assisted synthesis of hexagon&#8208;shaped carbon quantum dots (H&#8208;CQDs) delivering near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield as well as a high electron mobility of up to 0.07&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The H&#8208;CQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes show a high external quantum efficiency of 4.6&#8201;% and a record maximum brightness of over 11&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) feature bright and tunable photoluminescence, solution processability, and low toxicity, showing great potential in optoelectronics. However, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of CQDs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) has not been achieved so far. In this study, we perform radical&#8208;assisted synthesis of hexagon&#8208;shaped CQDs (H&#8208;CQDs) delivering near&#8208;unity PLQY (96&#8201;%). Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the large vertically oriented transition dipole moment of H&#8208;CQDs originating from high symmetry results in nearly 100&#8201;% PLQY. The H&#8208;CQDs also exhibited a high electron mobility of up to 0.07&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. These properties enable the H&#8208;CQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency of 4.6&#8201;% and a record maximum brightness of over 11&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study represents a significant advance that CQDs&#8208;based electroluminescent device can be utilized for potential display and lighting applications.

         <title>Restructuring and Activation of Cu(111) under Electrocatalytic Reduction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potential&#8208; and pH&#8208; dependent restructuring of the Cu(111) surface induced by H adsorption under electrochemical reduction in acidic conditions is decoded by a combination of a grand canonical ensemble representation of surface states and operando electrochemical STM experiments.







Abstract
The dynamic restructuring of Cu surfaces in electroreduction conditions is of fundamental interest in electrocatalysis. We decode the structural dynamics of a Cu(111) electrode under reduction conditions by joint first&#8208;principles calculations and operando electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) experiments. Combining global optimization and grand canonical density functional theory, we unravel the potential&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent restructuring of Cu(111) in acidic electrolyte. At reductive potential, Cu(111) is covered by a high density of H atoms and, below a threshold potential, Cu adatoms are formed on the surface in a (4&#215;4) superstructure, a restructuring unfavorable in vacuum. The strong H adsorption is the driving force for the restructuring, itself induced by the electrode potential. On the restructured surface, barriers for hydrogen evolution reaction steps are low. Restructuring in electroreduction conditions creates highly active Cu adatom sites not present on Cu(111).

         <title>Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries for the Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Biomass Aldehyde Derivatives and Concurrently Enhanced Power Output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of a &#8220;Zn&#8208;organic battery&#8221; and a Cu nanosheet/Cu foil electrocatalyst were presented for the simultaneous efficient energy delivery and semi&#8208;hydrogenation of biomass aldehyde derivatives, achieving an impressive electrochemical performance of 2.00&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maximum power density and 14.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maximum current density.







Abstract
Electricity generation and chemical productions are both critically important for the sustainable development of modern civilization. Here, a novel bifunctional Zn&#8208;organic battery has been established for the concurrent enhanced electricity output and semi&#8208;hydrogenations of a series of biomass aldehyderivatives, for the high value&#8208;added chemical syntheses. Among them, the typical Zn&#8208;furfural (FF) battery equipped with Cu foil&#8208;supported edge&#8208;enriched Cu nanosheets as cathodic electrocatalyst (Cu NS/Cu foil), provides a maximum current density and power density of 14.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 2.00&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and in the meantime, produces high value product, furfural alcohol (FAL). The Cu NS/Cu foil catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance of &#8776;93.5&#8201;% conversion ratio and &#8776;93.1&#8201;% selectivity for FF semi&#8208;hydrogenation at a low potential of &#8208;1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl by using H2O as H source, and shows impressive performance for various biomass aldehyderivatives semi&#8208;hydrogenation.

         <title>The Regioselective Solid&#8208;State Photo&#8208;Mechanochemical Synthesis of Nanographenes with UV light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry and mechanochemistry have been combined to synthesize nanographenes in the complete absence of bulk solvents. The concept is showcased with two reactions&#8212;the Mallory reaction and the cyclodehydrochlorination, both applicable to the intramolecular formation of C&#8722;C bonds. Moreover, the approach can even form these bonds regioselectively in larger systems&#8212;something not possible before in mechanochemistry.







Abstract
Photochemical reactors inherently suffer from the low penetration depth of light and therefore rely on high dilutions to enable chemical reactions. Here we present the first method of UV (ultraviolet) photochemistry in the complete absence of bulk solvents in a ball mill. Triphenylene was synthesized by two routes, the Mallory reaction and the cyclodehydrochlorination (CDHC), resulting in yields of 81 and 92&#8201;%, respectively. The reaction was successfully scaled up to the gram scale and the robustness of the method was demonstrated for several different substrates. Finally, the regioselective assembly of nanographenes by mechanochemistry was demonstrated for larger systems. Thus, the mechanochemical approach presented here provides a powerful new tool for the atomically precise construction of nanographenes.

         <title>GdIII&#8208;19F Distance Measurements for Proteins in Cells by Electron&#8208;Nuclear Double Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
GdIII&#8208;19F magnetic resonance measurements using electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) permit accessing the 1&#8211;1.5&#8197;nm distance range for proteins in human cells.







Abstract
Studies of protein structure and dynamics are usually carried out in dilute buffer solutions, conditions that differ significantly from the crowded environment in the cell. The double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) technique can track proteins&#8217; conformations in the cell by providing distance distributions between two attached spin labels. This technique, however, cannot access distances below 1.8&#8197;nm. Here, we show that GdIII&#8208;19F Mims electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements can cover part of this short range. Low temperature solution and in&#8208;cell ENDOR measurements, complemented with room temperature solution and in&#8208;cell GdIII&#8208;19F PRE (paramagnetic relaxation enhancement) NMR measurements, were performed on fluorinated GB1 and ubiquitin (Ub), spin&#8208;labeled with rigid GdIII tags. The proteins were delivered into human cells via electroporation. The solution and in&#8208;cell derived GdIII&#8208;19F distances were essentially identical and lie in the 1&#8211;1.5&#8197;nm range revealing that both, GB1 and Ub, retained their overall structure in the GdIII and 19F regions in the cell.

         <title>Pore &#8220;Softening&#8221; and Emergence of Breathability Effects of New Keplerate Nano&#8208;Containers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering the porosity of new Keplerate type molecular nano&#8208;containers for the controlled interaction with their external chemical environment is investigated. Their crystal structure has been determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions while the balancing act of kinetic and thermodynamic factors in conjunction with the emergence of amplified pore breathability that govern the functionality of the nano&#8208;containers is discussed.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of porous molecular nanocapsules offer unique opportunities to investigate a range of interesting phenomena and applications. However, to design nanocapsules with pre&#8208;defined properties, thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;property relation is required. Here, we report the self&#8208;assembly of two elusive members of the Keplerate family, [Mo132Se60O312(H2O)72(AcO)30]42&#8722; {Mo132Se60} 1 and [W72Mo60Se60O312(H2O)72(AcO)30]42&#8722; {W72Mo60Se60} 2, that have been synthesised using pentagonal and dimeric ([Mo2O2Se2]2+) building blocks and their structures have been confirmed via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions. Our comparative study involving the uptake of organic ions and the related ligand exchange of various ligand sizes by the {Mo132Se60} and previously reported Keplerates {Mo132O60}, {Mo132S60} based on the ligand exchange rates, revealed the emergence of increased &#8220;breathability&#8221; that dominates over the pore size as we transition from the {Mo132S60} to the &#8220;softer&#8221; {Mo132Se60} molecular nano&#8208;container.

     alt="Pore &#8220;Softening&#8221; and Emergence of Breathability Effects of New Keplerate Nano-Containers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering the porosity of new Keplerate type molecular nano-containers for the controlled interaction with their external chemical environment is investigated. Their crystal structure has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffractions while the balancing act of kinetic and thermodynamic factors in conjunction with the emergence of amplified pore breathability that govern the functionality of the nano-containers is discussed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-assembly of porous molecular nanocapsules offer unique opportunities to investigate a range of interesting phenomena and applications. However, to design nanocapsules with pre-defined properties, thorough understanding of their structure-property relation is required. Here, we report the self-assembly of two elusive members of the Keplerate family, [Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;312&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;72&lt;/sub&gt;(AcO)&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;42&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;} &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and [W&lt;sub&gt;72&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;312&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;72&lt;/sub&gt;(AcO)&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;42&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; {W&lt;sub&gt;72&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;} &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, that have been synthesised using pentagonal and dimeric ([Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) building blocks and their structures have been confirmed via single crystal X-ray diffractions. Our comparative study involving the uptake of organic ions and the related ligand exchange of various ligand sizes by the {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;} and previously reported Keplerates {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;}, {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;} based on the ligand exchange rates, revealed the emergence of increased &#8220;breathability&#8221; that dominates over the pore size as we transition from the {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;} to the &#8220;softer&#8221; {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;} molecular nano-container.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metastable Hexagonal Phase SnO2 Nanoribbons with Active Edge Sites for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hexagonal phase SnO2 nanoribbon with abundant edge&#8208;active sites has been successfully synthesized by microwave&#8208;assisted mechanochemical&#8208;thermal method. Due to its special structure and morphology, the h&#8208;SnO2 catalysts exhibit near 100&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a promising alternative to the energetically intensive anthraquinone process. However, there remain challenges in designing 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR catalysts that meet the application criteria. Here, we successfully adopt a microwave&#8208;assisted mechanochemical&#8208;thermal approach to synthesize hexagonal phase SnO2 (h&#8208;SnO2) nanoribbons with largely exposed edge structures. In 0.1&#8197;M Na2SO4 electrolyte, the h&#8208;SnO2 catalysts achieve the excellent H2O2 selectivity of 99.99&#8201;%. Moreover, when employed as the catalyst in flow cell devices, they exhibit a high yield of 3885.26&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the special crystal structure and morphology, resulting in abundantly exposed edge active sites to convert O2 to H2O2, which is confirmed by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Mechanically Activated Solid&#8208;State Radical Polymerization and Cross&#8208;Linking via Piezocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solventless free radical polymerization of solid vinyl monomers that is mechanically initiated by piezocatalytic BaTiO3 powders is reported. Activating BaTiO3 using hammer strikes and ball milling instigates hydroxyl radical production from surface&#8208;bound water in the solid state. Mechanoredox hydroxyl radicals are then directed to polymerize traditionally incompatible co&#8208;monomers and create cross&#8208;linked polymer resins dictated by mechanical input.







Abstract
Piezocatalysis offers a means to transduce mechanical energy into chemical potential, harnessing physical force to drive redox reactions. Working in the solid state, we show here that piezoelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles can transduce mechanical load into a flux of reactive radical species capable of initiating solid state free radical polymerization. Activation of a BaTiO3 powder by ball milling, striking with a hammer, or repeated compressive loading generates highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), which readily initiate radical chain growth and crosslinking of solid acrylamide, acrylate, methacrylate and styrenic monomers. Control experiments indicate a critical role for chemisorbed water on the BaTiO3 nanoparticle surface, which is oxidized to &#8901;OH via mechanoredox catalysis. The force&#8208;induced production of radicals by compressing dry piezoelectric materials represents a promising new route to harness mechanical energy for solid state radical synthesis.

         <title>Overcoming the Oxygen Dilemma in Photoredox Catalysis: Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Light&#8208;Triggered Peroxynitrite Generation for Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nile blue derivative SNB can be both used as a type I photosensitizer and a near&#8208;infrared photocatalyst, enabling the simultaneous generation of superoxide anions (O2.&#8722;) and nitric oxide (NO) via type I photosensitization and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalysis, respectively. The combination of O2.&#8722; and NO leads to peroxynitrite generation under NIR light irradiation, showing great promise in antibacterial and antibiofilm applications.







Abstract
The peroxynitrite anion (ONOO&#8722;) is closely associated with many diseases and the creation of ONOO&#8722; donors is an essential means of understanding its pathophysiological functions. However, it is challenging to develop ONOO&#8722; donors due to the difficulties in simultaneously producing highly reactive and short&#8208;lived nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;). Here, we report a novel strategy for constructing ONOO&#8722; donors by combining near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated type I photosensitization and photoredox catalysis. The key design using a Nile blue analogue that can serve as both a type I photosensitizer and a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst. Intriguingly, the formation of O2&#8901;&#8722; via type I photosensitization avoids oxygen interference and instead activates nitrobenzofurazan&#8208;based NO donors via oxygen&#8208;tolerant NIR photoredox catalysis. The simultaneous release of O2&#8901;&#8722; and NO leads to ONOO&#8722; release, showing both antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.

         <title>A Diode&#8208;Like Dye&#8208;Cu Anisotropic Junction in a Coordination Polymer as a Logic State Ratchet for Intratumor Redox Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By merging CuII ions and diphenylphenazine carboxylate ligands with discrete HOMO&#8211;LUMO dye sections, a multistable radical cationic coordination polymer with an anisotropic dye&#8208;Cu junction was constructed to achieve a diode&#8208;inspired unidirectional electron transfer and redox logic ratchet for the first time. Additionally, this material showed great potential for intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy.







Abstract
Redox logic materials offer new avenues to modulate intracellular pathologic redox environment area&#8208;specifically, but the unambiguity of redox logic states and their unidirectional and repetitive switchability are challenging to realize. By merging a bistable diisophthalic phenazine dye ligand with CuII salt, a multistable coordination polymer (CP) was constructed, of which the dye&#8208;Cu anisotropic junction achieved the diode&#8208;like unidirectional electron transfer and logic state ratchet for the first time. Radical cationic CP maintained OFF status with low toxicity in healthy tissues, but was reduced to the neutral SERVO state by the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in hypoxic tumors. After photoirradiation, the stabilized charge&#8208;separated ON status promoted photo&#8208;Fenton reaction for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal transduction, and simultaneously recovered the initial state for catalytic signal amplification of ROS, furnishing intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox logic materials offer new avenues to modulate intracellular pathologic redox environment area-specifically, but the unambiguity of redox logic states and their unidirectional and repetitive switchability are challenging to realize. By merging a bistable diisophthalic phenazine dye ligand with Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; salt, a multistable coordination polymer (CP) was constructed, of which the dye-Cu anisotropic junction achieved the diode-like unidirectional electron transfer and logic state ratchet for the first time. Radical cationic CP maintained &lt;b&gt;OFF&lt;/b&gt; status with low toxicity in healthy tissues, but was reduced to the neutral &lt;b&gt;SERVO&lt;/b&gt; state by the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in hypoxic tumors. After photoirradiation, the stabilized charge-separated &lt;b&gt;ON&lt;/b&gt; status promoted photo-Fenton reaction for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal transduction, and simultaneously recovered the initial state for catalytic signal amplification of ROS, furnishing intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative direct arylation polycondensation is firstly adopted to synthesize a high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymer using a newly developed monomer, i.e., 3,6&#8208;di(thiazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole (Tz&#8208;5&#8208;DPP). After n&#8208;doping, the polymer exhibited electric conductivity values up to 8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factors up to 106&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
n&#8208;Type conjugated polymers (CPs) are crucial in the applications of organic electronics. Direct coupling of electron&#8208;deficient C&#8722;H monomer via selective C&#8722;H activation, namely C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative direct arylation polycondensation (Oxi&#8208;DArP), is an ideal approach toward such CPs. Herein, Oxi&#8208;DArP is firstly adopted to synthesize a high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type CP using a newly developed monomer, i.e., 3,6&#8208;di(thiazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole (Tz&#8208;5&#8208;DPP). Tz&#8208;5&#8208;DPP based homopolymer PTz&#8208;5&#8208;DPP with a molecular weight of 22&#8197;kDa has been synthesized via Oxi&#8208;DArP. After n&#8208;doping, PTz&#8208;5&#8208;DPP films exhibited electric conductivity values up to 8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factors (PFs) up to 106&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. Notably, this PF value is the highest for n&#8208;type polymer thermoelectric materials to date. The Oxi&#8208;DArP synthesis and the excellent n&#8208;type performance of the polymer make this work an important step toward the straightforward and sustainable preparation of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Photochemical Activation of Peroxymonosulfate in Xanthene&#8208;Rich Systems for Fenton&#8208;Like Synergistic Decontamination: Efficacy of Proton Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable DPPA system for synergistic decontamination was proposed through selecting EB with xanthene structure as the model dye. The photo&#8208;electron transfer between excited dye and PMS triggered the activation process and significantly enhanced the production of reactive species. It was proved that the PTP was the crucial factor to determine the reactivity of DPPA system, mainly leading to the ISR and IDR of dye molecules.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;free visible light assisted Fenton&#8208;like catalysis offers opportunities to achieve the sustainable water decontamination, but the synergistic decontamination mechanisms are still unclear, especially the effect of proton transfer process (PTP). The conversion of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) in photosensitive dye&#8208;enriched system was detailed. The photo&#8208;electron transfer between excited dye and PMS triggered the efficient activation of PMS and enhanced the production of reactive species. Photochemistry behavior analysis and DFT calculations revealed that PTP was the crucial factor to determine the decontamination performance, leading to the transformation of dye molecules. The excitation process inducing activation of whole system was composed of low energy excitations, and the electrons and holes were almost contributed by LUMO and HOMO. This work provided new ideas for the design of catalyst&#8208;free sustainable system for efficient decontamination.

A new robust palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective alleneamination reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones with propargylic acetates is described. The salient features of this reaction include general substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, good yields and high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carboamination reaction is one of the most significant transformations in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alleneamination of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones with propargylic acetates. This protocol enables the efficient installation of various multisubstituted allene groups onto dihydropyrazoles in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The chiral sulfinamide phosphine ligand Xu&#8208;5 exhibits highly efficient stereoselective control in this protocol. The salient features of this reaction include the readily available starting materials, a broad substrate scope, an easy scale&#8208;up, mild reaction conditions and versatile transformations.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Enhanced O&#8722;H Cleavage in Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of a magnetic field, the spin&#8208;enhanced electrochemical water oxidation was observed on ferrimagnetic Fe3O4. In the nucleophilic attack of FeIV=O by molecular water, the magnetized Fe3O4 catalyst polarizes the spin states of the nucleophilic attacking intermediates, during which spin&#8208;enhanced singlet O&#8722;H cleavage and triplet O&#8722;O bonding occur synergistically.







Abstract
Herein we report the vital role of spin polarization in proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated water oxidation over a magnetized catalyst. During the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over ferrimagnetic Fe3O4, the external magnetic field induced a remarkable increase in the OER current, however, this increment achieved in weakly alkaline pH (pH&#8197;9) was almost 20 times that under strongly alkaline conditions (pH&#8197;14). The results of the surface modification experiment and H/D kinetic isotope effect investigation confirm that, at weakly alkaline pH, during the nucleophilic attack of FeIV=O by molecular water, the magnetized Fe3O4 catalyst polarizes the spin states of the nucleophilic attacking intermediates. The spin&#8208;enhanced singlet O&#8722;H cleavage and triplet O&#8722;O bonding occur synergistically, which promotes the O2 generation more significantly than the strongly alkaline case involving only spin&#8208;enhanced O&#8722;O bonding.

         <title>Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence from Achiral Luminescent Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel near ultraviolet circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with excellent circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) properties are developed, which can sensitize diverse achiral luminescent materials to produce efficient CP&#8208;EL with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art EL efficiencies.







Abstract
Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) is generally produced in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on special CP luminescent (CPL) materials, while common achiral luminescent materials are rarely considered to be capable of direct producing CP&#8208;EL. Herein, near ultraviolet CPL materials with high photoluminescence quantum yields and good CPL dissymmetry factors are developed, which can induce blue to red CPL for various achiral luminescent materials. Strong near ultraviolet CP&#8208;EL with the best external quantum efficiencies (&#951;exts) of 9.0&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;offs are achieved by using them as emitters for CP&#8208;OLEDs. By adopting them as hosts or sensitizers, commercially available yellow&#8208;orange achiral phosphorescence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and multi&#8208;resonance (MR) TADF materials can generate intense CP&#8208;EL, with high dissymmetry factors and outstanding &#951;exts (30.8&#8201;%), demonstrating a simple and universal avenue towards efficient CP&#8208;EL.

         <title>Photosystem II Inspired NiFe&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Efficient Water Oxidation via Second Coordination Sphere Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an electrocatalytic model that is designed to obtain superior oxygen evolution reaction activity (270&#8197;mV at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and cycle stability (over 300&#8197;h) by tuning the proton transfer pathway. The electron&#8208;rich terephthalic acid anion located in the second coordination sphere of the active center can mediate proton transfer pathways by preferentially accepting protons, which reduces the kinetic barrier for O&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
The mismatched fast&#8208;electron&#8208;slow&#8208;proton process in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely restricts the catalytic efficiency. To overcome these issues, accelerating the proton transfer and elucidating the kinetic mechanism are highly sought after. Herein, inspired by photosystem II, we develop a family of OER electrocatalysts with FeO6/NiO6 units and carboxylate anions (TA2&#8722;) in the first and second coordination sphere, respectively. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the metal units and TA2&#8722;, the optimized catalyst delivers superior activity with a low overpotential of 270&#8197;mV at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and excellent cycling stability over 300&#8197;h. A proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;promotion mechanism is proposed by in situ Raman, catalytic tests, and theoretical calculations. The TA2&#8722; (proton acceptor) can mediate proton transfer pathways by preferentially accepting protons, which optimizes the O&#8722;H adsorption/activation process and reduces the kinetic barrier for O&#8722;O bond formation.

         <title>Construction of Acyclic All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;Nonadjacent Stereoelements via Organo/Metal Dual Catalyzed Asymmetric Allenylic Substitution of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic strategy for the asymmetric allenylic substitution of aldehydes, which enables the construction of allene&#8208;containing acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereoelements, has been reported.







Abstract
A method for the asymmetric construction of functionalized acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereoelements has been developed via organo/metal dual catalyzed asymmetric allenylic substitution of branched and linear aldehydes, by developing an unknown acyclic secondary&#8208;secondary diamine as the enabling organocatalyst. Although it is believed that secondary&#8208;secondary diamines are difficult to be used as the organocatalysts in organo/metal dual catalysis, this study demonstrates that such diamines can be successfully combined with a metal catalyst in organo/metal dual catalysis. Our study enables the asymmetric construction of two important classes of motifs which were previously difficult to access, axially chiral allene&#8208;containing acyclic all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereoelements bearing allenyl axial chirality and central chirality, in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>A Simple Colorimetric Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au Tip Sensor with a New Functional Nucleic Acid Probe for Food&#8208;borne Pathogen Salmonella typhimurium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and portable Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au tip sensor was constructed to achieve specific, sensitive, and colorimetric detection of Salmonella typhimurium using an RNase H2&#8208;specific nucleic acid molecule derived from a random&#8208;sequence synthetic nucleic acid pool by in vitro selection.







Abstract
An Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au tip sensor is developed for the detection of Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella), using a new synthetic nucleic acid probe (NAP) as a linker for the immobilization of a DNA&#8208;conjugated Au nanoparticle (AuNP) onto a DNA&#8208;attached thin Au layer inside a pipette tip. In the presence of Salmonella, RNase H2 from Salmonella (STH2) cleaves the NAP and the freed DNA&#8208;conjugated AuNP can be visually detected by a paper strip. This portable biosensor does not require any electronic, electrochemical or optical equipment. It delivers a detection limit of 3.2&#215;103&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 for Salmonella in 1&#8197;h without cell&#8208;culturing or signal amplification and does not show cross&#8208;reactivity with several control bacteria. Further, the sensor reliably detects Salmonella spiked in food samples, such as ground beef and chicken, milk, and eggs. The sensor can be reused and is stable at ambient temperature, showing its potential as a point&#8208;of&#8208;need device for the prevention of food poisoning by Salmonella.

         <title>Precise Synthesis of Optically Active and Thermo&#8208;degradable Poly(trifluoromethyl methylene) with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living polymerization of 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethane gives environmental friendly poly(trifluoromethylmethylene) in high yield with controllable molar mass and low dispersity, which twisted into stable helix with clear circularly polarized luminescence. The high fluorine content results in high hydrophobicity, good resistance to chemical corrosion, high dielectric constant with low dielectric loss.







Abstract
Developing high performance and environment&#8208;friendly fluoropolymers is greatly desired. In this work, we found that 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethane can be polymerized by air&#8208;stable alkyne&#8208;palladium(II) catalysts following a living polymerization mechanism, affording a fluoropolymer, poly(trifluoromethyl methylene) in high yield with controlled molar mass and low dispersity. This polymer bears trifluoromethyl on every main chain atom and thus has good resistance to chemical corrosion, high hydrophobicity, and excellent dielectric constant with low dielectric loss. Due to the steric hindrance between the trifluoromethyl pendants, the synthetic poly(trifluoromethyl methylene) can twist into a stable helix. The one&#8208;handed preferred helices synthesized using chiral PdII&#8208;catalysts exhibit high optical activity and circularly polarized luminescence. Remarkably, such polymer can be completely degraded to (E)&#8208;1,1,1,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobut&#8208;2&#8208;ene at high temperatures (&gt;280&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, taking advantage of the living chain end, the polymer can be further modified.

&lt;p&gt;Living polymerization of 2-diazo-1,1,1-trifluoroethane gives environmental friendly poly(trifluoromethylmethylene) in high yield with controllable molar mass and low dispersity, which twisted into stable helix with clear circularly polarized luminescence. The high fluorine content results in high hydrophobicity, good resistance to chemical corrosion, high dielectric constant with low dielectric loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing high performance and environment-friendly fluoropolymers is greatly desired. In this work, we found that 2-diazo-1,1,1-trifluoroethane can be polymerized by air-stable alkyne-palladium(II) catalysts following a living polymerization mechanism, affording a fluoropolymer, poly(trifluoromethyl methylene) in high yield with controlled molar mass and low dispersity. This polymer bears trifluoromethyl on every main chain atom and thus has good resistance to chemical corrosion, high hydrophobicity, and excellent dielectric constant with low dielectric loss. Due to the steric hindrance between the trifluoromethyl pendants, the synthetic poly(trifluoromethyl methylene) can twist into a stable helix. The one-handed preferred helices synthesized using chiral Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-catalysts exhibit high optical activity and circularly polarized luminescence. Remarkably, such polymer can be completely degraded to (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluorobut-2-ene at high temperatures (&amp;gt;280&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, taking advantage of the living chain end, the polymer can be further modified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Isodesmic C&#8722;H Iodination of Phenylacetic Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isodesmic reactions represent mild alternatives to other chemical transformations that require harsh oxidizing agents or highly reactive intermediates. However, enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization is unknown. Herein, an unprecedented highly enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization to access chiral iodinated phenylacetic Weinreb amides via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution was reported.







Abstract
Isodesmic reactions represent mild alternatives to other chemical transformations that require harsh oxidizing agents or highly reactive intermediates. However, enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization is unknown and enantioselective direct iodination of inert C&#8722;H bond is very rare. Rapid synthesis of chiral aromatic iodides is of significant importance for synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report an unprecedented highly enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization to access chiral iodinated phenylacetic Weinreb amides via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution with PdII catalysis. Importantly, further transformations of the enantioenriched products are readily available at the iodinated or the Weinreb amide position, paving the way of related studies for synthetic and medicinal chemists.

         <title>Mosaic CuI&#8722;CuII&#8722;InIII 2D Perovskites: Pressure&#8208;Dependence of the Intervalence Charge Transfer and a Mechanochemical Alloying Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mosaic perovskites, featuring 3 different octahedral metal sites, allow for adjacent CuI/II sites, which otherwise does not occur in stoichiometric layered perovskites. The CuI/II intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) affords a 30&#8208;GPa reduction in the onset pressure for appreciable conductivity (10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to a CuII perovskite.







Abstract
The perovskite (BA)4[CuII(CuIInIII)0.5]Cl8 (1BA; BA+=butylammonium) allows us to study the high&#8208;pressure structural, optical, and transport properties of a mixed&#8208;valence 2D perovskite. Compressing 1BA reduces the onset energy of CuI/II intervalence charge transfer from 1.2&#8197;eV at ambient pressure to 0.2&#8197;eV at 21&#8197;GPa. The electronic conductivity of 1BA increases by 4 orders of magnitude upon compression to 20&#8197;GPa, when the activation energy for conduction decreases to 0.16&#8197;eV. In contrast, CuII perovskites achieve similar conductivity at &#8776;50&#8197;GPa. The solution&#8208;state synthesis of these perovskites is complicated, with more undesirable side products likely from the precursor mixtures containing three different metal ions. To circumvent this problem, we demonstrate an efficient mechanochemical synthesis to expand this family of halide perovskites with complex composition by simply pulverizing together powders of 2D CuII single perovskites and CuIInIII double perovskites.

Exploiting Ti and Mo diffusion chemistry, a Ni&#8208;rich cathode (LiNi0.9Co0.09Mo0.01O2) featuring a 5&#8197;nm Li2TiO3 coating on the surface, a Mo&#8208;rich Li+/Ni2+ cation&#8208;ordered superlattice at the sub&#8208;surface, and Ti&#8208;doping in bulk is simultaneously constructed by just one&#8208;step calcination. This bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface modified structure feature effectively maintains the structural integrity of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes, thus exhibiting excellent electrochemical stability.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich (Ni&#8805;90&#8201;%) layered cathodes are critical materials for achieving higher&#8208;energy&#8208;density and lower&#8208;cost next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their bulk and interface structural instabilities significantly impair their electrochemical performance, thus hindering their widespread adoption in commercial LIBs. Exploiting Ti and Mo diffusion chemistry, we report one&#8208;step calcination to synthesize bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface modified LiNi0.9Co0.09Mo0.01O2 (NCMo90) featuring a 5&#8197;nm Li2TiO3 coating on the surface, a Mo&#8208;rich Li+/Ni2+ superlattice at the sub&#8208;surface, and Ti&#8208;doping in the bulk. Such a multi&#8208;functional structure effectively maintains its structural integrity upon cycling. As a result, such NCMo90 exhibits a high initial capacity of 221&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, excellent rate performance (184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C), and high capacity retention of 94.0&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles. This work opens a new avenue to developing industry&#8208;applicable Ni&#8208;rich cathodes for next&#8208;generation LIBs.

         <title>Electrocatalytically Activating and Reducing N2 Molecule by Tuning Activity of Local Hydrogen Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically combines computational and experimental investigations and uncovers that N2 molecule can be effectively activated and reduced on electrocatalysts by tuning activity of local hydrogen radical.







Abstract
Decarbonizing N2 conversion is particularly challenging, but essential for sustainable development of industry and agriculture. Herein, we achieve electrocatalytic activation/reduction of N2 on X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C (X=Pd, Ir and Pt) dual&#8208;atom catalysts under ambient condition. We provide solid experimental evidence that local hydrogen radical (H*) generated on the X site of the X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts can participate in the activation/reduction of N2 adsorbed on the Fe site. More importantly, we reveal that the reactivity of X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts for N2 activation/reduction can be well adjusted by the activity of H* generated on the X site, i.e., the interaction between the X&#8722;H bond. Specifically, X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with the weakest X&#8722;H bonding exhibits the highest H* activity, which is beneficial to the subsequent cleavage of X&#8722;H bond for N2 hydrogenation. With the most active H*, the Pd/Fe dual&#8208;atom site promotes the turnover frequency of N2 reduction by up to 10 times compared with the pristine Fe site.

We provide solid experimental evidence that local hydrogen radical (H*) generated on the X site of the X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts can participate in the activation/reduction of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorbed on the Fe site. More importantly, we reveal that the reactivity of X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation/reduction can be well adjusted by the activity of H* generated on the X site, i.e., the interaction between the X&#8722;H bond. Specifically, X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with the weakest X&#8722;H bonding exhibits the highest H* activity, which is beneficial to the subsequent cleavage of X&#8722;H bond for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. With the most active H*, the Pd/Fe dual-atom site promotes the turnover frequency of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction by up to 10 times compared with the pristine Fe site.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective deuteration provides &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dideuterio&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids in excellent enantioselectivity and almost complete deuteration, using deuterated methanol as cheap deuterium source.







Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of amidoacrylates using deuterated methanol afforded &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dideuterio&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino esters in excellent enantiomeric ratios (mostly &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5) and almost complete deuteration (99&#8201;%). The new protocol was used to prepare dideuterio&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid fragments in some drugs. Furthermore, the stereoselective deuteration was applied in a concise synthesis of dideuterio l&#8208;DOPA.

         <title>A Polarized Gel Electrolyte for Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarized gel electrolyte of polyacrylamide&#8208;sodium citric (PAM&#8208;SC) is synthesized for flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries. The polarized &#8722;COO&#8722; functional groups in gel electrolyte not only form an electrical field to suppress Zn dendrite growth, but also prevent water from freezing and evaporating. The FZABs with the PAM&#8208;SC gel electrolyte exhibit long cycling life of 700&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, showing the application prospect under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The development of flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries (FZABs) has attracted broad attention in the field of wearable electronic devices. Gel electrolyte is one of the most important components in FZABs, which is urgent to be optimized to match with Zn anode and adapt to severe climates. In this work, a polarized gel electrolyte of polyacrylamide&#8208;sodium citric (PAM&#8208;SC) is designed for FZABs, in which the SC molecules contain large amount of polarized &#8722;COO&#8722; functional groups. The polarized &#8722;COO&#8722; groups can form an electrical field between gel electrolyte and Zn anode to suppress Zn dendrite growth. Besides, the &#8722;COO&#8722; groups in PAM&#8208;SC can fix H2O molecules, which prevents water from freezing and evaporating. The polarized PAM&#8208;SC hydrogel delivers a high ionic conductivity of 324.68&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and water retention of 96.85&#8201;% after being exposed for 96&#8197;h. FZABs with the PAM&#8208;SC gel electrolyte exhibit long cycling life of 700&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, showing the application prospect under extreme conditions.

         <title>Remote Control of One&#8208;Handed Helicity in Polyacetylenes through Flexible Spacers in Water: Impact of the Spacer Length</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sergeants and soldiers&#8208;type remote control of one&#8208;handed helicity in dynamic helical copolymers of chiral/achiral biphenylylacetylenes was achieved in water as well as in aqueous and nonaqueous organic solvents through intramolecular hydrophobic interactions with a small amount of chiral binaphthyl residues (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) introduced at the terminal of achiral flexible oligo(ethylene glycol) spacers as many as 80&#8197;bonds away from the polymer backbones.







Abstract
We report the unprecedented sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S)&#8208;type remote control of one&#8208;handed helicity in copolymers of chiral/achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing amphiphilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains. A small amount of chiral binaphthyl residues (&#8804;10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) introduced at the terminal of the achiral OEG spacers as many as 80&#8197;bonds away from the polymer backbones induced a complete one&#8208;handed helix in water through preferential intramolecular encapsulation of the binaphthyl groups within a cavity of the copolymers. A fully one&#8208;handed helix can be induced virtually independent of the OEG spacer length and concentrations. At a specific spacer length, however, its helix&#8208;sense was inverted. The copolymers also form an excess one&#8208;handed helix in organic solvents in an OEG spacer&#8208;length dependent manner, yet far from the polymer backbones. We show the superiority of the present covalent&#8208;bond driven S&amp;S&#8208;type remote helicity control over the corresponding noncovalent helicity induction approach.

         <title>Cd/Pt Precursor Solution for Solar H2 Production and in situ Photochemical Synthesis of Pt Single&#8208;atom Decorated CdS Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the use of Cd/Pt precursor solutions for substantially higher photocatalytic H2 production (154.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), thereby eliminating the need for pre&#8208;synthesized photocatalysts for H2 production. Furthermore, in parallel to H2 production, a simplified solar light&#8208;assisted in situ synthesis of Pt single&#8208;atom anchored CdS nanoparticles (PtSA&#8208;CdSIS) has also been demonstrated.







Abstract
Despite extensive efforts to develop high&#8208;performance H2 evolution catalysts, this remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate the use of Cd/Pt precursor solutions for significant photocatalytic H2 production (154.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), removing the need for a pre&#8208;synthesized photocatalyst. In addition, we also report simultaneous in situ synthesis of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored CdS nanoparticles (PtSA&#8208;CdSIS) during photoirradiation. The highly dispersed in situ incorporation of extensive Pt single atoms on CdSIS enables the enhancement of active sites and suppresses charge recombination, which results in exceptionally high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of &#8776;1&#8201;% and an apparent quantum yield of over 91&#8201;% (365&#8197;nm) for H2 production. Our work not only provides a promising strategy for maximising H2 production efficiency but also provides a green process for H2 production and the synthesis of highly photoactive PtSA&#8208;CdSIS nanoparticles.

         <title>Assembly of an A6L6 Anion Trigonal Antiprism and Binding of Glucopyranosides and Polyethylene Glycols (PEGs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appending triphenylphosphine oxide with three bis(urea) moieties has led to a ligand that assembles with phosphate anions to afford an unusual A6L6 trigonal antiprism. This antiprismatic cage features one central cavity and two large outer pockets which can bind monosaccharides or polyethylene glycol molecules (PEG600, PEG1000, and PEG2000), respectively, as confirmed by crystal structure analysis.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) has proven to be a very effective strategy for the construction of polyhedral structures. Here we demonstrate that variation of the &#8220;angle&#8221; of the backbone of C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, from triphenylamine to triphenylphosphine oxide, results in the change of the final construct from an A4L4 tetrahedron to a higher&#8208;nuclearity, A6L6 trigonal antiprism (A=anion, herein PO43&#8722;; L=ligand). Most interestingly, this assembly features a huge hollow internal space that is divided into three compartments: one central cavity and two large outer pockets. This multi&#8208;cavity character enables the binding of different guests, namely monosaccharides or polyethylene glycol molecules (PEG600, PEG1000 and PEG2000), respectively. The results prove that anion coordination by multiple hydrogen bonds may provide both sufficient strength and flexibility, thus making possible the formation of complicated structures with adaptive guest binding ability.

         <title>Stereospecific Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylations to Functionalized Alkenes and C&#8208;Glycosides

A convenient photo&#8208;catalyzed, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed with 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX, VBO) to synthesize di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes with complete E&#8201;:&#8201;Z selectivity. A diastereoselective C&#8208;vinylation of glycosides was also developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a concerted radical coupling pathway.







Abstract
We report an efficient radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling through photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions of 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX, VBO). This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and mild photocatalytic method has excellent functional group tolerance and affords vinylated products in good yields, with complete retention of the alkene configuration. The utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the diastereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;vinyl glycosides. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8722;C bond formation is stereospecific and proceeds through a concerted radical coupling transition state.

         <title>Selective Synthesis and Structural Transformation of a 4&#8208;Ravel Containing Four Crossings and Featuring Cp*Rh/Ir Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented [5+10] icosanuclear molecular 4&#8208;ravels containing four crossings have been generated using a single&#8208;step strategy. This topology is achieved by utilizing parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions with carefully selected naphthoquinoyl Cp*M building blocks and X&#8208;shaped pyridyl ligands.







Abstract
Intricately interwoven topologies are continually being synthesized and are ultimately equally versatile and significant at the nanoscale level; however, reports concerning ravel structures, which are highly entwined new topological species, are extremely rare and fraught with tremendous synthesis challenges. To solve the synthesis problem, a tetrapodontic pyridine ligand L1 with two types of olefinic bond units and two Cp*M&#8208;based building blocks (E1, M=Rh; E2, M=Ir) featuring large conjugated planes was prepared to perform the self&#8208;assembly. Two unprecedented [5+10] icosanuclear molecular 4&#8208;ravels containing four crossings were obtained by parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in a single&#8208;step strategy. Remarkably, reversible structural transformations between the 4&#8208;ravel and the corresponding metallocage could be realized by concentration changes and solvent&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced effects. X&#8208;ray crystallographic data and NMR spectroscopy provide full confirmation of these phenomena.

         <title>Synchronously Manipulating Absorption and Extinction Coefficient of Semiconducting Polymers via Precise Dual&#8208;Acceptor Engineering for NIR&#8208;II Excited Photothermal Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;acceptor engineering was used to synchronously manipulate the absorption and extinction coefficient of semiconducting polymers for the first time. The optimized agent, which exhibits strong NIR&#8208;II absorption with high extinction coefficient and prominent photothermal conversion capability, shows an unprecedented performance in multi&#8208;modal phototheranostics for cancer.







Abstract
Integrating the ultralong excitation wavelength, high extinction coefficient, and prominent photothermal conversion ability into a single photothermal agent is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, a precise dual&#8208;acceptor engineering strategy is exploited for this attempt based on donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type semiconductor polymers by subtly regulating the molar proportions of the two employed electron acceptor moieties featuring different electronic affinity and &#960;&#8208;conjugation degrees, and making full use of the active intramolecular motion&#8208;induced photothermal effect. The optimal polymer SP4 synchronously shows desirable second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) absorption, an extremely high extinction coefficient, and satisfactory photothermal conversion behavior. Consequently, the unprecedented performance of SP4 NPs on 1064&#8197;nm laser&#8208;excited photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor elimination.

Abstract
Fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs) have become one of the significantly strategical flexible energy&#8208;storage materials towards future wearable textile electronics and metaverse technologies. Here, we develop the high&#8208;performance FSCs based on multiscale dot&#8208;wire&#8208;sheet heterostructure microfiber of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/silk nanofibers (NCDs&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/SNFs) hybrids via microfluidic fabrication. Due to the enlarged interlayer spacing, plentiful porous channels, accelerated H+ ion transport dynamics, large electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical strength/flexibility, the NCDs&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/SNFs possesses high volumetric capacitance (2218.7&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and reversible charge&#8211;discharge stability in 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state FSCs present high energy density (57.9&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), good capacitance (1157&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3), long&#8208;life cycles (82.3&#8201;% capacitance retention after 40000&#8197;cycles), which realize the actual energy&#8208;supply applications (powering lamp, watch and toy car).

&lt;p&gt;Fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSCs) have become one of the significantly strategical flexible energy-storage materials towards future wearable textile electronics and metaverse technologies. Here, we develop the high-performance FSCs based on multiscale dot-wire-sheet heterostructure microfiber of nitrogen-doped carbon dots-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;

Due to the enlarged interlayer spacing, plentiful porous channels, accelerated H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion transport dynamics, large electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical strength/flexibility, the NCDs-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;

Furthermore, the solid-state FSCs present high energy density (57.9&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), good capacitance (1157&#8197;F&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), long-life cycles (82.3&#8201;% capacitance retention after 40000&#8197;cycles), which realize the actual energy-supply applications (powering lamp, watch and toy car).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Induced In Situ Michael Addition between Nanoparticles for Pyroptosis and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;o&#8208;gallate (EGCG)&#8211;molybdenum ion coordination nanoparticles were prepared by biomineralization. In cancer cells, they disrupt the redox equilibrium and simultaneously compete for and consume intracellular glutathione (GSH) to form large aggregates, which mechanically disrupt the endosomal and plasma membranes, thus inducing pyroptosis and releasing inflammatory factors for activating immunological responses.







Abstract
Most tumor treatments will fail when ignoring competition and cooperation between each cancer cell and its microenvironment. Inspired by game theory, therapeutic agents can be introduced to compete for intracellular molecules to disrupt the cooperation between molecules and cells. Biomineralized oxidized (&#8722;)&#8208;epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;o&#8208;gallate (EGCG)&#8211;molybdenum ion coordination nanoparticles were prepared for disrupting redox equilibria and simultaneously reacting with intracellular GSH in a Michael addition to form large aggregates that can mechanically disrupt endosomal and plasma membranes, stimulating pyroptosis and anti&#8208;tumor immunological responses for versatile inhibition of different types of tumors. This design disrupts the cooperation between molecules and between cancer and immune cells, achieving an optimal payoff in competition and cooperation in cancer therapy.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Diverse Tetramic Acid Bearing cis&#8208;Decalin Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective endo&#8208;boat intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder (IMDA) reaction and a one&#8208;pot aminolysis/Dieckmann condensation cascade formed the basis for the total synthesis of four natural antibiotics and one hydrogenated natural product derivative, all of which contain a cis&#8208;decalin ring bearing a tetramic acid.







Abstract
We report herein the first total syntheses of four natural antibiotics, vermisporin, PF1052/AB4015&#8208;A, AB4015&#8208;L, AB4015&#8208;B, and one hydrogenated natural product derivative, AB4015&#8208;A2, that all feature a tetramic acid bearing cis&#8208;decalin ring. The construction of the functionalized cis&#8208;decalin ring was achieved by a diastereoselective intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder (IMDA) reaction, which proceeded via a rare endo&#8208;boat transition state. Through an intramolecular neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;oriented strategy, the sterically hindered epoxy group in vermisporin, PF1052/AB4015&#8208;A and AB4015&#8208;L was installed efficiently. A one&#8208;pot aminolysis/Dieckmann condensation cascade using l&#8208;amino acid derivatives afforded the desired tetramic acid structure. The total synthesis led to the unambiguous verification of the absolute configuration of these natural products.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Synthesis of a Fully &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Helical Ladder Polymer and Resolution into a Pair of Enantiomeric Helical Ladders
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative and chemoselective helical ladderization of a rationally designed random&#8208;coil polymer followed by chromatographic enantioseparation has led to a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated optically active helical ladder polymer composed entirely of achiral units. The sufficiently high helix&#8208;inversion barrier makes the helical ladder polymer with an excess of one&#8208;handed helicity thermally stable, maintaining its optical activity in solution even at 100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers with a spiral geometry represent a new class of helical polymers with great potential for organic nanodevices, but there is no precedent for an optically active helical ladder polymer totally composed of achiral units. We now report the defect&#8208;free synthesis and resolution of a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated helical ladder polymer with a rigid helical cavity, which has been achieved by quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted alkyne benzannulations of a rationally designed, random&#8208;coil achiral polymer followed by chromatographic enantioseparation. Because of a sufficiently high helix&#8208;inversion barrier, the isolated excess one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymer with a degree of polymerization of more than 15 showed a strong circular dichroism with a dissymmetry factor of up to 1.7&#215;10&#8722;2 and is thermally stable, maintaining its optical activity in solution even at 100&#8201;&#176;C, as well&#8208;supported by molecular dynamics simulation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Benzene Dual&#8208;Emitters Harness Excited&#8208;State Antiaromaticity for White Light Generation and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;benzene dual&#8208;emitters are realized by proton transfer equilibrium between two emissive tautomers. We demonstrate that the excited&#8208;state antiaromaticity of the benzene core drives the proton movements. The dual&#8208;emitters produce white light in both solution and solid states, making them useful for white light&#8208;emitting devices and multicolor fluorescence imaging of fluorous nanodroplets in live cells.







Abstract
Molecular emitters simultaneously generating light at different wavelengths have wide applications. With a small molecule, however, it is challenging to realize two independent radiative pathways. We invented the first examples of dual&#8208;emissive single&#8208;benzene fluorophores (SBFs). Two emissive tautomers are generated by synthetic modulation of the hydrogen bond acidity, which opens up pathways for excited&#8208;state proton transfer. White light is produced by a delicate balance between the energy and intensity of the emission from each tautomer. We show that the excited&#8208;state antiaromaticity of the benzene core itself dictates the proton movements driving the tautomer equilibrium. Using this simple benzene platform, a fluorinated SBF was synthesized with a record high solubility in perfluorocarbon solvents. White light&#8208;emitting devices and multicolor imaging of perfluorocarbon nanodroplets in live cells demonstrate the practical utility of these molecules.

         <title>Reticular Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Sonodynamic Activity of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Nanodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two inactive monomers incapable of generating singlet oxygen under ultrasound (US) irradiation were utilized for the reticular synthesis of a backbone&#8208;active covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer (TPE&#8208;NN) with intrinsic sonodynamic activity. With Cu ions coordination, the fabricated TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu is demonstrated to exhibit a bilaterally enhanced nanodynamic feature of Cu ion&#8208;augmented sonodynamic activity and US&#8208;amplified chemodynamic catalytic efficacy.







Abstract
The development of covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizers with intrinsic sonodynamic effects is highly desirable. However, such COFs are generally constructed using small&#8208;molecule photosensitizers. Herein, we report that the reticular chemistry&#8208;based synthesis of COFs from two inert monomers yields a COF&#8208;based sonosensitizer (TPE&#8208;NN) with inherent sonodynamic activity. Subsequently, a nanoscale COF TPE&#8208;NN is fabricated and embedded with copper (Cu)&#8208;coordinated sites to obtain TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Results show that Cu coordination can enhance the sonodynamic effect of TPE&#8208;NN, whereas ultrasound (US) irradiation for sonodynamic therapy can augment the chemodynamic efficacy of TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Consequently, TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu upon US irradiation shows high&#8208;performance anticancer effects based on mutually reinforced sono&#8208;/chemo&#8208;nanodynamic therapy. This study reveals the backbone&#8208;originated sonodynamic activity of COFs and proposes a paradigm of intrinsic COF sonosensitizers for nanodynamic therapy.

         <title>Electrically Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a chiral anion strategy, electrically amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is realized in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells of readily obtained diastereomeric ionic transition&#8208;metal complexes. The addition of a chiral ionic liquid (IL) into the active layer significantly improves the device performance and the electroluminescence dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
The development of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is currently hampered by the high difficulty and cost in the syntheses of suitable chiral materials and the notorious chirality diminishment issue in electrical devices. Herein, diastereomeric IrIII and RuII complexes with chiral (&#177;)&#8208;camphorsulfonate counteranions are readily synthesized and used as the active materials in circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells to generate promising CPELs. The addition of the chiral ionic liquid (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole camphorsulfonate into the active layer significantly improves the device performance and the electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (&#8776;10&#8722;3), in stark contrast to the very weak circularly polarized photoluminescence of the spin&#8208;coated films of these diastereomeric complexes. Control experiments with enantiopure IrIII complexes suggest that the chiral anions play a dominant role in the electrically&#8208;induced amplification of CPELs.

         <title>Reversibly Modulating Plasmon&#8208;mediated Chemical Reaction via Electrode Potential on Reliable Copper Nanoelectrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and reliable copper nanoelectrodes (CuNEs) were fabricated. The reactions of aromatic nitro modified on the CuNE surface were probed using time&#8208;resolved electrochemical SERS measurements. Cyclic conversions between aromatic nitro and its reduction products aromatic azo and aromatic amine were achieved by balancing electrochemical and Cu reductions with the plasmon&#8208;assisted photooxidation.







Abstract
Plasmonic metal nanostructures are essential for plasmon&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The nanostructures are commonly made from the coinage metals gold and silver. Copper (Cu) is less used mainly due to the difficulties in fabricating stable nanostructures. However, Cu is an attractive option with its strong plasmonic properties, high catalytic activities, and relatively cheap price. Herein, we fabricated tunable, reliable, and efficient Cu nanoelectrodes (CuNEs). Using time&#8208;resolved electrochemical SERS, we have comprehensively studied the reversible chemical transformations between aromatic amine and nitro groups modified on the CuNE surface. Their PMCRs are well&#8208;controlled by changing the surface roughness, the oxidation states of Cu, and the applied electrode potential. We thus demonstrate that the Cu nanostructures enable better investigations in the interplays between PMCR, electrochemistry, and Cu catalysis.

         <title>Understanding Electrochemical Reaction Mechanisms of Sulfur in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries through Operando and Theoretical Studies 
</title>

         <dc:description>
Utilizing operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of the sulfur cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are revealed. The results demonstrated that no Li2S6 and Li2S4 is formed but Li2S2 is observed. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles calculations disclose the formation energy of solid state Li2Sn (1&#8804;n&#8804;8), in which Li2S2 is a metastable phase.







Abstract
Due to its outstanding safety and high energy density, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASLSBs) are considered as a potential future energy storage technology. The electrochemical reaction pathway in ASLSBs with inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes is different from Li&#8208;S batteries with liquid electrolytes, but the mechanism remains unclear. By combining operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the reaction mechanism of sulfur (S8) in ASLSBs. Our results revealed that no Li2S8, Li2S6, and Li2S4 were formed, yet Li2S2 was detected. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles structural calculations were employed to disclose the formation energy of solid state Li2Sn (1&#8804;n&#8804;8), in which Li2S2 was a metastable phase, consistent with experimental observations. Meanwhile, partial S8 and Li2S2 remained at the full lithiation stage, suggesting incomplete reaction due to sluggish reaction kinetics in ASLSBs.

         <title>Highly Strong and Tough Supramolecular Polymer Networks Enabled by Cryptand&#8208;Based Host&#8208;Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryptand&#8208;based host&#8208;guest recognition motifs with their high association constants have been exploited as cross&#8208;links to endow supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) with both excellent mechanical and dynamic properties. This approach also offers a fundamental understanding of the mechanism behind reinforcing SPNs with strong noncovalent cross&#8208;links, and acts as a guide for the design and preparation of high&#8208;performance dynamic materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) demonstrate great potential in the development of smart materials owing to their attractive dynamic properties. However, as they suffer from the inherent weak bonding of most noncovalent cross&#8208;links, it remains a significant challenge to construct SPNs with outstanding mechanical performance. Herein, we exploit the cryptand/paraquat host&#8208;guest recognition motifs as cross&#8208;links to prepare a class of highly strong and tough SPNs. Unlike those supramolecular cross&#8208;links with relatively weak binding abilities, the cryptand&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interactions have a high association constant and steady complexing structure, which effectively stabilizes the network and resists mechanical deformation under external force. Such favorable structural stability endows our SPNs with greatly enhanced mechanical performance, compared with the control&#8208;1 cross&#8208;linked by the weakly complexed crown ether/secondary ammonium salt motif (tensile strength: 21.1&#177;0.5 vs 2.8&#177;0.1&#8197;MPa; Young's modulus: 102.6&#177;4.8 vs 2.1&#177;0.3&#8197;MPa; toughness: 90.4&#177;2.0 vs 10.8&#177;0.6&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3). Moreover, our SPNs also retain abundant dynamic properties including good abilities in energy dissipation, reprocessability, and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. These findings provide novel insights into the preparation of SPNs with enhanced mechanical properties, and promote the development of high&#8208;performance intelligent supramolecular materials.

&lt;p&gt;Cryptand-based host-guest recognition motifs with their high association constants have been exploited as cross-links to endow supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) with both excellent mechanical and dynamic properties. This approach also offers a fundamental understanding of the mechanism behind reinforcing SPNs with strong noncovalent cross-links, and acts as a guide for the design and preparation of high-performance dynamic materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) demonstrate great potential in the development of smart materials owing to their attractive dynamic properties. However, as they suffer from the inherent weak bonding of most noncovalent cross-links, it remains a significant challenge to construct SPNs with outstanding mechanical performance. Herein, we exploit the cryptand/paraquat host-guest recognition motifs as cross-links to prepare a class of highly strong and tough SPNs. Unlike those supramolecular cross-links with relatively weak binding abilities, the cryptand-based host-guest interactions have a high association constant and steady complexing structure, which effectively stabilizes the network and resists mechanical deformation under external force. Such favorable structural stability endows our SPNs with greatly enhanced mechanical performance, compared with the control-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; cross-linked by the weakly complexed crown ether/secondary ammonium salt motif (tensile strength: 21.1&#177;0.5 &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 2.8&#177;0.1&#8197;MPa; Young's modulus: 102.6&#177;4.8 &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 2.1&#177;0.3&#8197;MPa; toughness: 90.4&#177;2.0 &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 10.8&#177;0.6&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, our SPNs also retain abundant dynamic properties including good abilities in energy dissipation, reprocessability, and stimuli-responsiveness. These findings provide novel insights into the preparation of SPNs with enhanced mechanical properties, and promote the development of high-performance intelligent supramolecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photopolymerization&#8208;Driven Macroscopic Mechanical Motions of a Composite Film Containing a Vinyl Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal photopolymerization reaction of a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) vinyl coordination polymer (CP) produces a two&#8208;dimensional CP accompanied by an unprecedented phenomenon of photoinduced nonlinear lattice expansion. This 1D CP can be uniformly mixed with polyvinyl alcohol to form a composite film that exhibits macroscopic photomechanical motions such as bending, rolling, unrolling, lifting, grasping and jacking.







Abstract
We report a unique vinyl coordination polymer (CP), [Zn(4&#8208;Fb)2(tkpvb)]n (1, 4&#8208;HFb=4&#8208;fluorobenzoic acid, tkpvb=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridylvinyl)benzene) that undergoes a rare photopolymerization reaction to form a two&#8208;dimensional CP integrated with a one&#8208;dimensional linear organic polymer. Upon light irradiation at different wavelengths, 1 exhibits an unprecedented phenomenon of photoinduced nonlinear lattice expansion. 1 can be uniformly dispersed in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form the composite film of 1&#8208;PVA. When this film is exposed to UV light, internal minute stresses within crystallites are released by lattice expansion, resulting in a variety of photopolymerization&#8208;driven macroscopic mechanical motions. The findings provide new insights into the conversion of small lattice expansions of CPs into macroscopic mechanical motions based on photopolymerization reactions, which can promote the development of CPs&#8208;based smart photoactuators in the burgeoning field of microrobotics.

         <title>A Dynamic Defect Generation Strategy for Efficient Enzyme Immobilization in Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Catalytic Hydrolysis and Chiral Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic defect generation strategy for enzyme immobilization in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is developed. Enzymes can act as &#8220;macro ligands&#8221; to generate competitive coordination and form defects, hence promoting the gradual transport of enzymes in MOFs, and forming enzyme@MOFs with good protective performance and exceptional reusability as enzyme@MOF catalysts.







Abstract
Enzyme immobilization has been demonstrated to be a favorable protocol for promoting the industrialization of bioactive molecules, but still with formidable challenge. Addressing this challenge, we create a dynamic defect generation strategy for enzyme immobilization by using the dissociation equilibrium of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) mediated by enzymes. Enzymes can act as &#8220;macro ligands&#8221; to generate competitive coordination against original ligands, along with the release of metal clusters of MOFs to generate defects, hence promoting the gradual transport of enzymes from the surface to inside. Various enzymes can be efficiently immobilized in MOFs to afford composites with good enzymatic activities, protective performances and exceptional reusabilities. Moreover, multienzyme bioreactors capable of efficient cascade reactions can also be generated. This study provides new opportunities to construct highly efficient biocatalysts incorporating different types of enzymes.

         <title>Understanding the Synthesis Kinetics of Single&#8208;Crystal Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries is explored. A quasi&#8208;equilibrium reaction path is driven at low reaction temperature to induce a low&#8208;temperature topotactic lithiation, which can promote the rapid formation of the layered phase, thus contributing to the formation of highly ordered layered oxides in the solid&#8208;state synthesis of single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium kinetic intermediates are usually preferentially generated instead of thermodynamic stable phases in the solid&#8208;state synthesis of layered oxides. Understanding the inherent complexity between thermodynamics and kinetics is important for designing high cationic ordering cathodes. Single&#8208;crystal strategy is an effective way to solve the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical problems of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. However, the synthesis of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystal is very challenging. Herein, the kinetic reaction path and the formation mechanism of non&#8208;equilibrium intermediates in the synthesis of single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich were explored. We demonstrate that the formation of non&#8208;equilibrium intermediate and the electrochemical&#8208;thermo&#8208;mechanical failure can be effectively inhibited by driving low&#8208;temperature topotactic lithiation. This work provides a basis for designing high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystal Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides by regulating the defective structures.

         <title>Modulating Triplet Excited States of Organic Semiconductors via Tuning Molecular Conformation for Dual&#8208;ratiometric Thermometers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strength of noncovalent intramolecular interactions was fine&#8208;tuned to systematically modulate the triplet states, resulting in efficient room temperature phosphorescence and two well&#8208;separated emission bands. An unprecedented organic 3D dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometer was established based on intensity ratio and lifetime ratio of two bands, which was used for in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;thermometry with high accuracy.







Abstract
The dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometry is one of highly accurate methods for microscopic thermal measurement in biological systems. Herein, a series of chromone derivatives with noncovalently intramolecular interactions (NIIs) were designed and synthesized for ratiometric thermometers. The triplet states of these organic compounds were systematically tuned upon regulating the conformation with NIIs to yield efficient room temperature phosphorescence and large wavelength difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence simultaneously. As a result, an unprecedent organic 3D dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometer was established based on the intensity ratio and lifetime ratio of fluorescence/phosphorescence vs temperature, which was used for in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;thermometry with high accuracy. This work provides a novel method to achieve organic dual ratiometric thermometers via tuning the triplet excited states.

We demonstrate the utility of Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS with the first fluorogenic probe for direct visualization and quantitative analysis of the expression and localization of the G protein&#8208;coupled receptors&#8197;54 (GPR54 or kisspeptin) in human cells and intact mouse pancreatic islets.







Abstract
The G protein&#8208;coupled kisspeptin receptor (GPR54 or KISS1R) is an important mediator in reproduction, metabolism and cancer biology; however, there are limited fluorescent probes or antibodies for direct imaging of these receptors in cells and intact tissues, which can help to interrogate their multiple biological roles. Herein, we describe the rational design and characterization of a new acid&#8208;resistant BODIPY&#8208;based amino acid (Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS), and its implementation for solid&#8208;phase synthesis of fluorescent bioactive peptides. Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS retains the binding capabilities of both short linear and cyclic peptides and displays notable turn&#8208;on fluorescence emission upon target binding for wash&#8208;free imaging. Finally, we employed Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS to prepare some of the first fluorogenic kisspeptin&#8208;based probes and visualized the expression and localization of GPR54 receptors in human cells and in whole mouse pancreatic islets by fluorescence imaging.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides are the most diverse sugar nucleotides in nature. They serve as the glycosylation donors of glycosyltransferases to produce various carbohydrate structures. In their Research Article (e202217894), Liuqing Wen and co&#8208;workers have developed a general strategy for the efficient preparation of dTDP&#8208;activated sugar nucleotides from readily available starting materials. This high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy avoids the need for complicated purification procedures.

         <dc:description>
A strong&#8211;metal support interaction construction was induced via ultrasonication in water as described by Zhenzhen Yang, Sheng Dai et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202214322). The encapsulation degree of metal nanoparticles by reducible oxide overlayers can be modulated by the ultrasonication parameters. The facile tunability offers enhanced activity and selectivity in diverse catalytic hydrogenation applications. The cover picture by Andy Sproles illustrates ultrasound waves encircling supported metal nanoparticles in water to induce the encapsulation procedure.

         <title>Safer Polyurethane Foams with Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent work to produce polyurethane (PU) foams without the safety concerns of current commercial PU monomers is highlighted. The new chemistry utilizes cyclic carbonates which undergo hydrolysis to produce the blowing gas for the foaming process.







Abstract
Polyurethanes (PUs) are a class of materials usually synthesized from isocyanates, diols, and water. Water is essential for producing carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used for the self&#8208;blowing of the foams. Due to safety concerns with the production of isocyanates, alternative chemistries have been evaluated and cyclic carbonate systems have shown great promise. In a recent advancement by Bourguignon, Grignard, and Detrembleur, a cyclic carbonate and diamine system is capable of generating CO2 for self&#8208;blowing through hydrolysis of the carbonate&#8208;based monomer. The authors demonstrate that with a simple variation of the diamine monomer a wide range of physical and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties were achievable. This work represents a significant step towards safer and more environmentally friendly PUs.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Conjugate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric conjugate reduction (ACR) reactions have emerged over the last decades as straightforward and powerful transformations that provide direct access to chiral building blocks bearing ubiquitous trisubstituted stereocenters. This comprehensive Review focuses on the three areas of catalysis that contributed the most to the development of ACR chemistry: transition&#8208;metal, organic, and enzymatic catalysis.







Abstract
Enantioselective reduction reactions are privileged transformations for the construction of trisubstituted stereogenic centers. While these include established synthetic strategies, such as asymmetric hydrogenation, methods based on the enantioselective addition of hydridic reagents to electrophilic prochiral substrates have also gained importance. In this context, the asymmetric conjugate reduction (ACR) of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds has become a convenient approach for the synthesis of chiral compounds with trisubstituted stereocenters in &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, or &#947;&#8208;position to electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups. Because such activating groups are diverse and amenable of further derivatizations, ACRs provide a general and powerful synthetic entry towards a variety of valuable chiral building blocks. This Review provides a comprehensive collection of catalytic ACR methods involving transition&#8208;metal, organic, and enzymatic catalysis since its first versions dating back to the late 1970s.

         <title>Fluorescent Flippers: Small&#8208;Molecule Probes to Image Membrane Tension in Living Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of fluorescent flippers as membrane tension probes is described in the context of the general challenge to create chemistry tools to image physical forces in living systems.







Abstract
Flipper probes have been introduced as small molecule fluorophores to image physical forces, that is, membrane tension in living systems. Their emergence over one decade is described, from evolution in design and synthesis to spectroscopic properties. Responsiveness to physical compression in equilibrium at the ground state is identified as the ideal origin of mechanosensitivity to image membrane tension in living cells. A rich collection of flippers is described to deliver and release in any subcellular membrane of interest in a leaflet&#8208;specific manner. Chalcogen&#8208;bonding cascade switching and dynamic covalent flippers are developed for super&#8208;resolution imaging and dual&#8208;sensing of membrane compression and hydration. Availability and broad use in the community validate flipper probes as a fine example of the power of translational supramolecular chemistry, moving from fundamental principles to success on the market.

         <title>Molecular Mechanisms behind Acetylene Adsorption and Selectivity in Functional Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview covers some state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of advanced porous materials, namely metal&#8211;organic frameworks and decorated zeolites, that have been applied to the purification and storage of acetylene. It also discusses the challenges in translational research for the development of new solid sorbent&#8208;based separation technologies and highlights areas which require future research efforts.







Abstract
Since its first industrial production in 1890s, acetylene has played a vital role in manufacturing a wide spectrum of materials. Although current methods and infrastructures for various segments of acetylene industries are well&#8208;established, with emerging functional porous materials that enabled desired selectivity toward target molecules, it is of timely interest to develop new efficient technologies to promote safer acetylene processes with a higher energy efficiency and lower carbon footprint. In this Minireview, we, from the perspective of materials chemistry, review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of advanced porous materials, namely metal&#8211;organic frameworks and decorated zeolites, that have been applied to the purification and storage of acetylene. We also discuss the challenges on the roadmap of translational research in the development of new solid sorbent&#8208;based separation technologies and highlight areas which require future research efforts.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for C6 Alkane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the recent advancement in developing MOFs as energy&#8208;efficient adsorbents for the separation of C6 alkane isomers based on different separation mechanisms. Particular emphasis is made on the design and tailoring of their structures and pore properties to achieve optimal separation performance. Existing challenges and possible solutions, as well as future directions of this important research field are also discussed.







Abstract
The separation of alkane isomers is an important yet challenging process in the petrochemical industry. Being a crucial step to produce premium gasoline components as well as optimum ethylene feed, the current industrial separation by distillation is extremely energy intensive. Adsorptive separation based on zeolite is limited by insufficient adsorption capacity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold enormous promise as alternative adsorbents due to their diverse structural tunability and exceptional porosity. Precise control of their pore geometry/dimensions has led to superior performance. In this minireview, we highlight the recent progresses in developing MOFs for the separation of C6 alkane isomers. Representative MOFs are reviewed based on their separation mechanisms. Emphasis is put on the material design rationale for achieving optimal separation capability. Finally, we briefly discuss the existing challenges, possible solutions, and future directions of this important field.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations Guide Chimeragenesis and Engineered Control of Chemoselectivity in Diketopiperazine Dimerases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of C&#8722;N bond forming diketopiperazine dimerase, AspB, was solved. However, the near complete superposition of active site residues and bound substrates in AspB/NzeB masked the molecular basis for their orthogonal chemoselectivities. Molecular dynamics simulations guided rational chimeragenesis to reprogram NzeB dimerase selectivity. Substrate mimics further validated differential substrate binding by the chemodivergent dimerases.







Abstract
In the biosynthesis of the tryptophan&#8208;linked dimeric diketopiperazines (DKPs), cytochromes P450 selectively couple DKP monomers to generate a variety of intricate and isomeric frameworks. To determine the molecular basis for selectivity of these biocatalysts we obtained a high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of selective Csp2&#8722;N bond forming dimerase, AspB. Overlay of the AspB structure onto C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond forming homolog NzeB revealed no significant structural variance to explain their divergent chemoselectivities. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations identified a region of NzeB with increased conformational flexibility relative to AspB, and interchange of this region along with a single active site mutation led to a variant that catalyzes exclusive C&#8722;N bond formation. MD simulations also suggest that intermolecular C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond formation results from a change in mechanism, supported experimentally through use of a substrate mimic.

         <title>Monitoring Cardiac Biomarkers with Aptamer&#8208;Based Molecular Pendulum Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic nucleic acid&#8208;based reagent&#8208;free electronic biomolecular analysis technique enabled by high&#8208;performance signal transduction with molecular pendulums is presented. The approach was applied to the analysis of cardiac biomarkers with low femtomolar detection limits and minimal cross&#8208;reactivity in whole blood collected from patients with chronic heart failure.







Abstract
Reagent&#8208;free electronic biosensors capable of analyzing disease markers directly in unprocessed body fluids will enable the development of simple &amp; affordable devices for personalized healthcare monitoring. Here we report a powerful and versatile nucleic acid&#8208;based reagent&#8208;free electronic sensing system. The signal transduction is based on the kinetics of an electrode&#8208;tethered molecular pendulum&#8212;a rigid double stranded DNA with one of the strands displaying an analyte&#8208;binding aptamer and the other featuring a redox probe&#8212;that exhibits field&#8208;induced transport modulated by receptor occupancy. Using chronoamperometry, which enables the sensor to circumvent the conventional Debye length limitation, the binding of an analyte can be monitored as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag. The sensing platform demonstrates a low femtomolar quantification limit and minimal cross&#8208;reactivity in analyzing cardiac biomarkers in whole blood collected from patients with chronic heart failure.

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Induced Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Construction in Water Towards Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;stable metal nanocatalysts based on strong metal&#8208;support interaction construction were produced leveraging the instantaneous energy input from ultrasonication under near&#8208;ambient conditions in H2O. Encapsulation of the metal nanoparticles was achieved via the formation of reducible metal oxide overlayers, leading to enhanced performance and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions and CO2 conversion.







Abstract
The development of facile methodologies to afford robust supported metal nanocatalysts under mild conditions is highly desirable yet challenging, particularly via strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) construction. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches capable of generating SMSI encapsulation mainly focus on high temperature annealing in reductive/oxidative atmosphere. Herein, ultra&#8208;stable metal nanocatalysts based on SMSI construction were produced by leveraging the instantaneous high&#8208;energy input from ultrasonication under ambient conditions in H2O, which could rapidly afford abundant active intermediates, Ti3+ ions, and oxygen vacancies within the scaffolds to induce the SMSI overlayer formation. The encapsulation degree could be tuned and controlled via the reducibility of the solvents and the ultrasonication parameters. This facile and efficient approach could be further extended to diverse metal oxide supports and noble metal NPs leading to enhanced performance in hydrogenation reactions and CO2 conversion.

         <title>Comproportionation of CO2 and Cellulose to Formate Using a Floating Semiconductor&#8208;Enzyme Photoreforming Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous formate formation from CO2 reduction and cellulose oxidation is enabled by a biohybrid photocatalyst with formate dehydrogenase immobilized on titanium dioxide. The semi&#8208;artificial photocatalytic system can be further immobilized onto floating hollow glass microspheres allowing vertical solar light illumination with optimal light exposure of the photocatalyst and thereby mimicking the trajectory of real sunlight.







Abstract
Formate production via both CO2 reduction and cellulose oxidation in a solar&#8208;driven process is achieved by a semi&#8208;artificial biohybrid photocatalyst consisting of immobilized formate dehydrogenase on titanium dioxide (TiO2|FDH) producing up to 1.16&#177;0.04&#8197;mmolformate&#8201;g
&#8722;1 in 24&#8197;hours at 30 &#176;C and 101 kPa under anaerobic conditions. Isotopic labeling experiments with 13C&#8208;labeled substrates support the mechanism of stoichiometric formate formation through both redox half&#8208;reactions. TiO2|FDH was further immobilized on hollow glass microspheres to perform more practical floating photoreforming allowing vertical solar light illumination with optimal light exposure of the photocatalyst to real sunlight. Enzymatic cellulose depolymerization coupled to the floating photoreforming catalyst generates 0.36&#177;0.04&#8197;mmolformate per m2 irradiation area after 24&#8197;hours. This work demonstrates the synergistic solar&#8208;driven valorization of solid and gaseous waste streams using a biohybrid photoreforming catalyst in aqueous solution and will thus provide inspiration for the development of future semi&#8208;artificial waste&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion strategies.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 24&#8197;hours at 30 &#176;C and 101 kPa under anaerobic conditions. Isotopic labeling experiments with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labeled substrates support the mechanism of stoichiometric formate formation through both redox half-reactions. TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;b&gt;FDH&lt;/b&gt; was further immobilized on hollow glass microspheres to perform more practical floating photoreforming allowing vertical solar light illumination with optimal light exposure of the photocatalyst to real sunlight. Enzymatic cellulose depolymerization coupled to the floating photoreforming catalyst generates 0.36&#177;0.04&#8197;mmol&lt;sub&gt;formate&lt;/sub&gt; per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; irradiation area after 24&#8197;hours. This work demonstrates the synergistic solar-driven valorization of solid and gaseous waste streams using a biohybrid photoreforming catalyst in aqueous solution and will thus provide inspiration for the development of future semi-artificial waste-to-chemical conversion strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Domino meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Ethyl Glycosylation by Ruthenium(II/III) Catalysis: Modular Assembly of meta&#8208;C&#8208;Alkyl Glycosides</title>

         <dc:description>
A ruthenium(II)/phosphine catalytic system enabled efficient domino meta&#8208;C&#8722;H ethyl glycosylations. Thus 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides were obtained via the selective assembly of easily accessible glycosyl bromide and alkenes under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Glycosyl anomeric radical addition reactions have been well&#8208;explored and proved efficient for the C&#8208;alkyl glycosides synthesis, but multicomponent Domino transformations for the rapid and controllable construction of structurally diversified C&#8208;alkyl glycosides in a single step are still rare. In contrast, we, herein, report a ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Domino meta&#8208;C&#8722;H ethyl glycosylation, enabling the construction of challenging meta&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides. Our ruthenium(II) catalysis was reflected by the mild reaction condition, exclusive meta&#8208;site selectivity and high levels of anomeric selectivity. In addition, the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Domino meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation allowed for the synthesis of versatile 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides with commercially available vinyl arenes, acrylates and easily accessible glycosyl bromides.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Mediated Radical Stabilization and Dynamic Covalent Bonding: Tunable, Reversible and Photocontrollable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of a Lewis acid into the solution of a radical &#963;&#8208;dimer led to a radical, which is stabilized by captodative effect, single electron transfer and steric effect. This work describes a strategy not only to isolate a dynamically stable radical with physical property tunability, but to efficiently regulate the radical dissociation with reversibility and photocontrollability.







Abstract
This work describes a strategy not only to isolate a dynamically stable radical with physical property tunability, but to efficiently regulate the radical dissociation with reversibility and photo controllability. The addition of Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (BCF) into the solution of a radical &#963;&#8208;dimer (1&#8208;1) led to a stable radical (1&#8901;&#8208;2B), which has been characterized by EPR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in conjunction with theoretical calculation. The radical species is stabilized mainly by captodative effect, single electron transfer and steric effect. The absorption maximum of the radical can be tuned by using different Lewis acids. Dimer 1&#8208;1 can be achieved back by addition of a stronger base into the solution of 1&#8901;&#8208;2B, exhibiting a reversible process. By introducing a photo BCF generator, the dissociation of the dimer and the formation of the radical adduct become photocontrollable.

         <title>Structural and Morphological Transformations of Covalent Organic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two imine bonds at the ortho&#8208;position of the benzene ring undergo a click rearrangement to form the imidazole ring. Two such geminal imine bonds in covalent organic nanotubes (CONTs) convert imine CONTs to imidazole CONTs. The CONTs exhibit two types of self&#8208;assembly like gold nanorods, i.e., side&#8208;by&#8208;side assembly and head&#8208;to&#8208;head assembly.







Abstract
Covalent organic nanotubes (CONTs) are porous one&#8208;dimensional frameworks connected through imine bonds via Schiff base condensation between aldehydes and amines. The presence of two amine groups at the ortho position in the structurally demanding tetraaminotriptycene (TAT) building block leads to multiple reaction pathways between the ditopic aldehyde and the tetratopic amine. We have synthesized five different monomers of CONT&#8208;1 by the Schiff base condensation reaction between TAT and o&#8208;anisaldehyde. The conversion of imine to imidazole bonding in a monomer is probed using NMR, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. Solid&#8208;state NMR provide insights into the CONTs&#8217; structural connectivity. A theoretical investigation suggests that the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking could be the driving force for rapid imine to imidazole conversion within the CONT&#8208;1. Microscopic imaging sheds further light on the self&#8208;assembly process of the CONTs, indicating both head&#8208;to&#8208;head and side&#8208;by&#8208;side assembly.

         <title>Asymmetric C1 Extension of Aldehydes through Biocatalytic Cascades for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Mandelic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic cascades consisting of L&#8208;threonine aldolase (LTA), L&#8208;threonine dehydratase (LTD) and 4&#8208;hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) were developed for cyanide&#8208;free asymmetric C1&#8208;extension. Engineering of the central enzyme, HmaS, enabled the stereodivergent synthesis of mandelic acids from glycine and aromatic aldehydes.







Abstract
The development of mild, efficient, and enantioselective methods for preparing chiral building blocks from simple, renewable carbon units has been a long&#8208;term goal of the sustainable chemical industry. Mandelate derivatives are valuable pharmaceutical intermediates and chiral resolving agents, but their manufacture relies heavily on highly toxic cyanide. Herein, we report (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS)&#8208;centered biocatalytic cascades for the synthesis of mandelates from benzaldehydes and glycine. We show that HmaS can be engineered to perform R&#8208;selective hydroxylation by single&#8208;point mutation, empowering the stereodivergent synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;mandelate derivatives. These biocatalytic cascades enabled the production of various mandelate derivatives with high atom economy as well as excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and ee values (up to &gt;99&#8201;%). This methodology offers an effective cyanide&#8208;free technology for greener and sustainable production of mandelate derivatives.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy to construct pure&#8208;red multiple resonance (MR) emitters was successfully implemented. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule PPZ&#8208;BN achieves a significant redshift of more than 125&#8197;nm compared to the selected parent MR core. The corresponding narrowband red organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a high external quantum efficiency of 26.9&#8201;%, a small efficiency roll&#8208;off, and an excellent operation stability.







Abstract
Though the flourishment of materials with multiple resonance (MR) in blue to green regions, red&#8208;emissive MR emitters are still rare in literatures, which definitely should be resolved for further applications. Herein, we report a simple molecular design strategy for the construction of pure&#8208;red MR emitters by conjugate charge transfer, which could greatly enhance the &#960;&#8208;conjugation degree and charge&#8208;transfer property of the target molecule while maintaining the basic feature of MR, leading to a significant redshift of more than 128&#8197;nm compared to the selected parent MR core. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter PPZ&#8208;BN exhibited a pure&#8208;red emission with a dominant peak at 613&#8197;nm and a small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 0.16&#8197;eV (48&#8197;nm). The optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode showed a high external quantum efficiency of 26.9&#8201;%, a small efficiency roll&#8208;off, and an excellent operation stability (LT99) of more than 43&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Square&#8208;Planar Anionic Pt0 Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a diphosphine&#8208;borane ligand DPB enables straightforward access to anionic Pt0 complexes. [(DPB)PtX]&#8722; complexes were isolated and fully characterized. They represent unique examples of square&#8208;planar Pt0 complexes, as substantiated by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A T&#8208;shaped Pt0 complex with a diphosphine&#8208;borane (DPB) ligand was prepared. The Pt&#8594;B interaction enhances the electrophilicity of the metal and triggers the addition of Lewis bases to give the corresponding tetracoordinate complexes. For the first time, anionic Pt0 complexes are isolated and structurally authenticated. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses show the anionic complexes [(DPB)PtX]&#8722; (X=CN, Cl, Br, I) to be square&#8208;planar. The d10 configuration and Pt0 oxidation state of the metal were unambiguously established by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The coordination of Lewis acids as Z&#8208;type ligands is a powerful mean to stabilize elusive electron&#8208;rich metal complexes and achieve uncommon geometry.

         <title>Polydopamine as a Visible&#8208;Light Photosensitiser for Photoinitiated Polymerisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine free radicals are observed to be photo&#8208;responsive under visible light irradiation, amplifying semiquinone radical population and modifying redox potential. Using polydopamine nanoparticles, the researchers photo&#8208;initiate free&#8208;radical polymerization of vinylic monomers via sensitization of a diphenyliodonium photo&#8208;initiator. This work offers important insights into melanin&#8208;like materials and presents PDA as a promising photosensitizer.







Abstract
Polydopamine (PDA) is a synthetic model for melanin and has a wide range of opto&#8208;electronic properties that underpin its utility in applied and biological settings, from broadband light absorbance to possessing stable free radical species. Here, we show that PDA free radicals are photo&#8208;responsive under visible light irradiation, enabling PDA to serve as a photo&#8208;redox catalyst. Steady&#8208;state and transient electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals a reversible amplification in semiquinone radical population within PDA under visible light. This photo&#8208;response modifies the redox potential of PDA and supports sensitisation of exogenous species via photoinduced electron transfer (PET). We demonstrate the utility of this discovery by employing PDA nanoparticles to photosensitise a common diaryliodonium photoinitiator and initiate free&#8208;radical polymerisation (FRP) of vinylic monomers. In situ 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals an interplay between PDA&#8208;driven photosensitising and radical quenching during FRP under blue, green, and red light. This work provides crucial insights into the photoactive free radical properties of melanin&#8208;like materials and reveals a promising new application for polydopamine as a photosensitiser.

         <title>Csp3&#8722;PIII Bond Formation via Cross&#8208;Coupling of Umpolung Carbonyls with Phosphine Halides Catalyzed by Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes an unprecedented methodology for the direct construction of invaluable Csp3&#8722;PIII bond through a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of Umpolung carbonyls with phosphine chlorides. A series of trivalent alkylphosphines were isolated and characterized as sulfides or borane complexes in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A novel method for the formation of Csp3&#8722;PIII bonds via the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of Umpolung carbonyls and phosphine chlorides is reported herein. This process leads to a series of alkylphosphines, which are characterized as sulfides or borane&#8208;phosphine complexes after undergoing further transformation with moderate to good yields. Invaluable free alkylphosphines can be easily obtained by desulfurization or deboration of the products. A possible mechanistic pathway is also discussed. This report represents the first example of using renewable carbonyls as latent organometallic reagent surrogates for cross&#8208;coupling with heteroatom electrophiles.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale and Controllable Syntheses of Covalently&#8208;Crosslinked Poly(ionic liquid) Nanoporous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, straightforward and versatile conceptual synthetic procedure capable of scalable and controllable preparation of freestanding, covalently crosslinked nanoporous poly(ionc liquid) membranes in water solution under ambient condition is developed. The resultant membranes possess remarkable thermal/solvent (e.g. salt, pH, organic solvents) stability, and exhibit excellent Li+/Mg2+ ion separation performance.







Abstract
Herein, we report an exciting synthetic procedure for the scalable and controllable fabrication of covalently crosslinked poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) nanoporous membranes (CPILMs) in water solution under ambient conditions. We found that the pore sizes, flexibility and compositions of freestanding CPILMs can be finely tailored by a rational structural choice of PIL, diketone and aldehyde. Studies on the CPILM formation mechanism revealed that hydrogen bonding&#8208;induced phase separation of amino&#8208;functionalized homo&#8208;PIL between its polar and apolar domains coupled with structural rearrangements due to the Debus Radsizewski reaction&#8208;triggered ambient covalent crosslinking process created a stable three&#8208;dimensionally interconnected pore system in water solution. Employing structurally stable CPILMs in ion sieving devices resulted in an excellent Li+/Mg2+ separation efficiency due to the positively charged nature and &#8220;Donann&#8221; effects. This green, facile yet versatile approach to the production of CPILMs is a conceptually distinct and commercially interesting strategy for making useful nanoporous functional polyelectrolyte membranes.

         <title>Burning Graphite Faster than Carbon Black: A Case of Diffusion Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through careful control of total diffusion&#8208;limited regime, it is possible to purify carbon black at the expense of far more stable graphite. This shows that targeted exploitation of total diffusion may be used to bypass the classical chemical reactivity. This represents a new technique for materials purification or synthesis not allowed by other methods.







Abstract
External diffusion may be exploited as a tool to purify materials in a way thought to be inaccessible from a chemical reactivity point of view. A mixture of two carbonaceous materials, graphite and carbon black, are thermally oxidized in either i) outside total diffusion&#8208;limited regime or ii) total diffusion&#8208;limited regime. Depending on the treatment applied it is possible to purify either graphite, a trivial task, or carbon black, a task thought impossible. Introducing geometrical selectivity, controlled total diffusion&#8208;limited chemistry exceeds by far the field of carbon materials and can be used as an engineering tool for many materials purification, original synthesis, or to introduce asymmetry in a system. Several examples for direct applications of the findings are mentioned.

         <title>Glucose&#8208;Responsive Charge&#8208;Switchable Lipid Nanoparticles for Insulin Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized four glucose&#8208;responsive cationic lipids to prepare lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with low toxicity. LNP&#8208;insulin complex can be formed by electrostatic attraction. The surface positive charge of LNPs is switched off in glucose solution, leading to insulin release. In type&#8197;1 diabetic mice, LNPs can prolong the subcutaneous retention of insulin, thus doubling the duration of the normoglycemia period as compared with native insulin.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based drug delivery systems have a profound clinical impact on nucleic acid&#8208;based therapy and vaccination. Recombinant human insulin, a negatively&#8208;charged biomolecule like mRNA, may also be delivered by rationally&#8208;designed positively&#8208;charged lipid nanoparticles with glucose&#8208;sensing elements and be released in a glucose&#8208;responsive manner. Herein, we have designed phenylboronic acid&#8208;based quaternary amine&#8208;type cationic lipids that can self&#8208;assemble into spherical lipid nanoparticles in an aqueous solution. Upon mixing insulin and the lipid nanoparticles, a heterostructured insulin complex is formed immediately arising from the electrostatic attraction. In a hyperglycemia&#8208;relevant glucose solution, lipid nanoparticles become less positively charged over time, leading to reduced attraction and subsequent insulin release. Compared with native insulin, this lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based glucose&#8208;responsive insulin shows prolonged blood glucose regulation ability and blood glucose&#8208;triggered insulin release in a type&#8197;1 diabetic mouse model.

         <title>Upcycling of Polybutadiene Facilitated by Selenium&#8208;Mediated Allylic Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling via the direct chemical functionalization of a commodity polymer is a promising strategy that introduces new value&#8208;added properties without destroying the parent backbone. This work harnesses the power of selenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization chemistry for the selective allylic amination of 1,4&#8208;polybutadiene, without alkene saturation or transposition, to tune thermal and surface wetting properties.







Abstract
Accumulation of end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics presents ongoing environmental concerns. One strategy to solve this grand challenge is to invent new techniques that modify post&#8208;consumer waste and impart new functionality. While promising approaches for the chemical upcycling of commodity polyolefins and polyaromatics exist, analogous approaches to repurpose unsaturated polymers (e.g., polybutadiene) are scarce. In this work, we propose a method to upcycle polybutadiene, one of the most widely used commercial rubbers, via a mild, metal&#8208;free allylic amination reaction. The resulting materials have tunable thermal and surface wetting properties as a function of both sulfonamide identity and grafting density. Importantly, this approach maintains the parent alkene microstructure without evidence of olefin reduction, olefin transposition, and/or chain scission. Based on these findings, we anticipate future applications in the remediation of complex elastomers and vulcanized rubbers.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Monofluorocyclohexenes through Photocatalyzed Cascade Cyclization of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
The first photocatalyzed cascade cyclization of readily available &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of monofluorocyclohexenes has been achieved. The reaction shows broad substrate scope and high diastereoselectivity, and the synthetic potential has been demonstrated by downstream transformations.







Abstract
Monofluoroalkenes are nonhydrolyzable mimetics of amides. Previous work focused on the synthesis of non&#8208;cyclic monofluoroalkenes. However, diastereoselective synthesis of monofluorocyclohexenes from non&#8208;cyclic substrates is challenging. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade cyclization reactions of readily available &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of highly functionalized monofluorocyclohexenes. The reaction shows broad substrate scope with high diastereoselectivity (&gt;30 examples, up to 86&#8201;% yield, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). The post&#8208;reaction transformations of the products demonstrate the synthetic potential of this methodology.

         <title>Biased Borate Esterification during Nucleoside Phosphorylase&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions: Apparent Equilibrium Shifts and Kinetic Implications
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 20, May 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biased esterification of nucleosides with borate preferentially removes those reactants from biocatalytic equilibrium systems, with the resulting cyclic borate esters acting as reversible enzyme inhibitors. This effect can be used to manipulate glycosylation equilibria and facilitate biocatalytic access to nucleoside analogues.







Abstract
Biocatalytic nucleoside (trans&#8208;)glycosylations catalyzed by nucleoside phosphorylases have evolved into a practical and convenient approach to the preparation of modified nucleosides, which are important pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various cancers and viral infections. However, the obtained yields in these reactions are generally determined exclusively by the innate thermodynamic properties of the nucleosides involved, hampering the biocatalytic access to many sought&#8208;after target nucleosides. We herein report an additional means for reaction engineering of these systems. We show how apparent equilibrium shifts in phosphorolysis and glycosylation reactions can be effected through entropically driven, biased esterification of nucleosides and ribosyl phosphates with inorganic borate. Our multifaceted analysis further describes the kinetic implications of this in situ reactant esterification for a model phosphorylase.

         <title>Interfacial Ti&#8208;S Bond Modulated S&#8208;scheme MOF/CTF Nanosheet Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic C&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing photocatalyst systems to functionalize the inert C&#8208;H bonds has attracted extensive research interest. However, purposeful modulation of interfacial charge transfer in heterostructures remains a challenge, as it usually suffers from sluggish kinetics. Reported herein is an easy strategy to construct the heteroatom&#8208;induced interface for developing the titanium&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;902) @ thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine frameworks (CTF&#8208;Th) nanosheets S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions with controllable oxygen vacancies (OVs). Specifically, Ti atoms were first anchored onto the heteroatom site of CTF&#8208;Th nanosheets, and then grown into MOF&#8208;902 via an interfacial Ti&#8208;S linkage, generating OVs. Using in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the enhanced interfacial charge separation and transfer induced by moderate OVs in the pre&#8208;designed S&#8208;scheme nanosheets was validated. The heterostructures exhibited an improved efficiency in photocatalytic C3&#8208;acylation of indoles under mild conditions with a yield 8.2 times larger than pristine CTF&#8208;Th or MOF&#8208;902 and enabled an extended scope of substrates (15 examples). This performance is superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalyst and can be retained, without significant loss, after 12 consecutive cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Generation of H2O2 and Formate by Co&#8208;Electrolysis of Water and CO2 over Bifunctional Zn/SnO2 Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and formate are important chemicals used in various chemical manufacturing industries. One promising approach for the simultaneous production of these chemicals is coupling anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation with cathodic CO2 reduction in an electrolyzer using nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, we report an innovative hybrid electrosynthesis strategy using Zn&#8208;doped SnO2 (Zn/SnO2) nanodots as bifunctional redox electrocatalysts to achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 80.6% and 92.2% for H2O2 and formate coproduction, respectively, along with excellent stability for at least 60 h at a current density of ~ 150 mA cm&#8208;2. Through a combination of physicochemical characterizations, including operando attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), isotope labeling mass spectrometry (MS)/1H NMR and quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we discovered that the Zn dopant facilitates the coupling of *OH intermediates to promote H2O2 production and optimizes the adsorption of *OCHO intermediates to accelerate formate formation. Our findings offer new insights into designing more efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8208;based pair&#8208;electrosynthesis system for the coproduction of H2O2 and formate feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Defective Copper Nanocluster Catalysts for Highly Selective C&#8208;C Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Point defects in nanoparticles have long been hypothesized to play an important role in governing the particle&#8217;s electronic structure and physicochemical properties. However, single point defects in material systems usually exist with other heterogeneities, obscuring the chemical role of the effects. Herein, we report a novel atomically precise, copper hydride nanoclusters (NCs), [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28; TPP: triphenylphosphine; C7H7S: o&#8208;thiocresol) with a defined defect in the gram scale via a one&#8208;pot reduction method. The Cu28 acts as a highly selective catalyst in for C&#8211;C cross&#8208;couplings. The work highlights the potential of defective NCs as model systems for investigating individual defects, correlating defects with physiochemical properties, and rationally designing new nanoparticle catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Domain versus Single&#8208;Domain: A Magnetic Field is Not a Must for Promoting Spin&#8208;Polarized Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction kinetics of spin&#8208;polarized oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be enhanced by ferromagnetic catalysts under an external magnetic field. However, applying a magnetic field necessitates additional energy consumption and creates design difficulties for electrolyzers. Here, we prove that a single&#8208;domain FM catalyst without external magnetic fields exhibits a similar OER increment to its magnetized multi&#8208;domain one. The evidence is given by comparing the pH&#8208;dependent increment of OER on multi&#8208; and single&#8208;domain FM catalysts with or without a magnetic field. The intrinsic activity of a single&#8208;domain catalyst is higher than that of a multi&#8208;domain counterpart. The latter can be promoted to approach the former by the magnetization effect. Reducing the FM catalyst size into the single&#8208;domain region, the spin&#8208;polarized OER performance can be achieved without a magnetic field, illustrating an external magnetic field is not a requirement to reap the benefits of magnetic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mucin&#8208;Inspired Single&#8208;Chain Polymer (MIP) Fibers as Potent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mucins are the key component of the defensive mucus barrier. They are extended fibers of very high molecular weight with diverse biological functions depending strongly on their specific structural parameters. Here, we present a mucin&#8208;inspired nanostructure, produced via a synthetic methodology to prepare methacrylate&#8208;based dendronized polysulfates (MIP&#8208;1) on a multi gram scale with relatively high molecular weight (MW = 450 kDa) and thiol end&#8208;functionalized mucin&#8208;inspired polymer (MIP) via RAFT polymerization. Cryo&#8208;electron tomography (Cryo&#8208;ET) analysis of MIP&#8208;1 confirmed a mucin&#8208;mimetic wormlike single&#8208;chain fiber structure (length = 144.5 &#177; 59.4 nm) in aqueous solution. This biocompatible fiber showed promising activity against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its mutant strain, with a remarkable low half maximal (IC50) inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 10.0 nM). Additionally, we investigate the impact of fiber length on SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 inhibition by testing other functional polymers (MIPs) of varying fiber lengths.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control via Binding Sites within the Confined Space of Metal Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Frameworks for Enhanced Shape&#8208;Selectivity Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One striking feature of enzyme is its controllable ability to trap substrates&#160;via&#160;synergistic or cooperative binding in the enzymatic pocket, which renders the shape&#8208;selectivity of product by the confined spatial environment. The success of shape&#8208;selective catalysis relies on the ability of enzyme to tune the thermodynamics and kinetics for chemical reactions. In emulation of enzyme&#8217;s ability, we showcase herein a&#160;targeting strategy&#160;with the substrate being anchored on the internal pore wall of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), taking full advantage of the sterically kinetic control to achieve shape&#8208;selectivity for the reactions. For this purpose, a series of binding site&#8208;accessible metal metalloporphyrin&#8208;frameworks (MMPFs) have been investigated to shed light on the nature of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. They exhibit a different density of binding sites that are well arranged into the nanospace with corresponding distances of opposite binding sites. Such a structural specificity results in a facile switch in selectivity from an exclusive formation of the thermodynamically stable product to the kinetic product. Thus, the proposed targeting strategy, based on the combination of porous materials and binding events, paves a new way to develop highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for shifting selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrogen to Ammonia Using Tiara&#8208;like Phenylethanethiolated Nickel Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fixing of N2 to NH3 is challenging due to the inertness of the N &#8801; N bond. Commercially, ammonia production depends on the energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch (H&#8208;B) process, which emits CO2&#160;while using fossil fuels as the sources of hydrogen and energy. An alternative method for NH3 production is the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) process as it is powered by renewable energy sources. Here, we report a tiara&#8208;like nickel&#8208;thiolate cluster, [Ni6(PET)12] (where, PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiol)] as an efficient electro&#8208;catalyst for the electrochemical NRR at ambient conditions. Ammonia (NH3: 16.2 &#177; 0.8 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) was the only nitrogenous product over the potential of &#9472;2.3 V vs. Fc+/Fc with a Faradic efficiency of 25 &#177; 1.7 %. Based on theoretical calculations, NRR through [Ni6(PET)12] proceeds through both the distal and alternating pathways with an onset potential of &#8211;1.84 V vs. RHE (i.e., &#8211;2.46 V vs. Fc+/Fc) which corroborates with the experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Cluster Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Containing Copper Iodine Cube with 100% Exciton Utilization Using Host&#8211;Cluster Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clusters combine the advantages of organic molecules and inorganic nanomaterials, which are promising alternatives for optoelectronic applications. Nonetheless, recently emerged cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes require further excited state optimization of cluster emitters, especially to reduce population of the cluster&#8208;centered triplet quenching state (3CC). Here we report that redox&#8208;active ligands enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) of Cu4I4 cluster for triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet conversion, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host can provide an external RISC channel. It indicates that the complementarity between TADF host and cluster in RISC transitions gives rise to 100% triplet conversion efficiency and complete singlet exciton convergence, rendering 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant. We achieve a photoluminescence quantum yield of 99% and a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4%.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Microenvironment Modulation of Pd Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical microenvironment modulation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) holds promise in tackling the long&#8208;lasting challenge of trade&#8208;off effect between activity and selectivity in catalysis. Herein, ultrafine PdCu2 NPs incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse groups on their pore walls have been fabricated for semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Cu species as the primary microenvironment of Pd active sites greatly improves the selectivity. The functional groups as the secondary microenvironment around PdCu2 NPs effectively regulate the activity, in which PdCu2 NPs encapsulated in the COF bearing &#8208;CH3 groups exhibit the highest activity with 100% conversion and &gt;96% selectivity. Both experimental and calculation results suggest that the functional group affects the electron&#8208;donating ability of the COFs, which successively impacts the charge transfer between COFs and Pd sites, giving rise to modulated Pd electronic state and excellent catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on PdNiRuIrRh High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy by Machine Learning Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts have been widely studied in electrolysis. However, identifying atomic structure of HEA with complex atomic arrangement is challenging, which seriously hinders the fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanism. Here, we report a HEA&#8208;PdNiRuIrRh catalyst with remarkable mass activity of 3.25 mA &#956;g&#8208;1 for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which is 8&#8208;fold enhancement compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Through machine learning potential&#8208;based Monte Carlo simulation, we reveal that the dominant Pd&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ni/Pd&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pd bonding environments and Ni/Ru oxophilic sites on HEA surface are beneficial to the optimized adsorption/desorption of *H and enhanced *OH adsorption, contributing to the excellent HOR activity and stability. This work provides significant insights into atomic structure and catalytic mechanism for HEA and offers novel prospects for developing advanced HOR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Integration of a Hydrophobic and Fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Inorganic Interphase to Stabilize Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The irreversible issues of Zn anode stemming from dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced erosion have severely hindered the commercialization of rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries. Herein, a hydrophobic and fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conductive zinc hexacyanoferrate (HB&#8208;ZnHCF) interphase layer is in&#8208;situ integrated on Zn by a rapid room&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry method to address these dilemmas. Different from currently proposed hydrophilic inorganic cases, the hydrophobic and compact HB&#8208;ZnHCF interphase effectively prevents the access of water molecules to Zn surface, thus avoiding H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. Moreover, the HB&#8208;ZnHCF with large internal ion channels, strong zincophilicity, and high Zn2+ transference number (0.86) permits fast Zn2+ transport and enables smooth Zn deposition. Remarkably, the resultant HB&#8208;ZnHCF@Zn electrode delivers unprecedented reversibility with 99.88% Coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles, realizes long&#8208;term cycling over 5800 h (&gt; 8 months, 1 mA cm&#8208;2) and 1000 h (10 mA cm&#8208;2), and assures the stable operation of full Zn battery with both coin&#8208; and pouch&#8208;type configurations.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The irreversible issues of Zn anode stemming from dendrite growth and water-induced erosion have severely hindered the commercialization of rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries. Herein, a hydrophobic and fast-Zn2+-conductive zinc hexacyanoferrate (HB-ZnHCF) interphase layer is in-situ integrated on Zn by a rapid room-temperature wet-chemistry method to address these dilemmas. Different from currently proposed hydrophilic inorganic cases, the hydrophobic and compact HB-ZnHCF interphase effectively prevents the access of water molecules to Zn surface, thus avoiding H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. Moreover, the HB-ZnHCF with large internal ion channels, strong zincophilicity, and high Zn2+ transference number (0.86) permits fast Zn2+ transport and enables smooth Zn deposition. Remarkably, the resultant HB-ZnHCF@Zn electrode delivers unprecedented reversibility with 99.88% Coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles, realizes long-term cycling over 5800 h (&amp;gt; 8 months, 1 mA cm-2) and 1000 h (10 mA cm-2), and assures the stable operation of full Zn battery with both coin- and pouch-type configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Rechargeable Air Batteries Using Dihydroxybenzoquinone and Its Polymer as the Negative Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study was conducted on an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable air battery (SSAB) using redox&#8208;active 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DHBQ) and its polymer (PDBM) and a proton&#8208;conductive polymer (Nafion). DHBQ functioned well in the redox reaction with the solid Nafion ionomer at 0.47 and 0.57 V vs. RHE, similar to that in acid aqueous solution. The resulting air battery exhibited an open circuit voltage of 0.80 V and a discharge capacity of 29.7 mAh gDHBQ&#8208;1 at a constant current density (1 mA cm&#8208;2). With PDBM, the discharge capacity was much higher, 176.1 mAh gPDBM&#8208;1, because of the improved utilization of the redox&#8208;active moieties. In the rate characteristics of the SSAB&#8208;PDBM, the coulombic efficiency was 84% at 4 C, which decreased to 66% at 101 C. In a charge/discharge cycle test, the capacity remaining after 30 cycles was 44%, which was able to be significantly improved, to 78%, by tuning the Nafion composition in the negative electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Phase Transitions of Thermotropic Glycolipid Quasicrystal and Frank&#8208;Kasper Mesophases: A Mechanistic Rosetta Stone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rich thermotropic phase map is documented for a class of versatile glycolipids that now includes dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and Frank&#8208;Kasper A15, and &#963; mesophases of tunable periodicity that are connected through rapid thermotropic phase transitions as a function of increasing temperature. This includes the first direct observation of a rapid thermotropic A15&#8594;&#963; phase transition that is proposed to proceed through a diffusionless martensitic process.







Abstract
Experimental results are presented that serve to lower the barrier for developing the science and technology of non&#8208;classical thermotropic glycolipid mesophases, which now include dodecagonal quasicrystal (DDQC) and Frank&#8211;Kasper (FK) A15 and &#963; mesophases that can be produced under mild conditions from a versatile class of sugar&#8208;polyolefin conjugates. By employing &#8220;alloys&#8221; comprised of mono&#8208; and disaccharide&#8208;polyolefin conjugates, and optionally with vitamin E as a small molecule phase modulator, we report the spontaneous formation of stable A15 mesophases at ambient temperature. We further document a rich thermotropic phase map that includes DDQC, A15, and &#963; mesophases of tunable periodicity that are connected through rapid thermotropic phase transitions as a function of increasing temperature in the order: liquid&#8208;like packing (LLP)&#8594;DDQC &#8594; A15&#8594;&#963;&#8594; disorder. This first direct observation of a rapid thermotropic A15&#8594;&#963; phase transition provides support for a diffusionless martensitic process proceeding through strain&#8208;induced introduction of planar defects into the A15 lattice.

         <title>Conformationally Controlled sp3&#8208;Hydrocarbon&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Helix Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aberrant protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) in disease can be disrupted through &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics. However, methods to control the conformation of mimetics for maximum efficacy can be restrictive. Here we show that destabilising syn&#8208;pentane interactions allow substituted hydrocarbons to adopt well&#8208;defined conformations to present functional groups in a way that mimics the &#945;&#8208;helix, thus allowing them to be used as scaffolds for inhibitor design.







Abstract
With over 60&#8201;% of protein&#8211;protein interfaces featuring an &#945;&#8208;helix, the use of &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics as inhibitors of these interactions is a prevalent therapeutic strategy. However, methods to control the conformation of mimetics, thus enabling maximum efficacy, can be restrictive. Alternatively, conformation can be controlled through the introduction of destabilizing syn&#8208;pentane interactions. This tactic, which is often adopted by Nature, is not a common feature of lead optimization owing to the significant synthetic effort required. Through assembly&#8208;line synthesis with NMR and computational analysis, we have shown that alternating syn&#8211;anti configured contiguously substituted hydrocarbons, by avoiding syn&#8208;pentane interactions, adopt well&#8208;defined conformations that present functional groups in an arrangement that mimics the &#945;&#8208;helix. The design of a p53 mimetic that binds to Mdm2 with moderate to good affinity, demonstrates the therapeutic promise of these scaffolds.

         <title>A Hemilabile NHC&#8208;Gold Complex and its Application to the Redox Neutral 1,2&#8208;Oxyarylation of Feedstock Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A hemi&#8208;labile (C^N) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand mediates oxidative addition of aryl iodides to a AuI center. The oxidative addition process has been studied and analyzed computationally. This process allows the first examples of &#8220;exogenous oxidant&#8208;free&#8221; AuI/AuIII catalyzed 1,2&#8208;oxyarylations of ethylene and propylene.







Abstract
We describe a AuI complex of a hemi&#8208;labile (C^N) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand that is able to mediate oxidative addition of aryl iodides. Detailed computational and experimental investigations have been undertaken to verify and rationalize the oxidative addition process. Application of this initiation mode has resulted in the first examples of &#8220;exogenous oxidant&#8208;free&#8221; AuI/AuIII catalyzed 1,2&#8208;oxyarylations of ethylene and propylene. These demanding yet powerful processes establish these commodity chemicals as nucleophilic&#8208;electrophilic building blocks in catalytic reaction design.

         <dc:description>A desymmetrizing silylation of axially chiral aromatic diols is reported. The previously unknown asymmetric silyl ether formation of phenol derivatives is achieved by applying List&#8217;s counteranion&#8208;directed silylation technique.

         <title>Linear Adsorption Enables NO Selective Electroreduction to Hydroxylamine on Single Co Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxylamine (NH2OH), a vital industrial feedstock, is presently synthesized under harsh conditions with serious environmental and energy concerns. Electrocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) reduction is attractive for the production of hydroxylamine under ambient conditions. However, hydroxylamine selectivity is limited by the competitive reaction of ammonia production. Herein, we regulate the adsorption configuration of NO by adjusting the atomic structure of catalysts to control the product selectivity. Co single&#8208;atom catalysts show state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH2OH selectivity from NO electroreduction under neutral conditions (FENH2OH: 81.3%), while Co nanoparticles are inclined to generate ammonia (FENH3: 92.3%). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical simulations unveil that linear adsorption of NO on isolated Co sites enables hydroxylamine formation and bridge adsorption of NO on adjacent Co sites induces the production of ammonia.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nitride Additive: A Drop&#8208;in Solution for Lithium/Garnet Wetting in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garnet oxides such as Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) are promising solid electrolyte materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries because of high ionic conductivity, low electronic leakage, and wide electrochemical stability window. While LLZTO has been frequently discussed to be stable against lithium metal anode, it is challenging to achieve and maintain good solid&#8208;on&#8208;solid wetting at the metal/ceramic interface in both processing and extended electrochemical cycling. Here we address the challenge by a powder&#8208;form magnesium nitride additive, which reacts with the lithium metal anode to produce well&#8208;dispersed lithium nitride. The in&#8208;situ formed lithium nitride promotes reactive wetting at the Li/LLZTO interface, which lowers interfacial resistance, increases critical current density (CCD), and improves cycling stability of the electrochemical cells. The additive recipe has been diversified to titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, tantalum nitride, and niobium nitride, thus supporting the general concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting. Such a design can be extended to other solid&#8208;state devices for better functioning and extended cycle life.</dc:description>

         <title>Frenkel Defect&#8208;modulated Anti&#8208;thermal Quenching Luminescence in Lanthanide&#8208;doped Sc2(WO4)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Although large amount of effort has been invested in combating thermal quenching that severely degrades the performance of luminescent materials particularly at high temperatures, not much affirmative progress has been realized. Herein, we demonstrate that the Frenkel defect formed via controlled annealing of Sc2(WO4)3:Ln (Ln = Yb, Er, Eu, Tb, Sm), can work as energy reservoir and back&#8208;transfer the stored excitation energy to Ln3+ upon heating. Therefore, except routine anti&#8208;thermal quenching, thermally enhanced 415&#8208;fold downshifting and 405&#8208;fold upconversion luminescence are even obtained in Sc2(WO4)3:Yb/Er, which has set a record of both the Yb3+&#8208;Er3+ energy transfer efficiency (&gt; 85%) and the working temperature at 500 and 1073 K, respectively. Moreover, this design strategy is extendable to other hosts possessing Frenkel defect, and modulation of which directly determines whether enhanced or decreased luminescence can be obtained. This discovery has paved new avenues to reliable generation of high&#8208;temperature luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers via Asymmetric Metal Carbene gem&#8208;Dialkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters has received tremendous interest over the past decades, and numerous efficient protocols have been disclosed based on the formation of one C&#8208;C bond between two assembling reactants. However, the use of asymmetric multi&#8208;component reactions that build two C&#8208;C bonds on the same carbonic center with concomitant assembly of quaternary stereocenters is rare and remains challenging. Herein, we disclose an enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazines under dirhodium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalysis, which leads to a practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of poly&#8208;functionalized chiral ketones that bear a &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter in generally good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In comparison to the previous method for the construction of tertiary and quaternary stereocenters via carbene gem&#8208;difunctionalization reactions, this reaction features an unprecedented gem&#8208;dialkylation process via sequential installation of two C&#8208;C bonds on the carbene center in one reaction, providing an essential complement to the asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters using common and readily available starting materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eutectogels are an emerging family of soft ionic materials alternative to ionic liquid gels and organogels, offering fresh perspectives for designing functional dynamic platforms in water&#8208;free environments. Herein, the first example of mixed ionic and electronic conducting supramolecular eutectogel composites&#160;is reported. A fluorescent glutamic acid&#8208;derived low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) was found to self&#8208;assemble into nanofibrillar networks in deep eutectic solvents (DES)/ poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): chondroitin sulfate dispersions. These dynamic materials displayed excellent injectability and self&#8208;healing properties, high ionic conductivity (up to 10&#8208;2 S cm&#8208;1), good biocompatibility, and fluorescence imaging ability. This set of features turns the mixed conducting supramolecular eutectogels into promising adaptive materials for bioimaging and electrostimulation applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding of the nature of single&#8208;atom catalytic sites and identification of their spectroscopic fingerprints are essential prerequisites for the rational design of target catalysts. Here, we apply correlated in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy to probe the edge&#8208;site&#8208;specific chemistry of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) operation. The unique edge&#8208;hosted architecture affords single&#8208;atom Co site remarkable structural flexibility with adapted dynamic oxo adsorption and valence state shuttling between Co(2&#8208;&#948;)+ and Co2+, in contrast to the rigid in&#8208;plane embedded Co1&#8208;Nx counterpart. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergistic interplay of in&#8208;situ reconstructed Co1&#8208;N2&#8208;oxo with peripheral oxygen groups gives rise to a near&#8208;optimal adsorption of *OOH intermediate and substantially increases the activation barrier for its dissociation, accounting for a robust acidic ORR activity and 2e&#8208; selectivity for H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Photoreduction of Carborane Phosphonium Salts: Efficient Synthesis of Carborane&#8208;Oxindole&#8208;Pharmaceutical Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreaction of carboranes is an effective approach to prepare carborane&#8208;containing compounds. While several methods via boron&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals have been established, those via carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are much underdeveloped, except for the UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photohomolysis. Herein, we describe a simple but effective approach to access carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals via photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts under blue light irradiation without using transition metals and photocatalysts. The utility of the method was demonstrated by successfully preparing a range of carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids via radical cascade reactions. Computational and experimental studies suggested that the carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals were generated via single electron transfer of the photoactive charge transfer complexes between the salts and the additive potassium acetate.</dc:description>

While several methods via boron-centered carboranyl radicals have been established, those via carbon-centered carboranyl radicals are much underdeveloped, except for the UV-light-promoted photohomolysis. Herein, we describe a simple but effective approach to access carbon-centered carboranyl radicals via photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts under blue light irradiation without using transition metals and photocatalysts. The utility of the method was demonstrated by successfully preparing a range of carborane-oxindole-pharmaceutical hybrids via radical cascade reactions. Computational and experimental studies suggested that the carbon-centered carboranyl radicals were generated via single electron transfer of the photoactive charge transfer complexes between the salts and the additive potassium acetate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia over Cu Nanosheets via Facet Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into ammonia (NH3) represents a potential way for achieving carbon&#8722;free NH3 production while balancing the nitrogen cycle. Herein we report a high&#8722;performance Cu nanosheets catalyst which delivers a NH3 partial current density of 665 mA cm&#8722;2 and NH3 yield rate of 1.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell at &#8722;0.59 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The catalyst showed a high stability for 700 h with NH3 Faradaic efficiency of ~88% at 365 mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy results verify that Cu nanosheets are in situ derived from the as&#8208;prepared CuO nanosheets under electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction conditions. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations indicate that the high performance is attributed to the tandem interaction of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets. The NO2&#8722; generated on the Cu(100) facets is subsequently hydrogenated on the Cu(111) facets, thus the tandem catalysis promotes the crucial hydrogenation of *NO to *NOH for NH3 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered Zeolite for Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional Separation Membranes for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane separation is an energy&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly process. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular sieving membranes featuring unique nanopores and low transport resistance have the potential to achieve highly permeable and selective mixture separation with low energy consumption. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio zeolite nanosheets with intrinsic molecular&#8208;sieving pores perpendicular to the layers are desirable building blocks for fabricating high&#8208;performance 2D zeolite membrane. However, a wider application of 2D zeolitic membranes is restricted by the limited number of recognized zeolite nanosheets. Herein, we report a swollen layered zeolite, ECNU&#8208;28, with SZR topology and eight&#8208;member ring (8&#8208;MR, 3.0 &#197; &#215; 4.8 &#197;) pores normal to the nanosheets. It can be easily exfoliated to construct 2D membrane, which shows a high hydrogen selectivity up to 130 from natural gas and is promising for hydrogen purification and greenhouse gas capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Type All&#8208;Inorganic Heterometallic Nanoclusters: Record High&#8208;Nuclearity Cobalt Polyoxoniobates for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Only rarely have polyoxometalates been found to form core&#8208;shell nanoclusters. Here, we succeeded in isolating a series of rare giant and all&#8208;inorganic core&#8208;shell cobalt polyoxoniobates (Co&#8208;PONbs) with diverse shapes, nuclearities and original topologies, including 50&#8208;nuclearity {Co12Nb38O132}, 54&#8208;nuclearity {Co20Nb34O128}, 62&#8208;nuclearity {Co26Nb36O140} and 87&#8208;nuclearity {Co33Nb54O128}. They are the largest Co&#8208;PONbs and also the polyoxometalates containing the greatest number of Co ions and the largest cobalt clusters known thus far. These molecular Co&#8208;PONbs have intriguing and atomically precise core&#8208;shell architectures comprising unique cobalt oxide cores and niobate oxide shells. In particular, the encapsulated cobalt oxide cores with different nuclearities have identical compositions, structures and mixed&#8208;valence Co3+/Co2+ states as the different sized Co&#8208;O moieties of the bulk cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4, suggesting that they can serve as various molecular models of the cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4. The successful construction of the series of the Co&#8208;PONbs reveals a feasible and versatile synthetic method for making rare core&#8208;shell heterometallic PONbs. Further, these new&#8208;type core&#8208;shell bimetal species are promising cluster molecular catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion of Chemical Handles into the Backbone of DNA during Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis by Oxidative Coupling of Amines to Phosphites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugation of molecules or proteins to oligonucleotides can improve their functional and therapeutic capacity. However, such modifications are often limited to the 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; end of oligonucleotides. Herein, we report the development of an inexpensive and simple method that allows for the insertion of chemical handles into the backbone of oligonucleotides. This method is compatible with standardized automated solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis, and relies on formation of phosphoramidates. A unique phosphoramidite is incorporated into a growing oligonucleotide, and oxidized to the desired phosphoramidate using iodine and an amine of choice. Azides, alkynes, amines, and alkanes have been linked to oligonucleotides via internally positioned phosphoramidates with oxidative coupling yields above 80%. We show the design of phosphoramidates from secondary amines that specifically hydrolyze to the phosphate only at decreased pH. Finally, we show the synthesis of an antibody&#8208;DNA conjugate, where the oligonucleotide can be selectively released in a pH 5.5 buffer.</dc:description>

         <title>Prussian Blue Analogues with Optimized Crystal Plane Orientation and Low Crystal Defects toward 450 Wh kg&#8208;1 Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical energy density and low&#8208;cost. However, high water and vacancies content of PBAs lower their energy density and bring safety issues, impeding their large&#8208;scale application in SIBs. Herein, a facile &#8220;potassium&#8208;ions assisted&#8221; strategy is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs. By manipulating the dominant crystal plane and suppressing vacancies, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs exhibits increased redox potential resulting in high energy density up to ~450 Wh kg&#8208;1, which is at the same level of the well&#8208;known LiFePO4 cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, unconventional highly&#8208;reversible phase evolution and redox&#8208;active pairs were identified by multiple in&#8208;situ techniques for the first time. The preferred guest&#8208;ion storage sites and migration mechanism were systematically analysed through theoretical calculations. We believe these results could inspire the designing of safe SIBs with high energy density.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Polymer as Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li)&#160;metal anodes have the highest theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential making them ideal for Li metal batteries (LMBs). However, Li dendrite formation on the anode impedes the proper discharge capacity and practical cycle life of LMBs, particularly in carbonate electrolytes.&#160;Herein, we developed a reactive alternative polymer named&#160;P(St&#8208;MaI) containing carboxylic acid and cyclic ether moieties which would in&#8208;situ&#160;form artificial polymeric solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with Li. This SEI can accommodate volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. The presence of carboxylic acid and cyclic ether pendant groups greatly contribute to the induction of uniform Li ion deposition. In addition, the presence of benzyl rings makes the polymer have a certain mechanical strength and plays a key role in inhibiting the growth of Li&#160;dendrites. As a result, the symmetric Li||Li cell with P(St&#8208;MaI)@Li layer can stably cycle for over 900 h under 1 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;without polarization voltage increasing, while their Li||LiFePO4&#160;full batteries maintain high capacity retention of 96% after 930 cycles at 1C in carbonate electrolytes.&#160;The innovative strategy of artificial&#160;SEI is broadly applicable in designing new materials to inhibit Li dendrite growth on Li metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Functionalisation of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine by Organic Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The epigenetic modification 5&#8208;methylcytosine plays a vital role in development, cell specific gene expression and disease states. The selective chemical modification of the 5&#8208;methylcytosine methyl group is challenging. Currently, no such chemistry exists. Direct functionalisation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine would improve the detection and study of this epigenetic feature. We report a xanthone&#8208;photosensitised process that introduces a 4&#8208;pyridine modification at a C(sp3)&#8208;H bond in the methyl group of 5&#8208;methylcytosine. We propose a reaction mechanism for this type of reaction based on density functional calculations and apply transition state analysis to rationalise differences in observed reaction efficiencies between cyanopyridine derivatives. The reaction is initiated by single electron oxidation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine followed by deprotonation to generate the methyl group radical. Cross coupling of the methyl radical with 4&#8208;cyanopyridine installs a 4&#8208;pyridine label at 5&#8208;methylcytosine. We demonstrate use of the pyridination reaction to enrich 5&#8208;methylcytosine&#8208;containing RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonance Building&#8208;Block&#8208;Based Electroluminescent Material: Lengthening Emission Maximum and Shortening Delayed Fluorescence Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are considered a class of organic materials with exceptional electronic and optical properties, which make them promising for the applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we improved, synthesized, and characterized a multiple&#8208;resonance type emitter based on the assembly of MR&#8208;building blocks (MR&#8208;BBs). By optimizing the geometric arrangement of MR&#8208;BBs, we were able to generate narrowband emission in the longer wavelength region and shorten the delayed excited&#8208;state lifetime, resulting in improved emission efficiency compared to the parent molecule. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule, m&#8208;DBCz, exhibited narrowband yellowish&#8208;green TADF emission with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 32 nm and a small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap of 0.04 eV. The OLED developed using m&#8208;DBCz as the emitter demonstrated electroluminescence at 548 nm and achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.9%. Further optimization of the device resulted in a high external quantum efficiency of 36.3% and extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQE values of 30.1% and 27.7% obtained even at high luminance levels of 50000 and 100000 cd m&#8722;2. These results demonstrate the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF materials for applications on ultrahigh&#8208;luminance OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Performance of Cobalt Oxide by Protic Ionic Liquid Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is an appealing way for small&#8208;scale and decentralized ammonia synthesis and waste nitrate treatment. Currently, strategies to enhance the reaction performance through elaborate catalyst design have been well developed, but it is still of challenge to realize the promotion of reactivity and selectivity at the same time. Instead, a facile method of catalyst modification with ionic liquid to modulate the electrode surface microenvironment that mimic the role of the natural MoFe protein environment is found effective for the simultaneous improvement of NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a low NaNO3 concentration of 500 ppm. Protic ionic liquid (PIL) N&#8208;butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bim]NTf2) modified Co3O4&#8208;x is fabricated and affords the NH3 yield rate and FE of 30.23 &#177; 4.97 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 and 84.74 &#177; 3.43% at &#8208;1.71 and &#8208;1.41 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, outperforming the pristine Co3O4&#8208;x. Mechanistic and theoretical studies reveal that the PIL modification facilitates the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8208; as well as the NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction competition via enhancing the Lewis acidity of the Co center, shuttling protons, and constructing a hydrogen bonded and hydrophobic electrode surface microenvironment.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioamide peptides were synthesized via a straightforward one&#8208;pot process via the linkage of diverse natural amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane, wherein carbonyl groups were replaced with thiono compounds with minimal racemization. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies demonstrated that trichlorosilane enabled the activation of carboxylic acids via intense interactions with the Si&#8211;O bond, followed by coupling of the carboxylic acids with thiolphosphonate to obtain the key intermediate S&#8208;acyl dithiophosphate. Silyl&#8208;activated quadrangular metathesis transition states afforded thioamide peptides. The potential applications for thioamide peptides were further highlighted via late&#8208;stage linkages of diverse natural products and pharmaceutical drugs and the thioamide moiety.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a new strategy in which a thiolate&#8208;protected Ag25 nanocluster can be doped with open d&#8208;shell group 8 (Ru, Os) and 9 (Ir) metals by forming metal hydride (RuH2, OsH2, IrH) superatoms with a closed d&#8208;shell. Structural analyses using various experimental and theoretical methods revealed that the Ag25 nanoclusters were co&#8208;doped with the open d&#8208;shell metal and hydride species to produce superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters, establishing a novel superatom doping phenomenon for open d&#8208;shell metals. The synthesized superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters exhibited dopant&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Comparative PL lifetime studies of the Ag25 nanoclusters doped with 8&#8211;10 group metals revealed that both radiative and nonradiative processes were significantly dependent on the dopant. The former is strongly correlated with the electron affinity of the metal dopant, whereas the latter is governed predominantly by the kernel structure changed upon the doping of the metal hydride(s).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the electronic structure of covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalysts is essential for maximizing photocatalytic activity. Herein, we report an isoreticular family of&#160;multivariate&#160;COFs&#160;containing chromenoquinoline rings in the COF structure and electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups in the pores.&#160;Intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions in the COFs allowed tuning of local charge distributions&#160;and charge carrier separation under visible light irradiation, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance. By optimizing the optoelectronic properties of the COFs, a photocatalytic uranium extraction efficiency of 8.02 mg/g/day was achieved using a nitro&#8208;functionalized multicomponent COF in natural seawater, exceeding the performance of all COFs reported to date.&#160;Results demonstrate an effective design strategy towards high&#8208;activity COF photocatalysts with intramolecular D&#8208;A structures not easily accessible using traditional synthetic approaches.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been employed to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To achieve high activity and selectivity, various building blocks containing heteroatoms and groups linked by imine bonds were used to create catalytic COFs. However, the roles of linkages of COFs in ORR have not been investigated. In this work, catalytic linkage engineering has been employed to modulate the catalytic behaviors. To create single catalytic sites while avoiding other possible catalytic sites, we synthesized COFs from benzene units linked by various bonds, such as imine, amide, azine, and oxazole bonds. Among these COFs, the oxazole&#8208;linkage in COFs enables to catalyze the ORR with the highest activity, which achieved a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.75 V and a limited current density of 5.5 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the oxazole&#8208;linked COF achieved a conversion frequency (TOF) value of 0.0133 S&#8722;1, which were 1.9, 1.3, and 7.4&#8208;times that of azine&#8208;, amide&#8208; and imine&#8208;COFs, respectively. The theoretical calculation showed that the carbon atoms in oxazole linkages facilitated the form of OOH* and promoted protonation of O* to form the OH*, thus advancing the catalytic activity. This work guides us on which linkages in COFs are suitable for ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO Mediated by Silver Single Atoms Anchored on Tubular Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photosynthesis is a promising strategy for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into fuels and value&#8208;added chemical products. However, a photocatalyst is usually suffered from low activity and product selectivity due to the sluggish dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers. Herein, we develop the Ag single atoms anchored hollow porous polygonal tubular C3N4 (PCN) photocatalyst Ag1@PCN with an Ag&#8208;N3coordination for CO2 photoreduction using H2O as the reductant. The as&#8208;synthesized Ag1@PCNexhibits a high CO production rate of 0.32 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 (mass of catalyst: 2 mg), a high selectivity (&gt;94%), and an excellent stability in the long term of photocatalytic reaction. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) analyses elucidate that the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (Ag&#8208;N3) not only favors *CO2 adsorption, *COOH generation and desorption, but also accelerates the dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers between C3N4 and Ag single atoms, thereby accounting for the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity with a high CO selectivity. This work provides a deep insight into the important role of strong metal&#8208;support interaction in enhancing the photoactivity and CO selectivity of CO2 photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Observing Confined Local Oxygen&#8208;induced Reversible Thiol/Disulfide Cycle with a Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disulfide bonds play an important role in thiol&#8208;based redox regulation. However, owing to the lack of analytical tools, little is known about how local O2 mediates the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle under protein confinement. In this study, a protein nanopore reactor inside a glove box is developed for O2 confinement, as well as a single&#8208;molecule sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle. The results demonstrate that the presence of local O2 molecules in protein nanopores can facilitate the redox cycle of disulfide formation and cleavage by promoting a higher fraction of effective reactant collisions owing to nanoconfinement. Further kinetic calculations indicate that negatively charged residues near the reactive sites facilitate proton&#8208;involved, oxygen&#8208;induced disulfide cleavage under protein confinement. The unexpectedly strong oxidation ability of confined local O2 may play an essential role in cellular redox signaling and enzyme reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Excited State Trajectories on Potential Energy Surfaces with Atomic Resolution in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoexcited molecular trajectories on the potential energy surfaces prior to thermalization are intimately connected to the photochemical reaction outcome. The excited state trajectories of a diplatinum complex featuring photo&#8208;activated metal&#8208;metal &#120590;&#8208;bond formation and associated Pt&#8208;Pt stretching motions were detected in real time using femtosecond wide angle X&#8208;ray solution scattering. The observed motions correspond well with coherent vibrational wavepacket motions detected by femtosecond optical transient absorption. Two key coordinates for intersystem crossing have been identified, the Pt&#8208;Pt bond distance and the orientation of the ligands coordinated with the platinum centers, along which the excited state trajectories can be projected onto the calculated potential energy surfaces of the excited states. This investigation has gleaned novel insight into electronic transitions occurring on the time scales of vibrational motions measured in real time, revealing ultrafast nonadiabatic or non&#8208;equilibrium processes along excited state trajectories involving multiple excited state potential energy surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Apolipoprotein&#8197;E Recognizes Alzheimer's Disease Associated 3&#8208;O Sulfation of Heparan Sulfate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of Apolipoprotein&#8197;E (ApoE) with cell surface Heparan Sulfate (HS) is enhanced by a rare, Alzheimer's Disease linked 3&#8208;O&#8208;Sulfo group. This binding motif is shared with tau protein, suggesting a mechanism for ApoE/tau interactions in the association of certain ApoE isoforms with AD.







Abstract
Apolipoprotein&#8197;E (ApoE)&#8217;s &#1013;4 alle is the most important genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cell&#8208;surface heparan sulfate (HS) is a cofactor for ApoE/LRP1 interaction and the prion&#8208;like spread of tau pathology between cells. 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfo (3&#8208;O&#8208;S) modification of HS has been linked to AD through its interaction with tau, and enhanced levels of 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated HS and 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfotransferases in the AD brain. In this study, we characterized ApoE/HS interactions in wildtype ApoE3, AD&#8208;linked ApoE4, and AD&#8208;protective ApoE2 and ApoE3&#8208;Christchurch. Glycan microarray and SPR assays revealed that all ApoE isoforms recognized 3&#8208;O&#8208;S. NMR titration localized ApoE/3&#8208;O&#8208;S binding to the vicinity of the canonical HS binding motif. In cells, the knockout of HS3ST1&#8208;a major 3&#8208;O sulfotransferase&#8208;reduced cell surface binding and uptake of ApoE. 3&#8208;O&#8208;S is thus recognized by both tau and ApoE, suggesting that the interplay between 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated HS, tau and ApoE isoforms may modulate AD risk.

         <title>Formation and Loading of a (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;Ethylmalonamyl Starter Unit in the Assembly Line of Polyketide&#8208;Nonribosomal Peptide Hybrid Sanglifehrin A</title>

         <dc:description>
The process for forming and loading a (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl starter unit in the assembly line of sanglifehrin A is uncovered. This process involves two unusual enzymatic reactions that occur on a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP): an amide synthetase catalyzes (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonyl amidation, and a homolog of &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III transfers resultant (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl onto the assembly line to prime the biosynthesis of sanglifehrin A.







Abstract
Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a spirolactam&#8208;conjugated, 22&#8208;membered macrolide with remarkable immunosuppressive and antiviral activities. This macrolide is a result of a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly line that utilizes (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl as a starter unit. Here, we report that the formation and loading of this starter unit in the SFA assembly line involve two unusual enzymatic reactions that occur on a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP), SfaO. An amide synthetase, SfaP, catalyzes the amidation of (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonyl in a SfaO&#8208;dependent manner. Then, a &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III&#8208;like protein, SfaN, transfers resultant (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl from SfaO onto the loading ACP domain of the hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS assembly line to prime SFA biosynthesis. Both SfaP and SfaN display promiscuous activities. This study furthers the appreciation of assembly line chemistry, as a new paradigm for unusual building block formation and incorporation is provided.

         <title>Inducing Covalent Atomic Interaction in Intermetallic Pt Alloy Nanocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing covalent interaction bonding between Pt and Ga atoms, the developed L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa/C ORR catalyst shows efficient and stable performance in practical fuel cells. This work may provide a new strategy to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts via tuning the type of chemical bonds for electrochemical energy conversion.







Abstract
The harsh working environments of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) pose huge challenges to the stability of Pt&#8208;based alloy catalysts. The widespread presence of metallic bonds with significantly delocalized electron distribution often lead to component segregation and rapid performance decay. Here we report L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa intermetallic nanoparticles with a unique covalent atomic interaction between Pt&#8722;Ga as high&#8208;performance PEMFC cathode catalysts. The L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa/C catalyst shows superb oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in fuel cell cathode (mass activity=0.57&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density=2.60/1.24&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;O2/air, 28&#8197;mV voltage loss at 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles). Theoretical calculations reveal the optimized adsorption of oxygen intermediates via the formed biaxial strain on L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa surface, and the durability enhancement stems from the stronger Pt&#8722;M bonds than those in L11&#8722;PtCu resulted from Pt&#8722;Ga covalent interactions.

         <title>Molecule Saturation Boosts Acetylene Semihydrogenation Activity and Selectivity on a Core&#8208;Shell Ruthenium@Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective catalyst for semihydrogenation of acetylene was created by layering Pd on large Ru nanoparticles with terrace sites and a smaller lattice constant. The catalyst stabilizes unsaturated acetylene as it undergoes semihydrogenation while promoting ethylene desorption, thereby achieving high activity and selectivity at the same time.







Abstract
Increasing selectivity without the expense of activity is desired but challenging in heterogeneous catalysis. By revealing the molecule saturation and adsorption sensitivity on overlayer thickness, strain, and coordination of Pd&#8208;based catalysts from first&#8208;principles calculations, we designed a stable Pd monolayer (ML) catalyst on a Ru terrace to boost both activity and selectivity of acetylene semihydrogenation. The least saturated molecule is most sensitive to the change in catalyst electronic and geometric properties. By simultaneously compressing the Pd ML and exposing the high coordination sites, the adsorption of more saturated ethylene is considerably weakened to facilitate the desorption for high selectivity. The even stronger weakening to the least saturated acetylene drives its hydrogenation such that it is more exothermic, thereby boosting the activity. Tailoring the molecule saturation and its sensitivity to structure and composition provides a tool for rational design of efficient catalysts.

         <title>A Fused [5]Helicene Dimer with a Figure&#8208;Eight Topology: Synthesis, Chiral Resolution, and Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Suzuki coupling&#8208;mediated macrocyclization followed by a Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of a vinyl ether has led to the synthesis of a fused [5]helicene dimer with a figure&#8208;eight geometry, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The fully conjugated electronic structure and D2 symmetry results in the isolated enantiomers showing persistent chirality and large dissymmetric factors.







Abstract
Chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons are promising chiroptical materials; their synthesis, however, remains a big challenge. Herein, we report the facile synthesis and chiral resolution of a double&#8208;stranded figure&#8208;eight carbon nanobelt 1 in which two [5]helicene units are fused together. Two synthetic routes were developed, and, in particular, a strategy involving Suzuki coupling&#8208;mediated macrocyclization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ether turned out to be the most efficient. The structure of 1 was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The isolated (P,P)&#8208; and (M,M)&#8208; enantiomers show persistent chiroptical properties with relatively large dissymmetric factors (|gabs|=5.4&#215;10&#8722;3 and |glum|=1.0&#215;10&#8722;2), which can be explained by the effective electron delocalization along the fully conjugated belt and the unique D2 symmetry. 1 exhibits local aromatic character with a dominant structure containing eight Clar's aromatic sextet rings.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;triggered Carbon Monoxide and Manganese Dioxide Generation based on Scintillating Nanoparticles for Cascade Cancer Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered carbon monoxide and manganese dioxide generation nanocomposites were fabricated with UV&#8208;responsive manganese carbonyl and radioluminescent scintillating nanoparticles. The glycolytic inhibition of carbon monoxide, coupled with the Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like activity of manganese dioxide, greatly boost the effect of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with broad therapeutic effects. Here, a multifunctional X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered carbon monoxide (CO) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) generation nanoplatform based on metal carbonyl and scintillating nanoparticles (SCNPs) is reported. Attributed to the radioluminescent characteristic of SCNPs, UV&#8208;responsive Mn2(CO)10 is not only indirectly activated to release CO by X&#8208;ray but can also be degraded into MnO2. A high dose of CO can be used as a glycolytic inhibitor for tumor suppression; it will also sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy. Meanwhile MnO2, as the photolytic byproduct of Mn2(CO)10, has both glutathione (GSH) depletion and Fenton&#8208;like Mn2+ delivery properties to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) in tumors. Thus, this strategy can realize X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated CO release, GSH depletion, and &#8901;OH generation for cascade cancer radiosensitization. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated Mn2+ in vivo demonstrates an MRI contrast effect, making it a potential theranostic nanoplatform.

         <title>The Indenyl Effect: Accelerated C&#8722;H Amidation of Arenes via Ind*RhIII Nitrene Transfer Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acyl silane directed C&#8722;H amidation of benzoyl silanes via nitrene transfer catalysis using 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones as the N&#8208;donor source was significantly accelerated in the presence of a heptamethylindenyl&#8208;rhodium catalyst (Ind*RhIII).







Abstract
Investigations into C&#8722;H amidation reactions catalysed by cationic half&#8208;sandwich d6 metal complexes revealed that the indenyl&#8208;derived catalyst [Ind*RhCl2]2 significantly accelerated the directed ortho C&#8722;H amidation of benzoyl silanes using 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones. Ring slippage involving a haptotropic &#951;5 to &#951;3 rearrangement of the indenyl complex proposedly enables ligand substitution at the metal centre to proceed via associative, rather than dissociative pathways, leading to significant rate and yield enhancements. Intriguingly, this phenomenon appears specific for C&#8722;H amidation reactions involving weakly coordinating carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups with no acceleration observed for the corresponding reactions involving strongly coordinating nitrogen&#8208;based directing groups.

     alt="The Indenyl Effect: Accelerated C&#8722;H Amidation of Arenes via Ind*RhIII Nitrene Transfer Catalysis**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acyl silane directed C&#8722;H amidation of benzoyl silanes via nitrene transfer catalysis using 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones as the &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;donor source was significantly accelerated in the presence of a heptamethylindenyl-rhodium catalyst (Ind*Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigations into C&#8722;H amidation reactions catalysed by cationic half-sandwich d&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; metal complexes revealed that the indenyl-derived catalyst [Ind*RhCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly accelerated the directed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;H amidation of benzoyl silanes using 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones. Ring slippage involving a haptotropic &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; rearrangement of the indenyl complex proposedly enables ligand substitution at the metal centre to proceed via associative, rather than dissociative pathways, leading to significant rate and yield enhancements. Intriguingly, this phenomenon appears specific for C&#8722;H amidation reactions involving weakly coordinating carbonyl-based directing groups with no acceleration observed for the corresponding reactions involving strongly coordinating nitrogen-based directing groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Sustainable Wood&#8208;Based Iron Photocatalyst for Multiple Uses with Sunlight: Water Treatment and Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst was made from demethylated lignin as sustainable source and Fe3O4. It can be used in environmental sciences to clean wastewater and in material sciences as a radical photoinitiator, resulting in crosslinking of vinyl monomers by radical photopolymerization. Films obtained showed good water repelling and no tackiness even in an aerobic surrounding.







Abstract
A sustainable photocatalyst for use with multiple purpose comprising demethylated lignin (Fe3O4@D&#8208;wood) was made by treatment of wood and iron oxide. Characterization followed by XRD, UV/Vis, photo&#8208;current studies, and electrochemical measurements. This material became subject of photocatalytic explorations for water treatment and material synthesis by radical photopolymerization. Exposure of Fe3O4@D&#8208;wood with artificial sunlight showed an improved activity considering photochemical oxidation of organic pollutants in the presence of H2O2. The efficient generation of reactive radicals brought this system also to photopolymerization. Here, radicals based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the catalytic cycle can be seen as the dominating species to initiate radical polymerization. A mixture of UDMA and TPGDA showed good reactivity with cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Photocatalyst used for water treatment facilitates reuse for photopolymerization.

         <title>Unveiling the Critical Role of Ion Coordination Configuration of Ether Electrolytes for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ether solvent (1,3&#8208;dimethoxypropane, DMP) is used for the configuration of the electrochemical behavior of electrolytes in lithium metal batteris. The six&#8208;membered Li+&#8208;chelating ring greatly improves the oxidation stability of the ether&#8208;based electrolyte compared to the conventional five&#8208;membered chelate ring. The cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase enriched in LiF effectively protects the nickel&#8208;rich cathode from corrosion by electrolyte side reactions.







Abstract
Albeit ethers are favorable electrolyte solvents for lithium (Li) metal anode, their inferior oxidation stability (&lt;4.0&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) is problematic for high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Studies of ether electrolytes have been focusing on the archetype glyme structure with ethylene oxide moieties. Herein, we unveil the crucial effect of ion coordination configuration on oxidation stability by varying the ether backbone structure. The designed 1,3&#8208;dimethoxypropane (DMP, C3) forms a unique six&#8208;membered chelating complex with Li+, whose stronger solvating ability suppresses oxidation side reactions. In addition, the favored hydrogen transfer reaction between C3 and anion induces a dramatic enrichment of LiF (a total atomic ratio of 76.7&#8201;%) on the cathode surface. As a result, the C3&#8208;based electrolyte enables greatly improved cycling of nickel&#8208;rich cathodes under 4.7&#8197;V. This study offers fundamental insights into rational electrolyte design for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Crystallinity Regulation and Defects Passivation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Using Fully Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed through Gilch reaction. The obtained PAFs have rigid conjugated backbones with high specific surface area and excellent stability. The PAFs were successfully applied in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by doping into the perovskite layer, and the power conversion efficiencies and stability significantly increased.







Abstract
Fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) have been constructed through Gilch reaction. The obtained PAFs have rigid conjugated backbones, high specific surface area, and excellent stability. The prepared PAF&#8208;154 and PAF&#8208;155 have been successfully applied in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by doping into the perovskite layer. The champion PSC devices afford a power conversion efficiency of 22.8&#8201;% and 22.4&#8201;%. It is found that the PAFs can be used as an efficient nucleation template, thus regulating the perovskite crystallinity. Meanwhile, PAFs can also passivate defects and promote carriers transporting in the perovskite film. By the comparative study with their linear counterpart, we unravel that the efficacy of PAFs is highly related to their porous structure and rigid fully conjugated networks. The unencapsulated devices with PAFs doping exhibit outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 80&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after half&#8208;year storage in ambient conditions.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Site Conformational Exchange in the Synthetic Neomycin&#8208;Sensing Riboswitch Studied by 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motions are tightly coupled with function. Here we use a unique combination of five different fluorine NMR relaxation methods to reveal the dynamics in three structurally similar riboswitch:ligand complexes. Our data displays unexpectedly complex exchange topologies with up to four structurally different states. Importantly, the associated kinetic and thermodynamics parameters could be accurately determined.







Abstract
The synthetic neomycin&#8208;sensing riboswitch interacts with its cognate ligand neomycin as well as with the related antibiotics ribostamycin and paromomycin. Binding of these aminoglycosides induces a very similar ground state structure in the RNA, however, only neomycin can efficiently repress translation initiation. The molecular origin of these differences has been traced back to differences in the dynamics of the ligand:riboswitch complexes. Here, we combine five complementary fluorine based NMR methods to accurately quantify seconds to microseconds dynamics in the three riboswitch complexes. Our data reveal complex exchange processes with up to four structurally different states. We interpret our findings in a model that shows an interplay between different chemical groups in the antibiotics and specific bases in the riboswitch. More generally, our data underscore the potential of 19F NMR methods to characterize complex exchange processes with multiple excited states.

The asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;vulgarisins&#8197;A&#8211;E, which share a rare [5&#8208;6&#8208;4&#8208;5] tetracyclic core structure, have been achieved for the first time in a divergent manner.

Abstract
The asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;vulgarisins&#8197;A&#8211;E, which share a rare and highly oxygenated [5&#8208;6&#8208;4&#8208;5] tetracyclic core structure that were isolated from P. vulgaris Linn., have been described for the first time in a divergent manner. Key transformations include: 1) a catalytic asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation to forge the A ring bearing desired stereochemistry at C14; 2) a one&#8208;pot borylation/conjugate addition process for creation of the C1&#8722;C11 bond; 3) a Wolff ring contraction to assemble the bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane subunit (CD rings); and 4) a stereocontrolled pinacol cyclization for construction of the central B ring of the natural products.

&lt;p&gt;The asymmetric total syntheses of (+)-vulgarisins&#8197;A&#8211;E, which share a rare and highly oxygenated [5-6-4-5] tetracyclic core structure that were isolated from &lt;i&gt;P. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; Linn., have been described for the first time in a divergent manner. Key transformations include: 1) a catalytic asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation to forge the A ring bearing desired stereochemistry at C14; 2) a one-pot borylation/conjugate addition process for creation of the C1&#8722;C11 bond; 3) a Wolff ring contraction to assemble the bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane subunit (CD rings); and 4) a stereocontrolled pinacol cyclization for construction of the central B ring of the natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Resolidified Chalcogen Precursors for High&#8208;Quality 2D Semiconductor Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen powder is pre&#8208;melted and resolidified to give a stable chalcogen precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of transition metal dichalcogenides. The obtained monolayer tungsten disulfide is uniform and shows high optical and structural quality.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained attention in optoelectronics for their extraordinary properties. However, the large amount and locally distributed lattice defects affect the optical properties of 2D TMDCs, and the defects originate from unstable factors in the synthesis process. In this work, we develop a method of pre&#8208;melting and resolidification of chalcogen precursors (sulfur and selenium), namely resolidified chalcogen, as precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of TMDCs with ultrahigh quality and uniformity. Taking WS2 as an example, the monolayer WS2 shows uniform fluorescence intensity and a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of photoluminescence peak at low temperatures with an average value of 13.6&#177;1.9&#8197;meV. The defect densities at the interior and edge region are both low and comparable, i.e., (9&#177;3)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2 and (10&#177;4)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2, indicating its high structural quality and uniformity. This method is universal in growing high quality monolayer MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, and will benefit their applications.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells by a Multifunctional Composite Photoanode to 14.13&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to fabricate a multifunctional composite photoanode containing TiO2 hollow spheres, Au nanoparticles and upconversion nanoparticles is presented. A champion power conversion efficiency of 14.13&#8201;% is obtained, which is a record for N719 dye&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells.







Abstract
We report a new strategy to fabricate a multifunctional composite photoanode containing TiO2 hollow spheres (TiO2&#8208;HSs), Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and novel NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Yb,Er@NaLuF4&#8201;:&#8201;Eu@SiO2 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The AuNPs are grown on the photoanode film including TiO2&#8208;HSs and UCNPs by a simple in situ plasmonic treatment. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.13&#8201;% is obtained, which is a record for N719 dye&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, demonstrating great potential for the solar cells toward commercialization. This obvious enhancement is ascribed to a collaborative mechanism of the TiO2&#8208;HSs exhibiting excellent light&#8208;scattering ability, of the UCNPs converting near&#8208;infrared photons into visible photons and of the AuNPs presenting outstanding surface plasmon resonance effect. Notably, a steady&#8208;state experiment further reveals that the champion cell exhibits 95.33&#8201;% retainment in efficiency even after 180&#8197;h of measurements, showing good device stability.

         <title>Construction of Axially Chiral Arylpyrroles via Atroposelective Diyne Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective diyne cyclization enables the efficient synthesis of a range of axially chiral arylpyrrole biaryls in good to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities via oxidation and X&#8722;H insertion of vinyl cations. This method gives the first synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers and the first atroposelective diyne cyclization.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryls widely exist in natural products and pharmaceuticals and are used as chiral ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis. Compared to the well&#8208;established axially chiral 6&#8208;membered biaryl skeletons, examples of 5&#8208;membered biaryls have been quite scarce, and mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers have not been reported. Here, we disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective diyne cyclization for the construction of a range of axially chiral arylpyrrole biaryls in good to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities via oxidation and X&#8722;H insertion of vinyl cations. Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers, but also constitutes the first example of atroposelective diyne cyclization and the first atropisomer construction via vinyl cations. Theoretical calculations further support the mechanism of vinyl cation&#8208;involved cyclization and elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane via Regulating Methyl Intermediates over Metal/ZnO Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;loaded ZnO has been investigated for photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane, among which Au/ZnO exhibited a C2&#8208;C4 hydrocarbon production rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 83&#8201;% selectivity. Photogenerated methyl active groups can be selectively coupled on Au but tend to be over&#8208;oxidized into CO2 on other transition metals mainly because of the deference in *CH3&#8208;metal interaction.







Abstract
Methane conversion to higher hydrocarbons requires harsh reaction conditions due to high energy barriers associated with C&#8722;H bond activation. Herein, we report a systematic investigation of photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over transition&#8208;metal&#8208;loaded ZnO photocatalysts. A 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Au/ZnO delivered a remarkable C2&#8208;C4 hydrocarbon production rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (83&#8201;% C2&#8208;C4 selectivity) under light irradiation with excellent photostability over two days. The metal type and its interaction with ZnO strongly influence the selectivity toward C&#8722;C coupling products. Photogenerated Zn+&#8208;O&#8722; sites enable CH4 activation to methyl intermediates (*CH3) migrating onto adjacent metal nanoparticles. The nature of the *CH3&#8208;metal interaction controls the OCM products. In the case of Au, strong d&#8208;&#963; orbital hybridization reduces metal&#8208;C&#8722;H bond angles and steric hindrance, thereby enabling efficient methyl coupling. Findings indicate the d&#8208;&#963; center may be a suitable descriptor for predicting product selectivity during OCM over metal/ZnO photocatalysts.

         <title>Traffic Lights for Catalysis: Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular and Extended Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just as flowers blooming in response to the sun attract bees to continue their natural life cycle, molecules which respond to external stimuli can be used to control catalytic cycles. Development of stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular and extended catalytic platforms is a pathway for precise tuning of reaction yield, rate, or enantioselectivity that could pave the way for the next era of sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
The advances made in the field of stimuli&#8208;responsive catalysis during the last five years with a focus on the novel recently&#8208;emerged directions and applications have been surveyed. Metal&#8208;free catalysts and organometallic complexes, as well as biomimetic systems and extended structures, which display switchable catalytic activity for a variety of organic transformations, are discussed. Light&#8208;activated systems comprised of photochromic molecules capable of modulating reaction rate, yield, or enantioselectivity based on geometric and electronic changes associated with photoisomerization are the focus of the detailed discussion. Alternative stimuli, including pH and temperature, which could be applied either alone or in combination with light, are also addressed. Recent advances clearly demonstrate that the capability to finely tune catalyst behavior via an external stimulus is a powerful tool that could alter the landscape of sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Highly Active Hydrogen&#8208;rich Photothermal Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction on Ni/LaInO3 Perovskite Catalysts with Near&#8208;unity Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni/LaInO3 was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal CO2 conversion with a high CO yield rate (1314&#8197;mmol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity, where LaInO3 was enriched extensive oxygen vacancies to roundly adsorbing CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway and the photoinduced charge transfer process to reduce the reaction active energy.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is regarded green and promising in controlling the reaction gas ratio in Fischer Tropsch synthesis. But it is inclined to produce more byproducts in high H2 concentration condition. Herein, LaInO3 loaded with Ni&#8208;nanoparticles (Ni NPs) was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal RWGS reaction rate, where LaInO3 was enriched with oxygen vacancies to roundly adsorbing CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni NPs endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. The optimized catalyst performed a large CO yield rate (1314&#8197;mmol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway of the reaction and photoinduced charge transfer process for reducing the RWGS reaction active energy. Our work provides valuable insights on the construction of catalysts concerning products selectivity and photoelectronic activating mechanism on CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Enables Polymer Hydrogels with pH&#8208;Induced Reversible Dynamic Responsive Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Driven by pH&#8208;induced alteration of hydrogen bonds, when placed in an acid solution, the transparent PAN hydrogel quickly becomes opaque and then gradually regains its transparency; while after being switched into DI water, the same dynamic response of fast transparency drop followed by spontaneous slow recovery is recreated.







Abstract
Poly(acrylic acid&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) (PAN) hydrogels containing multiple hydrogen bonds can exhibit pH&#8208;induced reversible dynamic responsive behaviors. When placing a transparent hydrogel in an acid bath, as hydrogen bonds between comonomer units involving protonated COOH groups are formed faster than water diffusion, a nonequilibrium light&#8208;scattering state is formed to turn the hydrogel opaque, while as the swelling equilibrium is reached over time, the hydrogel regains its transparency. Likewise, when the transparent, hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrogel is subsequently immersed in DI water, faster water absorption occurs in where more COOH groups are deprotonated, which also generates a light&#8208;scattering state leading to opacity, while the transparency is slowly recovered after equilibrium. Using such two&#8208;way dynamic transparency evolution, a PAN&#8208;based hydrogel material is prepared to demonstrate a dynamic memory system for information memorizing&#8208;forgetting and recalling&#8208;forgetting.

         <title>Phenazine&#8208;based Compound Realizing Separate Hydrogen and Oxygen Production in Electrolytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Phenazine&#8208;based electrode is used as a solid&#8208;state redox mediator to decouple the H2 and O2 production in acidic water electrolysis, realizing a membrane&#8208;free hydrogen production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable energy is a sustainable approach for hydrogen production. However, conventional water electrolysis may suffer from gas mixing, and the different kinetics between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) will limit the direct use of unstable renewable energies, leading to increased cost of H2 production. Herein, a novel phenazine&#8208;based compound is synthesized to develop the solid&#8208;state redox mediator associated water splititng process, and thus decoupling the H2 and O2 production in acid solution without the use of membrane. Excitingly, this organic redox mediator exhibits high specific capacity (290&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (186&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (3000&#8197;cycles) due to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic structure and the fast kinetics of H+ storage/release process. Furthermore, a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis architecture driven by solar energy is achieved, demonstrating high&#8208;purity H2 production at different times.

         <title>Self&#8208;Polarization Triggered Multiple Polar Units Toward Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to highly valuable ethanol has been considered a intriguring strategy for carbon neutruality. However, the slow kinetics of coupling carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) bonds, especially the low selectivity ethanol than ethylene in neutral conditions, is a significant challenge. Herein, the asymmetrical refinement structure with enhanced charge polarization is built in the vertically oriented bimetallic organic frameworks (NiCu&#8208;MOF) nanorod array with encapsulated Cu2O (Cu2O@MOF/CF), which can induce an intensive internal electric field to increase the C&#8208;C coupling for producing ethanol in neutral electrolyte. Particularly, when directly employed Cu2O@MOF/CF as the self&#8208;supporting electrode, the ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) could reach maximum 44.3% with an energy efficiency of 27% at a low working&#8208;potential of &#8208;0.615 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) using CO2&#8208;saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8208;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of H2CCHO*&#8208;to&#8208;*OCHCH3 for the generation of ethanol. Our research offers a reference for the design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to multicarbon chemicals.</dc:description>

Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C-C coupling and reduce the formation energy of H2CCHO*-to-*OCHCH3 for the generation of ethanol. Our research offers a reference for the design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to multicarbon chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>I3&#8722;/I&#8722; Redox Reaction&#8208;mediated Organic Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries with Accelerated Kinetics and Long Shelf Lives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The storage time of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) for practical implementation has been neglected long&#8208;lastingly. ZABs based on organic solvents promise long storage time but suffer from sluggish kinetics. Here, we report a longly storable ZAB with enhanced kinetics mediated by iodine&#8208;containing redox. In the charge process, the electrooxidation of Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#183;H2O is accelerated by I3&#8208; chemical oxidation. In the discharge process, I&#8208; adsorbed on the electrocatalyst changes the energy level of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Benefitting from these advantages, the prepared ZAB shows remarkably improved round&#8208;trip efficiency (56.03% vs. 30.97% without the mediator), and long&#8208;term cycling time (&gt;2600 h) in ambient air without replacing any components or applying any protective treatment to Zn anode and electrocatalyst. After resting for 30 days without any protection, it can still directly discharge continuously for 32.5 h and charge/discharge very stably for 2200 h (440 cycles), which is evidently superior to aqueous ZABs (only 0/0.25 h, and 50/25 h (10/5 cycles) by mild/alkaline electrolyte replenishment). This study provides a strategy to solve both storage and sluggish kinetics issues that have been plaguing ZABs for centuries, opening up a new avenue to the industrial application of ZABs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep learning is revolutionizing structural biology to an unprecedented extent. Spearheaded by DeepMind&#8217;s Alphafold2, structural models of often high quality can be generated, and are now available for most known proteins, as well as many protein interactions. The next challenge will be to leverage this rich structural corpus to learn about binding: which protein can contact which partners, and at what affinity? In a recent study, Chang and Perez have presented an elegant approach towards this challenging goal, for interactions that involve a short peptide binding to its receptor. The basic idea is straightforward: given a receptor that binds to two peptides, if the receptor sequence is presented with both peptides together at the same time, AlphaFold2 should model the tighter binding peptide into the binding site, while excluding the second. A simple idea that works!</dc:description>

         <title>Tinkering with Mechanochemical Tools for Scale Up</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry provides an environmentally benign platform to develop more sustainable chemical processes by limiting raw materials, energy use, and waste generation while using physically smaller equipment. A continuously growing research community has been steadily showcasing examples of beneficial mechanochemistry applications at both laboratory and preparative scales. Given the yet unstandardised nature of mechanochemical processes compared to solution&#8208;based chemistry, scaling up is still a nascent discipline. The purpose of this review is to highlight similarities, differences and challenges of the various approaches that have been successfully applied for a range of chemical applications at various scales. We hope to provide a discussion starting point for those interested in further developing mechanochemical processes for commercial use and/or industrialisation.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Lactam Electrophiles for Covalent Chemical Biology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic groups are one of the key pillars of contemporary chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. For instance, the group of 3&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds &#8211; such as aziridines, azirines, and oxaziridines &#8211; possess unique electronic and structural properties which underlie their potential and applicability as covalent tools. The &#945;&#8208;lactams are also members of this group of compounds, however, their utility within the field remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an &#945;&#8208;lactam reagent (AM2) that is tolerant to aqueous buffers while being reactive towards biologically relevant nucleophiles. Interestingly, carboxylesterases 1 and 2 (CES1/2), both serine hydrolases with key roles in endo&#8208; and xenobiotic metabolism, were found as primary covalent targets for AM2 in HepG2 liver cancer cells. All in all, our study constitutes the starting point for the further development and exploration of &#945;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based electrophilic probes in covalent chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Trialkoxysilane Exchange: Scope, Mechanism, Cryptates and pH&#8208;Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) of the Si&#8722;O&#160;bond holds unique opportunities, but has rarely been employed to&#160;assemble discrete molecular architectures. This may be due to&#160;the harsh conditions required to initiate exchange reactions at&#160;silicon in aprotic solvents. Herein, we provide a comprehensive&#160;experimental and computational account on the reaction of&#160;trialkoxysilanes with alcohols and identify mild conditions for rapid&#160;exchange in aprotic solvents. Substituent, solvent and salt effects&#160;are uncovered, understood and exploited for the construction of&#160;sila&#8208;orthoester cryptates. A sharp, divergent pH&#8208;response of the&#160;obtained cages renders this substance class attractive for future&#160;applications well beyond host&#8208;guest chemistry, for instance, in&#160;drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Time Scale on the Reaction Mechanism of CO Oxidation over a Au/TiO2 Catalystt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowledge of the reaction mechanism is key for rational catalyst improvement. Traditionally mechanistic studies focus on structure and the reaction conditions like temperature, pH, pressure, etc, whereas the time dimension is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate the influence of time on the mechanism of a catalytic reaction. A dual catalytic mechanism was identified for the CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy coupled with modulation excitation spectroscopy. During the first seconds CO on the gold particles is the only reactive species. As the reaction proceeds the redox properties of TiO2 dominate the catalytic activity through electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). CO induces the reduction and reconstruction of TiO2 whereas oxygen leads to its oxidation. The activity of the catalyst follows the spectroscopic signature of the EMSI. These findings demonstrate the power of studying the short&#8208;time kinetics for mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Cihunamides, Macrocyclic Antibacterial RiPPs with a Unique C&#8208;N Linkage Formed by CYP450 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cihunamides A&#8208;D (1&#8208;4), novel antibacterial RiPPs, were isolated from volcanic island&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. The structures of 1&#8208;4 were elucidated by 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR, MS, and chemical derivatizations; they contain a tetrapeptide core composed of WNIW, cyclized by a unique C&#8208;N linkage between two Trp units. Genome mining of the producer strain revealed two biosynthetic genes encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme and a precursor peptide. Heterologous co&#8208;expression of the core genes demonstrated the biosynthesis of cihunamides via a P450&#8208;mediated oxidative Trp&#8208;Trp crosslinking. Further bioinformatic analysis uncovered 252 homologous gene clusters, including that of tryptorubins, which possess a distinct Trp&#8208;Trp linkage. Cihunamides do not display non&#8208;canonical atropisomerism shown in tryptorubins, which are the founding members of the &#8220;atropitide&#8221; family. Therefore, we propose to use a new RiPP family name &#8220;bitryptides&#8221; for cihunamides, tryptorubins, and their congeners, wherein the Trp&#8208;Trp linkages define the structural class rather than non&#8208;canonical atropisomerism.</dc:description>

         <title>Organohydrogels with High&#8208;speed Lubrication via Confining Polymer Chain Mobility by Interpenetrated Heteronetwork</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels with pure hydrophilic network have received much attention due to their excellent low frictional behavior. However, the lubrication performance of hydrogels is not satisfied under high&#8208;speed condition due to the energy dissipation caused by adsorbed polymer chains as well as the failure of lubricating mechanisms accompanied by the transition of lubrication regime. In this work, interpenetrating double&#8208;network organohydrogels were constructed by combining hydrophilic and oleophilic polymer networks to modify the physiochemical properties of surface polymer chains, especially the chain mobility. The oleophilic polymer network spatially restricting the mobility of the swollen hydrophilic network in water, resulted in a low coefficient of friction (ca. 0.01) compared with conventional hydrogels at high speed (0.1m/s). Meanwhile, the organohydrogels had superior wear resistance, with almost no wear observed on the sliding track after 5k cycles of rubbing at high speed. The design concept of organohydrogels can be extended to a variety of low&#8208;wear, highly&#8208;lubricating materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation of Asymmetric Oxidation Catalysis with B20 Chiral Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous processes for enantiomeric processes based on inorganic crystals have been a topic of resurgent interest. However, it remains a challenge to answer the question of what the driving forces for the emergence of homochirality in nature and chemical reactions are. Here, we propose one possible driver of enantioselectivity, namely orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization. Enantioselective recognition of 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) was achieved by using B20 group PdGa crystals. Orbital textures of PdGa enantiomers suggest large OAM polarization for the bands near the Fermi level and carrying opposite signs. A positive or a negative magnetization in the [111] direction is expected depending on the handedness of PdGa crystal. This leads to the difference in adsorption energy between PdGa chiral crystals and DOPA molecules, depending on the pairing ability between the O 2p (DOPA) and Pd 4d orbital (PdGa). These results provide a new route to achieving enantioselectivity with pure inorganic crystals and may hold an answer to the origin of chirality in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore Size Modulation in Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling High Performance Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pore size plays a critical role in determining the performance of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in catalysis, sensing, and gas storage or separation. However, revealing the pore&#8208;size/property relationship remains extremely challenging because ideal structure models possessing different pore sizes but having the same components are lacking. In this work, a solvent&#8208;coordination directed structure swelling method was developed for modulating the ratio between the large and narrow pore phases of a flexible MOF, MIL&#8208;88B. Pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent gas sensitivity and selectivity were studied for the first time in the MIL&#8208;88B samples. The optimized MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;20% sample showed one of the best sensing performances among all the reported MOF&#8208;based H2S&#8208;sensing materials. This work not only provides a method to synthesize ideal structure models for revealing the relationship between pore&#8208;size and properties, but also may inspire the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sodium Carbazolide and Derivatives as Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Replacing widely used organic liquid electrolytes with solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) could effectively solve the safety issues in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Efforts on seeking novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes have been continued for decades. However, issues about SSEs still exist, such as low ionic conductivity at ambient temperature, difficulty in manufacturing, low electrochemical stability, poor compatibility with electrodes, etc. Here, sodium carbazolide (Na&#8208;CZ) and its THF&#8208;coordinated derivatives are rationally fabricated as Na+ conductors, and two of their crystal structures are successfully solved. Among these materials, THF&#8208;coordinated complexes exhibit fast Na+ conductivities, i.e., 1.20&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 and 1.95&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 at 90 &#176;C for Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;1THF and Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;2THF, respectively, which are among the top Na+ conductors under the same condition. Furthermore, stable Na plating/stripping is observed even over 400 h cycling, showing outstanding interfacial stability and compatibility against Na electrode. More advantages such as ease of synthesis, low&#8208;cost, and cold pressing for molding can be obtained. In situ NMR results revealed that the evaporation of THF may play an essential role in the Na+ migration, where the movement of THF creates defects/vacancies and facilitates the migration of Na+.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Dehydrogenative Coupling of Aldehydes with C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NHC&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular dehydrogenative coupling of aldehyde with ether, amine or benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is disclosed via metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free radical pathways.







Abstract
The development of catalyst&#8208;controlled methods for direct functionalization of two distinct C&#8722;H bonds represents an appealing approach for C&#8722;C formations in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe an organocatalytic approach for straightforward acylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds employing readily available aldehyde as &#8220;acyl source&#8221; involving dehydrogenative coupling of aldehydes with ether, amine, or benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. The developed method affords a broad range of ketones under mild conditions. Mechanistically, simple ortho&#8208;cyanoiodobenzene is essential in the oxidative radical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis to give a ketyl radical and C(sp3) radical through a rarely explored intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer pathway, rendering the acylative C&#8722;C formations in high efficiency under a metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free catalytic conditions. Moreover, the prepared products show promising anti&#8208;bacterial activities that shall encourage further investigations on novel agrochemical development.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Recycling of FeX2/FeX3 for Efficient Halogenation of C&#8722;H Bonds Using NaX</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeX2 coupled semiconductor system accelerates oxygen reduction and halogen radical generation, resulting in efficient, selective, and continuous photocatalytic halogenation using NaX as the halogen source under mild conditions.







Abstract
Environmental&#8208;friendly halogenation of C&#8722;H bonds using abundant, non&#8208;toxic halogen salts is in high demand in various chemical industries, yet the efficiency and selectivity of laboratory available protocols are far behind the conventional photolytic halogenation process which uses hazardous halogen sources. Here we report an FeX2 (X=Br, Cl) coupled semiconductor system for efficient, selective, and continuous photocatalytic halogenation using NaX as halogen source under mild conditions. Herein, FeX2 catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen and the consumption of generated oxygen radicals, thus boosting the generation of halogen radicals and elemental halogen for direct halogenation and indirect halogenation via the formation of FeX3. Recycling of FeX2 and FeX3 during the photocatalytic process enables the halogenation of a wide range of hydrocarbons in a continuous flow, rendering it a promising method for applications.

A Pd0 complex can mediate dehydrogenative formation of 2,4&#8208;diene systems from &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls in the presence of 2,6&#8208;DMBQ (2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone), which undergo vinylogous addition to imines via auto&#8208;tandem Pd0&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalysis. Both chemically inverse &#948;&#8208;regioselective aza&#8208;Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts and &#945;&#8208;regioselective normal ones are obtained switchably and stereoselectively by tuning catalytic conditions.







Abstract
&#963;&#8208;Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective aza&#8208;Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction of &#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated systems remains a challenge due to the intrinsic covalent activation mode. Here we demonstrate that a Pd0 complex can mediate the dehydrogenative reaction of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated compounds to give corresponding electron&#8208;poor dienes, which further undergo &#948;&#8208;regioselective umpolung Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type addition to imines via auto&#8208;tandem Pd0&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalysis. After &#946;&#8208;H elimination of in situ formed PdII&#8208;complexes, unprecedented and chemically inverse aza&#8208;MBH&#8208;type adducts are finally furnished with fair to outstanding enantioselectivity, and a diversity of functional groups and both ketimine and aldimine acceptors can be well tolerated. Moreover, switchable &#945;&#8208;regioselective normal aza&#8208;MBH&#8208;type reaction also can be realized by tuning catalytic conditions, whereas moderate to good enantioselectivity with low to excellent Z/E&#8208;selectivity is attained.

         <title>A Strong&#8208;Acid&#8208;Resistant [Th6] Cluster&#8208;Based Framework for Effectively and Size&#8208;Selectively Catalyzing Reductive Amination of Aldehydes with N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong&#8208;acid&#8208;resistant [Th6] cluster&#8208;based framework containing stacked nanocages was constructed and demonstrated excellent efficiency and stability in the reductive amination of various aldehydes with N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide as the amino source, reductant and solvent. In addition, this catalyst displayed a catalytic size&#8208;selectivity for aldehydes that has not been observed previously for this reaction.







Abstract
Utilization of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) as an amine source and reductant for synthesizing tertiary amines is a promising way to replace the substrates formaldehyde and dimethylamine, and it is desirable to seek porous acid&#8208;resistant catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis of this reaction. Herein, a robust metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) {[Th6O4(OH)4(H2O)6(BCP)3]&#8901;10&#8201;DMF}n (1) containing stacked nanocages with a diameter of 1.55&#8197;nm was constructed. Compound 1 can maintain its single&#8208;crystal structure even kept in air at 400&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h, and in DMF or water at 200&#8201;&#176;C for 7&#8197;days. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the high interaction energy between the [Th6O4(OH)4(H2O)6]12+ clusters and ligands was responsible for the excellent stability of 1. Catalytic investigations revealed that 1 can effectively and size&#8208;selectively catalyze the reductive amination of aldehydes with DMF, and it can be reused at least five times without obvious loss in catalytic activity.

         <title>Photoenzymatic Hydrosulfonylation for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoenzymatic strategy for radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydrosulfonylation has been developed. An engineered OYE1 enzyme enabled the generation of a series of &#946;&#8208;chiral sulfonyl compounds in high yields (up to 92&#8201;%) with excellent e.r. values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
Chiral sulfones are recurrent motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive molecules. Although chemical methods have been developed to afford &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208; chiral sulfones, these protocols rely heavily on the pre&#8208;synthesis of structurally complicated starting materials and chiral metal complexes. Herein, we described a photoenzymatic approach for the radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydrosulfonylation. Engineered variants of ene reductases provide efficient biocatalysts for this transformation, enabling to achieve a series of &#946;&#8208;chiral sulfonyl compounds with high yields (up to 92&#8201;%) and excellent e.r. values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization for Hydrogel Synthesis through Barriers and Development of Light&#8208;Regulated Healable Hydrogels under NIR Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This photo&#8208;RAFT process enables the preparation of hydrogels under low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light without deoxygenation. Exploiting enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through barriers. Notably, RAFT units, i.e., thiocarbonylthio groups, embedded in hydrogel networks facilitate the reactivation of polymer chains under NIR wavelengths, enabling the photoinduced healing of hydrogels through non&#8208;transparent barriers.







Abstract
We report an aqueous and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light mediated photoinduced reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system catalyzed by tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPcS4&#8722;) in the presence of peroxides. Taking advantage of its fast polymerization rates and high oxygen tolerance, this system is successfully applied for the preparation of hydrogels. Exploiting the enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through non&#8208;transparent biological barriers. Notably, the RAFT agents embedded in these hydrogel networks can be reactivated on&#8208;demand, enabling the hydrogel healing under NIR light irradiation. In contrast to the minimal healing capability (&lt;15&#8201;%) of hydrogels prepared by free radical polymerization (FRP), RAFT&#8208;mediated networks display more than 80&#8201;% recovery of tensile strength. Although healable polymer networks under UV and blue lights have already been established, this work is the first photochemistry system using NIR light, facilitating photoinduced healing of hydrogels through thick non&#8208;transparent barriers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report an aqueous and near-infrared (NIR) light mediated photoinduced reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (photo-RAFT) polymerization system catalyzed by tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPcS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in the presence of peroxides. Taking advantage of its fast polymerization rates and high oxygen tolerance, this system is successfully applied for the preparation of hydrogels. Exploiting the enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through non-transparent biological barriers. Notably, the RAFT agents embedded in these hydrogel networks can be reactivated on-demand, enabling the hydrogel healing under NIR light irradiation. In contrast to the minimal healing capability (&amp;lt;15&#8201;%) of hydrogels prepared by free radical polymerization (FRP), RAFT-mediated networks display more than 80&#8201;% recovery of tensile strength. Although healable polymer networks under UV and blue lights have already been established, this work is the first photochemistry system using NIR light, facilitating photoinduced healing of hydrogels through thick non-transparent barriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring *H Intermediate Coverage on the CuAl2O4/CuO Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a *H&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction from CO2RR. The findings reveal that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 in Cu&#8208;based catalyst could accelerate water dissociation and tailor *H intermediate coverage, which favors hydrogenation of the *HCCOH to ethanol. This study directs a feasible avenue for mediating *H intermediate coverage and tailoring *H&#8208;involved reduction reaction pathways on an efficient and durable Cu&#8208;based oxide catalyst.







Abstract
The direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products offers a promising pathway for producing value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity. However, producing ethanol remains a challenge because of the competitive ethylene formation and hydrogen evolution reactions. Herein, we propose an active hydrogen (*H)&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction on a layered precursor&#8208;derived CuAl2O4/CuO catalyst. The catalyst delivered a Faradaic efficiency of 70&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products and 41&#8201;% for ethanol at current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibited a continuous 150&#8197;h durability in a flow cell. The intensive spectroscopic studies combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 could tailor *H intermediate coverage and the elevated *H coverage favors the hydrogenation of the *HCCOH intermediate, accounting for the increased yield of ethanol. This work directs a pathway for enhancing ethanol electroproduction from CO2 reduction by tailoring *H intermediate coverage.

         <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization and Allylic Amination for Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Polynorbornenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a selenium catalyzed method for C&#8722;H activation and allylic amination of polynorbornene. Ultimately, our method achieves high and tunable degrees of functionalization, yielding materials with tunable thermal properties.







Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) via direct C&#8722;H functionalization is a powerful synthetic strategy to convert polymer feed&#8208;stocks into value&#8208;added products. We found that a metal&#8208;free, Se&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H amination provided an efficient method for PPM of polynorbornenes (PNBs) produced via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. Inherent to the mechanism of the allylic amination, PPM on PNBs preserved the alkene functional groups along the polymer backbone, while also avoiding transposition of the double bonds. Amination using a series of aryl sulfonamides led to good control over the degree of functionalization, access to a range of functionalities, and tunable thermal properties from the resulting polymers.

         <title>Glass Formation in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glassy state of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) has recently been identified, exhibiting diverse properties complementary to the crystalline state. This mini review presents an overview of the structural chemistry of both two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional HOIPs, and a comprehensive discussion on their glass formation processes. Current advances in melt&#8208;quenched glasses formed from HOIPs are discussed, and an outlook for the future of this new family of materials is offered.







Abstract
Crystalline materials have governed the development of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), giving rise to a variety of fascinating applications such as solar cells and optoelectronic devices. With increasing interest in non&#8208;crystalline systems, the glassy state of HOIPs has recently been identified. Here, the basic building blocks of crystalline HOIPs appear to be retained, though their glasses lack long&#8208;range periodic order. The emerging family of glasses formed from HOIPs exhibits diverse properties, complementary to their crystalline state. This mini review describes the chemical diversity of both three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional crystalline HOIPs and demonstrates how glasses are produced from these materials. Specifically, current achievements in melt&#8208;quenched glasses formed from HOIPs are highlighted. We conclude with our perspective on the future of this new family of materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Start CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a Reaction with Caged crRNA Enables Rapid and Sensitive Nucleic Acid Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay was developed by combining a light&#8208;start CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a reaction system and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for nucleic acid detection. With this platform, the clinical samples of Epstein&#8208;Barr virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) samples can be effectively detected.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is a promising platform for nucleic acid detection. Regulating the CRISPR reaction would be extremely useful to improve the detection efficiency and speed of CRISPR diagnostic applications. Here, we have developed a light&#8208;start CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a reaction by employing caged CRISPR RNA (crRNA). When combined with recombinase polymerase amplification, a robust photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay is achieved. The photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay is simpler and is 50&#8208;fold more sensitive than the conventional assay. This improved detection efficiency also facilitates the development of a faster CRISPR diagnostic method. The detection of clinical samples demonstrated that 10&#8211;20&#8197;min is sufficient for effective detection, which is much faster than the current gold&#8208;standard technique PCR. We expect this advance in CRISPR diagnostics to promote its widespread detection applications in biomedicine, agriculture, and food safety.

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation and Recycling of Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve a circular polymer economy, it is desirable to convert polymers into monomers or useful building blocks. This Minireview summarizes recent developments on polymer degradation and recycling enabled by mechanochemistry.







Abstract
The accumulation of plastic waste, due to lack of recycling, has led to serious environmental pollution. Although mechanical recycling can alleviate this issue, it inevitably reduces the molecular weight and weakens the mechanical properties of materials and is not suitable for mixed materials. Chemical recycling, on the other hand, breaks the polymer into monomers or small&#8208;molecule constituents, allowing for the preparation of materials of quality comparable to that of the virgin polymers and can be applied to mixed materials. Mechanochemical degradation and recycling leverages the advantages of mechanical techniques, such as scalability and efficient energy use, to achieve chemical recycling. We summarize recent progress in mechanochemical degradation and recycling of synthetic polymers, including both commercial polymers and those designed for more efficient mechanochemical degradation. We also point out the limitations of mechanochemical degradation and present our perspectives on how the challenges can be mitigated for a circular polymer economy.

         <title>Towards Automated Microfluidic&#8208;based Platforms: Optimizing Hydrogenation Efficiency of Nitrobenzene through &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions in Pd Nanoparticles on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Put&amp;Play Automated Microplatform(PPAM) was established herein to enhance the hydrogenation performance of palladium nanoparticles on the covalent organic frameworks (Pd/TP&#8208;COFs) as well as showing the unconventional superiority of coating over mixing in heterogeneous reactions.







Abstract
Microplatform with timed automata has been leveraged for guiding the preparation of molecules, whereas the requirement of handling expertise and sophisticated instrument is inevitable in combination with heterogeneous catalysis. Here we report a microfluidic&#8208;based autolab with open structures, called Put &amp; Play Automated Microplatform (PPAM). It shows the efficient hydrogenation performance of palladium nanoparticles on the triphenylene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (Pd/TP&#8208;COFs) in which the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions of TP rings in the vicinity of Pd is optimized by easy change&#8208;over of catalyst and simple tuning of reactor geometries in PPAM. Using experiment/simulation of the Pd/TP&#8208;COFs coating (PCC) and mixing (PCM) across PPAM with different channel sizes, the turnover frequencies are 60&#8197;times the commonly used batch reactor, and aniline productivity of 8.8&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 is achieved in 0.09&#8197;cm3. This work will raise awareness about the benefits of the catalyst&#8208;loaded microplatform in future materials performance campaigns.

         <title>Exclusive Co&#8208;N4 Sites Confined in Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Layers Enabling Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction at Industrial&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Together with the exclusive Co&#8208;N4 sites, enlarged surface area, improved electrical conductivity and CO2 adsorption capacity, Co porphyrin&#8208;based porous organic layers exhibit optimal activity for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO due to the strong *COOH binding and moderate *CO adsorption. Moreover, industrial&#8208;level current above 200&#8197;mA can be achieved in a membrane electrode assembly device with near&#8208;unity CO selectivity over 20&#8197;h.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework catalysts bring new opportunities for CO2 electrocatalysis. Herein, we first conduct density&#8208;functional theory calculations and predict that Co&#8208;based porphyrin porous organic layers (Co&#8208;PPOLs) exhibit good activity for CO2 conversion because of the low *CO adsorption energy at Co&#8208;N4 sites, which facilitates *CO desorption and CO formation. Then, we prepare two&#8208;dimensional Co&#8208;PPOLs with exclusive Co&#8208;N4 sites through a facile surfactant&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up method. The ultrathin feature ensures the exposure of catalytic centers. Together with large specific area, high electrical conductivity and CO2 adsorption capability, Co&#8208;PPOLs achieve a peak faradaic efficiency for CO production (FECO=94.2&#8201;%) at a moderate potential in CO2 electroreduction, accompanied with good stability. Moreover, Co&#8208;PPOLs reach an industrial&#8208;level current above 200&#8197;mA in a membrane electrode assembly reactor, and maintain near&#8208;unity CO selectivity (FECO&gt;90&#8201;%) over 20&#8197;h in CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Chiral Control of Gas&#8208;Phase Molecules using Microwave Pulses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in the area of chiral control using rotational spectroscopy are highlighted. Microwave three&#8208;wave mixing is a phase&#8208;sensitive technique for enantiodifferentiation, it is discussed here together with its extension to create coherent enantiomer&#8208;selective population enrichment. This scheme results in enantioselective enrichment in a chosen rotational state that holds interesting promises for advanced chirality experiments.







Abstract
Microwave three&#8208;wave mixing has emerged as a novel approach for studying chiral molecules in the gas phase. This technique employs resonant microwave pulses and is a non&#8208;linear and coherent approach. It serves as a robust method to differentiate between the enantiomers of chiral molecules and to determine the enantiomeric excess, even in complex chiral mixtures. Besides such analytical applications, the use of tailored microwave pulses allows us to control and manipulate chirality at the molecular level. Here, an overview of some recent developments in the area of microwave three&#8208;wave mixing and its extension to enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer is provided. The latter is an important step towards enantiomer separation&#8212;in energy and finally in space. In the last section, we present new experimental results on how to improve enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer to achieve an enantiomeric excess of about 40&#8201;% in the rotational level of interest using microwave pulses alone.

         <title>Inherently Emissive Puromycin Analogues for Live Cell Labelling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherently emissive puromycin analogues can fluorescently tag newly synthesized proteins in live&#8208;cells without the need for further chemical treatments.







Abstract
Puromycin derivatives containing an emissive thieno[3,4&#8208;d]&#8208;pyrimidine core, modified with azetidine and 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine as Me2N surrogates, exhibit translation inhibition and bactericidal activity similar to the natural antibiotic. The analogues are capable of cellular puromycylation of nascent peptides, generating emissive products without any follow&#8208;up chemistry. The 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine&#8208;containing analogue is shown to fluorescently label newly translated peptides and be visualized in both live and fixed HEK293T cells and rat hippocampal neurons.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Permeable Dual&#8208;Mechanism&#8208;Driven Graphene Oxide Framework Membranes for Precision Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;posterior&#8221; interfacial polymerization (p&#8208;IP) strategy is developed to fabricate a high&#8208;surface positively charged graphene oxide (GO) framework membrane for ion sieving. The generated electrostatic repulsion of ions from the positively charged surface, in conjunction with reinforced size exclusion from the p&#8208;IP&#8208;formed polyamide network, endows the membrane with outstanding performance for ion separation.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional graphene oxide (GO) membranes are gaining popularity as a promising means to address global water scarcity. However, current GO membranes fail to sufficiently exclude angstrom&#8208;sized ions from solution. Herein, a de novo &#8220;posterior&#8221; interfacial polymerization (p&#8208;IP) strategy is reported to construct a tailor&#8208;made polyamide (PA) network in situ in an ultrathin GO membrane to strengthen size exclusion while imparting a positively charged membrane surface to repel metal ions. The electrostatic repulsion toward metal ions, coupled with the reinforced size exclusion, synergistically drives the high&#8208;efficiency metal ion separation through the synthesized positively charged GO framework (PC&#8208;GOF) membrane. This dual&#8208;mechanism&#8208;driven PC&#8208;GOF membrane exhibits superior metal ion rejection, anti&#8208;fouling ability, good operational stability, and ultra&#8208;high permeance (five times that of pristine GO membranes), enabling a sound step towards a sustainable water&#8208;energy&#8208;food nexus.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Pairing&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement from Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diads Decorated with Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane as an Electrochemical Protector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elaborate metal&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems require highly robust organic emitters in the radical form. In their Research Article (e202301109), Keishiro Tahara, Masaaki Abe, and co&#8208;workers used a classical Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 as an electrochemical protector of donor&#8211;acceptor emitters, leading to the discovery of Lewis pairing&#8208;induced ECL enhancement.

&lt;p&gt;Elaborate metal-free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems require highly robust organic emitters in the radical form. In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202301109"&gt;e202301109&lt;/a&gt;), Keishiro Tahara, Masaaki Abe, and co-workers used a classical Lewis acid B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as an electrochemical protector of donor&#8211;acceptor emitters, leading to the discovery of Lewis pairing-induced ECL enhancement. The Lewis acid also converted the molecular arrangements of the emitters, playing a unique role in crystalline film ECL.

         <title>Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of Enantiopure Bicyclic Ether&#8208;ester Monomers toward Closed&#8208;loop Recyclable and Crystalline Stereoregular Polyesters via Chemical Upcycling of Bioplastic</title>

         <dc:description>
Upcycling of P3HB into enantiopure bicyclic ether&#8208;ester monomers, and their ROP to produce crystalline stereoregular polyesters and their reversed depolymerization.







Abstract
Although great successes have been achieved, the preparation of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyesters with high working temperatures still remains as a big challenge. Herein, we present the syntheses of a series of enantiopure bicyclic ether&#8208;ester monomers by upcycling of poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) bioplastic. The &#8220;living&#8221;/controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of these enantiopure monomers to produce stereoregular polyesters with controlled molecular weights and well&#8208;defined chain ends were achieved. The effects of stereoconfiguration and substituent on polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics as well as the thermal properties of resultant polyesters were investigated. Of note, the stereoregular polyesters are semi&#8208;crystalline materials with melting temperatures up to 176&#8201;&#176;C, even higher than the commodity polyolefin plastics. These polyesters can be depolymerized back to recover pristine monomers, thus successfully establishing a closed&#8208;loop life cycle.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Artificial Receptors as Transmembrane Signal Transduction Systems for Protocellular Communication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based dimers are designed as artificial membrane receptors for transmembrane signal transduction and amplification without physical mass exchange, which facilitates the establishment of a signalling network in protocell colonies.







Abstract
The ability to reproduce signal transduction and cellular communication in artificial cell systems is significant in synthetic protobiology. Here, we describe an artificial transmembrane signal transduction through low pH&#8208;mediated formation of the i&#8208;motif and dimerization of DNA&#8208;based artificial membrane receptors, which is coupled to the occurrence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer and the activation of G&#8208;quadruplex/hemin&#8208;mediated fluorescence amplification inside giant unilamellar vesicles. Moreover, an intercellular signal communication model is established when the extravesicular H+ input is replaced by coacervate microdroplets, which activate the dimerization of the artificial receptors, and subsequent fluorescence production or polymerization in giant unilamellar vesicles. This study represents a crucial step towards designing artificial signalling systems with environmental response, and provides an opportunity to establish signalling networks in protocell colonies.

         <title>Automated Solid&#8208;Phase Oligo(disulfide) Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the automated synthesis of sequence&#8208;specific oligo(disulfides) on a solid support was developed. Six different dithiol monomer building blocks were prepared and applied in the synthesis of disulfide oligomers by extension of a T15 DNA strand. The disulfides were degraded in the presence of millmolar levels of glutathione, and a mechanism for cargo release upon reduction was also developed.







Abstract
A method for automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis of oligo(disulfide)s was developed. It is based on a synthetic cycle comprising removal of a protecting group from a resin&#8208;bound thiol followed by treatment with monomers containing a thiosulfonate as an activated precursor. For ease of purification and characterization, the disulfide oligomers were synthesized as extensions of oligonucleotides on an automated oligonucleotide synthesizer. Six different dithiol monomer building blocks were synthesized. Sequence&#8208;defined oligomers of up to seven disulfide units were synthesized and purified. The sequence of the oligomer was confirmed by tandem MS/MS analysis. One of the monomers contains a coumarin cargo that can be released by a thiol&#8208;mediated release mechanism. When the monomer was incorporated into an oligo(disulfide) and subjected to reducing conditions, the cargo was released under near&#8208;physiological conditions, which underlines the potential use of these molecules in drug delivery systems.

         <title>Discovery of the Lanthipeptide Curvocidin&#8197;and Structural Insights into its Trifunctional Synthetase CuvL</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Class&#8208;IV lanthipeptide synthetase CuvL forms a central reaction chamber by arranging its three catalytic domains in circular manner. The precursor peptide of curvocidin uses its N&#8208;terminal leader region to wrap around the kinase N&#8208;lobe of CuvL, while its C&#8208;terminal substrate region can shuttle within the chamber for iterative phosphorylation, &#946;&#8208;elimination and thioether&#8208;ring installment.







Abstract
Lanthipeptides are ribosomally&#8208;synthesized natural products from bacteria featuring stable thioether&#8208;crosslinks and various bioactivities. Herein, we report on a new clade of tricyclic class&#8208;IV lanthipeptides with curvocidin from Thermomonospora curvata as its first representative. We obtained crystal structures of the corresponding lanthipeptide synthetase CuvL that showed a circular arrangement of its kinase, lyase and cyclase domains, forming a central reaction chamber for the iterative substrate processing involving nine catalytic steps. The combination of experimental data and artificial intelligence&#8208;based structural models identified the N&#8208;terminal subdomain of the kinase domain as the primary site of substrate recruitment. The ribosomal precursor peptide of curvocidin employs an amphipathic &#945;&#8208;helix in its leader region as an anchor to CuvL, while its substrate core shuttles within the central reaction chamber. Our study thus reveals general principles of domain organization and substrate recruitment of class&#8208;IV and class&#8208;III lanthipeptide synthetases.

     alt="Discovery of the Lanthipeptide Curvocidin&#8197;and Structural Insights into its Trifunctional Synthetase CuvL"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class-IV lanthipeptide synthetase CuvL forms a central reaction chamber by arranging its three catalytic domains in circular manner. The precursor peptide of curvocidin uses its N-terminal leader region to wrap around the kinase N-lobe of CuvL, while its C-terminal substrate region can shuttle within the chamber for iterative phosphorylation, &#946;-elimination and thioether-ring installment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanthipeptides are ribosomally-synthesized natural products from bacteria featuring stable thioether-crosslinks and various bioactivities. Herein, we report on a new clade of tricyclic class-IV lanthipeptides with curvocidin from &lt;i&gt;Thermomonospora curvata&lt;/i&gt; as its first representative. We obtained crystal structures of the corresponding lanthipeptide synthetase CuvL that showed a circular arrangement of its kinase, lyase and cyclase domains, forming a central reaction chamber for the iterative substrate processing involving nine catalytic steps. The combination of experimental data and artificial intelligence-based structural models identified the N-terminal subdomain of the kinase domain as the primary site of substrate recruitment. The ribosomal precursor peptide of curvocidin employs an amphipathic &#945;-helix in its leader region as an anchor to CuvL, while its substrate core shuttles within the central reaction chamber. Our study thus reveals general principles of domain organization and substrate recruitment of class-IV and class-III lanthipeptide synthetases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Pauson&#8211;Khand Reactions of 1,6&#8208;Chloroenynes with 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Olefins</title>

         <dc:description>
An enantioselective RhI&#8208;catalyzed Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction (PKR) using 1,6&#8208;chloroenynes with challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins is described. DFT calculations reveal that the halide pre&#8208;polarizes the alkyne to lower the barrier for the metallacycle formation and provides the proper steric profile to permit a favorable enantiodetermining interaction between the 1,6&#8208;chloroenyne and the chiral diphosphine ligand in the rhodium complex.







Abstract
An enantioselective rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction (PKR) using 1,6&#8208;chloroenynes that contain challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins is described. In contrast to the previous studies with these types of substrates, which are only suitable for a single type of tether and alkyne substituent, the new approach results in a more expansive substrate scope, including carbon and heteroatom tethers with polar and non&#8208;polar substituents on the alkene. DFT calculations provide critical insight into the role of the halide, which pre&#8208;polarizes the alkyne to lower the barrier for metallacycle formation and provides the proper steric profile to promote a favorable enantiodetermining interaction between substrate and chiral diphosphine ligand. Hence, the chloroalkyne enables the efficient and enantioselective PKR with 1,6&#8208;enynes that contain challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins, thereby representing a new paradigm for enantioselective reactions involving 1,6&#8208;enynes.

         <title>Manipulating Coulombic Efficiency of Cathodes in Aqueous Zinc Batteries by Anion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically investigated how anions manipulate the coulombic efficiency of cathodes of zinc batteries for conversion and intercalation chemistry. It was found that the electronic properties of anions, including charge density and its distribution, can tune reactions of the conversion&#8208;type cathode (e.g. iodine, I2) and the intercalation&#8208;type cathode (e.g. vanadium pentoxide, V2O5), leading to significant coulombic efficiency differences.







Abstract
Electrolyte environments, including cations, anions, and solvents are critical for the performance delivery of cathodes of batteries. Most works focused on interactions between cations and cathode materials, in contrast, there is a lack of in&#8208;depth research on the correlation between anions and cathodes. Here, we systematically investigated how anions manipulate the coulombic efficiency (CE) of cathodes of zinc batteries. We take intercalation&#8208;type V2O5 and conversion&#8208;type I2 cathodes as typical cases for profound studies. It was found that electronic properties of anions, including charge density and its distribution, can tune conversion or intercalation reactions, leading to significant CE differences. Using operando visual Raman microscopy and theoretical simulations, we confirm that competitive coordination between anions and I&#8722; can regulate CEs by modulating polyiodide diffusion rates in Zn&#8722;I2 cells. In Zn&#8722;V2O5 cells, anion&#8208;tuned solvation structures vastly affect CEs through varying Zn2+ intercalation kinetics. Conversion I2 cathode achieves a 99&#8201;% CE with highly electron&#8208;donating anions, while anions with preferable charge structures that interact strongly with Zn2+ afford an intercalation V2O5 a nearly 100&#8201;% CE. Understanding the mechanism of anion&#8208;governed CEs will help us evaluate compatibility of electrolytes with electrodes, thus providing a guideline for anion selection and electrolyte design for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;cycling zinc batteries.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Targeted Glycan Editing on Living Cells Disrupts KRAS Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The frequent mutation of KRAS oncogene in some of the most lethal human cancers has spurred incredible efforts to develop KRAS inhibitors, yet only one covalent inhibitor for the KRASG12C mutant has been approved to date. New venues to interfere with KRAS signaling are desperately needed. Here, we report a &#8220;localized oxidation&#8208;coupling&#8221; strategy to achieve protein&#8208;specific glycan editing on living cells for disrupting KRAS signaling. This glycan remodeling method exhibits excellent protein and sugar specificity and is applicable to different donor sugars and cell types. Attachment of mannotriose to the terminal galactose/N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine epitopes of integrin &#945;v&#946;3, a membrane receptor upstream of KRAS, blocks its binding to galectin&#8208;3, suppresses the activation of KRAS and downstream effectors, and mitigates KRAS&#8208;driven malignant phenotypes. Our work represents the first successful attempt to interfere with KRAS activity by manipulating membrane receptor glycosylation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ambient ammonia synthesis coupled with distributed green hydrogen production technology can provide promising solutions for low&#8208;carbon NH3 production and H2 storage. Herein, we reported Ru&#8208;loaded defective pyrochlore K2Ta2O6&#8208;x with remarkable visible&#8208;light absorption and a very low work function, enabling effective visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2 at low pressure down to 0.2 atm. The photocatalytic rate was 2.8 times higher than that of the best previously reported photocatalyst and the photo&#8208;thermal rate at 425K was similar to that of Ru&#8208;loaded black TiO2 at 633K. Compared to perovskite&#8208;type KTaO3&#8208;x with the same composition, the pyrochlore exhibited a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in intrinsic activity due to a higher photoexcited charge separation efficiency and a higher conduction band position. The interfacial Schottky barrier and spontaneous electron transfer between K2Ta2O6&#8208;x and Ru further improve photoexcited charge separation and accumulate energetic electrons to facilitate N2 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photosynthetic Fixation of CO2 in Alkenes by Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalysis with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven fixation of CO2 in organics has emerged as an appealing alternative for the synthesis of value&#8208;added fine chemicals. Challenges remain in the transformation of CO2 as well as product selectivity due to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Here we develop a boron carbonitride (BCN) with the abundant terminal B/N defects around the mesoporous walls, which essentially enhances surface active sites as well as charge transfer kinetics, boosting the overall rate of CO2 adsorption and activation. In this protocol, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrocarboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to an extended carbon chain is achieved with good functional group tolerance and specific regioselectivity under visible light irradiation. The mechanistic studies demonstrate the formation of CO2 radical anion intermediate on defective boron carbonitride, leading to the anti&#8208;Markovnikov carboxylation. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural products and synthesis of anti&#8208;diabetic GPR40 agonists reveal the utility of this method. This study sheds new insight on the design and application of metal&#8208;free semiconductors for the conversion of CO2 in an atom&#8208;economic and sustainable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Ambient Manufacturability&#8208;Performance Bottleneck in Perovskite Nanocrystal Emitters for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have risen rapidly in luminescence efficiency and color purity. However, their high performance requires careful and complex pre&#8208;treatment of precursors and precise regulation of the reaction atmosphere; otherwise, their emission will be weak and broad. To overcome these limitations, we develop a facile ligand exchange method using a new type of bidentate ligand, which is obtained by reacting cheap sulfur with tributylphosphine (S&#8208;TBP). During ligand exchange, the double bond between P and S atoms breaks and a single bond is formed between them, after which S&#8208;TBP switches into a bidentate ligand and binds to a perovskite NC at two points. With short&#8208;chain S&#8208;TBP ligands that have high spatial position resistance, both NC spacing and surface ligand density can be reduced, thereby improving carrier injection and transport. On the NC surface after ligand exchange, halogen vacancies were substantially filled, leading to a PbSP (Pb, S, and P elements) component&#8208;dominated shell that greatly decreases trap density and enhances material stability. The resulting perovskite NCs are stable and bright with a photoluminescence quantum yield of ~96%, and an external quantum&#160;efficiency of 22%. Note that our ligand&#8208;exchange strategy remains effective even when scaling up, which should accelerate commercialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne Hydrocyanation toward Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereodivergent Synthesis of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;Trisubstituted Acrylonitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of propiolamides for the stereodivergent synthesis of trisubstituted acrylonitriles. This synthetic method tolerated various primary, secondary and tertiary propiolamides. The cautious selection of a suitable ligand is essential to the success of this stereodivergent process. Control experiments indicate the intermediacy of E&#8208;acrylonitriles, which lead to Z&#8208;acrylonitriles via isomerization. The density functional theory calculations suggests that the bidentate ligand L2 enables a feasible cyclometallation/isomerization pathway for the E to Z isomerization, while the monodentate ligand L1 inhibits the isomerization, leading to divergent stereoselectivity. The usefulness of this method can be demonstrated by the readily derivatization of products to give various E&#8208; and Z&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. In addition, the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;acrylonitrile products have also been successfully employed in cycloaddition reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Quencher&#8208;Based Blood Autofluorescence&#8208;Suppression&#160;Strategy Enables the Quantification of Trace Analyte in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise quantification of trace components in whole blood via fluorescence is of great significance. However, the applicability of current fluorescent probes in whole blood is largely hindered by the strong blood autofluorescence. Here, we proposed a blood autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy to develop an activable fluorescent probe for quantification of trace analyte in whole blood.&#160;Based on inner filter effect, by screening fluorophores whose absorption overlapped with the emission of blood, a redshift BODIPY&#160;quencher with an absorption wavelength ranging from 600&#8208;700 nm was selected for its superior quenching efficiency&#160;and high brightness. Two 7&#8208;nitrobenzo[c] [1,2,5] oxadiazole ether groups were introduced onto the BODIPY skeleton for quenching its fluorescence and the response of H2S, a gas signal molecule that can hardly be quantified because of its low concentration in whole blood. Such detection system shows a pretty low background signal and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;back ratio, the probe thus achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H2S in 20&#8208;fold dilution of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H2S in whole blood. Moreover, this autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy could be expanded to other trace analytes detection in whole blood, which may accelerate the application of fluorescent probes in clinical blood test</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Salts Containing Cationic Al24&#8208;Hydroxide&#8208;Acetate Clusters from Scalable, Green and Aqueous Synthesis Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solution chemistry of aluminum is highly complex and various polyoxocations are known. Here we report on the facile synthesis of a cationic Al24 cluster that forms porous salts of composition [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]X4, denoted CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X, with X = Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, I&#8208;, HSO4&#8208;. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction was employed to determine the crystal structures. Various robust and mild synthesis routes for the chloride salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]Cl4 in water were established resulting in high yields (&gt; 95%, 215 g per batch) within minutes. Specific surface areas and H2O capacities with maximum values of up to 930 m2/g and 430 mg/g are observed. The particle size of CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X can be tuned between 140 nm and 1250 nm, permitting its synthesis as stable dispersions or as highly crystalline powders. The positive surface charge of the particles, allow fast and effective adsorption of anionic dye molecules and adsorption of poly&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Charge&#8208;Transfer Processes in a Covalently Linked [Ge9]&#8208;Cluster Imine Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C60 donor dyads in which the carbon cage is covalently linked to an electron&#8208;donating unit have been discussed as one possibility for an electron&#8208;transfer system, and it has been shown that spherical [Ge9] cluster anions show a close relation to fullerenes with respect to their electronic structure. However, the optical properties of these clusters and of functionalized cluster derivatives are almost unknown. We now report on the synthesis of the intensely red [Ge9] cluster linked to an extended &#960;&#8208;electron system. [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp]&#8211;&#160; (1&#8211;)is formed upon the reaction of [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2]2&#8211; with bromo&#8208;diazaborole DAB(II)Dipp&#8208;Br in CH3CN (TMS = trimethylsilyl; DAB(II) = 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborole with an unsaturated backbone; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl). Reversible protonation of the imine entity in 1&#8211; yields the deep green, zwitterionic cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N(H)}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp] (1&#8208;H) and vice versa. Optical spectroscopy combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory suggests a charge&#8208;transfer excitation between the cluster and the antibonding &#960;* orbital of the imine moiety as the cause of the intense coloration. An absorption maximum of 1&#8208;H in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the corresponding lowest&#8208;energy excited state at &#955;&#160;=&#160;669&#160;nm make the compound an interesting starting point for further investigations targeting the design of photo&#8208;active cluster compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Green, General and Low&#8208;cost Synthesis of Porous Organic Polymers in Sub&#8208;kilogram Scale for Catalysis and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers (POPs) with high porosity and tunable functionalities have been widely studied for use in gas separation, catalysis, energy conversion and energy storage. However, the high cost of organic monomers, and the use of toxic solvents and high temperatures during synthesis pose obstacles for large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we report the synthesis of imine and aminal&#8208;linked POPs using inexpensive diamine and dialdehyde monomer in green solvents. Theoretical calculations and control experiments show that using meta&#8208;diamines is crucial for forming aminal linkages and branching porous networks from [2 + 2] polycondensation reactions. The method demonstrates good generality in that 6 POPs were successfully synthesized from different monomers. Additionally, we scaled up the synthesis in ethanol at room temperature, resulting in the production of POPs in sub&#8208;kilogram quantities at a relatively low cost. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies demonstrate that the POPs can be used as high&#8208;performance sorbents for CO2 separation and as porous substrates for efficient heterogeneous catalysis. This method provides an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective approach for large&#8208;scale synthesis of various POPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Photoprocessable Materials via Photopolymerization Using an Acid&#8208;Induced Photocleavable Platinum&#8208;Acetylide Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photopolymerization and photoprocessing are core technologies for molding and tuning polymer materials. However, they are incompatible with single materials owing to their contradictory photoreactivity. Herein, an acid&#8208;induced photocleavable crosslinker, a platinum&#8211;acetylide complex covered by permethylated cyclodextrins, enables the fabrication of photoprocessable materials via photopolymerization with N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)acrylamide. The polymer networks are molded by 365 nm irradiation as well as softened and degraded by a cooperative reaction with HCl as an acidic additive under 365 nm UV light, or 470 nm visible light in the presence of a photosensitizer. Moreover, the crosslinker is applied to a photoadhesive triggered by 365 nm irradiation. The adhesion is detachable on&#8208;demand through acid&#8208;induced photodegradation with the same wavelength and intensity of irradiation. Thus, acid&#8208;induced photocleavage allows the integration of light&#8208;induced molding and processing under various lights of various wavelengths, opening up new strategies for polymer technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Recycling of Depolymerization Catalyst and Biodegradable Polyester that Markedly Outperforms Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically recyclable, circular polymers continue to attract increasing attention, but rendering both catalysts for depolymerization and high&#8208;performance polymers recyclable is a more sustainable yet challenging goal. Here we introduce a dual catalyst/polymer recycling system in that recyclable inorganic phosphomolybdic acid catalyzes selective depolymerization of high&#8208;ceiling&#8208;temperature biodegradable poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone), which, upon reaching suitable molecular weight, exhibits outstanding mechanical performance with a high tensile strength of ~66.6 MPa, fracture strain of ~904%, and toughness of ~308 MJ m&#8208;3, and thus markedly outperforms commodity polyolefins, recovering its monomer in pure state and quantitative yield at only 100 &#176;C. In sharp contrast, the uncatalyzed depolymerization not only requires a high temperature of &gt;310 &#176;C but is also low yielding and non&#8208;selective. Importantly, the recovered monomer can be repolymerized as is to reproduce the same polymer, thereby closing the circular loop, and the recycled catalyst can be reused repeatedly for depolymerization runs without loss of its catalytic activity and efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstruction of Solid Electrolyte Interphase with SrI2 Reactivates Dead Li for Durable Anode&#8208;Free Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dead Li in anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal battery is suppressed effectively through synergistic mechanisms. With SrI2 incorporation, reversible I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox reaction reactivates dead Li; electronic insulation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) surface with SrF2 and LiF prevents electrolyte decomposition; the inner layer of SEI with abundant LiI demonstrates high ionic conduction (3.488&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and enables efficient Li+ transfer and Li deposition inside the SEI.







Abstract
Without excess Li, anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal batteries (AFLMBs) have been proposed as the most likely solution to realizing highly&#8208;safe and cost&#8208;effective Li&#8208;metal batteries. Nevertheless, short cyclic life puzzles conventional AFLMBs due to anodic dead Li accumulation with a local current concentration induced by irreversible electrolyte depletion, insufficient active Li reservoir and slow Li+ transfer at the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, SrI2 is introduced into carbon paper (CP) current collector to effectively suppress dead Li through synergistic mechanisms including reversible I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox reaction to reactivate dead Li, dielectric SEI surface with SrF2 and LiF to prevent electrolyte decomposition and highly ionic conductive (3.488&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) inner layer of SEI with abundant LiI to enable efficient Li+ transfer inside. With the SrI2&#8208;modified current collector, the NCM532/CP cell delivers unprecedented cyclic performances with a capacity of 129.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Diazabicyclic Electroactive Ionenes for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazabicyclic electroactive ionenes with high density of interfacial dipoles are developed as interlayers in organic solar cells. Devices containing the optimal electroactive ionene interlayer give efficiency up to 18.43&#8201;% and excellent operational stability with exceptional interlayer thickness tolerance over 100&#8197;nm, correlating well with its superior optoelectronic and morphological characters, representing the best record reported so far.







Abstract
Electroactive ionenes combining caged&#8208;shaped diazabicyclic cations and aromatic diimides were developed as interlayers in organic solar cells (OSCs). These ionenes reduce the work&#8208;function of air&#8208;stable metal electrodes (e.g., Ag, Cu and Au) by generating strong interfacial dipoles, and their optoelectronic and morphological characters can be modulated by aromatic diimides, leading to high conductivity and good compatibility with active layers. The optimal ionene exhibits superior charge&#8208;transport, desirable crystallinity, and weak visible&#8208;absorption, boosting the efficiency of benchmark PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based OSCs up to 17.44&#8201;%. The corresponding normal devices show excellent stability at maximum power point test under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h. Replacing Y6 with L8&#8208;BO promotes the efficiency to 18.43&#8201;%, one of the highest in binary OSCs. Notably, high efficiencies &gt;16&#8201;% are maintained as the interlayer thickness increasing to 105&#8197;nm, the best result with interlayer&#8208;thickness over 100&#8197;nm.

Abstract
A novel, selective and high&#8208;yielding palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative arylation of a variety of weakly acidic (pKa 25&#8211;35 in DMSO) benzylic and heterobenzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with aryl bromides has been achieved. This system is applicable to a range of pro&#8208;nucleophiles for access to sterically and electronically diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl or &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones, which are ubiquitous substructures in biologically active compounds. The Josiphos SL&#8208;J001&#8208;1&#8208;based palladium catalyst was identified as the most efficient and selective, enabling carbonylative arylation with aryl bromides under 1&#8197;atm CO to provide the ketone products without the formation of direct coupling byproducts. Additionally, (Josiphos)Pd(CO)2 was identified as the catalyst resting state. A kinetic study suggests that the oxidative addition of aryl bromides is the turnover&#8208;limiting step. Key catalytic intermediates were also isolated.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled L&#8211;DNA Linkers for Rapid Construction of Multi&#8208;Specific Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates Library</title>

A modular platform for rapid construction of multi&#8208;specific Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates (ADCs). The MADC platform offers the combinatorial flexibility to screen for optimal target and payload combinations, while having the potential of becoming viable therapeutic agents themselves.







Abstract
One of the key challenges of improving clinical outcomes of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is overcoming cancer resistance to the antibody and/or drug components of ADCs, and hence the need for ADC platforms with high combinatory flexibility. Here, we introduce the use of self&#8208;assembled left&#8208;handed DNA (L&#8211;DNA) oligonucleotides to link combinatory single&#8208;domain antibodies and toxin payloads for tunable and adaptive delivery of ADCs. We demonstrate that the method allows convenient construction of a library of ADCs with multi&#8208;specific targeting, multi&#8208;specific payloads, and exact drug&#8208;antibody ratio. The newly constructed ADCs with L&#8211;DNA scaffold showed favorable properties of in vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo suppression and eradication of solid tumors. Collectively, our data suggest that the L&#8211;DNA based modular ADC (MADC) platform is a viable option for generating therapeutic ADCs and for potentially expanding ADC therapeutic window via multi&#8208;specificity.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Autonomous Sol&#8594;Gel&#8594;Sol&#8594;Gel&#8594;Sol Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reentrant phase transitions (sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol) are known to exist in natural and artificial chemical systems. In the past decade, chemical fuels have been used to tune reentrant phase transitions. Here a chemically fueled double reentrant phase transition is presented, where two distinct hydrogels (i.e. from aldehyde&#8208; and imine&#8208;based gelators) form transiently and in sequential order. This results in an autonomous sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol transition.







Abstract
Complex non&#8208;equilibrium phase behaviors are a hallmark of natural self&#8208;assembling systems. Here we show how intricate phase transitions can be achieved through a chemically fueled reaction cycle to yield autonomous sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol transitions. A relay of chemical transformations based on thiazinane metathesis leads to two consecutive transient gelations in a closed system. Within seconds of fuel addition to deactivated thiazinane monomers, an imine&#8208;based hydrogel forms that consists of fibrillar microspheres. This gel quickly loses its mechanical strength and forms a solution, from which a second aldehyde&#8208;based gel nucleates and remains stable for over one day. Overall, our reaction cycle gives rise to two consecutive re&#8208;entrant phase transitions without any experimental intervention.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Arylation of Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N versus C&#8722;O cross&#8208;couplings involving model compounds enabled development of chemoselective, metal&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208; and N&#8208;arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry.







Abstract
A systematic evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N versus C&#8722;O cross&#8208;couplings involving model compounds enabled development of hitherto unknown chemoselective O&#8208; and N&#8208;arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry. Use of the CyPAd&#8208;DalPhos pre&#8208;catalyst C2 enabled particularly challenging O&#8208;arylation chemoselectivity in amino alcohols featuring branched primary and secondary alkylamine groups, while selective N&#8208;arylation was observed in substrates featuring less&#8208;hindered linear alkylamine and aniline reacting groups. Useful reaction scope in the (hetero)aryl chloride was achieved throughout, and the ability to conduct such transformations using benchtop handling of materials is demonstrated.

         <title>A Coordination Polymer of Vaska's Complex as a Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Reductive Formation of Enamines from Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a low&#8208;valent metal&#8208;organic material is synthesized using a tetratopic phosphine linker and Vaska's complex. This crystalline, IrI&#8208;containing material behaves similarly to Vaska's complex, binding dioxygen reversibly and can also be used as a recyclable, heterogeneous catalyst for the reductive formation of enamines from amides.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LVMOFs) and related materials have gained interest due to their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. However, of the few LVMOFs that have been reported, none have shown catalytic activity. Herein, a low&#8208;valent metal&#8208;organic material constructed from phosphine linkers and IrI nodes is reported. This material is effectively a crystalline, insoluble analogue of Vaska's complex. As such, the material reversibly binds O2 and catalyzes the reductive formation of enamines from amides.

         <title>Passive Gate&#8208;Tunable Kinetic Photovoltage along Semiconductor&#8208;Water Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching on/off the kinetic photovoltage, an in&#8208;plane voltage in the semiconductor driven by the moving boundaries of electrical double layer between the irradiated and dark regions, is achieved by applying a bias across the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The study extends the principle of the solid&#8208;state field effect transistor to the solid&#8211;liquid system and may lead to novel design concepts for optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Moving boundaries of electric double layer at solid&#8211;liquid interface enables unprecedented persistent energy conversion and provokes a kinetic photovoltaic effect by moving an illumination region along the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. Here, we report a transistor&#8208;inspired gate modulation of kinetic photovoltage by applying a bias at the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. The kinetic photovoltage of both p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type silicon samples can be facilely switched on/off, stemming from the electrical&#8208;field&#8208;modulated surface band bending. In contrast to the function of solid&#8208;state transistors relying on external sources, passive gate modulation of the kinetic photovoltage is achieved simply by introducing a counter electrode with materials of desired electrochemical potential. This architecture provides the ability to modulate the kinetic photovoltage over three orders of magnitude and opens up a new way for self&#8208;powered optoelectronic logic devices.

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperativity and Hydrogen Bonding Allow Efficient Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers successfully implemented the key features of the natural enzyme CO dehydrogenase in an iron porphyrin architecture and designed a catalyst that allowed facile and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Reducing CO2 selectively to one of the several C1 products is challenging, as the thermodynamic reduction potentials for the different n&#8201;e&#8722;/n&#8201;H+ reductions of CO2 are similar and so is the reduction potential for H+ reduction. Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers have taken inspiration from the active site of nickel CO dehydrogenase (Ni&#8208;CODH) to design bimetallic iron porphyrins bridged by a urea moiety. These complexes show fast and selective reduction of CO2 to CO and the results suggest a Ni&#8208;CODH type mechanism at play where one of the two metals binds and reduces the CO2 while the other stabilizes the reduced species by forming a bridged complex, facilitating the C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

&lt;p&gt;Reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectively to one of the several C1 products is challenging, as the thermodynamic reduction potentials for the different &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reductions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are similar and so is the reduction potential for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction. Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co-workers have taken inspiration from the active site of nickel CO dehydrogenase (Ni-CODH) to design bimetallic iron porphyrins bridged by a urea moiety. These complexes show fast and selective reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO and the results suggest a Ni-CODH type mechanism at play where one of the two metals binds and reduces the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; while the other stabilizes the reduced species by forming a bridged complex, facilitating the C&#8722;O bond cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Traceless Chiral Shift Reagent Based on Nonbonding Interactions with Single&#8208;Handed Helical Poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifiable separation of the NMR signals of enantiomers of a broad range of chiral compounds including ethers, ketones, esters, haloalkanes, and alkanes, is possible by using a single&#8208;handed helical poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) bearing simple chiral alkoxymethyl side chains as a chiral shift reagent. The short spin&#8208;spin relaxation of the macromolecular scaffold enables the proton signals of the chiral shift reagent to be eliminated from the spectra.







Abstract
A single&#8208;handed poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) (PQX) has been found to serve as a new type of chiral shift reagent (CSR) for determining the enantiomeric ratio by NMR spectroscopy. Even though there is no specific binding site in the PQX, its nonbonding interaction with chiral analytes leads to a significant shift of the NMR chemical shift, allowing quantification of the enantiomeric ratio. The new type of CSR has the advantages of a wide scope of analytes including ethers, haloalkanes, and alkanes, easy tunability of the degree of chemical shifts by measurement temperature, and erasability of proton signals of CSR because of the short spin&#8208;spin (T2) relaxation of the macromolecular scaffold.

         <title>Divergent Total Syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;Daphnezomines&#8197;A and B and (+)&#8208;Dapholdhamine&#8197;B</title>

Divergent total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B and (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B have been accomplished in 16&#8211;20 steps from a known epoxide via a rapid construction of a common core intermediate. The aza&#8208;adamantane backbone of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B was furnished via a tandem deprotection/reduction/keto amine&#8208;carbinolamine tautomerization, and the (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B backbone was assembled through an N&#8208;iodosuccinimide&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig aminocyclization from the same intermediate.







Abstract
The daphnezomine A&#8208;type subfamily of Daphniphyllum alkaloids structurally features a unique aza&#8208;adamantane core skeleton and anticipates efficient strategies for completing their syntheses to thoroughly investigate their biological activities. Herein, divergent total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B and (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B have been accomplished in 16&#8211;20 steps from a known epoxide via rapid construction of a common core intermediate. The present work features a Ti&#8208;mediated radical cyclization to establish the azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system, an intramolecular Heck reaction to install the bridgehead all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, a tandem deprotection/reduction/keto amine&#8208;carbinolamine tautomerization to furnish the aza&#8208;adamantane backbone, and an NIS&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig aminocyclization to assemble the (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B backbone.
