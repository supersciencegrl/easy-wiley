         <title>Organoplatinum compounds as anion tuneable uphill hydroxide transporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active transport of ions uphill against a concentration gradient across a cell membrane is essential for life. It remains a significant challenge to develop synthetic systems that allow active uphill transport.&#160;Here an uphill transport phenomenon&#160;fuelled by organometallic compounds&#160;is reported that creates a pH gradient. The hydrolysis reaction of Pt(II) complexes results in the formation of aqua complexes that established rapid transmembrane movement (&#8220;flip&#8208;flop&#8221;) of neutral Pt&#8208;OH species, leading to protonation of the OH group in the inner leaflet, generating OH&#8722;&#160;ions, and so increasing pH in the intravesicular solution. The organoplatinum complex effectively transports bound hydroxide ions across the membrane in a neutral complex. The initial net flow of the Pt(II) complex into the vesicles generates a positive electric potential that can further drive uphill transport because the electric potential is opposed to the chemical potential of OH&#8722;. The OH&#8722;&#160;ions equilibrate with this transmembrane electric potential but cannot remove it due to the relatively low permeability of the charged species. As a result, effective hydroxide transport against its concentration gradient can be achieved, and multiple additions can continuously drive the generation of OH&#8722;&#160;against its concentration gradient up to &#916;pH &gt; 2. Moreover, the external addition of different anions can control the generation of OH&#8722;&#160;depending on their anion binding affinity. When anions displayed very high binding affinities towards Pt(II) compounds, such as halides, the external anions could dissipate the pH gradient. In contrast, a further pH increase was observed for weak binding anions, such as sulfate, due to the increase of positive electric potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Assisted Aqueous Manganese&#8208;Ion Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous manganese&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) are promising energy storage systems because of the distinctive merits of Mn metal, in terms of high abundance, low cost, nontoxicity, high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. Conventional MIBs are based on Mn  2+  ion storage mechanism, whereas the capacity in cathode materials is generally limited due to the high charge density and large solvated ionic radius of Mn  2+  ions in aqueous electrolytes. Herein, proton intercalation chemistry is introduced in aqueous MIBs, in which the layered Al  0.1  V  2  O  5  &#183;1.5H  2  O (AlVO) cathode exhibits a consequent Mn  2+  and H  +  ion intercalation/extraction process. Such energy storage mechanism contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance, including a high capacity, fast reaction kinetics and stable cycling behavior. Benefiting from this proton intercalation chemistry, the aqueous Mn||AlVO cells could deliver high specific energy and power simultaneously. This work provides a route for the design of high&#8208;performance aqueous MIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Cycling Stability and Rate Capability of Li&#8208;CO2 Battery via Synergistic Photoelectric Effect and Plasmonic Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution kinetics at cathode seriously impede the realistic applications of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, synergistic photoelectric effect and plasmonic interaction are introduced to accelerate CO2 reduction/evolution reactions by designing a silver nanoparticles&#8208;decorated titanium nanotube array cathode. The incident light excites energetic photoelectrons/holes in titanium dioxide to overcome reaction barriers, and induces the intensified electric field around silver nanoparticles to enable effective separation/transfer of photogenerated carriers and a thermodynamically favorable reaction pathway. The resulting Li&#8208;CO2 battery demonstrates ultra&#8208;low charge voltage of 2.86 V at 0.10 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2, good cycling stability with 86.9% round&#8208;trip efficiency after 100 cycles, and rate capability at 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2. This work offers guidance on rational cathode design for advanced Li&#8208;CO2 batteries and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing the Number of Aluminum  Atoms in T3 Sites of a Mordenite Zeolite by a Low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 Treatment to Catalyze Dimethyl Ether Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the location of aluminum atoms in zeolite framework is critical for understanding structure&#8208;performance relationships of catalytic reaction systems and tailoring catalyst design. Herein, we report a strategy to preferentially relocate mordenite (MOR) framework Al atoms into the desired T3 sites by low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST). High&#8208;field 27Al NMR was used to identify the exact location of framework Al for the MOR samples. The results indicate that 73% of the framework Al atoms were at the T3 sites after LPST under optimal conditions, which leads to controllably generating and intensifying active sites in MOR zeolite for dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation reaction with higher methyl acetate (MA) selectivity and much longer lifetime (25 times). Further research reveals that the Al relocation mechanism involves simultaneous extraction, migration, and reinsertion of Al atoms from and into the parent MOR framework. This unique method is potentially applicable to other zeolites to control Al location.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of an unprecedentedly large cove&#8208;edged nanographene, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzo&#8208;bis&#8208;peri&#8208;octacene (HBPO), is reported in this work. Chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed multiple conformations in solution. Two different molecular conformations, &#8220;waggling&#8221; and &#8220;butterfly&#8221;, were found in crystals by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the selectivity of conformations could be tuned by solvents. The optoelectronic properties of HBPO were investigated by UV&#8211;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations. The contorted geometry and branched alkyl groups suppress the aggregation of HBPO in solution, leading to a high fluorescence quantum yield of 79%. The optical&#8208;gain properties were explored through transient absorption and amplified spontaneous emission spectroscopies, which enrich the choices of edge structures for potential applications in laser cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanographene with Multiple Embedded Heptagons: Cascade Radical Photocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although heptagons are widely found in graphenic materials, the precise synthesis of nanocarbons containing heptagons remains a challenge, especially for the nanocarbons containing multiple&#8208;heptagons. Herein, we show that photo&#8208;induced radical cyclization (PIRC) can be used to synthesize multi&#8208;heptagon&#8208;embedded nanocarbons. Notably, a nanographene containing six heptagons (1) was obtained via a six&#8208;fold cascade PIRC reaction. The structure of 1 was clearly validated and showed a Monkey&#8208;saddle&#8208;shaped conformation. Experimental bond analysis and theoretical calculations indicated that the heptagons in 1 were non&#8208;aromatic, whereas the peripheral rings were highly aromatic. Compared to planar nanographene with the same number of &#960; electrons, 1 had a similar optical gap due to a compromise between the decreased conjugation in the wrapped structure and enhanced electronic delocalization at the rim. Electrochemical studies showed that 1 had low&#8208;lying oxidation potentials, which was attributed to the nitrogen&#8208;doping.</dc:description>

Experimental bond analysis and theoretical calculations indicated that the heptagons in 1 were non-aromatic, whereas the peripheral rings were highly aromatic. Compared to planar nanographene with the same number of &#960; electrons, 1 had a similar optical gap due to a compromise between the decreased conjugation in the wrapped structure and enhanced electronic delocalization at the rim. Electrochemical studies showed that 1 had low-lying oxidation potentials, which was attributed to the nitrogen-doping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Glycoprotein Directly Binds Exogeneous Sialic Acids:&#160;&#160;A NMR View</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction of the SARS CoV2 spike glycoprotein with two sialic acid&#8208;containing trisaccharides (a2,3 and&#160;a2,6 sialyl&#160;N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine) has been demonstrated by NMR. The NMR&#8208;based distinction between the signals of those sialic acids in the glycans covalently attached to the spike protein and those belonging to the exogenous&#160;a2,3 and&#160;a2,6 sialyl&#160;N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine&#160;ligands has been achieved by synthesizing&#160;uniformly&#160;13C&#8208;labelled trisaccharides at the sialic acid and galactose moieties.&#160;STD&#8208;1H,13C&#8208;HSQC&#160;NMR experiments elegantly demonstrate the direct interaction of the sialic acid residues of both trisaccharides with additional participation of the galactose moieties, especially for the&#160;a2,3&#8208;linked analogue. Additional experiments with the spike protein in the presence of a specific antibody for the N&#8208;terminal domain and with the isolated receptor binding and N&#8208;terminal domains of the spike protein unambiguously show that the sialic acid binding site is located at the N&#8208;terminal domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorogenic Iridium(III) bis&#8208;Tetrazine Complexes for Bioorthogonal Peptide Stapling, Bioimaging, Photocytotoxic Applications, and the Construction of Nanosized Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel iridium(III) bis&#8208;tetrazine complexes that displayed significant phosphorogenic response toward (1R,8S,9s)&#8208;bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) derivatives were synthesized and characterized. The complexes were exploited for peptide stapling and cross&#8208;labeling of BCN&#8208;modified peptides. They were also utilized in bioimaging, singlet oxygen photosensitization, and the construction of luminescent nanosized hydrogels.







Abstract
The dual functionality of 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine as a bioorthogonal reactive unit and a luminescence quencher has shaped tetrazine&#8208;based probes as attractive candidates for luminogenic labeling of biomolecules in living systems. In this work, three cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes featuring two tetrazine units were synthesized and characterized. Upon photoexcitation, the complexes were non&#8208;emissive but displayed up to 3900&#8208;fold emission enhancement upon the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) [4+2] cycloaddition with (1R,8S,9s)&#8208;bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) substrates. The rapid reaction kinetics (k2 up to 1.47&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) of the complexes toward BCN substrates allowed effective peptide labeling. The complexes were also applied as live cell bioimaging reagents and photocytotoxic agents. One of the complexes was utilized in the preparation of luminescent nanosized hydrogels that exhibited interesting cargo delivery properties.

         <title>Mechanochemical Access to a Short&#8208;Lived Cyclic Dimer Pd2L2: An Elusive Kinetic Species to Molecular Triangle Pd3L3 and Molecular Square Pd4L4.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;based molecular square Pd4L4 and triangle Pd3L3 represent the molecular ancestors of metal&#8208;coordination polyhedral that blossoms the field the last 30 years. Conventional solution&#8208;based reactions between cis&#8208;protected Pd ions and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine exclusively give Pd4L4 and/or Pd3L3 as the sole products. We herein showed that, under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical condition, self&#8208;assembly energy landscape can be thermodynamically manipulated to form an elusive cyclic dimer Pd2L2 for the first time. In the absence of solvent, Pd2L2 is indefinitely stable in solid&#8208;state, but converts rapidly to its thermodynamic products Pd3L3 and Pd4L4 in solution, confirming Pd2L2 as a short&#8208;lived kinetic species in the solution&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly process. Our result highlights how mechanochemistry grants access to vastly different chemical space than in conventional solution conditions. This provides a unique opportunity to isolate elusive species in self&#8208;assembly processes that are too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Kinetically stable and long&#8208;lived intermediates are crucial in following the progress and understanding of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of diverse aggregated structures with collective functions. Herein, the complex dynamics of an atomically precise Cu(I) nanocluster [Cu  8  (  t  BuC  6  H  4  S)  8  (PPh  3  )  4  ] (  Cu8a  ) is systematically investigated. Remarkably, by monitoring the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and electron microscopy of the kinetically stable intermediates in real time the directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) process of  Cu8a  is deduced. The polymorphism and different emission properties of Cu NCs aggregates were successfully captured, allowing the structure&#8722;optical property relationship to be established. More importantly, utilization of a mathematical "permutation and combination" ideology by introducing heterogeneous luminescent agent of carbon dot (  CD  ) to  Cu8a  ensembles the clarity of the dynamic remarkably enriches the "visualization" fluorescence window, which offers great potential in real time application for optical sensing of materials.</dc:description>

We report here the solid&#8208;phase synthesis of a DNA&#8208;encoded library of several hundred thousand thioether&#8208;linked macrocycles. The library was designed to be highly diverse with respect to backbone scaffold diversity and to minimize the number of amide N&#8208;H bonds, which compromise cell permeability. The utility of the library as a source of protein ligands is demonstrated through the isolation of compounds that bind SA, a model target, with high affinity.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosted  &#160;Inner Surface Charge Transfer in Perovskite Nanodots@Mesoporous Titania Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring high&#8208;efficiency and stable halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO  2  into methane is rather challenging due to the intrinsic photo&#8208; and chemical instability of halide perovskites. In this study, halide  perovskites  (Cs  3  Bi  2  Br  9  , Cs  2  AgBiBr  6  ) are in&#8208;situ grown in mesoporous TiO  2  frameworks with open channels to obtain hyperdispersed and stable nanodots for an efficient CO  2  RR. A benchmarked production rate of CH  4  (32.9 and 24.2 &#956;mol g  &#8211;1  h  &#8208;1  ) is achieved with selectivity values of 88.7% and 84.2%, respectively, which are better than most reported halide perovskite photocatalysts. Focused ion beam (FIB)&#8208;sliced imaging techniques directly image hyperdispersed perovskite nanodots confined in mesopores for the first time with tunable sizes varying from 3.8&#8208;9.9 nm. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and Kevin probe force microscopy clearly show that the built&#8208;in electric field between perovskite nanodots and mesoporous titania channels can efficiently promote photo&#8208;induced charge separation/transfer.  Density  function theory calculations indicate that the high methane selectivity is attributable to Bi&#8208;adsorption mediated hydrogenation of *CO to *HCO dominating over CO desorption. This work demonstrates that confining perovskite nanodots into a mesoporous semiconductor matrix can effectively prevent the aggregation of nano&#8208;perovskites and construct an inner surface built&#8208;in electric field to boosted charge transfer. Our results provide a prospective strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency and stable perovskite photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkenylazaarenes via Cooperative Photoredox and Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective hydroaminoalkylation of alkenyl azaarenes is described as the first successful catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition of radicals to activated olefins to directly forge stereocenters at their &#946;&#8208;position. The stereoselective transformation was made possible by the introduction of cooperative nonclassical H&#8208;bonding interactions, thus enabling the chiral catalyst to provide sufficient stereocontrol.







Abstract
Chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition to activated olefins has been widely used to access enantioenriched molecules containing stereocenters at the &#946;&#8208;position of the olefin activating groups. Herein, we report the first highly enantioselective radical&#8208;based manifold. Under a dual organocatalyst system involving a chiral phosphoric acid and DPZ as the photoredox sensitizer, transformations of N&#8208;arylglycines, in which aryls with CF3 substituents are introduced, with alkenyl azaarenes afforded valuable hydroaminoalkylation adducts with satisfactory results. In addition to the diversity of azaarenes, the method can be used to construct aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted stereocenter. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations were performed to elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism and the origin of stereoselectivity, wherein nonclassical H&#8208;bonding interactions were found to assist chiral catalysts in offering sufficient enantiocontrol.

         <title>Rational Design of Zinc/Zeolite Catalyst: Selective Formation of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol to Aromatics Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow triple&#8208;shelled Zn/MFI single crystals not only exhibit a significantly long lifetime but also an enhanced shape selectivity for p&#8208;xylene in the methanol to aromatics (MTA) reaction. The Zn species were directly imaged in the micropores of only the ZSM&#8208;5 layer and the specific structure and anchor location of the Zn species was determined.







Abstract
The production of p&#8208;xylene from the methanol to aromatics (MTA) reaction is challenging. The catalytic stability, which is inversely proportional to the particle size of the zeolite, is not always compatible with p&#8208;xylene selectivity, which is inversely proportional to the external acid sites. In this study, based on a nano&#8208;sized zeolite, we designed hollow triple&#8208;shelled Zn/MFI single crystals using the ultra&#8208;dilute liquid&#8208;phase growth technique. The obtained composites possessed one ZSM&#8208;5 layer (&#8776;30&#8197;nm) in the middle and two silicalite&#8208;1 layers (&#8776;20&#8197;nm) epitaxially grown on two sides of ZSM&#8208;5, which exhibited a considerably long lifetime (100&#8201;% methanol conversion &gt;40&#8197;h) as well as an enhanced shape selectivity of p&#8208;xylene (&gt;35&#8201;%) with a p&#8208;xylene/xylene ratio of &#8776;90&#8201;%. Importantly, using this sandwich&#8208;like zeolite structure, we directly imaged the Zn species in the micropores of only the ZSM&#8208;5 layer and further determined the specific structure and anchor location of the Zn species.

         <title>Accessing Highly Efficient Photothermal Conversion with Stable Open&#8208;Shell Aromatic Nitric Acid Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic nitric acid radicals exhibit high spin and excellent electrochemical and photothermal stability. A high solar&#8208;energy&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 89.41&#8201;% and water evaporation rate of 1.293&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 were achieved under 1 sun irradiation.







Abstract
It is very challenging to prepare stable radicals as they are usually thermodynamically or kinetically unstable in air. Herein, a series of star&#8208;shaped aromatic nitric acid radicals were prepared via facile demethylation and consequent oxidation. As phenol radicals without steric hindrance group protection, they exhibit high electrochemical and thermal stability due to their rich resonance structures including closed&#8208;shell nitro&#8208;like and open&#8208;shell nitroxide structure with unpaired electrons delocalized in conjugated backbones. Among them, TPA&#8208;TPA&#8208;O6 powder exhibited extremely wide absorption from 300 to 2000&#8197;nm covering the whole solar spectral irradiance, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and negligible photobleaching effect in seawater desalination. Under the irradiation of one sunlight, the water evaporation efficiency of TPA&#8208;TPA&#8208;O6 is recorded to be as high as 89.41&#8201;% and the water evaporation rate is 1.293&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, which represents the top performance in pure organic small molecule photothermal materials.

A self&#8208;healable and desolvation shield is designed as an artificial coating for aqueous Zn electrodes. This interface regulates the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn2+, restrains the random Zn2+ diffusion, and in&#8208;situ repairs the plating/stripping&#8208;induced cracks. By means of the coating, a long&#8208;term cycling stability for &gt;3500&#8197;h is achieved.







Abstract
Artificial interfaces can alleviate the side reactions and the formation of the metallic (e.g., Li, Na, and Zn) dendrites. However, the traditional ones always breakdown during the repeated plating/stripping and fail to regulate the electrodeposition behaviors of the electrodes. Herein, a self&#8208;healable ion regulator (SIR) is designed as a desolvation shield to protect the Zn electrodes and guide the Zn electrodeposition. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, SIR shows a superb capability to in situ repair the plating/stripping&#8208;induced cracks. Besides, the results of theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterizations show that the coating reduces water molecules in the solvated sheath of hydrated Zn2+ and restrains the random Zn2+ diffusion on the Zn surface. Even with a coating layer of only 360&#8197;nm, the SIR&#8208;modified Zn electrode exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability for &gt;3500&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and &gt;950&#8197;h at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Sustainable Superhydrophobic Surface with Tunable Nanoscale Hydrophilicity for Water Harvesting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel superhydrophobic surface with tunable nanoscale hydrophilicity for enhancing highly efficient water capture and transport performance is developed. The hydrophilic/superhydrophobic surface takes advantage of the surface&#8208;confined water of a cellulose nanocrystal under a humid environment and the hierarchical structure assembled by the wrinkled emulsion microparticles, to achieve an excellent water harvesting flux up to 3.402&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Superwettable surfaces show great potential in water harvesting applications, however, a scalable water harvesting surface remains elusive due to the trade&#8208;off between water deposition and transport. Herein, we report a unique superhydrophobic surface with tunable nanoscale hydrophilicity constructed by structured Pickering emulsions. Preferential exposure of the cellulose nanocrystal's outer surface and wax microspheres accelerates droplet deposition allowing for the manipulation of droplet mobility. Appropriate tuning of the wetting characteristics of the surfaces, optimizing the hydrophobicity and density of the water affinity nanodomains enhance the water deposition rate without the sacrifice of water transport rate, achieving an optimal water harvesting flux of 3.402&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 for a plate and 5.02&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 for a mesh. This hydrophilic/superhydrophobic surface allows the controllable manipulation of droplet nucleation and removal to enhance the water harvesting efficiency.

         <title>Dinuclear PtII Complexes with Strong Blue Phosphorescence for Operationally Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with EQE up to 23&#8201;% at 1000&#8201;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of new dinuclear PtII blue emitters bridged by phenylalkoxy&#8208;tethered pyrazole are reported with emission quantum yields up to 95&#8201;%, emission lifetimes down to 1.3&#8197;&#956;s and radiative decay rate constants up to 7.3&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. Efficient hyper&#8208;OLEDs fabricated exhibit a maximum EQE of 23.4&#8201;%, a FWHM of 18&#8197;nm and a device lifetime &gt;250&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new class of dinuclear PtII complexes with blue phosphorescence. Bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and tethered bridging ligands were employed to suppress photo&#8208;induced structural changes and to improve thermal stability of the complexes. These complexes show mixed 3IL/3MLCT blue emission (&#8776;460&#8197;nm) with emission quantum yields of up to 0.95, emission lifetimes of as low as 1.3&#8197;&#956;s and radiative decay rate constants of up to 7.3&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;wt&#8201;% doped PMMA films; the latter is attributed to a 1MLCT excited state having high metal character (resulting in a large SOC) and a large transition dipole moment, based on DFT calculations. Phosphor&#8208;sensitized blue hyper&#8208;OLEDs with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.13, 0.12) showed a maximum EQE of 23.4&#8201;% with a full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 18&#8197;nm and a LT50 &gt;250&#8197;h at an L0 of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Carbonyls and &#960;&#8208;Cation Effect for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepare a polyimide covalent organic framework composite anode by effective in&#8208;situ condensation of anhydride and amine on the surface of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. The construction of the conductive network accelerates the transport of electron. Dual electroactive sites in the framework, carbonyls and aromatic naphthalene rings, could store more potassium ions by the enolization and &#960;&#8208;K+ effect.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COF) possess a robust and porous crystalline structure, making them an appealing candidate for energy storage. Herein, we report an exfoliated polyimide COF composite (P&#8208;COF@SWCNT) prepared by an in situ condensation of anhydride and amine on the single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes as advanced anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Numerous active sites exposed on the exfoliated frameworks and the various open pathways promote the highly efficient ion diffusion in the P&#8208;COF@SWCNT while preventing irreversible dissolution in the electrolyte. During the charging/discharging process, K+ is engaged in the carbonyls of imide group and naphthalene rings through the enolization and &#960;&#8208;K+ effect, which is demonstrated by the DFT calculation and XPS, ex&#8208;situ FTIR, Raman. As a result, the prepared P&#8208;COF@SWCNT anode enables an incredibly high reversible specific capacity of 438&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and extended stability. The structural advantage of P&#8208;COF@SWCNT enables more insights into the design and versatility of COF as an electrode.

         <dc:description>
Enzymatic cascade reactions occurring in the cavity of flasklike colloidal motors have been shown to lead to the consumption of the glucose fuel and a decreased glucose concentration gradient at the opening. The resulting imbalance of self&#8208;diffusiophoretic forces generates a phoretic torque on the flasklike colloidal motors, which continuously steers them to the glucose concentration gradient and thus results in a positive chemotaxis motion.







Abstract
We report a direct experimental observation of the torque&#8208;driven active reorientation of glucose&#8208;fueled flasklike colloidal motors to a glucose gradient exhibiting a positive chemotaxis. These streamlined flasklike colloidal motors are prepared by combining a hydrothermal synthesis and a vacuum infusion and can be propelled by an enzymatic cascade reaction in the glucose fuel. Their flasklike architecture can be used to recognize their moving posture, and thus the dynamic glucose&#8208;gradient&#8208;induced alignment and orientation&#8208;dependent motility during positive chemotaxis can be examined experimentally. The chemotactic mechanism is that the enzymatic reactions inside lead to the glucose acid gradient and the glucose gradient which generate two phoretic torques at the bottom and the opening respectively, and thus continuously steer it to the glucose gradient. Such glucose&#8208;fueled flasklike colloidal motors resembling the chemotactic capability of living organisms hold considerable potential for engineering active delivery vehicles in response to specific chemical signals.

         <title>Robust Luminescent Molecules with High&#8208;Level Reverse Intersystem Crossing for Efficient Near Ultraviolet Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high&#8208;quality near ultraviolet lights are obtained from a tailor&#8208;made molecule featuring high&#8208;level reverse intersystem crossing, providing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiencies with small roll&#8208;offs. Efficient blue OLEDs are realized by adopting this short&#8208;wavelength emission molecule as host for fluorescence, delayed fluorescence or phosphorescence emitters.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) radiating near ultraviolet (NUV) light are of high importance but rarely reported due to the lack of robust organic short&#8208;wavelength emitters. Here, we report a short &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule (POPCN&#8208;2CP) with high thermal and morphological stabilities and strong NUV photoluminescence. Its neat film exhibits an electroluminescence (EL) peak at 404&#8197;nm with a maximum external quantum efficiency (&#951;ext,max) of 7.5&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off. The doped films of POPCN&#8208;2CP in both non&#8208;polar and polar hosts at a wide doping concentration range (10&#8211;80&#8197;wt%) achieve high&#8208;purity NUV light (388&#8211;404&#8197;nm) and excellent &#951;ext,maxs of up to 8.2&#8201;%. The high&#8208;level reverse intersystem crossing improves exciton utilization and accounts for the superb &#951;ext,maxs. POPCN&#8208;2CP can also serve as an efficient host for blue fluorescence, thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence emitters, providing excellent EL performance via F&#246;rster energy transfer.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Detection of Aqueous Uranyl Based on Uranyl&#8208;Triggered Protein Photocleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique uranyl&#8208;triggered photocleavage property is used for uranyl detection in diverse environments. This method is characterized by ultrasensitive detection, a wide detection range, as well as extensive environmental adaptability and is among the best&#8208;performing uranyl detection methods.







Abstract
The detection of environmental uranyl is attracting increasing attention. However, the available detection strategies mainly depend on the selective recognition of uranyl, which is subject to severe interference by coexisting metal ions. Herein, based on the unique uranyl&#8208;triggered photocleavage property, the protein BSA is labelled with fluorescent molecules that exhibit an aggregation&#8208;induced emission effect for uranyl detection. Uranyl&#8208;triggered photocleavage causes the separation of the fluorescent&#8208;molecule&#8208;labelled protein fragments, leading to attenuation of the emission fluorescence, which is used as a signal for uranyl detection. This detection strategy shows high selectivity for uranyl and an ultralow detection limit of 24&#8197;pM with a broad detection range covering five orders of magnitude. The detection method also shows high reliability and stability, making it a promising technique for practical applications in diverse environments.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Polycyclic Photovoltaic Molecule with Low Trap Density for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to typical linear conjugated material (Y6), the two&#8208;dimensional polycyclic material TPP designed and synthesized here exhibits much lower trap density. The bulk heterojunction nanoparticles based on a blend of polymer donor and TPP, exhibited an enhanced average hydrogen evolution rate of 72.75&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 330 to 1100&#8197;nm illumination, which is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than those values of inorganic/hybrid photocatalysts.







Abstract
Typical organic semiconductors show a high trap density of states (1016&#8211;1018&#8197;cm&#8722;3), providing a large number of centers for charge&#8208;carrier recombination, thus hindering the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Here, we design and synthesize a two&#8208;dimensional polycyclic photovoltaic material, named as TPP, to reduce the trap density to as low as 2.3&#215;1015&#8197;cm&#8722;3, which is 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude lower than those of typical organic semiconductors. Moreover, TPP exhibits a broad and strong absorption, ordered molecular packing with a large crystalline coherence length and enhanced electron mobility. Then, the bulk heterojunction nanoparticles (BHJ&#8208;NPs) based on a blend of polymer donor (PM6) and TPP exhibit an average hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 64.31&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under AM1.5G sunlight (100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and 72.75&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 330&#8211;1100&#8197;nm illumination (198&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) higher than that of the control NPs based on typical PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 (62.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Substrate Profiling of Mitochondrial Caseinolytic Protease P via a Site&#8208;Specific Photocrosslinking Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined approach of genetic code expansion, photocrosslinking and proteomics allows identification of the substrate scope of mitochondrial human caseinolytic protease P (hClpP) in an unbiased manner in living mammalian cells. For this, the diazirine&#8208;bearing non&#8208;canonical amino acid DiazK is incorporated site&#8208;specifically at selected positions within the inner proteolytic chamber of hClpP and trapped hClpP&#8208;substrates are enriched and identified via mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Approaches for profiling protease substrates are critical for defining protease functions, but remain challenging tasks. We combine genetic code expansion, photocrosslinking and proteomics to identify substrates of the mitochondrial (mt) human caseinolytic protease P (hClpP). Site&#8208;specific incorporation of the diazirine&#8208;bearing amino acid DiazK into the inner proteolytic chamber of hClpP, followed by UV&#8208;irradiation of cells, allows to covalently trap substrate proteins of hClpP and to substantiate hClpP's major involvement in maintaining overall mt homeostasis. In addition to confirming many of the previously annotated hClpP substrates, our approach adds a diverse set of new proteins to the hClpP interactome. Importantly, our workflow allows identifying substrate dynamics upon application of external cues in an unbiased manner. Identification of unique hClpP&#8208;substrate proteins upon induction of mt oxidative stress, suggests that hClpP counteracts oxidative stress by processing of proteins that are involved in respiratory chain complex synthesis and maturation as well as in catabolic pathways.

&lt;p&gt;Approaches for profiling protease substrates are critical for defining protease functions, but remain challenging tasks. We combine genetic code expansion, photocrosslinking and proteomics to identify substrates of the mitochondrial (mt) human caseinolytic protease P (hClpP). Site-specific incorporation of the diazirine-bearing amino acid DiazK into the inner proteolytic chamber of hClpP, followed by UV-irradiation of cells, allows to covalently trap substrate proteins of hClpP and to substantiate hClpP's major involvement in maintaining overall mt homeostasis. In addition to confirming many of the previously annotated hClpP substrates, our approach adds a diverse set of new proteins to the hClpP interactome. Importantly, our workflow allows identifying substrate dynamics upon application of external cues in an unbiased manner. Identification of unique hClpP-substrate proteins upon induction of mt oxidative stress, suggests that hClpP counteracts oxidative stress by processing of proteins that are involved in respiratory chain complex synthesis and maturation as well as in catabolic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Supramolecular Zippers with Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence by a Dexter Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic supramolecular zipper system showing fascinating ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) has been constructed. More importantly, detailed experimental and computational analysis suggest a new UOP mechanism involving Dexter energy transfer in single&#8208;component materials.







Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials glow persistently in the dark, which offers new exciting possibilities in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting, photoelectric devices and biological imaging. However, the development of single&#8208;component UOP materials remains a great challenge. Herein, we develop a single component organic supramolecular zipper system with a lifetime up to 0.77&#8197;s. Owing to the introduction of a pyrazole ring into the diphenylsulfone group, the &#8220;V&#8221; shaped molecules were artfully self&#8208;assembled into supramolecular zippers via &#960;&#8211;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, that is not only of significance in highly efficient generation of triplet excitons but also facilitates a Dexter energy transfer process within supramolecular zippers, that are responsible for alleviating radiative and non&#8208;radiative deactivation decay of triplet excitons, to finally boost the UOP. This finding not only gives a new set of guidelines for the design of single&#8208;component UOP molecules but also reveals the UOP mechanism from a new perspective.

         <title>Direct and Unified Access to Carbon Radicals from Aliphatic Alcohols by Cost&#8208;Efficient Titanium&#8208;Mediated Homolytic C&#8722;OH Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of &#8220;TiCl2(cat)&#8221; and Zn (cat=catecholate) facilitates the homolytic cleavage of &#8220;non&#8208;activated&#8221; alcohol C&#8722;O bonds. All aliphatic primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols serve as good substrates. This method was applied to radical conjugate addition reactions successfully, and mechanistic studies indicate that alkyl chlorides are not intermediates. The active species is a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex of alkoxide and TiIII.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent Ti&#8208;mediated homolytic C&#8722;O bond cleavage offers unified access to carbon radicals from ubiquitous non&#8208;activated tertiary, secondary, and even primary alcohols. In contrast to the representative Ti reagents, which were ineffective for this purpose, &#8220;TiCl2(cat)&#8221;/Zn (cat=catecholate) was found to be specifically active. This method was applied to the addition reactions of radicals to alkenes and exhibited high generality and yields. More than 50 combinations were examined. The excellent cost&#8208;efficiency and accessibility of &#8220;TiCl2(cat)&#8221;/Zn further enhance its applicability. Control experiments proved the presence of a carbon radical intermediate and excluded the pathway via alkyl chlorides. Further mechanistic study indicated that the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex of alkoxide (R&#8722;O&#8722;) and TiIII is an active species in the C&#8722;O cleavage.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Lattice Intergrown and Robust MOF Membranes for Polyol Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero&#8208;lattice intergrown (HIL) MOF membranes were synthesized, with an integration of two distinct network MOFs, namely MIL&#8208;53 (Al) and amino&#8208;MIL&#8208;101 (Cr), at the molecular scale. The complementary growth, concomitant with a close connection between two lattices, creates a highly compact and robust micro&#8208;architecture. The HLI MOF membrane displays excellent pervaporation dehydration performances for aqueous polyol solutions, and can deal with tough separation situations.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework membranes are frequently used in gas separations, but rare in pervaporation for liquid chemical upgrading, especially for separating water from polyols, due to lack of highly compact and robust micro&#8208;architecture. Here, we report hetero&#8208;lattice intergrown membranes in which amino&#8208;MIL&#8208;101 (Cr) particles embedded into the micro&#8208;gaps of MIL&#8208;53 (Al) rod arrays after secondary growth. By means of high&#8208;resolution TEM and two&#8208;dimensional topologic simulation, the connection between these two distinct MOF lattices at the molecular&#8208;level and their crystallographic geometry harmony is identified, which leads to a close&#8208;knit structure at the crystal boundaries of membranes. Typically, the membrane shows a separation factor as high as 13&#8201;000 for a 90/10 ethanediol/water solution in pervaporation, yields polymer&#8208;grade ethanediol, and saves ca. 32&#8201;% of energy consumption vs. vacuum distillation. It has a highly robust micro&#8208;architecture, with great tolerance to high pressure, durability against ultrasonic therapy and long&#8208;term separation stability over 600&#8197;h.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective N&#8208;1 and C&#8208;3 Heteroarylation of Indole with Heteroarylnitriles by Organocatalysis under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first regioselective, parallel methodologies for N&#8208;1 and C&#8208;3 heteroarylation of indoles via radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling by visible light irradiation have been developed with the aid of organocatalysis. Mechanism studies revealed that the reaction pathway switches from energy&#8208;transfer to proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer by consecutive hydrogen&#8208;bonding association between the organic base and its conjugate acid, with the radical species of the indole and heteroarylnitrile.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective N&#8208;1 and C&#8208;3 arylation of indole has been sought after because of the prevalent application of arylindoles and the intricate reactivities associated with the multiple sites of the N&#8208;unsubstituted indole. Represented herein is the first regioselective heteroarylation of indole via a radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling by visible&#8208;light irradiation. Steady and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic and computational studies revealed that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction of organic base and its conjugated acid, namely with indole and heteroarylnitrile, determined the reaction pathway, which underwent either proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer or energy&#8208;transfer for the subsequent radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling, leading to the regioselective formation of C&#8208;3 and N&#8208;1 heteroarylation of indoles, respectively. The parallel methodologies for regioisomeric N&#8208;1 and C&#8208;3 heteroaryl indoles with good functional group compatibility could be applied to large&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage derivatization of bioactive compounds under extremely mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Formation and Reactivity of a Hexahydridosilicate [SiH6]2&#8722; Coordinated by a Macrocycle&#8208;Supported Strontium Cation</title>

A dinuclear strontium hexahydridosilicate complex has been isolated. It can be regarded as the adduct of two cationic strontium hydride fragments [(Me4TACD)SrH(thf)x]+ with SiH4.







Abstract
The cationic benzyl complex [(Me4TACD)Sr(CH2Ph)][A] (Me4TACD=1,4,7,10&#8208;tetramethyltetraazacyclododecane; A=B(C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;Me2)4) reacted with two equivalents of phenylsilane to give the bridging hexahydridosilicate complex [(Me4TACD)2Sr2(thf)4(&#956;&#8208;&#954;3&#8201;:&#8201;&#954;3&#8208;SiH6)][A]2 (3&#8201;a). Rapid phenyl exchange between phenylsilane molecules is assumed to generate monosilane SiH4 that is trapped by two strontium hydride cations [(Me4TACD)SrH(thf)x]+. Complex 3&#8201;a decomposed in THF at room temperature to give the terminal silanide complex [(Me4TACD)Sr(SiH3)(thf)2][A], with release of H2. Upon reaction with a weak Br&#248;nsted acid, CO2, and 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene SiH4 was released. The reaction of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mixture of cationic benzyl and neutral dibenzyl complex with phenylsilane gave the trinuclear silanide complex [(Me4TACD)3Sr3(&#956;2&#8208;H)3(&#956;3&#8208;SiH3)2][A], while nOctSiH3 led to the trinuclear (n&#8208;octyl)pentahydridosilicate complex [(Me4TACD)3Sr3(&#956;2&#8208;H)3(&#956;3&#8208;SiH5nOct)][A].

         <title>Efficient Long&#8208;Range Triplet Exciton Transport by Metal&#8211;Metal Interaction at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton transport plays a pivotal role in organic opto&#8208;electronics. Effective triplet energy transfer is difficult to achieve, due to the less efficient Dexter mechanism for triplet exciton transport than F&#246;rster resonant energy transfer for singlet exciton transport. Herein, we show that organic PtII and PdII nanowires exhibit long&#8208;range triplet exciton diffusion lengths with large diffusion coefficients by metal&#8211;metal interaction at room temperature.







Abstract
Efficient and long&#8208;range exciton transport is critical for photosynthesis and opto&#8208;electronic devices, and for triplet&#8208;harvesting materials, triplet exciton diffusion length (
) and coefficient (
) are key parameters in determining their performances. Herein, we observed that PtII and PdII organometallic nanowires exhibit long&#8208;range anisotropic triplet exciton LD of 5&#8211;7&#8197;&#956;m along the M&#8722;M direction using direct photoluminescence (PL) imaging technique by low&#8208;power continuous wave (CW) laser excitation. At room temperature, via a combined triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) analysis and spatial PL imaging, an efficient triplet exciton diffusion was observed for the PtII and PdII nanowires with extended close M&#8722;M contact, while is absent in nanowires without close M&#8722;M contact. Two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and calculations revealed a significant contribution of the delocalized 1/3[d&#963;*(M&#8722;M)&#8594;&#960;*] excited state during the exciton diffusion modulated by the M&#8722;M distance.

         <title>Tandem Living Insertion and Controlled Radical Polymerization for Polyolefin&#8211;Polyvinyl Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem polymerization of living olefin polymerization and controlled radical polymerization afforded through the introduction of radical traps by photoinitiation of macrochelates (MILRad functionalization) gives access to macroinitators generating a range of di&#8208; and triblocks containing olefinic, acrylic, styrenic and vinylic block segments.







Abstract
Practical synthesis of polyolefin&#8211;polyvinyl block copolymers remains a challenge for transition&#8208;metal catalyzed polymerizations. Common approaches functionalize polyolefins for post&#8208;radical polymerization via insertion methods, yet sacrifice the livingness of the olefin polymerization. This work identifies an orthogonal radical/spin coupling technique which affords tandem living insertion and controlled radical polymerization. The broad tolerance of this coupling technique has been demonstrated for diverse radical/spin traps such as 2,2,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;3&#8208;azahexane&#8208;3&#8208;nitroxide (TIPNO), 1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine) &#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;bromoisobutyrate (TEMPO&#8208;Br), and N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylnitrone (PBN). Subsequent controlled radical polymerization is demonstrated with nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP) and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), yielding polyolefin&#8211;polyvinyl di&#8208; and triblock copolymers (&#272;&lt;1.3) with acrylic, vinylic and styrenic segments. These findings highlight radical trapping as an approach to expand the scope of polyolefin&#8208;functionalization techniques to access polyolefin macroinitiators.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nano&#8208;regulators with Cascading Activation for Photodynamic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nano&#8208;regulator (SPNT) with cascading intratumoral activation for apoptotic biomarker&#8208;induced indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) inhibition is reported for combinational photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer.







Abstract
Combination photoimmunotherapy holds promise for tumor suppression; however, smart phototherapeutic agents that only activate their immune pharmaceutical action in tumors have been rarely developed. Herein, we report a semiconducting polymer (SP) nano&#8208;regulator (SPNT) with cascading activation for combinational photodynamic cancer immunotherapy. SPNT comprises an immunoregulator (M&#8208;Trp: 1&#8208;methyltryptophan) conjugating to the side chain of the SP backbone via an apoptotic biomarker&#8208;cleavable linker. Under near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation, SPNT produces singlet oxygen to induce immunogenic apoptosis. Concurrently, an apoptotic biomarker is upregulated, which triggers the specific cleavage of M&#8208;Trp for indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) activity inhibition, regulatory T cells reduction and cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration. SPNT&#8208;mediated combination photodynamic immunotherapy thus reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment, resulting in efficient suppression of tumors, and inhibition of lung metastasis.

         <title>A Chemoenzymatic Cascade Combining a Hydration Catalyst with an Amine Dehydrogenase: Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An encapsulated gold carbene complex was combined with a free amine dehydrogenase (GkAmDH) as a co&#8208;catalyst, enabling a cascade synthetic route to directly access chiral amines from propargylethers. This process, combining an initial gold carbene catalyzed hydration of propargylethers to ketones followed by a subsequent reductive amination, produces a wide range of chiral amines in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The combination of biocatalysis and transition&#8208;metal catalysis can complement synthetic gaps only in a chemical or biological process. However, the intrinsic mutual deactivation between enzymatic and chemical species is a significant challenge in a single operation. To address the above issue, we developed an encapsulated Au/carbene combined with a free amine dehydrogenase as a co&#8208;catalyst system that enables an efficient hydration/amination enantioselective cascade process to be accomplished. The mechanistic investigation discloses dual catalysis comprised of alkyne hydration, followed by a reductive amination process.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on the Directing Ability of Chalcogenoethers in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective C&#8722;H Olefination and Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and computational studies on the directing ability of chalcogenoether motifs in Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation are presented. The thioether motif was found to be a superior directing group compared to the corresponding ether (&#8722;OR) and selenoether in terms of reactivity and enantiocontrol. The selenoether unit (&#8722;SeMe) was used for the first time as a suitable directing group in asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
We present herein our experimental and DFT computational studies on the directing ability of chalcogenoether motifs in Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H functionalization. The thioether motif was found to be a superior directing group compared to the corresponding ether and selenoether in terms of reactivity and enantiocontrol. Remarkably, DFT calculation provided a predictive model for the optimization of reaction conditions and the interpretation of the origin of enantioselectivity. Both Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions were successfully developed using chiral phosphoric acids as efficient ligands, providing a broad range of axially chiral biaryls in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of polyaryls bearing multiple stereogenic axes, gram&#8208;scale reaction and various chemical transformations make this protocol more attractive and significant.

         <title>Chiral Hybrid Copper(I) Halides for High Efficiency Second Harmonic Generation with a Broadband Transparency Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides based on CuI with a large band gap have been constructed, which feature well&#8208;balanced nonlinear optical performances with highly efficient SHG response, outstanding optical transparency and stability. The effective second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient is two orders of magnitude higher than that of their CuII counterparts, which promises potential nonlinear photonic applications in wide wavelength regions.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) with intrinsic noncentrosymmetry have shown great promise for applications in second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO). However, established chiral HOMHs often suffer from their relatively small band gaps, which lead to negative impacts on transparent window and laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LDT). Here, we have synthesized two chiral HOMHs based on CuI halides, namely (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)CuBr2, which feature well&#8208;balanced NLO performances with a highly efficient SHG response, outstanding optical transparency, and high LDT. The effective second&#8208;order NLO coefficient of (R&#8208;MBA)CuBr2 has been determined to be &#8776;24.7&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of their CuII counterparts. This work shows the promising potential of CuI&#8208;based chiral HOMHs for nonlinear photonic applications in wide wavelength regions.

         <title>Exceptional Manganese(II) Stability and Manganese(II)/Zinc(II) Selectivity with Rigid Polydentate Ligands**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the Irving&#8211;Williams series, found close to 75&#8197;years ago, manganese(II) complexes generally are significantly less stable than the corresponding zinc(II) complexes. Indeed, no ligands with manganese(II) versus zinc(II) selectivity have been known so far. Based on metal&#8208;ion size discrimination we now present hepta&#8208; and octadentate bispidine ligands with manganese(II) complex stabilities that are up to 10 orders of magnitude larger than those with zinc(II).







Abstract
While MnII complexes meet increasing interest in biomedical applications, ligands are lacking that enable high MnII complex stability and selectivity vs. ZnII, the most relevant biological competitor. We report here two new bispidine derivatives, which provide rigid and large coordination cavities that perfectly match the size of MnII, yielding eight&#8208;coordinate MnII complexes with record stabilities. In contrast, the smaller ZnII ion cannot accommodate all ligand donors, resulting in highly strained and less stable six&#8208;coordinate complexes. Combined theoretical and experimental data (X&#8208;ray crystallography, potentiometry, relaxometry and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy) demonstrate unprecedented selectivity for MnII vs. ZnII (KMnL/KZnL of 108&#8211;1010), in sharp contrast to the usual Irving&#8211;Williams behavior, and record MnII complex stabilities and inertness with logKMnL close to 25.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Sulfate Optical Materials Exhibiting Giant Second Harmonic Generation and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A HgII&#8208;based sulfate NLO crystal, Hg3O2SO4, which achieves a perfect balance between SHG coefficient and birefringence, exhibits a giant SHG response (14 times that of KDP), as well as an appropriate birefringence (0.10@546&#8197;nm) attributable to the unique component [Hg3O2SO4]&#8734; layers.







Abstract
Discovering novel sulfate optical materials with strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and large birefringence is confronted by a great challenge attributed to the intrinsically weak polarizability and optical anisotropy of tetrahedral SO4 groups. Herein, two superior&#8208;performing sulfate optical materials, namely, noncentrosymmetric Hg3O2SO4 and centrosymmetric CsHgClSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, have been successfully synthesized through the introduction of a highly polarizable d10 metal cation, Hg2+. The unique component layers in the reported compounds, [Hg3O2SO4]&#8734; layers in Hg3O2SO4 and [HgClSO4(H2O)]
 layers in CsHgClSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, induce enlarged birefringence in each sulfate. Remarkably, Hg3O2SO4 exhibits a very large SHG response (14 times that of KH2PO4), which is the strongest efficiency among all the reported nonlinear optical sulfates. Detailed theoretical calculations confirm that the employment of highly polarizable Hg2+ is an effective strategy to design superior optical materials with large birefringence and strong SHG response.

Herein, two superior-performing sulfate optical materials, namely, noncentrosymmetric Hg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and centrosymmetric CsHgClSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, have been successfully synthesized through the introduction of a highly polarizable d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; metal cation, Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The unique component layers in the reported compounds, [Hg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; layers in Hg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and [HgClSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]
 layers in CsHgClSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, induce enlarged birefringence in each sulfate. Remarkably, Hg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a very large SHG response (14 times that of KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which is the strongest efficiency among all the reported nonlinear optical sulfates. Detailed theoretical calculations confirm that the employment of highly polarizable Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is an effective strategy to design superior optical materials with large birefringence and strong SHG response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lessons from an Array: Using an Electrode Surface to Control the Selectivity of a Solution&#8208;Phase Chemical Reaction</title>

The confinement of a preparative reaction to the surface of an electrode offers new opportunities to induce selectivity into the transformation.







Abstract
Electrochemistry offers a variety of novel means by which selectivity can be introduced into synthetic organic transformations. In the work reported, it is shown how methods used to confine chemical reactions to specific sites on a microelectrode array can also be used to confine a preparative reaction to the surface of an electrode inserted into a bulk reaction solution. In so doing, the surface of a modified electrode can be used to introduce new selectivity into a preparative reaction that is not observed in the absence of either the modified electrode surface or the effort to confine the reaction to that surface. The observed selectivity can be optimized in the same way that confinement is optimized on an array and is dependent on the nature of the functionalized surface.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Bispecific Peptide for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a bispecific T&#8208;cell engager (BiTE)&#8208;like molecule is proposed. The peptide consists of dual CD3 and integrin &#945;v&#946;3 targeting sequence, conjugated by a self&#8208;assembling peptide. The molecule is designed to target the CD3 receptor on T&#8197;cells and induce T&#8197;cell&#8208;mediated cytolysis against tumor cells overexpressing integrin &#945;v&#946;3.







Abstract
Precise and effective manipulation of protein functions still faces tremendous challenges. Herein we report a programmable peptide molecule, consisted of targeting and self&#8208;assembly modules, that enables specific and highly efficient assembly governed by targeting receptor proteins. Upon binding to the cell membrane receptor, peptide conformation is somewhat stabilized along with decreased self&#8208;assembly activation energy, promoting peptide&#8208;protein complex oligomerization. We first design a GNNQQNY&#8208;RGD peptide (G7&#8208;RGD) to recognize integrin &#945;V&#946;3 receptor for proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. In the presence of &#945;V&#946;3 protein, the critical assembly concentration of free G7&#8208;RGD decreases from 525 to 33&#8197;&#956;M and the resultant G7&#8208;RGD cluster drives integrin receptor oligomerization. Finally, a bispecific assembling peptide antiCD3&#8208;G7&#8208;RGD is rationally designed for cancer immunotherapy, which validates CD3 oligomerization and concomitant T cell activation, leading to T cell&#8208;mediated cancer cell cytolysis.

         <title>The Assembly and Jamming of Nanoparticle Surfactants at Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The attachment mechanism of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs), which are generated by the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and polymeric ligands at the interface, is demonstrated. The binding energy of the NPS to the interface can be adjusted, and a size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface can be triggered or suppressed by controlling the packing state of NPSs.







Abstract
Using the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and polymeric ligands to generate nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface, the binding energy of the NP to the interface can be significantly increased, irreversibly binding the NPSs to the interface. By designing a simplified NPS model, where the NP size can be precisely controlled and the characteristic fluorescence of the NPs be used as a direct probe of their spatial distribution, we provide new insights into the attachment mechanism of NPSs at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. We find that the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be reduced by competitive ligands, resulting in the dissociation and disassembly of NPSs at the interface, and allowing the construction of responsive, reconfigurable all&#8208;liquid systems. Smaller NPSs that are loosely packed (unjammed) and irreversibly bound to the interface can be displaced by larger NPSs, giving rise to a size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface. However, when the smaller size NPSs are densely packed and jam at the interface, the size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface can be completely suppressed.

         <title>Electropolymerization of Metal Clusters Establishing a Versatile Platform for Enhanced Catalysis Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;cluster hybrid materials was successfully fabricated by using the electropolymerization (EP) method. Poly&#8208;metal clusters in an extended conjugated network establish an electron transport highway to catalytic sites. The improvement in catalytic performance in poly&#8208;metal clusters was demonstrated by electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) and photocatalytic chemical warfare simulant degradation experiments.







Abstract
Atomically precise metal clusters are attractive as highly efficient catalysts, but suffer from continuous efficiency deactivation in the catalytic process. Here, we report the development of an efficient strategy that enhances catalytic performance by electropolymerization (EP) of metal clusters into hybrid materials. Based on carbazole ligand protection, three polymerized metal&#8208;cluster hybrid materials, namely Poly&#8208;Cu14cba, Poly&#8208;Cu6Au6cbz and Poly&#8208;Cu6Ag4cbz, were prepared. Compared with isolated metal clusters, metal clusters immobilizing on a biscarbazole network after EP significantly improved their electron&#8208;transfer ability and long&#8208;term recyclability, resulting in higher catalytic performance. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, Poly&#8208;Cu14cba was evaluated as an electrocatalyst for reducing nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3), which exhibited &#8776;4&#8208;fold NH3 yield rate and &#8776;2&#8208;fold Faraday efficiency enhancement compared to that of Cu14cba with good durability. Similarly, Poly&#8208;Cu6Au6cbz showed 10&#8197;times higher photocatalytic efficiency towards chemical warfare simulants degradation than the cluster counterpart.

         <title>Photoswitchable Epothilone&#8208;Based Microtubule Stabilisers Allow GFP&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Compatible, Optical Control over the Microtubule Cytoskeleton**

A photoswitchable epothilone&#8208;based microtubule stabiliser, STEpo, is introduced for high&#8208;precision cytoskeleton photocontrol in live cells. STEpo features a novel styrylthiazole photoswitch that is isosteric to azobenzene, but is compatible with GFP imaging, and can photomodulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding as well as sterics. STEpo photocontrols microtubule dynamics and cell division with micron&#8208; and second&#8208;scale resolution, and has mid&#8208;nanomolar potency.







Abstract
Optical methods to modulate microtubule dynamics show promise for reaching the micron&#8208; and millisecond&#8208;scale resolution needed to decrypt the roles of the cytoskeleton in biology. However, optical microtubule stabilisers are under&#8208;developed. We introduce &#8220;STEpos&#8221; as GFP&#8208;orthogonal, light&#8208;responsive epothilone&#8208;based microtubule stabilisers. They use a novel styrylthiazole photoswitch in a design to modulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding and steric effects that control epothilone potency. STEpos photocontrol microtubule dynamics and cell division with micron&#8208; and second&#8208;scale spatiotemporal precision. They substantially improve potency, solubility, and ease&#8208;of&#8208;use compared to previous optical microtubule stabilisers, and the structure&#8208;photoswitching&#8208;activity relationship insights in this work will guide future optimisations. The STEpo reagents can contribute greatly to high&#8208;precision research in cytoskeleton biophysics, cargo transport, cell motility, cell division, development, and neuroscience.

         <title>The Underlying Molecular Mechanism of Fence Engineering to Break the Activity&#8211;Stability Trade&#8208;Off in Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinct molecule&#8208;selective cobalt disulfide fence is proposed to be capable of solving the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off of highly active cobalt&#8208;doped molybdenum disulfide catalysts. This fence completely encloses the catalyst and prevents species that would poison the catalyst from reaching it, but allows catalytic reaction&#8208;related species to diffuse freely. In&#8197;situ spectroscopy uncovers its underlying mechanism.







Abstract
Non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal (NPM) catalysts often face the formidable challenge of a trade&#8208;off between long&#8208;term stability and high activity, which has not yet been widely addressed. Herein we propose a distinct molecule&#8208;selective fence as a promising concept to solve this activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. The fence encloses the catalyst and prevents species poisonous to the catalyst from reaching it, but allows catalytic reaction&#8208;related species to diffuse freely. We constructed a CoS2 fence layer on the external surface of highly active cobalt&#8208;doped MoS2, achieving a remarkable catalytic stability towards the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction and improved activity. In&#8197;situ spectroscopy uncovered the underlying molecular mechanism of the CoS2 fence for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of the MoS2 catalyst. This work offers valuable guidance for rationally designing efficient and stable NPM catalysts.

         <title>Chirality Inversion in Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites Directed by Curvature&#8208;Mediated Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active role of achiral nanoparticles in regulating supramolecular chirality of the nanocomposites is reported. Nanoparticle&#8208;curvature&#8208;dependent supramolecular chirality in nanotubular composites was discovered, where small&#8208;sized nanoparticles of high curvature and large&#8208;sized nanoparticles of low curvature lead to nanotubular composites with opposite chirality.







Abstract
Nanoscale curvature&#8208;dependent interactions are of paramount importance in biological systems. Here, we report that nanoscale curvature plays an important role in regulating the chirality of self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites from chiral organic molecules and achiral nanoparticles. Specifically, we show that the supramolecular chirality of the nanocomposites markedly depends on the nanoparticle curvature, where small&#8208;sized nanoparticles of high curvature and large&#8208;sized nanoparticles of low curvature lead to nanocomposites with opposite chirality. Quantitative kinetic experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that nanoparticle curvature plays a key role in promoting the pre&#8208;nucleation oligomerization of chiral molecules, which consequently regulates the supramolecular chirality of the nanocomposites. We anticipate that this study will aid in rational design of an artificial cooperative system giving rise to emergent assembling phenomena that can be surprisingly rich and often cannot be understood by studying the conventional noncooperative systems.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Reduction&#8208;Induced Hydrogenation of a Helical Bilayer Nanographene with K and Rb Metals: Electron Multiaddition and Selective Rb+ Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented site&#8208;specific reduction&#8208;induced hydrogenation of a helical bilayer nanographene has been found using K or Rb metals. However, coordination of the metal to the central six&#8208;membered rings of the bilayer helicene in a &#951;3&#8208;mode is only observed for the Rb complex, due to its larger ionic size, thus showing the impact of the cation's size on the reaction product.







Abstract
The chemical reduction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bilayer nanographene 1 (C138H120) with K and Rb in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 affords [K+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)(THF)2][{K+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}2(THF)0.5][C138H1223&#8722;] (2) and [Rb+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)2][{Rb+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}2(C138H1223&#8722;)] (3). Whereas K+ cations are fully solvent&#8208;separated from the trianionic core thus affording a &#8220;naked&#8221; 1.3&#8722; anion, Rb+ cations are coordinated to the negatively charged layers of 1.3&#8722;. According to DFT calculations, the localization of the first two electrons in the helicene moiety leads to an unprecedented site&#8208;specific hydrogenation process at the carbon atoms located on the edge of the helicene backbone. This uncommon reduction&#8208;induced site&#8208;specific hydrogenation provokes dramatic changes in the (electronic) structure of 1 as the helicene backbone becomes more compressed and twisted upon chemical reduction, which results in a clear slippage of the bilayers.

Using asunaprevir to control the activity of HCV NS3 protease embedded in a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) on T cells, the CAR can be repeatedly turned on and off to target tumor cells for their elimination.







Abstract
As a revolutionary cancer treatment, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy suffers from complications such as cytokine release syndromes and T cell exhaustion. Their mitigation desires controllable activation of CAR&#8208;T cells that is achievable through regulatory display of CARs. By embedding the hepatitis C virus NS3 protease (HCV&#8208;NS3) between the single&#8208;chain variable fragment (scFv) and the hinge domain, we showed that the display of anti&#8208;CD19 scFv on CAR&#8208;T cells was positively correlated to the presence of a clinical HCV&#8208;NS3 inhibitor asunaprevir (ASV). This novel CAR design that allows the display of anti&#8208;CD19 scFv in the presence of ASV and its removal in the absence of ASV creates a practically reversible chemical switch. We demonstrated that the intact CAR on T cells can be repeatedly turned on and off by controlling the presence of ASV in a dose dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, which enables delicate modulation of CAR&#8208;T activation during cancer treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Using asunaprevir to control the activity of HCV NS3 protease embedded in a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) on T cells, the CAR can be repeatedly turned on and off to target tumor cells for their elimination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a revolutionary cancer treatment, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy suffers from complications such as cytokine release syndromes and T cell exhaustion. Their mitigation desires controllable activation of CAR-T cells that is achievable through regulatory display of CARs. By embedding the hepatitis C virus NS3 protease (HCV-NS3) between the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and the hinge domain, we showed that the display of anti-CD19 scFv on CAR-T cells was positively correlated to the presence of a clinical HCV-NS3 inhibitor asunaprevir (ASV). This novel CAR design that allows the display of anti-CD19 scFv in the presence of ASV and its removal in the absence of ASV creates a practically reversible chemical switch. We demonstrated that the intact CAR on T cells can be repeatedly turned on and off by controlling the presence of ASV in a dose dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, which enables delicate modulation of CAR-T activation during cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T&#8197;cell therapy suffers from complications including cytokine release syndromes and T&#8197;cell exhaustion. To curb these drawbacks, Jianfeng Zhou, Wenshe&#8197;Ray Liu et&#8197;al. report in their Research Article (e202109550) a chemogenetic switch that can be reversibly turned on and off to control the expression of CAR using a clinically approved small&#8208;molecule drug, asunaprevir. This novel technique will potentially enable delicate modulation of CAR&#8208;T activation during cancer treatment.

         <title>Back Cover: Site&#8208;Specific Reduction&#8208;Induced Hydrogenation of a Helical Bilayer Nanographene with K and Rb Metals: Electron Multiaddition and Selective Rb+ Complexation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 10/2022)</title>

Reduction&#8208;induced hydrogenation of a helical bilayer nanographene (C138H120) with K or Rb in 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 is reported by Israel Fern&#225;ndez, Marina&#8197;A. Petrukhina, Nazario Mart&#237;n, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202115747). DFT calculations predict that localization of the first two electrons in the helicene moiety leads to a site&#8208;specific hydrogenation at the carbon atoms located on the edge of the central [6]helicene backbone (pink hydrogens). The third electron forms a radical trianion on the HBC leading to a final Rb complex.

         <title>Deoxygenative Functionalizations of Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review recaps the development of selected deoxygenation methodologies for aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids, which take full advantage of the tremendous yet underexplored synthetic potential of carbonyl and carboxyl groups. Representative literature examples are discussed and their general features summarized, including characteristic reaction intermediates, typical reactivity patterns and commonly used conditions.







Abstract
The simple and efficient conversion of carbonyl compounds into functionalized alkanes via deoxygenation is highly enabling in chemical synthesis. This Review covers the recent methodology development in carbonyl and carboxyl deoxygenative functionalizations, highlighting some representative and significant contributions in this field. These advances are categorized based on the reactivity patterns of some oxygenated feedstock compounds, including aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids. Four types of reactive intermediates arising from aldehydes and ketones during the deoxygenation, namely, bis&#8208;electrophiles, carbenoids, bis&#8208;nucleophiles and alkyl radical equivalents, are presented, while the carboxylic acids mainly behave as tris&#8208;electrophiles when deoxygenated. In each subcategory, selected examples are organized according to the type of bond formation and discussed from a generalized mechanistic perspective.

         <title>Global Analysis of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extensive analysis of the mechanical properties of organic crystals has determined the limits of their mechanical performance as a separate class of engineering materials. This Minireview also explores the reasons for the softness of organic crystals.







Abstract
Organic crystals, although widely studied, have not been considered nascent candidate materials in engineering design. Here we summarize the mechanical properties of organic crystals that have been reported over the past three decades, and we establish a global mechanical property profile that can be used to predict and identify mechanically robust organic crystals. Being composed of light elements, organic crystals populate a narrow region in the mechanical property&#8211;density space between soft, disordered organic materials and stiff, ordered materials. Two subsets of extraordinarily stiff and hard organic crystalline materials were identified and rationalized by the normalized number density, strength, and directionality of their intermolecular interactions. We conclude that future lightweight, soft, all&#8208;organic components in devices should capitalize on the greatest asset of organic single crystals&#8212;namely, the combination of long&#8208;range structural order and softness.

         <title>Layered 2D Halide Perovskites beyond the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Phase: Tailored Interlayer Chemistries for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) and alternating&#8208;cation&#8208;interlayer (ACI) phases are two emerging types of layered 2D halide perovskites with high potential in balanced charge&#8208;transport properties and chemical stability. By tailoring the molecular, thin&#8208;film, and device chemistries, high&#8208;performance solar cells have been demonstrated.







Abstract
Layered halide perovskites (LHPs) with crystallographically 2D structures have gained increasing interest for photovoltaic applications due to their superior chemical stability and intriguing anisotropic properties, which are in contrast to their conventional 3D perovskite counterparts. The most frequently studied LHPs are Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) phases, which suffer from a carrier&#8208;transport bottleneck due to the van der Waals gap associated with their intrinsic organic interlayer structures. To address this issue, Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) and alternating&#8208;cation&#8208;interlayer (ACI) LHPs have rapidly emerged, which exhibit unique structural and (opto)electronic characteristics that may resemble those of the 3D counterparts owing to the eliminated or reduced van der Waals gap. Improved photophysical properties have been achieved in DJ and ACI LHPs, leading towards better photovoltaic performance. Here we provide a comprehensive discussion on the merits and promises of DJ and ACI LHPs from a chemistry perspective. Then, we review recent progress on the synthesis and tailoring of DJ and ACI LHP crystals and thin films, as well as their optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Finally, we discuss possible pathways to overcome critical challenges to realize the full potential of DJ and ACI LHPs for high&#8208;performance solar cells and beyond.

         <title>Direct Observation of Ultrafast Proton Rocking in the BLUF Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes of the OaPAC BLUF domain W mutant are uncovered to be forward sequential electron transfer and proton transfer followed by reverse sequential proton transfer and electron transfer mechanism. Significantly, the Grotthuss&#8208;type proton rocking process is unambiguously resolved in this system and the associated kinetic isotope effect is measured.







Abstract
We present direct observation of ultrafast proton rocking in the central motif of a BLUF domain protein scaffold. The mutant design has taken consideration of modulating the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) driving forces by replacing Tyr in the original motif with Trp, in order to remove the interference of a competing electron transfer pathway. Using femtosecond pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy and detailed kinetics analysis, we resolved an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;coupled Grotthuss&#8208;type forward and reverse proton rocking along the FMN&#8211;Gln&#8211;Trp proton relay chain. The rates of forward and reverse proton transfer are determined to be very close, namely 51&#8197;ps vs. 52&#8197;ps. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) constants associated with the forward and reverse proton transfer are 3.9 and 5.3, respectively. The observation of ultrafast proton rocking is not only a crucial step towards revealing the nature of proton relay in the BLUF domain, but also provides a new paradigm of proton transfer in proteins for theoretical investigations.

         <title>Flash Electrochemical Approach to Carbocations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel flow electrochemical reactor that accomplishes electrolysis within a few seconds was developed, enabling flash generation of short&#8208;lived carbocations and trapping reaction with nucleophiles before they decompose. The present methodology was applied to highly reactive oxocarbenium ions, N&#8208;acyliminium ions, glycosyl cations, and the Ferrier cations. Moreover, continuous and flash synthesis of a pharmaceutical precursor using the flow reactor system was successfully demonstrated.

A novel flow electrochemical reactor that accomplishes electrolysis within a few seconds in a single passage was developed. By using the flow reactor system, the flash electrochemical generation of short&#8208;lived carbocations, including oxocarbenium ions, N&#8208;acyliminium ions, glycosyl cations, and Ferrier cations was achieved within a few seconds, enabling the subsequent reaction with nucleophiles before their decomposition. Moreover, continuous operation based on the present system enabled the rapid synthesis of pharmaceutical precursors on demand.

         <title>Topochemical Polymerization of a Diacetylene in a Chalcogen&#8208;Bonded (ChB) Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
No strong hydrogen bonding but weaker chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions are used for the first time to organize diacetylene molecules in the solid state for thermal topochemical polymerization. The obtained polydiacetylene, free of the pyridine&#8208;based ChB acceptor, exhibits an 8 orders of magnitude increase in conductivity upon iodine doping.







Abstract
The successful topochemical polymerization of bis(selenocyanatomethyl)butadyine 1 is achieved upon association in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 co&#8208;crystal with 1,2&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (2&#8208;bpen) through strong and linear (NC)&#8722;Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NPy chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions, allowing for an appropriate parallel alignment of the diacetylene moieties toward the solid&#8208;state reaction. Co&#8208;crystal 1&#8901;(2&#8208;bpen) undergoes polymerization upon heating at 100&#8201;&#176;C. The reaction progress was monitored by IR, DSC and PXRD. An enhancement of the polymer conductivity by 8 orders of magnitude is observed upon iodine doping. Strikingly, the course of polymerization is accompanied with sublimation of the ChB acceptor molecules 2&#8208;bpen, providing the polymer in a pure form with full recovery of the co&#8208;former, at variance with the usual hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystal strategies toward polydiacetylenes.

         <title>Polyyne [3]Rotaxanes: Synthesis via Dicobalt Carbonyl Complexes and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt carbonyl complexes have been used as temporary masking group, and temporary stoppers, in the synthesis of polyyne [3]rotaxanes with two macrocycles threaded on a C28 thread. Comparison of the thermal stability of two [3]rotaxanes with different threaded macrocycles shows that the 2,6&#8208;pyridyl cycloparaphenylene nanohoop effectively stabilizes the polyyne chain.







Abstract
New strategies for synthesizing polyyne polyrotaxanes are being developed as an approach to stable carbyne &#8220;insulated molecular wires&#8221;. Here we report an active metal template route to polyyne [3]rotaxanes, using dicobalt carbonyl masked alkyne equivalents. We synthesized two [3]rotaxanes, both with the same C28 polyyne dumbbell component, one with a phenanthroline&#8208;based macrocycle and one using a 2,6&#8208;pyridyl cycloparaphenylene nanohoop. The thermal stabilities of the two rotaxanes were compared with that of the naked polyyne dumbbell in decalin at 80&#8201;&#176;C, and the nanohoop rotaxane was found to be 4.5 times more stable.

         <title>Highly Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient enantioselective nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes has been realized. This system integrates direct generation of difluoromethylated stereocenters and enantioselective carbon(sp3)&#8722;silicon bond formation.







Abstract
The synthesis of small organic molecules with a difluoromethylated stereocenter is particularly attractive in drug discovery. Herein, we have developed an efficient method for the direct generation of difluoromethylated stereocenters through Ni0&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes. The reaction also represents the enantioselective construction of carbon(sp3)&#8722;silicon bonds with nickel catalysis, which provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical synthesis route of high&#8208;value optically active &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes. This protocol features readily available starting materials and commercial chiral catalysis, broad substrates spanning a range of functional groups with high yield (up to 99&#8201;% yield) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee). The enantioenriched products undergo a variety of stereospecific transformations. Preliminary mechanistic studies were performed.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioconvergent Allenylation of Aldehydes with Propargyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cr&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylation reaction of aldehydes with racemic propargyl halides has been developed. This robust method employs simple and readily accessible materials, exhibits exceptional functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, and provides facile access to a wide range of valuable optically enriched &#945;&#8208;allenols with two or three continuous chiral centers, including both central and axial chirality.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Allenol is a versatile synthon in organic synthesis. The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allenols from readily available starting materials remains a prominent challenge, especially when simultaneous control over axial and central chirality is required. Herein, we describe the Cr&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylation of aldehydes with racemic propargyl halides to rapidly access a wide range of chiral &#945;&#8208;allenols with adjacent axial and central chiralities. This method features excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity control with broad substrate scope, and provides facile access to all four stereoisomers when allied with a Mitsunobu reaction. Preliminary mechanistic studies support radical&#8208;based reaction pathways. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the application in late&#8208;stage functionalization and the formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;varitriol.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopropenols Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Organocatalyzed [2+1] Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An energy transfer photocatalysis strategy was developed for the synthesis of cyclopropenols. The novel donor&#8211;acceptor carbenes derived from trifluoroacetylsilanes reacted efficiently with both activated and non&#8208;activated alkynes to form the 2+1 cyclization products. The synthetic potential of the reaction is highlighted by a gram&#8208;scale reaction and the application in diastereoselective synthesis of trifluoromethylated cyclopropanols.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of common cyclopropenes has been well studied, the access to cyclopropenols is rather limited. Herein, we report the first synthesis of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylated cyclopropenols via 2+1 cycloaddition reactions between alkynes and trifluoroacylsilanes, enabled by visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced organocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;An energy transfer photocatalysis strategy was developed for the synthesis of cyclopropenols. The novel donor&#8211;acceptor carbenes derived from trifluoroacetylsilanes reacted efficiently with both activated and non-activated alkynes to form the 2+1 cyclization products. The synthetic potential of the reaction is highlighted by a gram-scale reaction and the application in diastereoselective synthesis of trifluoromethylated cyclopropanols.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the synthesis of common cyclopropenes has been well studied, the access to cyclopropenols is rather limited. Herein, we report the first synthesis of &#945;&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;trifluoromethylated cyclopropenols via 2+1 cycloaddition reactions between alkynes and trifluoroacylsilanes, enabled by visible-light-induced organocatalysis. The novel ambiphilic donor&#8211;acceptor carbenes derived from trifluoroacetylsilanes reacted efficiently with both activated and non-activated alkynes. The reaction features simple operation, mild conditions, broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. The synthetic potential of the reaction is highlighted by the gram-scale reactions and first synthesis of &#945;-trifluoromethylated cyclopropanols through the combination of the 2+1 cyclization and high diastereoselective hydrogenation reaction in one pot.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transformation of Covalent Organic Frameworks from N&#8208;Acylhydrazone to Oxadiazole Linkages for Smooth Electron Transfer in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxadiazole&#8208;linked covalent organic framework has been constructed through oxidative cyclization of N&#8208;acylhydrazone linkage. Both chemical stability and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization are significantly improved, thus upgrading photocatalytic hydrogen generation. This work provides facile protocols for the modulation of photophysical properties for photocatalysis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are regarded as new platforms for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion due to their tailor&#8208;made functions and pre&#8208;designable structures. Their intrinsic reversibility and the high polarization of organic linkages inevitably result in poor chemical stability and weak optoelectronic properties. Herein, one N&#8208;acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COF (H&#8208;COF) was converted into a stable and &#960;&#8208;conjugated oxadiazole&#8208;linked COF via post&#8208;oxidative cyclization. Both chemical stability and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization throughout the reticular framework are significantly improved, leading to a high hydrogen evolution rate of 2615&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 upon visible light irradiation, which is over four times higher than that of H&#8208;COF. This work provides a facile protocol for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs and the modulation of photophysical properties for photocatalytic application.

         <title>Dissipative Organization of DNA Oligomers for Transient Catalytic Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fuel&#8208;driven DNA self&#8208;assemblies with various transient functions such as catalytic activity are realized in an enzymatic reaction network of concurrent ATP&#8208;powered ligation and restriction of DNA species. The catalytic function with a temporal lifetime can be repeatedly activated by multiple additions of ATP fuel, allowing for fuel&#8208;dependent substrate cleavage.







Abstract
The development of synthetic non&#8208;equilibrium systems opens doors for man&#8208;made life&#8208;like materials. Yet, creating distinct transient functions from artificial fuel&#8208;driven structures remains a challenge. Building on our ATP&#8208;driven dynamic covalent DNA assembly in an enzymatic reaction network of concurrent ATP&#8208;powered ligation and restriction, we introduce ATP&#8208;fueled transient organization of functional subunits for various functions. The programmability of the ligation/restriction site allows to precisely organize multiple sticky&#8208;end&#8208;encoded oligo segments into double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA complexes. We demonstrate principles of ATP&#8208;driven organization into sequence&#8208;defined oligomers by sensing barcode&#8208;embedded targets with different defects. Furthermore, ATP&#8208;fueled DNAzymes for substrate cleavage are achieved by transiently ligating two DNAzyme subunits into a dsDNA complex, rendering ATP&#8208;fueled transient catalytic function.

         <dc:description>
Concise total syntheses of isorosthin&#8197;L and isoadenolin&#8197;I are described. This work highlights a convergent building&#8208;block&#8208;welding strategy for quick construction of an advanced intermediate bearing a quaternary center present in ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoids from two readily available building blocks.







Abstract
Total syntheses of two Isodon diterpenes, isorosthin&#8197;L and isoadenolin&#8197;I, are reported. The synthetic strategy features a quick assembly of two simple building blocks through a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction and a subsequent radical cyclization for efficient construction of a rather complex advanced intermediate bearing a quaternary stereocenter present in all Isodon diterpenes. Oxidative cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond in the cyclopentane enabled the conversion to a lactone moiety which is desired for the construction of the molecular skeleton through reductive coupling with an aldehyde carbonyl group.

         <title>Outstanding Multi&#8208;Photon Absorption at &#960;&#8208;Delocalizable Metallodendrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallodendrimers comprising bis(diphosphine)ruthenium units in a phenyleneethynylene&#8208;derived organic &#960;&#8208;framework are shown to display outstanding instantaneous multi&#8208;photon absorption. The key structural requirements for the rare five&#8208; and six&#8208;photon absorption seen with these compounds have been identified.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;photon absorption (MPA) has attracted interest for applications exploiting the tight spatial control of interaction volume and long wavelength excitation. However, a deficiency of molecules exhibiting higher&#8208;order nPA (n&#8208;photon absorption, n&gt;2) and a lack of structure&#8211;property studies to define the key structural characteristics needed to optimize higher&#8208;order MPA performance have hindered practical development. We herein report the syntheses of second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation metallodendrimers and assessment of their nonlinear absorption, together with those of zero&#8208; and first&#8208;generation analogues. We report the first 5PA and 6PA data for an organometallic. The largest dendrimer exhibits exceptional three&#8208;, four&#8208;, five&#8208; and six&#8208;photon absorption to femtosecond&#8208;pulsed light. The systematically varied compounds highlight the crucial role of metal&#8208;to&#8208;oligo(phenyleneethynylene) charge transfer in promoting outstanding MPA activity.

         <title>Isolation and Properties of the Long Elusive Deep Blue Soluble [K3{(NtBu)3S}2]. Cage Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deep blue radical [K3{(NtBu)3S}2]., containing S(NtBu)3&#8208;caps isosteric to SO32&#8722;, forms in the solid state an equilateral K3 triangle capped by two S(NtBu)3 anions. The EPR spectrum, recorded in solution at room temperature, shows 13 main lines (a=2.6&#8197;G), each split into seven lines (a&#8776;0.38&#8197;G), through the coupling of the unpaired electron with the six 14N nuclei (I=1) and the three central 39K/41K nuclei (I=3/2).







Abstract
The reaction of potassium metal with sulfurtriimide S(NtBu)3 (II) gives the long elusive deep blue cage radical [K3{(NtBu)3S}2]. (1_K) that crystallizes at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C from toluene solution. The subsequent physical characterization via X&#8208;ray structure analysis, UV/Vis&#8208;, and EPR spectroscopy from solution reveals the existence of one unpaired electron delocalized within the whole cage, i.e. coupling with the six nitrogen atoms, as well as the three potassium atoms caped by the two SN3 ligands.

         <title>Catalytic Transformation of PET and CO2 into High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and CO2, two chemical wastes that urgently need to be transformed in our environment, are converted simultaneously in a one&#8208;pot catalytic process. The process for dual&#8208;promoted conversion overcomes the original thermodynamic equilibrium limits of methanol synthesis and PET methanolysis, leading to a significantly enhanced yield of PET.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and CO2, two chemical wastes that urgently need to be transformed in the environment, are converted simultaneously in a one&#8208;pot catalytic process through the synergistic coupling of three reactions: CO2 hydrogenation, PET methanolysis and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) hydrogenation. More interestingly, the chemical equilibria of both reactions were shifted forward due to a revealed dual&#8208;promotion effect, leading to significantly enhanced PET depolymerization. The overall methanol yield from CO2 hydrogenation exceeded the original thermodynamic equilibrium limit since the methanol was in&#8197;situ consumed in the PET methanolysis. The degradation of PET by a stoichiometric ratio of methanol was significantly enhanced because the primary product, DMT was hydrogenated to dimethyl cyclohexanedicarboxylate (DMCD) or p&#8208;xylene (PX). This synergistic catalytic process provides an effective way to simultaneously recycle two wastes, polyesters and CO2, for producing high&#8208;value chemicals.

         <title>A Fluorescent Sensor for Quantitative Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Amyloid Fibril Assembly**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>

Applicable in single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy, AmyBlink&#8208;1 facilitates nanoscale imaging of a range of amyloid fibrils, achieving a resolution of 30&#8197;nm. Cluster&#8208;detection analyses of the super&#8208;resolution images enable the quantification of the nanoscale morphological features of intermediates formed at different times in the amyloid assembly cascade.







Abstract
Many soluble proteins can self&#8208;assemble into macromolecular structures called amyloids, a subset of which are implicated in a range of neurodegenerative disorders. The nanoscale size and structural heterogeneity of prefibrillar and early aggregates, as well as mature amyloid fibrils, pose significant challenges for the quantification of amyloid morphologies. We report a fluorescent amyloid sensor AmyBlink&#8208;1 and its application in super&#8208;resolution imaging of amyloid structures. AmyBlink&#8208;1 exhibits a 5&#8208;fold increase in ratio of the green (thioflavin T) to red (Alexa Fluor 647) emission intensities upon interaction with amyloid fibrils. Using AmyBlink&#8208;1, we performed nanoscale imaging of four different types of amyloid fibrils, achieving a resolution of &#8776;30&#8197;nm. AmyBlink&#8208;1 enables nanoscale visualization and subsequent quantification of morphological features, such as the length and skew of individual amyloid aggregates formed at different times along the amyloid assembly pathway.

         <title>Na4B8O9F10: A Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Fluorooxoborate with Unexpected Short Phase&#8208;Matching Wavelength Induced by Optimized Chromatic Dispersion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 10, March 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na4B8O9F10, the first non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystal with [BF4]&#8722; units among the reported metal&#8208;fluorooxoborate systems, was designed and synthesized. It features isolated [BF4]&#8722; groups and novel [B7O10F6]5&#8722; fundamental building blocks, and achieves an unexpected short &#955;PM of 240&#8197;nm induced by optimized chromatic dispersion with such a small birefringence (0.036@1064&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Exploring significant ultraviolet/deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is hindered by rigorous and contradictory requirements, especially, possessing a moderate optical birefringence to meet phase&#8208;matching (PM). Except for suitable birefringence, small chromatic dispersion is also crucial to blue&#8208;shift the PM wavelength. Here, the introduction of a fluorinated tetrahedral boron&#8208;centred chromophore strategy was proposed to optimize the chromatic dispersion. Herein, the [BF4]&#8722; unit with a large HOMO&#8211;LUMO band gap was introduced to the Na&#8722;B&#8722;O&#8722;F system and Na4B8O9F10 was designed and synthesized successfully for the first time. Na4B8O9F10 with an optimized chromatic dispersion can achieve a short second harmonic generation PM wavelength of 240&#8197;nm with a relatively small birefringence (0.036@1064&#8197;nm). Notably, Na4B8O9F10 is the first acentric crystal with [BF4]&#8722; units among the reported metal&#8211;fluorooxoborate systems, involving isolated [BF4]&#8722; and novel [B7O10F6]5&#8722; fundamental building blocks.

         <title>Characterization of Multifunctional and Non&#8208;stereoselective Oxidoreductase RubE7/IstO, Expanding the Functional Diversity of the Flavoenzyme  Superfamily</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes enable a broad range of redox transformations and generally act as monofunctional and stereoselective catalysts. Herein, we report the investigation of a multifunctional and non&#8208;stereoselective FMN&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase RubE7 from the rubrolone biosynthetic pathway. Our study outlines a single RubE7&#8208;catalysed sequential reduction of three spatially distinct bonds in a tropolone ring and a reversible double&#8208;bond reduction and dehydrogenation. The crystal structure of IstO (a RubE7 homologue) with 2.0 &#197; resolution reveals the location of the active site at the interface of two monomers, and the size of active site is large enough to permit both flipping and free rotation of the substrate, resulting in multiple nonselective reduction reactions. Molecular docking and site mutation studies demonstrate that His106 is oriented towards the substrate and is important for the reverse dehydrogenation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Atom Swapping on Aromatic Rings: Conversion from Phosphinine Pincer Metal Complexes to Metallabenzenes Triggered by O2 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a novel synthetic method for metallabenzene by swapping phosphorous atom in an aromatic phosphinine ring with transition metal fragments. Oxidation of a phosphine&#8208;phosphinine&#8208;phosphine pincer iridium complex by O  2  triggered replacement of the phosphorous atom of the phosphinine ring by an iridium fragment to afford iridabenzene. Dianionic rhodabenzene was also synthesized from a phosphinine rhodium complex by oxidation of the phosphorous atom followed by the subsequent reduction by metallic potassium. The aromaticity of newly synthesized irida&#8208; and rhoda&#8208;benzenes were evaluated experimentally and theoretically.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Full&#8208;Color Tuning of Organic Chromophore in a Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 2D Flexible MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing universal stimuli&#8208;responsive materials capable of emitting a broad spectrum of colors is highly desirable. Herein, we deliberately grafted a conformation&#8208;adaptable organic chromophore into the established coordination space of a flexible metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). In terms of the coupled structural transformations and the space confinement, the chromophore in the MOF matrix underwent well&#8208;regulated conformational changes under physical and chemical stimuli, simultaneously displaying thermo&#8208;, piezo&#8208;, and solvato&#8208;fluoro&#8208;chromism with color tunability over the visible range. Owing to the resilient nature and the reduced dimensionality of the selected coordination space, all three color modulations behaved in a sensitive and self&#8208;reversible manner, each following a linear correlation of the emission maximum with stimulus. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction of the variable&#8208;temperature structures and solvent&#8208;inclusion crystals elucidated the intricate color varying mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Azulene  is a non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic building block with unique chemical structure and  physicochemical  properties. By using the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthetic strategy, we synthesized three azulene&#8208;embedded [  n  ]helicenes (  [  n  ]AzHs  ,  n  = 5, 6 and 7), in which one terminal azulene subunit was fused with  n  &#8208;  2  benzene rings.  P&#8208;  and  M  &#8208;  enantiomers were observed in the packing diagrams of  [5]&#8208;  , and  [6]AzHs  . However,  P  &#8208;  and  M  &#8208;  [  7]AzHs  could be isolated by recrystallization of the racemic mixture. These  [  n  ]AzHs  were endowed with new properties by azulene moiety such as  low&#8208;lying first electric state (S  1  )  , small optical energy gap and  anti&#8208;  Kasha emission.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activatable Spherical Nucleic Acids for Conditional Control of Protein Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical control of protein activity represents a promising strategy for precise modulation of biological processes. Here, we report rationally designed, aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) capable of noninvasive and programmable regulation of target protein activity by deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. The photo&#8208;responsive SNAs are constructed by integrating activatable aptamer modules onto the surface of upconversion nanoparticles. The SNAs remains inert but can be remotely reverted by NIR light irradiation to capture the target protein and thus function as an enzyme inhibitor, while introduction of antidote DNA could further reverse their inhibition functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of the SNAs as controllable anticoagulants for the NIR light&#8208;triggered regulation of thrombin function. Ultimately, the availability of diverse aptamers would allow the design to regulate the activities of various proteins in a programmable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling Charge&#8208;Separation Mechanisms in Photocatalyst Particles by Spatially Resolved Surface Photovoltage Techniques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge separation is key to efficient photocatalytic solar energy conversion. The distribution of surface charge on photocatalysts can be identified and the driving forces of charge separation quantitatively determined at the nanoscale by the spatially resolved surface photovoltage technique. The identification of photocatalytic charge separation mechanisms will enable the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of solar energy offers a potential route to renewable energy, and its efficiency relies on effective charge separation in nanostructured photocatalysts. Understanding the charge&#8208;separation mechanism is key to improving the photocatalytic performance and this has now been enabled by advances in the spatially resolved surface photovoltage (SRSPV) method. In this Review we highlight progress made by SRSPV in mapping charge distributions at the nanoscale and determining the driving forces of charge separation in heterogeneous photocatalyst particles. We discuss how charge separation arising from a built&#8208;in electric field, diffusion, and trapping can be exploited and optimized through photocatalyst design.

     alt="Unraveling Charge-Separation Mechanisms in Photocatalyst Particles by Spatially Resolved Surface Photovoltage Techniques"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge separation is key to efficient photocatalytic solar energy conversion. The distribution of surface charge on photocatalysts can be identified and the driving forces of charge separation quantitatively determined at the nanoscale by the spatially resolved surface photovoltage technique. The identification of photocatalytic charge separation mechanisms will enable the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic conversion of solar energy offers a potential route to renewable energy, and its efficiency relies on effective charge separation in nanostructured photocatalysts. Understanding the charge-separation mechanism is key to improving the photocatalytic performance and this has now been enabled by advances in the spatially resolved surface photovoltage (SRSPV) method. In this Review we highlight progress made by SRSPV in mapping charge distributions at the nanoscale and determining the driving forces of charge separation in heterogeneous photocatalyst particles. We discuss how charge separation arising from a built-in electric field, diffusion, and trapping can be exploited and optimized through photocatalyst design. We also highlight the importance of asymmetric engineering of photocatalysts for effective charge separation. Finally, we provide an outlook on further opportunities that arise from leveraging these insights to guide the rational design of photocatalysts and advance the imaging technique to expand the knowledge of charge separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Enantiopure Sulfoxides by Concurrent Photocatalytic Oxidation and Biocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concurrent operation of chemical and biocatalytic reactions in one pot is still a challenging task, and, in particular for chemical photocatalysts, examples besides simple cofactor recycling systems are rare. However, especially due to the complementary chemistry that the two fields of catalysis promote, their combination in one pot has the potential to unlock intriguing, unprecedented overall reactivities. Herein we demonstrate a concurrent biocatalytic reduction and photocatalytic oxidation process. Specifically, the enantioselective biocatalytic sulfoxide reduction using (S)&#8208;selective methionine sulfoxide reductases was coupled to an unselective light&#8208;dependent sulfoxidation. Protochlorophyllide was established as a new green photocatalyst for the sulfoxidation. Overall, a cyclic deracemization process to produce nonracemic sulfoxides was achieved and the target compounds were obtained with excellent conversions (up to 91%) and superb optical purity (&gt;99% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Acridine Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) as Photocatalysts for Metallaphotocatalytic C&#8211;N Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are structurally tuneable, porous and crystalline polymers constructed through the covalent attachment of small organic building blocks as elementary units. Using the myriad of such building blocks, a broad spectrum of functionalities has been applied for COF syntheses for broad applications, including heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new family of porous and crystalline COFs using a novel acridine linker and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde derivatives bearing a variable number of hydroxy groups. With the broad absorption in the visible light region the COFs were applied as photocatalysts in metallaphotocatalytic C&#8211;N cross coupling. The fully &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine linked COF showed the highest activity, due to the increased charge separation upon irradiation. The COF showed good to excellent yields for several aryl bromides, good recyclability and even catalysed the organic transformation in presence of green light as energy source.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamline Sulfur Redox Reactions to Achieve Efficient Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering CoS2 as electron reservoirs overcomes the limited length of the electron diffusion tunnel over an insulating sulfur cathode and thus achieves fast reaction kinetics in sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. With the assistance of Co1 single atoms, this strategy provides streamlined redox paths, which reduce the formation of unstable polysulfides and enable stable sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
It is vital to dynamically regulate S activity to achieve efficient and stable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT/Na&#8722;S) batteries. Herein, we report using cobalt sulfide as an electron reservoir to enhance the activity of sulfur cathodes, and simultaneously combining with cobalt single atoms as double&#8208;end binding sites for a stable S conversion process. The rationally constructed CoS2 electron reservoir enables the straight reduction of S to short&#8208;chain sodium polysulfides (Na2S4) via a streamlined redox path through electron transfer. Meanwhile, cobalt single atoms synergistically work with the electron reservoir to reinforce the streamlined redox path, which immobilize in situ formed long&#8208;chain products and catalyze their conversion, thus realizing high S utilization and sustainable cycling stability. The as&#8208;developed sulfur cathodes exhibit a superior rate performance of 443&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high cycling capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 5000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Engineering MoOx/MXene Hole Transfer Layers for Unexpected Boosting Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene quantum dots were grafted on a BiVO4 substrate, then a MoOx layer combining an ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst was constructed as a promising model system of an integrated photoanode. The OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4 array not only achieves a current density of 5.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE, but also remarkably enhances photostability.







Abstract
The development of semiconductor photoanodes is of great practical interest for the realization of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, MXene quantum dots (MQD) were grafted on a BiVO4 substrate, then a MoOx layer by combining an ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) was constructed as an integrated photoanode. The OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4 array not only achieves a current density of 5.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), but also enhances photostability. From electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations, high PEC performance is ascribed to the incorporation of MoOx/MQD as hole transfer layers, retarding charge recombination, promoting hole transfer and accelerating water splitting kinetics. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work not only demonstrates the potential utilization of hole transfer layers, but also sheds light on rational design and fabrication of integrated photoanodes for feasible solar energy conversion.

         <dc:description>
A second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) self&#8208;checking molecule, LET&#8208;1052, was developed for visualizing intracellular viscosity change and immediately predicting therapeutic efficacy of tumour turn&#8208;on photothermal therapy.







Abstract
We present a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) self&#8208;checking molecule, LET&#8208;1052, for acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) turn&#8208;on photothermal therapy (PTT), followed by viscosity based therapeutic efficacy evaluation by itself in two independent channels, denoted as &#8220;self&#8208;checking&#8221; strategy. In acidic TME, LET&#8208;1052 was protonated and turned on NIR&#8208;II absorption for PTT under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, PTT&#8208;induced cellular death increases intracellular viscosity, which inhibited the intramolecular rotation of LET&#8208;1052, resulting in the enhancement of NIR&#8208;I fluorescence for real&#8208;time evaluation of PTT efficacy. After PTT of tumor&#8208;bearing mice for different periods of NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, NIR&#8208;I fluorescence in the tumor region showed positive correlation with tumor growth inhibition rate, demonstrating reliable and prompt prediction of PTT efficacy. The strategy may be expanded for instant evaluation of other therapeutic modalities for personalized medicine.

In acidic TME, LET-1052 was protonated and turned on NIR-II absorption for PTT under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, PTT-induced cellular death increases intracellular viscosity, which inhibited the intramolecular rotation of LET-1052, resulting in the enhancement of NIR-I fluorescence for real-time evaluation of PTT efficacy. After PTT of tumor-bearing mice for different periods of NIR-II laser irradiation, NIR-I fluorescence in the tumor region showed positive correlation with tumor growth inhibition rate, demonstrating reliable and prompt prediction of PTT efficacy. The strategy may be expanded for instant evaluation of other therapeutic modalities for personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luciferin Synthesis and Pesticide Detection by Luminescence Enzymatic Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic reactions were developed to convert 19 phenolic derivatives containing halogen, nitro, and methyl substituents into eight D&#8208;luciferin analogues, including the novel compounds 4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;D&#8208;luciferin and 5&#8242;&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;luciferin, which emit brighter and longer&#8208;wavelength light than the native D&#8208;luciferin. These reactions enabled the further development of luminescence technology for the sensitive detection of organophosphate pesticides.







Abstract
D&#8208;Luciferin (D&#8208;LH2), a substrate of firefly luciferase (Fluc), is important for a wide range of bioluminescence applications. This work reports a new and green method using enzymatic reactions (HELP, HadA Enzyme for Luciferin Preparation) to convert 19 phenolic derivatives to 8 D&#8208;LH2 analogues with &#8776;51&#8201;% yield. The method can synthesize the novel 5&#8242;&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 and 4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2, which have never been synthesized or found in nature. 5&#8242;&#8208;Methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 emits brighter and longer wavelength light than the D&#8208;LH2. Using HELP, we further developed LUMOS (Luminescence Measurement of Organophosphate and Derivatives) technology for in situ detection of organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including parathion, methyl parathion, EPN, profenofos, and fenitrothion by coupling the reactions of OPs hydrolase and Fluc. The LUMOS technology can detect these OPs at parts per trillion (ppt) levels. The method can directly detect OPs in food and biological samples without requiring sample pretreatment.

         <dc:description>
The bioinspired total synthesis of (+)&#8208;euphorikanin A, an intriguing and complex diterpenoid, was achieved by using an intramolecular nucleophile&#8208;catalyzed aldol lactonization of carboxylic acid&#8211;ketone to assemble the five&#8208;membered ring, a McMurry coupling to construct the seven&#8208;membered ring, and a biomimetic benzilic acid type rearrangement to form the bridged [3.2.1]&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactone moiety.

         <title>Unprecedented and Readily Tunable Photoluminescence from Aliphatic Quaternary Ammonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented intrinsic fluorescence/phosphorescence dual emissions are observed from the solids of aliphatic quaternary ammonium salts (QASs), with &#934;c and &lt;&#964;&gt;p of up to 14.7&#8201;% and 762&#8197;ms, respectively. By adjusting the alkyl chain length/counterions or through physical blending and grinding, multicolor emissions from blue to orange&#8208;red and white are realized, which enables advanced multimode anticounterfeiting for QASs.







Abstract
Compounds bearing aliphatic amines can be emissive under appropriate conditions. However, their ionized counterparts, namely, quaternary ammonium salts (QASs), which are widely used as phase&#8208;transfer catalysts, ionic liquids, disinfectants, and surfactants, are known as luminescence quenchers and considered nonemissive. Herein, unprecedented intrinsic fluorescence/phosphorescence dual emissions from various QASs are reported, which can be finely regulated by changing the excitation wavelength, alkyl chain length, counterion, and mechanical stimuli. The bright photoluminescence along with distinct afterglow and tunable multicolor emissions enables the application of QAS solids in advanced multimode anticounterfeiting. This finding refreshes the understanding of QASs and may inspire emerging applications based on the utilization of the intrinsic luminescences of QASs. Furthermore, it opens opportunities for the investigation of QAS&#8208;related processes and functions via a photophysical approach and affords strong implications for the fabrication of novel nonconventional luminophores.

         <title>Support&#8208;Free PEDOT:PSS Fibers as Multifunctional Microelectrodes for In Vivo Neural Recording and Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS fibers and multifunctional microelectrodes based on them, which are mechanically compliant with neural tissues and exhibit significantly reduced foreign body responses, are developed not only for spatiotemporal neurochemical and electrophysiological recording in the same extracellular microspace in neural microcircuits, but also for neuromodulation by current&#8208;regulated electrostimulation.







Abstract
In vivo microelectrodes are essential for neuroscience studies. However, development of microelectrodes with both flexibility and multifunctionality for recording chemical and electrical signals in the same extracellular microspace and modulating neural activity remains challenging. Here, we find that pure PEDOT:PSS fibers (i.e., support&#8208;free) exhibit high conductivity, fast heterogeneous electron transfer, and suitable charge storage and injection capabilities, and can thus directly act as microelectrodes not only for chemical and electrophysiological recording in the same extracellular microspace, but also for electromodulation of neural microcircuit activity. Moreover, the microelectrodes mechanically match with neural tissues, exhibiting less foreign body responses. Given the multifunctionality, flexibility, and biocompatibility, the support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based microelectrodes offer a new avenue to microelectrode technology for neuroscience research, diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>Static Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Images Reveal the Mechanism of Supramolecular Polymerization of an Oligopyridine on Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To be or not to be: The pressing question of the fundamental mechanism of two&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;assembly processes, namely that of thermodynamic or kinetic control, is demonstrated using the example of a donor&#8211;acceptor oligopyridine on graphite. A statistical analysis of STM images and DFT calculations suggest that there is a significant contribution of kinetics similar to copolymerization in bulk.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of a donor&#8211;acceptor bisterpyridine (BTP) equipped with an electron&#8208;rich carbazole unit is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)|solution interface. It is shown that two&#8208;dimensional crystals of supramolecular (co)polymers are formed by chain growth polymerization, which in turn can be described by copolymerization statistics. From concentration&#8208;dependent measurements, derived copolymerization parameters and DFT calculations, a mechanism for self&#8208;assembly is developed that suggests a kinetically driven polymerization process in combination with thermodynamically controlled crystallization.

From concentration-dependent measurements, derived copolymerization parameters and DFT calculations, a mechanism for self-assembly is developed that suggests a kinetically driven polymerization process in combination with thermodynamically controlled crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Azacorannulenophane Enabled by Strain&#8208;Induced 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane, an [n]cyclophane molecule bearing the largest polycyclic heteroarene, was synthesized via a strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization. The obtained azacorannulenophane shows unique structural and physical features, which provides important insights into the influence of &#960;&#8208;extension and strain from an aliphatic chain in polycyclic aromatic systems.







Abstract
The first example of a cyclophane bearing a nitrogen&#8208;containing buckybowl was synthesized via sequential 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. The key to the successful synthesis is the strain&#8208;induced 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of a polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide to the K&#8208;region of [7](2,7)pyrenophane. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended azacorannulenophane exhibits intriguing structural and physical properties, including unique variation of bowl depth, extraordinarily high&#8208;field chemical shifts in its 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum, a decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and a red shift in the absorption/emission spectrum, when compared to those of the parent azacorannulene. These characteristics are derived from both the &#960;&#8208;extension to the polycyclic aromatic system in the cyclophane structure and the increased curvature enforced by the seven&#8208;carbon aliphatic chain.

         <title>Alkylgold(III) Complexes Undergo Unprecedented Photo&#8208;Induced &#946;&#8208;Hydride Elimination and Reduction for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of alkylgold(III) complexes containing glucose moieties were identified to undergo unprecedented photo&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination and reduction, leading to cancer&#8208;selective cellular uptake, potent inhibition on thioredoxin reductase, up to 400&#8208;fold increase of cytotoxicity in vitro, and strong antiangiogenic and anti&#8208;tumor activities in two animal models.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally controllable activation of prodrugs within tumors is highly desirable for cancer therapy to minimize toxic side effects. Herein we report that stable alkylgold(III) complexes can undergo unprecedented photo&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, releasing alkyl ligands and forming gold(III)&#8208;hydride intermediates that could be quickly converted into bioactive [AuIII&#8722;S] adducts; meanwhile, the remaining alkylgold(III) complexes can photo&#8208;catalytically reduce [AuIII&#8722;S] into more bioactive AuI species. Such photo&#8208;reactivities make it possible to functionalize gold complexes on the auxiliary alkyl ligands without attenuating the metal&#8211;biomacromolecule interactions. As a result, the gold(III) complexes containing glucose&#8208;functionalized alkyl ligands displayed efficient and tumor&#8208;selective uptake; notably, after one&#8208; or two&#8208;photon activation, the complexes exhibited high thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition, potent cytotoxicity, and strong antiangiogenesis and antitumor activities in vivo.

         <title>Trapping&#8208;Enrichment Multi&#8208;dimensional Liquid Chromatography with On&#8208;Line Deuterated Solvent Exchange for Streamlined Structure Elucidation at the Microgram Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapping&#8208;Enrichment Deuterated Multidimensional&#8208;Liquid Chromatography (TE&#8208;Dt&#8208;mDLC) for rapid microgram&#8208;scale structure elucidation by NMR is introduced. This concept enables a streamlined chemical characterization of multicomponent mixtures (e.g. catalysis, natural products) while bypassing tedious drying processes with recoveries above 90&#8201;% using as little as a few micrograms of material.







Abstract
At the forefront of chemistry and biology research, development timelines are fast&#8208;paced and large quantities of pure targets are rarely available. Herein, we introduce a new framework, which is built upon an automated, online trapping&#8208;enrichment multi&#8208;dimensional liquid chromatography platform (TE&#8208;Dt&#8208;mDLC) that enables: 1)&#8197;highly efficient separation of complex mixtures in a first dimension (1D&#8208;UV); 2)&#8197;automated peak trapping&#8208;enrichment and buffer removal achieved through a sequence of H2O and D2O washes using an independent pump setup; and 3)&#8197;a second dimension separation (2D&#8208;UV&#8208;MS) with fully deuterated mobile phases and fraction collection to minimize protic residues for immediate NMR analysis while bypassing tedious drying processes and minimizing analyte degradation. Diverse examples of target isolation and characterization from organic synthesis and natural product chemistry laboratories are illustrated, demonstrating recoveries above 90&#8201;% using as little as a few micrograms of material.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO/CH4 Using a Metal&#8211;Organic &#8220;Soft&#8221; Coordination Polymer Gel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin&#8208;based coordination polymer gel (CPG) has been developed for visible/sunlight&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Notably, the product of CO2 reduction can be modulated by changing the sacrificial electron donor (SED). Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG upon photocatalytic CO2 reduction produces CO (3.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity in presence of TEA as SED), whereas in presence of both BNAH and TEA as SED, Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG produces CH4 (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity).







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a well&#8208;defined and astutely designed, low&#8208;molecular weight gelator (LMWG) based linker with a suitable metal ion is a promising method for preparing photocatalytically active coordination polymer gels. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and gelation behaviour of a tetrapodal LMWG based on a porphyrin core connected to four terpyridine units (TPY&#8208;POR) through amide linkages. The self&#8208;assembly of TPY&#8208;POR LMWG with RuII ions results in a Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR coordination polymer gel (CPG), with a nanoscroll morphology. Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG exhibits efficient CO2 photoreduction to CO (3.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial electron donor. Interestingly, in the presence of 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) with TEA as the sacrificial electron donor, the 8e&#8722;/8H+ photoreduction of CO2 to CH4 is realized with &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity (6.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). In CPG, porphyrin acts as a photosensitizer and covalently attached [Ru(TPY)2]2+ acts as a catalytic center as demonstrated by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Further, combining information from the in situ DRIFT spectroscopy and DFT calculation, a possible reaction mechanism for CO2 reduction to CO and CH4 was outlined.

         <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Reveals Molecular Species in Carbon Nanodot Samples Disclosing Flaws</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The purification of carbon nanodots is a critical aspect in their preparation, especially for syntheses involving molecular precursors. Indeed, the presence of organic molecules in the final sample can lead to mistaken conclusions regarding their properties. In this work, NMR is proven to be an essential technique to verify the purification of carbon nanodots, thanks to its ability to disclose molecular species.







Abstract
Carbon nanodots are currently one of the hot topics in the nanomaterials world, due to their accessible synthesis and promising features. However, the purification of these materials is still a critical aspect, especially for syntheses involving molecular precursors. Indeed, the presence of unreacted species or small organic molecules formed during solvothermal treatments can affect the properties of the synthesized nanomaterials. To illustrate the extreme importance of this issue, we present two case studies in which insufficient purification results in misleading conclusions regarding the chiral and fluorescent properties of the investigated materials. Key to identify molecular species is the use of nuclear magnetic resonance, which proves to be an effective tool. Our work highlights the need to include nuclear magnetic resonance as a standard characterization technique for carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, to minimize the risk of observing properties that arise from molecular species, rather than the target carbon nanodots.

         <title>Overturned Loading of Inert CeO2 to Active Co3O4 for Unusually Improved Catalytic Activity in Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique overturned loading strategy for the preparation of Co3O4 nanocomposites by loading inert CeO2 onto active Co3O4 is described. Such a design generates abundant surface oxygen vacancies neighboring Co and Ce as new active sites, resulting in unusually improved catalytic activity in both Fenton&#8208;like reaction and beyond, for instance, CO oxidation.







Abstract
In the past decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to improving the catalytic activity of nanocomposites by either exposing more active sites or regulating the interaction between the support and nanoparticles while keeping the structure of the active sites unchanged. Here, we report the fabrication of a Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 nanocomposite via overturning the loading direction, i.e., loading an inert CeO2 support onto active Co3O4 nanoparticles. The resultant catalyst exhibits unexpectedly higher activity and stability in peroxymonosulfate&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reactions than its analog prepared by the traditional impregnation method. Abundant oxygen vacancies (Ov with a Co&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ov&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ce structure instead of Co&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ov) are generated as new active sites to facilitate the cleavage of the peroxide bond to produce SO4.&#8722; and accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step, i.e., the desorption of SO4.&#8722;, affording improved activity. This strategy is a new direction for boosting the catalytic activity of nanocomposite catalysts in various scenarios, including environmental remediation and energy applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Directed Chemical Modification of Amyloid by Polyoxometalates for Inhibition of Protein Misfolding and Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thiazolidinethione (TZ) modified Wells&#8211;Dawson polyoxometalate (POMD) derivative (POMD&#8208;TZ) has been synthesized which can covalently modify &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) site&#8208;selectively at Lys16. The inhibitory effect of POMD&#8208;TZ on A&#946; aggregation is much stronger than that of POMD, thus demonstrating the superiority of the chemical post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) method for the modification of traditional A&#946; inhibitors.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of protein can significantly change protein conformation and function. Inspired by the natural PTM, we present a new approach to inhibit amyloid aggregation by chemical PTM modification. Polyoxometalates (POMs) were used as examples of inhibitors of &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) aggregation to illustrate the chemical PTM method. After the POMs were modified with thiazolidinethione (TZ), the resulting POMD&#8208;TZ acted as a chemical PTM agent and could covalently modify A&#946; site&#8208;selectively at Lys16. Multiple biophysical techniques and biochemical assays have been employed to show the superiority of the chemical PTM method compared to traditional A&#946; inhibitors. Since A&#946; oligomers are more cytotoxic, we further functionalized POMD&#8208;TZ with an A&#946;&#8208;targeted peptide and a fluorescent probe to obtain an &#8220;A&#946; oligomer sensitive&#8221; probe. The use of PTM agents for the site&#8208;directed chemical modification of proteins provides a new way to regulate amyloid aggregation.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene Stabilized Disilicon(0) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene ligated disilicon(0) complex was synthesized and characterized, which revealed a Si0=Si0 double bond with significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; bonding. Its reaction with phenylacetylene gave the structurally interesting silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene and reveals new aspects of low&#8208;valent silicon chemistry.







Abstract
Synthesis and reactivity of disilicon(0) complexes are of fundamental and application importance. Herein, we report the development of an N&#8208;heterocyclic imino&#8208;substituted silylene (1), which has strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability and is significantly sterically hindered. The one&#8208;pot reaction of this silylene with [IPr&#8594;SiCl2] (IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and KC8 (2&#8197;equiv) in THF at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C leads to a silylene&#8208;ligated disilicon(0) complex (2), isolated as red crystals in 60&#8201;% yield. Characterization data and DFT calculations show that the trans&#8208;bent Si4 skeleton in 2 features a Si0=Si0 double bond with significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; bonding and one lone pair of electrons on each of these two Si0 atoms. Complex 2 reacts readily with phenylacetylene, producing a structurally intriguing silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo&#8208;[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene (3), and revealing new aspects of low&#8208;valent silicon chemistry.

This work presents the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight P&#948;CL that was capable to recycle back to pristine monomer with an almost quantitative yield (&#8776;99&#8201;%). Well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers with excellent mechanical properties can be easily prepared by sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide.

The development of chemically recyclable polymers presents the most appealing solution to address the plastics&#8217; end&#8208;of&#8208;use problem. Despite the recent advancements, it is highly desirable to develop chemically recyclable polymers from commercially available monomers to avoid the costly and time&#8208;consuming commercialization. In this contribution, we achieve the controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;sourced &#948;&#8208;caprolactone (&#948;CL) using strong base/urea binary catalysts. The obtained P&#948;CL is capable of chemical recycling to &#948;CL in an almost quantitative yield by thermolysis. Sequential ROP of &#948;CL and l&#8208;lactide (l&#8208;LA) affords well&#8208;defined PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA triblock copolymers, which behave as thermoplastic elastomers with excellent elastic recovery, tensile strength and ultimate elongation. The upcycling of PLLA&#8208;b&#8208;P&#948;CL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA to recover ethyl lactate and &#948;CL with high yields is achieved by refluxing with ethanol and then distillation under reduced pressure.

         <title>Oriented Nanoarchitectonics of Bacteriorhodopsin for Enhancing ATP Generation in a FoF1&#8208;ATPase&#8208;Based Assembly System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coassembly of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and ATP synthase into an artificial biomimetic system has enabled a cascade reaction under illumination and the synthesis of ATP. The approach based on layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer electrostatic adsorption results in BR maintaining a highly uniform orientation with a high loading capacity and enhanced phosphorylation. The introduction of optically matched quantum dots led to the ATP production being further enhanced to 2.11 times.







Abstract
Energy conversion plays an important role in the metabolism of photosynthetic organisms. Improving energy transformation by promoting a proton gradient has been a great challenge for a long time. In the present study, we realize a directional proton migration through the construction of oriented bacteriorhodopsin (BR) microcapsules coated by FoF1&#8208;ATPase molecular motors through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) assembly. The changes in the conformation of BR under illumination lead to proton transfer in a radial direction, which generates a higher proton gradient to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by FoF1&#8208;ATPase. Furthermore, to promote the photosynthetic activity, optically matched quantum dots were introduced into the artificial coassembly system of BR and FoF1&#8208;ATPase. Such a design creates a new path for the use of light energy.

         <title>Unmasking the Critical Role of the Ordering Degree of Bimetallic Nanocatalysts on Oxygen Reduction Reaction by In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical role of the ordering degree of AuCu bimetallic catalysts were studied in&#8197;situ by a shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy satellite strategy and the molecular reaction mechanism is revealed.







Abstract
Precise control and accurate understanding of the ordering degree of bimetallic nanocatalysts (BNs) are challenging yet crucial to acquire advanced materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). AuCu BNs with various ordering degrees were synthesized to evaluate the influence of ordering degree on the ORR at a molecular level using in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. The activity of AuCu BNs was improved by over 2&#8197;times after a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition, making the performance of highly ordered AuCu BNs exceed that of benchmark Pt/C. Direct Raman spectroscopic evidence of key intermediate (*OH) demonstrates that the active site is the combination site of Au and Cu. Moreover, two distinct *OH species are observed on the ordered and disordered structure, and the ordered site is more beneficial for ORR due to its lower affinity to *OH. This work deepens the understanding on the important role of ordering degree on BNs and enables the design of improved catalysts.

         <title>The Electronic Origin of Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxygenic Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differential protein electrostatics enable excitation of the Photosystem&#8208;II reaction center chlorophyll&#8211;pheophytin pigment pairs by far&#8208;red light along two distinct, conformation&#8208; and wavelength&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;transfer pathways.







Abstract
Photosystem&#8208;II uses sunlight to trigger charge separation and catalyze water oxidation. Intrinsic properties of chlorophyll a pigments define a natural &#8220;red limit&#8221; of photosynthesis at &#8776;680&#8197;nm. Nevertheless, charge separation can be triggered with far&#8208;red photons up to 800&#8197;nm, without altering the nature of light&#8208;harvesting pigments. Here we identify the electronic origin of this remarkable phenomenon using quantum chemical and multiscale simulations on a native Photosystem&#8208;II model. We find that the reaction center is preorganized for charge separation in the far&#8208;red region by specific chlorophyll&#8211;pheophytin pairs, potentially bypassing the light&#8208;harvesting apparatus. Charge transfer can occur along two distinct pathways with one and the same pheophytin acceptor (PheoD1). The identity of the donor chlorophyll (ChlD1 or PD1) is wavelength&#8208;dependent and conformational dynamics broaden the sampling of the far&#8208;red region by the two charge&#8208;transfer states. The two pathways rationalize spectroscopic observations and underpin designed extensions of the photosynthetically active radiation limit.

         <title>Chemical Defect&#8208;Driven Response on Graphene&#8208;Based Chemiresistors for Sub&#8208;ppm Ammonia Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent functionalization of graphene leads to excellent sensitivity for ammonia. Quick response and recovery of the functionalized graphene layers are observed, and a sensitivity benchmarking with other graphene chemiresistors shows a superior sensitivity in the sub&#8208;ppm range.







Abstract
Gas sensors are essential in several fields and, in general, features such as high sensitivity, quick response, and fast recovery are required, along with low power consumption and low cost. Graphene is considered a promising material for gas sensing applications, its functionalization often being a requisite. In the present study, we developed competitive and promising gas sensors for ammonia detection. Interestingly, we present an easy and efficient method to functionalize graphene by using diazonium chemistry with different functional groups. Moreover, we prove the superior sensing capability of our covalently modified graphene layers. These experimental data have been consistently interpreted by theoretical calculations, which reveal a defect&#8208;driven sensor's response to ammonia. These results open the possibility of a comprehensive design and use of these graphene&#8208;based sensors in real applications.

         <title>Molecular Catalysts for Reductive Homocoupling of CO2 towards C2+ Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds via reductive homocoupling offers the possibility to transform renewable energy into chemical energy carriers and thereby create &#8220;carbon&#8208;neutral&#8221; fuels or other valuable products. While in the major part of the available studies heterogeneous metallic catalysts were employed, the use of molecular catalysts is still underexplored. However, several works have already demonstrated the great potential of the molecular approach, i.e. the possibility for gaining a deep mechanistic understanding and a more precise control of the product selectivity. This review summarizes the recent progress in both thermo&#8208; and electrochemical reductive homocoupling of CO2 toward C2+ products mediated by molecular catalysts. In addition, reductive CO homocoupling is discussed as a model for further conversion of intermediates from CO2 reduction, which may serve as a source of inspiration for developing novel molecular catalysts in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling of the ADP&#8208;Ribosylome in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Posttranslational modification (PTM) with ADP&#8208;ribose and poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD  +  ) as substrate is involved in the regulation of numerous cellular pathways in eukaryotes, notably the response to DNA damage caused by cellular stress. Nevertheless, due to intrinsic properties of NAD  +  e.g., high polarity and associated poor cell passage, these PTMs are difficult to characterize in cells. Here, two new NAD  +  derivatives are presented, which carry either a fluorophore or an affinity tag and, in combination with developed methods for mild cell delivery, allow studies in living human cells. We show that this approach allows not only the imaging of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living cells but also the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of cellular adaptation by protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation as a consequence of environmental changes such as H  2  O  2  &#8208;induced oxidative stress or the effect of the approved anti&#8208;cancer drug olaparib. Our results therefore pave the way for further functional and clinical studies of the ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteome in living cells in health and disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Separation of Oppositely Charged Polymers Regulates Bioinspired Silicification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, simple organisms evolved mechanisms to form intricate biosilica nanostructures, far exceeding current synthetic manufacturing. Based on the properties of extracted biomacromolecules, polycation&#8208;polyanion pairs were suggested as moderators of biosilica formation. However, the chemical principles of this polymer&#8208;induced silicification remain unclear. Here, we used a biomimetic polycation&#8208;polyanion system to study polymer&#8208;induced silicification. We demonstrate that it is the polymer phase separation process, rather than silica&#8208;polymer interactions, which controls silica precipitation. Since ionic strength controls this electrostatic phase separation, it can be used to tune the morphology and structure of the precipitates. In situ cryo electron microscopy highlights the pivotal role of the hydrated polymer condensates in this process. These results pave the road for developing nanoscale morphologies of bioinspired silica based on the chemistry of liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free and metal&#8208;containing molecular trefoil knots are fascinating ensembles that are usually covalently assembled, the latter requiring the rational design of di&#8208; or multidentate/multipodal ligands as connectors. In this work, we describe the self&#8208;assembly of pentadecanuclear Au  I  trefoil knots [Au  15  (C&#8801;CR)  15  ] from monoalkynes HC&#8801;CR (R = 9,9&#8208;X  2  &#8208;fluorenyl with X =  n  Bu,  n  &#8208;hexyl) and [Au  I  (THT)Cl]. Hetero&#8208;bimetallic counterparts [Au  9  M  6  (C&#8801;CR)  15  ] (M = Cu/Ag) were self&#8208;assembled by reactions of [Au  15  (C&#8801;CR)  15  ] with [Cu(MeCN)  4  ]  +  /AgNO  3  and HC&#8801;CR. The type of pentadecanuclear trefoil knots described herein is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 2D NMR and HR&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS. [Au  9  Cu  6  (C&#8801;CR)  15  ] is relatively stable in hexane; its excited state properties were investigated. DFT calculations revealed that non&#8208;covalent metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;ligand interactions, together with longer alkyl chain&#8208;strengthened inter&#8208;ligand dispersion interactions, govern the stability of the trefoil knot structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Overall Water Splitting by a Zirconium&#8208;Doped TaON&#8208;Based Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;powered&#160;one&#8208;step&#8208;excitation overall water splitting (OWS) using semiconducting materials is a simple means of achieving scalable and sustainable hydrogen production.  While tantalum oxynitride (TaON) is one of the few photocatalysts capable of promoting OWS via single&#8208;step visible light excitation, the efficiency of this process remains extremely poor. The present work employed 15 nm amorphous Ta  2  O  5  &#8226;3.3H  2  O nanoparticles as a new precursor together with Zr doping and an optimized nitridation duration to synthesize a TaON&#8208;based photocatalyst with reduced particle sizes and low defect densities. Upon loading with Ru/Cr  2  O  3  /IrO  2  cocatalysts, this material exhibited stoichiometric water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen, with an order of magnitude improvement in efficiency.  Our findings demonstrate the importance of inventing/selecting the appropriate synthetic precursor and of defect control for fabricating active OWS photocatalysts.</dc:description>

Emission spectroscopy is used to explore photophysical properties. Two broad features in the high&#8211; and low&#8211;energy regions are associated with the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the gold entities, respectively. Temperature&#8211;dependent luminescence measurements show that the emission color can be tuned from blue to green  via  cyan and white. Hence, these complexes can act as a colorimetric thermometer.

         <title>Short Guanidinium&#8208;Functionalized Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s Displaying Potent Therapeutic Efficacy on Drug&#8208;Resistant Fungal Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New antifungals are urgently needed to combat invasive fungal infections, due to limited types of available antifungal drugs and frequently encountered side effects, as well as the quick emergence of drug&#8208;resistance. We previously developed amine&#8208;pendent poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POXs) as synthetic mimics of host defense peptides (HDPs) to have antibacterial properties, but with poor antifungal activity. Hereby, we report the finding of short guanidinium&#8208;pendent POXs, inspired by cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, as synthetic mimics of HDPs to display potent antifungal activity, superior mammalian cells vs fungi selectivity, and strong therapeutic efficacy in treating local and systemic fungal infections. Moreover, the unique antifungal mechanism of fungal cell membrane penetration and organelle disruption explains the insusceptibility of POXs to antifungal resistance.   The    easy synthesis and structural diversity of POXs imply their potential as a class of promising antifungal agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric a&#8208;Allylation of Glycinate with Switched Chemoselectivity Enabled by Customized Bifunctional Pyridoxal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing  to the strong nucleophilicity of the NH  2  group, free&#8208;NH  2  glycinates react with MBH acetates to usually deliver N&#8208;allylated products even in the absence of catalysts. Without protection of the NH  2  group, chiral pyridoxal catalysts bearing an amide side chain at the C3 position of the naphthyl ring switched the chemoselectivity of the gylcinates from intrinsic N&#8208;allylation to a&#8208;C allylation. The reaction formed chiral multisubstituted glutamic acid esters as S  N  2'&#8208;S  N  2' products in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 86% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, 97% ee). As compared to pyridoxal catalysts bearing an amide side arm at the C2 position, the pyridoxals in this study have a bigger catalytic cavity to enable effective activation of larger electrophiles, such as MBH acetates and related intermediates. The reaction is proposed to proceed via a cooperative bifunctional catalysis pathway, which accounts for the high level of diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol of the pyridoxal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Design, Synthesis, and Photochemistry of Cy7PPG, an Efficient NIR&#8208;Activated Photolabile Protecting Group for Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photolabile Protecting Groups (PPGs) are molecular tools used, e.g., in photopharmacology for the activation of drugs with light, enabling spatiotemporal control over their potency. Yet, red&#8208;shifting of PPG activation wavelengths into the NIR range, which penetrates the deepest in tissue, has often yielded inefficient or insoluble molecules, hindering the use of PPGs in the clinic. To solve this problem, we report herein a novel concept in PPG design, by transforming clinically&#8208;applied NIR&#8208;dyes with suitable molecular orbital configurations into new NIR&#8208;PPGs using computational approaches. Using this method, we demonstrate how Cy7, a class of NIR dyes possessing ideal properties (NIR&#8208;absorption, high molecular absorptivity, excellent aqueous solubility) can be successfully converted into Cy7&#8208;PPG. We report a facile synthesis towards Cy7PPG from accessible precursors and confirm its excellent properties as the most redshifted oxygen&#8208;independent NIR&#8208;PPG to date (&#955;  max  = 746 nm).</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Damage&#8208;Response&#8208;Targeting Mitochondria&#8208;Activated Multifunctional Prodrug Strategy for Self&#8208;Defensive Tumor Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A new multifunctional construct M1 combining a floxuridine (FUDR) with a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor is presented. M1 targets the DNA damage response of cancer cells by inhibiting the PP2A activity and inducing mitochondrial and nucleus DNA damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis.







Abstract
We report a novel multifunctional construct, M1, designed explicitly to target the DNA damage response in cancer cells. M1 contains both a floxuridine (FUDR) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor combined with a GSH&#8208;sensitive linker. Further conjugation of the triphenylphosphonium moiety allows M1 to undergo specific activation in the mitochondria, where mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptosis is observed. Moreover, M1 has enormous effects on genomic DNA ascribed to FUDR's primary function of impeding DNA/RNA synthesis combined with diminishing PP2A&#8208;activated DNA repair pathways. Importantly, mechanistic studies highlight the PP2A obtrusion in FUDR/5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) therapy and underscore the importance of its inhibition to harbor therapeutic potential. HCT116 cell xenograft&#8208;bearing mice that have a low response rate to 5&#8208;FU show a prominent effect with M1, emphasizing the importance of DNA damage response targeting strategies using tumor&#8208;specific microenvironment&#8208;activatable systems.

         <title>Pure Boric Acid Does Not Show Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For over 100&#8197;years, boric acid (BA) has been known to serve as an excellent glass matrix for luminescent chromophores. However, in contrast to a recent report, pure BA does NOT display RTP when excited at 280&#8197;nm, and it is demonstrated experimentally that it does not absorb at &#955;&gt;200&#8197;nm. Theoretical studies further reveal that pure BA cannot absorb at &#955;&gt;175&#8197;nm. Thus, an impurity must be responsible for the apparent RTP in the previous report.







Abstract
Boric acid (BA) has been used as a transparent glass matrix for optical materials for over 100&#8197;years. However, recently, apparent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from BA (crystalline and powder states) was reported (Zheng et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 9500) when irradiated at 280&#8197;nm under ambient conditions. We suspected that RTP from their BA sample was induced by an unidentified impurity. Our experimental results show that pure BA synthesized from B(OMe)3 does not luminesce in the solid state when irradiated at 250&#8211;400&#8197;nm, while commercial BA indeed (faintly) luminesces. Our theoretical calculations show that neither individual BA molecules nor aggregates would absorb light at &gt;175&#8197;nm, and we observe no absorption of solid pure BA experimentally at &gt;200&#8197;nm. Therefore, it is not possible for pure BA to be excited at &gt;250&#8197;nm even in the solid state. Thus, pure BA does not display RTP, whereas trace impurities can induce RTP.

         <title>Local Symmetry Breaking Suppresses Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The globally rock&#8208;salt material AgSbSe2 is found to be locally distorted due to the off&#8208;centering of Sb atoms driven by a stereochemcally active 5s2 lone pair of electrons. This local off&#8208;centering plays an important role in suppressing the thermal propagation, resulting in ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in AgSbSe2.







Abstract
Understanding the correlations of both the local and global structures with lattice dynamics is critical for achieving low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) in crystalline materials. Herein, we demonstrate local cationic off&#8208;centring within the global rock&#8208;salt structure of AgSbSe2 by using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis and unravel the origin of its ultralow &#954;lat&#8776;0.4&#8197;W&#8201;mK&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K. The cations are locally off&#8208;centered along the crystallographic 
 direction by about &#8776;0.2&#8197;&#197;, which averages out as the rock&#8208;salt structure on the global scale. Phonon dispersion obtained by density functional theory (DFT) shows weak instabilities that cause local off&#8208;centering distortions within an anharmonic double&#8208;well potential. The local structural distortion arises from the stereochemically active 5s2 lone pairs of Sb. Our findings open an avenue for understanding how the local structure influences the phonon transport and facilitates the design of next&#8208;generation crystalline materials with tailored thermal properties.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed ON&#8208;OFF Switchable Hydrogenation Using a Molecular Shuttle Based on a [2]Rotaxane with a Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular shuttle based on a [2]rotaxane with a phosphine ligand has been applied to the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid esters and aryl enamides. The hydrogenation can be switched ON/OFF efficiently by adjusting the movement of the rotaxane wheels with acid/base. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the formation of inactive RhIII&#8208;hydride species might be the reason for shutdown of the reaction.







Abstract
A novel pH&#8208;responsive molecular shuttle based on a [2]rotaxane with a phosphine ligand has been designed and synthesized. In the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid esters and aryl enamides, ON/OFF&#8208;switchable catalysis was accomplished with high ON/OFF ratios by adjusting the movements of the rotaxane wheels located at the catalyst terminals with acid/base. Mechanistic studies using NMR spectroscopy and quasi in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that RhIII&#8208;hydride species are possibly formed in a H2 atmosphere when the catalyst is in the OFF state. During the reaction, a heterolytic activation of dihydrogen occurs by the interlocked rotaxane dibenzylamine and RhI catalytic center acting as a frustrated Lewis pair. Subsequent homolytic splitting of dihydrogen with the newly formed RhI&#8208;hydride species generates RhIII&#8208;hydride species. These findings show that a substrate&#8208;selective hydrogenation can be achieved by using the OFF&#8208;state catalyst.

         <title>A Calix[3]acridan&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Cocrystal Exhibiting Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials has been developed, which has led to the convenient synthesis of a new kind of macrocycle, namely calix[3]acridan. The host&#8211;guest cocrystal formed from calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70&#8201;% as a result of intense intermolecular charge transfer (ICT).







Abstract
A supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials through host&#8211;guest charge transfer interactions was proposed. Consequently, a new class of macrocycle namely calix[3]acridan was conveniently synthesized in 90&#8201;% yield. The host&#8211;guest cocrystal formed by calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF properties due to intense intermolecular charge transfer interactions. Moreover, the spatially separated highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital resulted in a very small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap of 0.014&#8197;eV and hence guaranteed an efficient reverse intersystem crossing for TADF. Especially, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70&#8201;% was achieved, and it represents the highest value among the reported intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor TADF materials.

         <title>Crystalline Neutral Diboron Analogues of Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of isoelectronic cyclopropane analogues, namely NHC&#8208;stabilized diboriranes is described. Featuring van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry and highly strained B2C rings, the diborirane derivatives readily undergo ring&#8208;opening and oxidative functionalization, demonstrating potential for future applications in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Although Schleyer's computations in 1979 predicted that the ground state of the parent diborirane features a planar&#8208;tetracoordinate carbon atom (anti van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry), this work demonstrates that substitution of C coupled with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) coordination provides access to isolable diborirane derivatives 3 and 4 with van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry. Species 3 and 4 are isoelectronic with cyclopropane and the highly strained B2C rings feature 2c&#8211;2e bent &#963; bonds. Consequently, the B&#8722;B and B&#8722;C bonds in 3 are cleaved in the presence of hydride, proton, and chalcogens. The former two reactions gave NHC&#8208;coordinated fluorenyldihydridoborane 5 and dichlorofluorenylborane 6, respectively, whereas the latter transformations afforded novel thiaborirane 8 and selenaborirane 9. In addition, transfer hydrogenation of 3 with ammonia borane (H3N&#8901;BH3) led to the formation of (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diborane 7 via selective cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. These reactivities show potential for their future application in organic synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of isoelectronic cyclopropane analogues, namely NHC-stabilized diboriranes is described. Featuring van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry and highly strained B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C rings, the diborirane derivatives readily undergo ring-opening and oxidative functionalization, demonstrating potential for future applications in organic synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Schleyer's computations in 1979 predicted that the ground state of the parent diborirane features a planar-tetracoordinate carbon atom (anti van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry), this work demonstrates that substitution of C coupled with N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) coordination provides access to isolable diborirane derivatives &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry. Species &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; are isoelectronic with cyclopropane and the highly strained B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C rings feature 2c&#8211;2e bent &#963; bonds. Consequently, the B&#8722;B and B&#8722;C bonds in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are cleaved in the presence of hydride, proton, and chalcogens. The former two reactions gave NHC-coordinated fluorenyldihydridoborane &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and dichlorofluorenylborane &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, respectively, whereas the latter transformations afforded novel thiaborirane &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; and selenaborirane &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;. In addition, transfer hydrogenation of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; with ammonia borane (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8901;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) led to the formation of (&#956;-hydrido)diborane &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; via selective cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. These reactivities show potential for their future application in organic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Degradable Vinylic Polymer&#8208;Based Latexes via Aqueous Radical Emulsion Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulsion copolymerization of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) with either styrene, n&#8208;butyl acrylate or a mixture of both was carried out in water using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. Stable waterborne particles of vinylic polymers (red) bearing cleavable thioester units (blue) along the chains were obtained. The polymer chains were degraded to oligomers using a strong base (1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) or isopropylamine.







Abstract
Aqueous emulsion copolymerizations of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) were performed with n&#8208;butyl acrylate (BA), styrene (S) and a combination of both. In all cases, stable latexes were obtained in less than two hours under conventional conditions; that is in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) used as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. A limited solubility of DOT in BA was observed compared to S, yielding to a more homogeneous integration of DOT units in the PS latex. In both cases, the copolymer could be easily degraded under basic conditions. Emulsion terpolymerization between DOT, BA and S allowed us to produce stable latexes not only composed of degradable chains but also featuring a broad range of glass transition temperatures.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Influenced Fragmentations in Free&#8208;Standing Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Hydrophobicity Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pre&#8208;synthetically controlled framework growth strategy to tune the hydrophobicity of the 3D&#8208;COF membranes without changing the building blocks or post&#8208;synthetic modifications is demonstrated. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane was utilized for the demulsification of an oil&#8211;water mixture.







Abstract
The ordered open organic frameworks membranes are attractive candidates for flow&#8208;assisted molecular separations. The physicochemical properties of such membranes mostly depend on their selectively chosen functional building blocks. In this work, we have introduced a novel concept of functional switchability of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) membranes through a simple solvent&#8208;influenced fragmentation method. This room&#8208;temperature interfacial synthesis provides free&#8208;standing 3D&#8208;COF membranes with distinct physicochemical properties from the same building monomers. Notably, the change of solvent from chloroform to ethyl acetate switches the membrane property from hydrophilic (water contact angle 60&#176;) to hydrophobic (water contact angle 142&#176;) nature. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane selectively passes oil molecules from an oil&#8211;water emulsion with a gravitational flux of 1536&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Microscopic Mechanism of the Heat&#8208;Induced Blueshift in Phosphors and a Logarithmic Energy Dependence on the Nearest Dopant&#8211;Vacancy Distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A logarithmic relation governing the structures of phosphors was revealed together with an electron&#8211;phonon coupling mechanism explaining the heat&#8208;induced blueshift (HIB) phenomenon by using a high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles approach. The results shed new light on understanding the general structure problems of defect&#8208;containing systems, and the heat&#8208;induced phenomena of phosphors.







Abstract
Heat&#8208;induced blueshift (HIB) observed in many luminescent materials is a puzzling phenomenon that has remained unexplained for decades. By using the high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles calculations and energy&#8208;screening techniques, we generated a number of model structures for five phosphors, RbLi[Li3SiO4]2:Eu2+, Na[Li3SiO4]:Eu2+, K[Li3SiO4]:Eu2+, Sr[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+, and Ca[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+. Our analyses suggest, to a first approximation, a logarithmic energy dependence on the nearest distance between the dopant and the metal&#8208;cation vacancy. By identifying the 
 transition energies from the electronic structures calculated for the screened model structures, we show that the vibration of the Eu2+ ion lying in an asymmetric and anharmonic potential well couples with the electronic states, leading to their HIB phenomena.

         <title>Advancing the Development of Recyclable Aromatic Polyesters by Functionalization and Stereocomplexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploitation of epoxides as building blocks enabled the preparation of a series of recyclable aromatic polyesters with functionalizable moieties, which has driven a wide array of post&#8208;polymerization modifications toward access of value&#8208;added materials. Stereocomplexed polymers were formed with enhanced thermal stability and crystallinity, and random copolymers displayed polyolefin&#8208;like mechanical performance.







Abstract
The development of innovative synthetic polymer systems to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer's depolymerizability and performance properties is in high demand for advanced material applications and sustainable development. In this contribution, we prepared a class of aromatic cyclic esters (M1&#8211;M5) from thiosalicylic acid and epoxides by facile one&#8208;pot synthesis. Ring&#8208;opening polymerization of Ms afforded aromatic polyesters P(M)s with high molecular weights and narrow dispersities. The physical and mechanical properties of P(M)s can be modulated by stereocomplexation and regulation of the side&#8208;chain flexibility of the polymers, ultimately achieving high&#8208;performance properties such as high thermal stability and crystallinity (Tm up to 209&#8201;&#176;C), as well as polyolefin&#8208;like high mechanical strength, ductility, and toughness. Furthermore, the functionalizable moieties of P(M)s have driven a wide array of post&#8208;polymerization modifications toward access to value&#8208;added materials. More importantly, the P(M)s were able to selectively depolymerize into monomers in excellent yields, thus establishing its circular life cycle.

         <title>Mechanism of Spatial and Temporal Control in Precision Cyclic Vinyl Polymer Synthesis by Lewis Pair Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal control in cyclic polymer synthesis: Lewis pair polymerization controls where and when cyclization takes place to afford precision cyclic vinyl homo and block copolymers.







Abstract
In typical cyclic polymer synthesis via ring&#8208;closure, chain growth and cyclization events are competing with each other, thus affording cyclic polymers with uncontrolled molecular weight or ring size and high dispersity. Here we uncover a mechanism by which Lewis pair polymerization (LPP) operates on polar vinyl monomers that allows the control of where and when cyclization takes place, thereby achieving spatial and temporal control to afford precision cyclic vinyl polymers or block copolymers with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity (&#8776;1.03). A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates that cyclization occurs only after all monomers have been consumed (when) via conjugate addition of the propagating chain end to the specific site of the initiating chain end (where), allowing the cyclic polymer formation steps to be regulated and executed with precision in space and time.

         <title>Light&#8208;Powered Ion Pumping in a Cation&#8208;Selective Conducting Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically fabricated conducting polymer membrane composed of polystyrene sulfonate anion doped polypyrrole matrices exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport. The asymmetric visible irradiation drove the cationic transport against a concentration gradient attributed to the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field, demonstrating an ion&#8208;pumping effect.







Abstract
The simulation of the ion pumping against a proton gradient energized by light in photosynthesis is of significant importance for the energy conversion in a non&#8208;biological environment. Herein, we report light&#8208;powered ion pumping in a polystyrene sulfonate anion (PSS) doped polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer membrane (PSS&#8208;PPy) with a symmetric geometry. This PSS&#8208;PPy conducting polymer membrane exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport attributed to the negatively charged PSS groups. An asymmetric visible irradiation on one side of the PSS&#8208;PPy membrane induces a built&#8208;in electric field across the membrane due to the intrinsic photoelectronic property of PPy, which drives the cationic transport against the concentration gradient, demonstrating an ion&#8208;pumping effect. This work is a prototype that uses a geometry&#8208;symmetric conducting polymer membrane as a light&#8208;powered artificial ion pump for active ion transport, which exhibits potential applications in nanofluidic energy conversion.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Hyperforin and Pyrohyperforin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of both (+)&#8208;hyperforin and its pyran congener (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin is described herein. The synthesis highlights a late&#8208;stage 1,3&#8208;diene diversification, including an abiotic cyclization cascade for pyran formation, and a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes.







Abstract
Capitalizing on the late&#8208;stage diversification of an essential 1,3&#8208;diene intermediate, we describe herein a 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;hyperforin and (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin, starting from commercially available allylacetone. Our convergent synthesis features a series of critical reactions: 1) an enantioselective deconjugative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acid using chiral lithium amides as noncovalent stereodirecting auxiliaries; 2) a HfCl4&#8208;mediated carbonyl &#945;&#8208;tert&#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework; 3) an abiotic cascade pyran formation; and 4) a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes. During the course of our synthesis, we also identified a 1,2&#8208;cyclopropanediol overbred intermediate which was responsible for the 1,3&#8208;diene precursor formation through a controlled fragmentation.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalyst: Marked ORR Activity in Acidic Media without the Contribution from Metal Sites?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;doped hollow and hierarchically porous carbon nanocage catalyst having a noncovalently bonded N&#8208;deficient/N&#8208;rich layered heterostructure exhibits excellent ORR performance in both alkaline and acidic media without significant contributions by negligble amounts of Fe (0&#8211;0.08&#8197;wt.%) owing to the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer and accelerated electron/mass transfer in the hierarchically porous structure.







Abstract
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to be the most promising substitutes for benchmark Pt/C catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report that N&#8208;doped carbon materials with trace amounts of iron (0&#8211;0.08&#8197;wt.&#8201;%) show excellent ORR activity and durability comparable and even superior to those of Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic media without significant contribution by the metal sites. Such an N&#8208;doped carbon (denoted as N&#8208;HPCs) features a hollow and hierarchically porous architecture, and more importantly, a noncovalently bonded N&#8208;deficient/N&#8208;rich heterostructure providing the active sites for oxygen adsorption and activation owing to the efficient electron transfer between the layers. The primary Zn&#8208;air battery using N&#8208;HPCs as the cathode delivers a much higher power density of 158&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the maximum power density in the H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell reaches 486&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is comparable to and even better than those using conventional Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts at cathodes.

         <title>Ferroptosis&#8208;Enhanced Cancer Immunity by a Ferrocene&#8208;Appended Iridium(III) Diphosphine Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agents have potential as antitumor candidates. A ferrocene&#8208;modified IrIII complex with Fenton&#8208;like catalytic is used to disturb the cellular redox balance, which leads to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis of cancer cells. Ferroptosis induced by the IrIII complex causes immunogenic cell death (ICD) of cancer cell in&#8197;vitro, which enhances cancer immune response in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a programmed cell death pathway discovered in recent years, and ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agents have great potential as new antitumor candidates. Here, we report a IrIII complex (Ir1) containing a ferrocene&#8208;modified diphosphine ligand that localizes in lysosomes. Under the acidic environments of lysosomes, Ir1 can effectively catalyze Fenton&#8208;like reaction, produce hydroxyl radicals, induce lipid peroxidation, down&#8208;regulate glutathione peroxidase 4, and result in ferroptosis. RNA sequencing analysis shows that Ir1 can significantly affect pathways related to ferroptosis and cancer immunity. Accordingly, Ir1 can induce immunogenic cells death and suppress tumor growth in vitro, regulate T cell activity and immune microenvironments in vivo. In conclusion, we show the potential of small molecules with ferroptosis&#8208;inducing capabilities for effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Reductive Dimerization of Terminal Alkynes to 2,3&#8208;Dibranched Butadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a combination of pivalic acid and para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid proved successful in favoring the selective highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization of terminal alkynes over the competitive head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization pathway. The target reaction, proposed to proceed via a cationic alkenyl palladium intermediate, presents a facile and straightforward approach for accessing 2,3&#8208;dibranched butadienes.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization of terminal alkynes is described for the first time. Aromatic terminal alkynes bearing diverse and sensitive functional groups as well as aliphatic terminal alkynes are efficiently transformed to 2,3&#8208;dibranched butadienes. The key to achieve a selective tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is to control appropriately the acidity of the reaction solution, which is accomplished by a combined use of pivalic acid and para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. The tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is proposed to proceed via a cationic alkenyl palladium intermediate under acidic conditions.

         <title>A Polymeric Nanobeacon for Monitoring the Fluctuation of Hydrogen Polysulfides during Fertilization and Embryonic Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluctuation of hydrogen polysulfide during the early embryonic development is revealed by a polymeric nanobeacon. A maximal level of H2Sn exists in the preliminary stage of embryogenesis, then the expression level of H2Sn was down&#8208;regulated with the development of the embryo.







Abstract
Fertilization and early embryonic development as the beginning of a new life are key biological events. Hydrogen polysulfide (H2Sn) plays important roles during physiological regulation, such as antioxidation&#8208;protection. However, no report has studied in situ H2Sn fluctuation during early embryonic development because of the low abundance of H2Sn and inadequate sensitivity of probes. We herein construct a polymeric nanobeacon from a H2Sn&#8208;responsive polymer and fluorophores, which is capable of detecting H2Sn selectively and of signal amplification. Taking the zebrafish as a model, the polymeric nanobeacon revealed that the H2Sn level was significantly elevated after fertilization due to the activation of cell multiplication, suppressed partially during embryonic development, and finally kept steady up to zebrafish emergence. This strategy is generally accessible for biomarkers by altering the responsive unit and significant for facilitating biological analysis during life development.

         <title>Reactive Extrusion Printing for Simultaneous Crystallization&#8208;Deposition of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable fabrication methods for metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films are crucial for integrating this class of materials with applications. Reactive extrusion printing (REP) co&#8208;delivers reactive inks that rapidly form micron&#8208;thick interconnected nanoparticulate films of Cu3btc2 (HKUST&#8208;1) on&#8208;demand and on&#8208;location.







Abstract
Reactive extrusion printing (REP) is demonstrated as an approach to simultaneously crystallize and deposit films of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Cu3btc2 (btc=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate), also known as HKUST&#8208;1. The technique co&#8208;delivers inks of the copper(II) acetate and H3btc starting materials directly on&#8208;surface and on&#8208;location for rapid nucleation into films at room temperature. The films were analyzed using PXRD, profilometry, SEM and thermal analysis techniques and confirmed high&#8208;quality Cu3btc2 films are produced in low&#8208;dispersity interconnected nanoparticulate form. The porosity was examined using gas adsorption which showed REP gives Cu3btc2 films with open interconnected pore structures, demonstrating the method bestows features that traditional synthesis does not. REP is a technique that opens the field to time&#8208;efficient large&#8208;scale fabrication of MOF interfaces and should find use in a wide variety of coating application settings.

         <title>In Situ Constructed Nano&#8208;drug Depots through Intracellular Hydrolytic Condensation for Chemotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intravesical administration of first&#8208;line drugs has shown failure in the treatment of bladder cancer owing to poor tumor retention time of chemotherapeutics. Herein, we report an intracellular hydrolytic condensation (  IHC  ) system to  in situ  construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots, wherein sustained drug release results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer. Briefly, the designed doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;silane conjugates self&#8208;assemble into silane&#8208;based prodrug nanoparticles, which condense into silicon particle&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug depots inside tumor cells. Significantly, we demonstrate that the  IHC  system possesses highly potent antitumor efficacy, which leads to the regression and eradication of large established tumors and simultaneously extends the overall survival of air pouch bladder cancer mice compared with that of mice treated with Dox. The concept of intracellular hydrolytic condensation can be extended via conjugating other chemotherapeutic drugs, which may facilitate rational design of novel nanomedicines for augmentation of chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Coupling of Methane: Examining the Inactivity of the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalyst at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) catalyzed by the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 has great industrial promise to convert methane directly to C2&#8208;3 products, but its high light&#8208;off temperature is the most challenging obstacle to commercialization and its working mechanism is still a mystery. We report the discovery of a low&#8208;temperature active and selective&#160;MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst enriched with Q2 units in the SiO2 carrier, being capable of converting 23% CH4 with 72% C2&#8208;3 selectivity at 660 oC. From experiments and theoretical calculations, a large number of Q2 units in the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst is a trigger for markedly lowering the light&#8208;off temperature of the Mn3+ &#8596; Mn2+ redox cycle involved in the OCM reaction because of the easy formation of MnSiO3. Notably, the MnSiO3 formation proceeds merely through SiO2&#8208;involved reaction in the presence of Na2WO4: Mn7SiO12 + 6SiO2 &#8596; 7MnSiO3 + 1.5O2. The Na2WO4 not only drives the light&#8208;off of this cycle but also gets it working with substantial selectivity toward C2&#8208;3 products. Our findings shine a light on rational design of more advanced MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4 based OCM catalyst through establishing new Mn3+ &#8596; Mn2+ redox cycles with lowered light&#8208;off temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Lock Label Based on Thermosensitive Polymer Hydrogels for Information Camouflage and Multilevel Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double lock encryption strategy with both temperature and time as keys and excellent comprehensive capabilities has been established via a combination of lower critical and upper critical solution temperature (LCST and UCST) thermosensitive polymer hydrogels, of which the phase transition temperature and time can be arbitrarily tailored by changing the contents of monomer and crosslinker in their networks. This strategy provides powerful double insurances for confidential information.







Abstract
Developing extra safety encryption technologies to prevent information leakage and combat fakes is in high demand but is challenging. Herein, we propose a &#8220;double lock&#8221; strategy based on both lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and upper critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer hydrogels for information camouflage and multilevel encryption. Two types of hydrogels were synthesized by the method of random copolymerization. The number of &#8722;CO&#8722;NH2 groups in the network structure of the hydrogels changed the enthalpic or entropic thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels, and ultimately precisely controlled their phase transition temperature. The crosslink density of the polymer hydrogels governs the diffusion kinetics, resulting in a difference in the time for their color change. The combination of multiple LCST and UCST hydrogels in one label realized information encryption and dynamic information identification in the dimensions of both time and temperature. This work is highly interesting for the fields of information encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and smart responsive materials.

         <title>Controlled Disassembly of Elemental Sulfur: An Approach to the Precise Synthesis of Polydisulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for controlling the orderly disassembly of elemental sulfur (S8) in the presence of MTBD (a hindered organic base) and [PPN]SbF6 (an ammonium salt) is described for constructing polydisulfides by copolymerizing with episulfides. The &#8220;living polymerization&#8221; feature and good monomer compatibility of this copolymerization allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides with well&#8208;defined structures and excellent optical properties.







Abstract
The usage of elemental sulfur (S8) for constructing sulfur&#8208;containing polymers is of great significance in terms of sulfur resource utilization or fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymers. Currently, the random disassembly of S8 hinders its direct use in the precise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers. Herein, we provide an effective strategy for controlling the dismantlement of S8 to synthesize polydisulfides, a promising category of dynamic bonds containing polymers. In this strategy, the completely alternating copolymerization of one sulfur atom, which is orderly derived from S8, with episulfides is achieved with MTBD (7&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) as catalyst and [PPN]SbF6 ([PPN]+ is bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium) as cocatalyst. Delightedly, the living&#8208; polymerization feature, and the good monomer compatibility allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) was employed to elaborate the copolymerization process.

         <title>Reversible Supramolecular Polymorphism in Solution and Solid Matrix by Manipulating Sidegroup Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible switching between supramolecular polymorphs offers a great way to introduce stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Supramolecular polymorphism is usually achieved through pathway complexity, or by exploiting solvent&#8208;solute interactions. But, steering a self&#8208;assembly along a specific pathway to form a kinetically&#8208;stable aggregate is not easy. Also, changing solvent to switch between polymorphs is impractical. We present a perylene bisimide molecule with  trans  &#8208;azobenzene sidegroup that assembles into three supramolecular polymorphs with distinct colors, morphologies, packing and aggregation mechanism. Optical absorption and FTIR spectroscopy reveal the importance of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between protic solvent and azo N that controls the planarity of the azobenzene group and influences molecular packing. This interaction can be further modulated using temperature, and solution pH to reversibly switch between the three polymorphs, in solution as well as in solid silica&#8208;gel matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;replication allows selection for dynamic kinetic stability in a system of competing replicators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the key characteristics of living systems are their ability to self&#8208;replicate and the fact that they exist in an open system away from equilibrium. Herein, we show how the outcome of the competition between two self&#8208;replicators, differing in size and building block composition, is different depending on whether the experiments are conducted in a closed vial or in an open and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium replication&#8208;destruction regime. In the closed system, the slower replicator eventually prevails over the faster competitor. In a replication&#8208;destruction regime, implemented through a flow system, the outcome of the competition is reversed and the faster replicator dominates. The interpretation of the experimental observations is supported by a mass&#8208;action&#8208;kinetics model. These results represent one of the few experimental manifestations of selection among competing self&#8208;replicators based on dynamic kinetic stability and pave the way towards Darwinian evolution of abiotic systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct C&#8211;H functionalizations by electrocatalysis is dominated by strongly coordinating N(sp  2  )&#8208;directing groups. In sharp contrast, direct electrocatalytic transformations of weakly&#8208;coordinating phenols remain underdeveloped. Herein, electrooxidative  peri  C&#8211;H alkenylations of challenging 1&#8208;naphthols were achieved by versatile rhodium(III) catalysis  via  user&#8208;friendly constant current electrolysis. The rhodaelectrocatalysis employed readily&#8208;available alkenes and a protic reaction medium and features ample scope, good functional group tolerance and high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The strategy was successfully applied to high&#8208;value, nitrogen containing heterocycles, thereby providing direct access to uncommon heterocyclic motifs based on the dihydropyranoquinoline skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Osmotic Energy Conversion Enabled by Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Membranes with Record Output Power Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A vast amount of energy can be extracted from the untapped low&#8208;grade heat from sources below 100 &#176;C and the Gibbs free energy from salinity gradients. Therefore, a process for simultaneous and direct conversion of these energies into electricity using permselective membranes was developed in this study. These membranes screen charges of ion flux driven by the combined salinity and temperature gradients to achieve thermo&#8208;osmotic energy conversion. Increasing the charge density in the pore channels enhanced the permselectivity and ion conductance, leading to a larger osmotic voltage and current. A 14&#8208;fold increase in power density was achieved by adjusting the ionic site population of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes. The optimal COF membrane was operated under simulated estuary conditions at a temperature difference of 60 K, which yielded a power density of ~231 W m  &#8722;2  , placing it among the best performing upscaled membranes. The developed system can pave the way to the utilization of the enormous supply of untapped osmotic power and low&#8208;grade heat energy, indicating the tremendous potential of using COF membranes for energy conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Salt&#8208;Stabilized Silylzinc Pivalates for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbosilylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report the preparation of solid and salt&#8208;stabilized silylzinc pivalates from the corresponding silyllithium reagents via transmetalation with Zn(OPiv)  2  . These resulting organosilylzinc pivalates show enhanced air and moisture stability and unique reactivity in the silylative difunctionalization of alkenes. Thus, a practical chelation&#8208;assisted nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alkyl and benzylsilylation of alkenes has been developed, which provides an easy method to access alkyl silanes with broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. Kinetic experiments highlight that the OPiv&#8208;coordination is crucial to improve the reactivity of silylzinc pivalates. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage functionalizations of druglike molecules and versatile modifications of the products illustrate the synthetical utility of this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversifying Nanoparticle Superstructures and Functions Enabled by Translative Templating from Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biology exploits a transcription&#8208;translation approach to deliver structural information from DNA to the protein&#8208;building machines with high precision. Here, we show how the structural information of small synthetic molecules could be used to guide the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into diversified yet long&#8208;range ordered superstructures, enabling the information transfer across four or five orders of magnitude in length scale. We designed three perylene diimide (PDI) based isomers differing by their site&#8208;specific substitutions of methyl group, which were able to supramolecularly polymerize into diverse structures. Importantly, coassembly of these PDI isomers with nanoparticles (NPs) could produce diverse long&#8208;range ordered nanoparticle superstructures, including one&#8208;dimensional NPs chains, double helical NPs assemblies and two&#8208;dimensional NPs superlattices. Equally important, we demonstrate that the information originated from small molecules could diversify the functions of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nuclear&#8208;Targeted AIE Photosensitizer for Enzyme Inhibition and Photosensitization in Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with AIE characteristics was developed. MeTPAE can not only interact with HDACs to inhibit cell proliferation, but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment. The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent photodynamic therapy (PDT) anti&#8208;tumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.







Abstract
The nucleus is considered the ideal target for anti&#8208;tumor therapy because DNA and some enzymes in the nucleus are the main causes of cell canceration and malignant proliferation. However, nuclear target drugs with good biosafety and high efficiency in cancer treatment are rare. Herein, a nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics was developed based on a triphenylamine structure skeleton. MeTPAE can not only interact with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to inhibit cell proliferation but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment (PDT). The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent PDT anti&#8208;tumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.

         <title>A TMEDA&#8211;Iron Adduct Reaction Manifold in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Historically, the role of TMEDA in iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling has been disputed due to a lack of insight into the iron species present during catalysis. In this report, low&#8208;temperature synthesis, freeze&#8208;trapped 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical&#8208;quenched GC analysis were utilized to identify highly reactive and selective TMEDA&#8208;ligated iron species responsible for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling catalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we expand the current molecular&#8208;level understanding of one of the most important and effective additives in iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). Focusing on relevant phenyl and ethyl Grignard reagents and slow nucleophile addition protocols commonly used in effective catalytic systems, TMEDA&#8208;iron(II)&#8208;aryl intermediates are identified via in situ spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and detailed reaction studies to be a part of an iron(II)/(III)/(I) reaction cycle where radical recombination with FePhBr(TMEDA) (2Ph) results in selective product formation in high yield. These results differ from prior studies with mesityl Grignard reagent, where poor product selectivity and low catalytic performance can be attributed to homoleptic iron&#8211;ate species. Overall, this study represents a critical advance in how amine additives such as TMEDA can modulate selectivity and reactivity of organoiron species in cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Structural Basis for Chaperone&#8208;Independent Ubiquitination of Tau Protein by Its E3 Ligase CHIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR&#8208;based structural investigation of the Tau&#8211;CHIP complex revealed a multi&#8208;domain, dynamic interaction that explains the origin of the multiple&#8208;site ubiquitination of Tau operated by CHIP, as well as the ability of this ligase to modify Tau in the absence of chaperones.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;site ubiquitination of Tau protein found in Alzheimer's disease filaments hints at the failed attempt of neurons to remove early toxic species. The ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of Tau is regulated in vivo by the E3 ligase CHIP, a quality controller of the cell proteome dedicated to target misfolded proteins for degradation. In our study, by using site&#8208;resolved NMR, biochemical and computational methods, we elucidate the structural determinants underlying the molecular recognition between the ligase and its intrinsically disordered substrate. We reveal a multi&#8208;domain dynamic interaction that explains how CHIP can direct ubiquitination of Tau at multiple sites even in the absence of chaperones, including its typical partner Hsp70/Hsc70. Our findings thus provide mechanistic insight into the chaperone&#8208;independent engagement of a disordered protein by its E3 ligase.

         <title>Kinetics&#8208;Regulated Interfacial Selective Superassembly of Asymmetric Smart Nanovehicles with Tailored Topological Hollow Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetics&#8208;regulated cooperative polymerization induced interfacial superassembly strategy is used by Biao Kong et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200240) to construct a series of asymmetric hollow porous composites with tunable diameters, architectures and composition. Owing to their excellent photothermal conversion performance and unique nanostructures, the resulting nanoparticles can be utilized as NIR light triggered nanovehicles with controllably release of cargos.

Owing to their excellent photothermal conversion performance and unique nanostructures, the resulting nanoparticles can be utilized as NIR light triggered nanovehicles with controllably release of cargos.

         <title>Simultaneous Counting of Molecules in the Halo and Dense&#8208;Core of Nanovesicles by Regulating Dynamics of Vesicle Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doublet spikes induced by chaotropes (SCN&#8722;) are recorded from chromaffin vesicles opening during vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC). The 1st and 2nd peaks correspond to the oxidization of molecules from the halo and dense&#8208;core, respectively, allowing a molecular count to be obtained independently in these two nanoscopic compartments. The vesicles can be classified into three groups including NDCVs, immature large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs), and mature LDCVs.







Abstract
We report the discovery that in the presence of chaotropic anions (SCN&#8722;) the opening of nanometer biological vesicles at an electrified interface often becomes a two&#8208;step process (around 30&#8201;% doublet peaks). We have then used this to independently count molecules in each subvesicular compartment, the halo and protein dense&#8208;core, and the fraction of catecholamine binding to the dense&#8208;core is 68&#8201;%. Moreover, we differentiated two distinct populations of large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs) and quantified their content, which might correspond to immature (43&#8201;%) and mature (30&#8201;%) LDCVs, to reveal differences in their biogenesis. We speculate this is caused by an increase in the electrostatic attraction between protonated catecholamine and the negatively charged dense&#8208;core following adsorption of SCN&#8722;.

Versatile tertiary &#946;&#8208;boryl amides are prepared by conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;substituted alkenyl boron &#8220;ate&#8221; complexes and carbamoyl chloride electrophiles.

Abstract
Synthesis of versatile &#946; tert&#8208;boryl amides is accomplished by conjunctive cross&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;substituted alkenyl boron &#8220;ate&#8221; complexes and carbamoyl chloride electrophiles. This reaction can be accomplished in an enantioselective fashion using a palladium catalyst in combination with MandyPhos. The addition of water results in enhanced chemoselectivity for the conjunctive coupling product relative to the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling product. Transformations of the reaction products were examined as well as application to the synthesis of (+)&#8208;adalinine.

         <title>Versatile Construction of Biomimetic Nanosensors for Electrochemical Monitoring of Intracellular Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile and large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalyst modified nanowires provides an innovative perspective for simple and stable construction of functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. Such nanosensors enable the sensitive and selective detection of diverse biomolecules, and for the first time achieve real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells.







Abstract
The current strategies for nanoelectrode functionalization usually involve sophisticated modification procedures, uncontrollable and unstable modifier assembly, as well as a limited variety of modifiers. To address this issue, we propose a versatile strategy for large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalysts (BMCs) modified nanowires (NWs) to construct functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. This design protocol employs an easy, controllable and stable assembly of diverse BMCs&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composites on conductive NWs. The intrinsic catalytic activity of BMCs combined with outstanding electron transfer ability of conductive polymer enables the nanosensors to sensitively and selectively detect various biomolecules. Further application of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine functionalized nanosensors achieves real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells for the first time.

         <title>Sulfamide: a Promising Deep&#8208;ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal Assembled from Polar Covalent [SO2(NH2)2] Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, the polar covalent tetrahedron [SO 2  (NH 2  ) 2  ] was revealed as a new deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO)&#8208;active unit according to the theoretical calculations. Furthermore, sulfamide consisting of the polar [SO 2  (NH 2  ) 2  ] units was confirmed as an excellent DUV NLO material. Since sulfamide realizes the optimal balance in the relationships among composition, structure, and properties, in addition to very short absorption of 160 nm, it achieves multiple optical performance records among the non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV NLO materials, including the strongest SHG efficiency (about 4 times that of KDP), the largest birefringence (obv.: 0.07@589.3 nm) and the shortest SHG wavelength predicted as 188 nm.

         <title>Supported Lanthanum Borohydride Catalyzes CH Borylation Inside Zeolite Micropores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borylation of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds in benzene with pinacolborane (HBpin), catalyzed by a zeolite&#8208;supported lanthanum borohydride, provides the first demonstration of a promising alternative to late&#8208;metal catalysts. High turnovers and yield are achieved by selective grafting of lanthanum at Br&#248;nsted acid sites and limiting HBpin degradation. C&#8722;H bond activation, likely via the &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism, is probably the turnover limiting step.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;supported lanthanide La(BH4)x&#8208;HY30 catalyzes C&#8722;H borylation of benzene with pinacolborane (HBpin), providing a complementary approach to precious, late transition metal&#8208;catalyzed borylations. The reactive catalytic species are generated from La grafted at the Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in micropores of the zeolite, whereas silanoate&#8208; and aluminoate&#8208;grafted sites are inactive under the reaction conditions. During typical catalytic borylations, conversion to phenyl pinacolborane (PhBpin) is zero&#8208;order in HBpin concentration. A turnover number (TON) of 167 is accessed by capping external silanols, selectively grafting at BAS sites, and adding HBpin slowly to the reaction.

         <title>Access to a Labile Monomeric Magnesium Radical by Ball&#8208;Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ball&#8208;milling of a magnesium iodide precursor with K/KI gave a mononuclear Mg radical which is stabilized by a CAAC ligand. Although stable in the crystalline state, the complex decomposed rapidly in solution. According to calculations and EPR spectroscopy, most of the spin density is localized on the CAAC ligand.







Abstract
In order to isolate a monometallic Mg radical, the precursor (Am)MgI&#8901;(CAAC) (1) was prepared (Am=tBuC(N&#8208;DIPP)2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, CAAC=cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene). Reduction of a solution of 1 in toluene with the reducing agent K/KI led to formation of a deep purple complex that rapidly decomposed. Ball&#8208;milling of 1 with K/KI gave the low&#8208;valent MgI complex (Am)Mg&#8901;(CAAC) (2) which after rapid extraction with pentane and crystallization was isolated in 15&#8201;% yield. Although a benzene solution of 2 decomposes rapidly to give Mg(Am)2 (3) and unidentified products, the radical is stable in the solid state. Its crystal structure shows planar trigonal coordination at Mg. The extremely short Mg&#8722;C distance of 2.056(2)&#8197;&#197; indicates strong Mg&#8722;CAAC bonding. Calculations and EPR measurements show that most of the spin density is in a &#960;* orbital located at the C&#8722;N bond in CAAC, leading to significant C&#8722;N bond elongation. This is supported by calculated NPA charges in 2: Mg +1.73, CAAC &#8722;0.82. Similar metal&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer was calculated for M0(CAAC)2 and [MI(CAAC)2+] (M=Be, Mg, Ca) complexes in which the metal charges range from +1.50 to +1.70. Although the spin density of the radical is mainly located at the CAAC ligand, complex 2 reacts as a low&#8208;valent MgI complex: reaction with a I2 solution in toluene gave (Am)MgI&#8901;(CAAC) (1) as the major product.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Coal&#8208;Bed Methane Purification with Record CH4/N2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of nickel&#8208;based coordination networks with different pore environments was synthesized. These porous materials could be used for coal&#8208;bed methane purification with exceptional separation performance.







Abstract
The enrichment and purification of coal&#8208;bed methane provides a source of energy and helps offset global warming. In this work, we demonstrate a strategy involving the regulation of the pore size and pore chemistry to promote the separation of CH4/N2 mixtures in four nickel&#8208;based coordination networks, named Ni(ina)2, Ni(3&#8208;ain)2, Ni(2&#8208;ain)2, and Ni(pba)2, (where ina=isonicotinic acid, 3&#8208;ain=3&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, 2&#8208;ain=2&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, and pba=4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzoic acid). Among them, Ni(ina)2 and Ni(3&#8208;ain)2 can effectively separate CH4 from N2 with top&#8208;performing performance because of the suitable pore size (&#8776;0.6 and 0.5&#8197;nm) and pore environment. Explicitly, Ni(ina)2 exhibits the highest ever reported CH4/N2 selectivity of 15.8 and excellent CH4 uptake (40.8&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) at ambient conditions, thus setting new benchmarks for all reported MOFs and traditional adsorbents. The exceptional CH4/N2 separation performance of Ni(ina)2 is confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Under different CH4/N2 ratios, Ni(ina)2 selectively extracts methane from the gaseous blend and produces a high purity of CH4 (99&#8201;%). Theoretical calculations and CH4&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal structure analysis provide critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism. Ni(ina)2 and Ni(3&#8208;ain)2 can form rich intermolecular interactions with methane, indicating a strong adsorption affinity between pore walls and CH4 molecules. Importantly, Ni(ina)2 has good thermal and moisture stability and can easily be scaled up at a low cost ($25 per kilogram), which will be valuable for potential industrial applications. Overall, this work provides a powerful approach for the selective adsorption of CH4 from coal&#8208;bed methane.

         <dc:description>
Multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with integrated capabilities of Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via a facile vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration process. The resultant AgNW/leather nanocomposites show promising application potentials for next&#8208;generation wearable electronic devices in energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence, etc.







Abstract
Multifunctional wearable electronic devices based on natural materials are highly desirable for versatile applications of energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence. Herein, multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with hierarchical structures for integrated visual Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via the facile vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration process. The AgNWs penetrate the micro&#8208;nanoporous structures in the corium side of leather constructing highly&#8208;efficient conductive networks. The resultant flexible and mechanically strong AgNW/leather nanocomposites exhibit extremely low sheet resistance of 0.8&#8197;&#937;/sq, superior visual Joule heating temperatures up to 108&#8201;&#176;C at low supplied voltage of 2.0&#8197;V due to efficient energy conversion, excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of &#8776;55&#8197;dB and outstanding piezoresistive sensing ability in human motion detection. This work demonstrates the fabrication of multifunctional AgNW/leather nanocomposites for next&#8208;generation wearable electronic devices in energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence, etc.

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Helicenes by a Tailored Chiral Benzo[ghi]perylene Trisimide &#960;&#8208;Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes are bound by a newly designed chiral &#960;&#8208;scaffold composed of a perylene trisimide, BINOL and terphenyl subunits. The superb enantiodifferentiation is observable by the naked eye due to the exciplex&#8208;type emission of the homochiral complex.







Abstract
Enantioselective molecular recognition of chiral molecules that lack specific interaction sites for hydrogen bonding or Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions remains challenging. Here we introduce the concept of tailored chiral &#960;&#8208;surfaces toward the maximization of shape complementarity. As we demonstrate for helicenes it is indeed possible by pure van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions (&#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions) to accomplish enantioselective binding. This is shown for a novel benzo[ghi]perylene trisimide (BPTI) receptor whose &#960;&#8208;scaffold is contorted into a chiral plane by functionalization with 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL). Complexation experiments of enantiopure (P)&#8208;BPTI with (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;[6]helicene afforded binding constants of 10&#8201;700&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 550&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively, thereby demonstrating the pronounced enantiodifferentiation by the homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffold of the BPTI host. The enantioselective recognition is even observable by the naked eye due to a specific exciplex&#8208;type emission originating from the interacting homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffolds of electron&#8208;rich [6]helicene and electron&#8208;poor BPTI.

         <title>Macrocyclic Polyoxometalates: Selective Polyanion Binding and Ultrahigh Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion templation using polyoxometalates can be a very effective approach to construct large macrocycles that have unique solid&#8208;state and solution properties. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle selectively binds the Preyssler polyanion in solution. It forms a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8211;guest complex that shows ultrahigh solid&#8208;state proton conductivities (1.7&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 368&#8197;K and 90&#8201;% RH) thanks to the presence of an extended hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
The rational development of an anion templation strategy for the construction of macrocycles has been historically limited to small anions, but large polyoxoanions can offer unmatched structural diversity and ample binding sites. Here we report the formation of a {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle by using the Preyssler anion, [NaP5W30O110]14&#8722; ({P5W30}), as a supramolecular template. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle displays selective anion binding behavior in solution. In the solid state, the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8211;guest complex, {P5W30}2&#8834;{Mo22Fe8}, transports protons more effectively, through an extended hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, than a related 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex where the guest is completely encapsulated. The results highlight the great potential this anion templation approach has in producing macrocyclic systems for selective anion recognition and proton conduction purposes.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair in Zeolite Cages for Alkane Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The H&#8722;H bond in H2 and C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes (n&#8805;3) can be activated by a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) in zeolites. The FLP consisting of the hydrocarbon pool species (polymethylbenzenium, Lewis acid) and deprotonated zeolites (Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;, Lewis base) is the common steady state of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reactions.







Abstract
The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) concept in homogeneous catalysis was extended to heterogeneous catalysis via the supramolecular system of FLP between deprotonated zeolite framework oxygens and confined carbocations in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reactions. In this FLP, the polymethylbenzenium (PMB+) functioned as the Lewis acid to accept an electron pair, and the deprotonated framework oxygen site acted as the Lewis base to donate an electron pair. This FLP theoretically demonstrated the ability to undergo H2 heterolysis and alkanes dehydrogenation, and this was further confirmed by gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometer (GC&#8208;MS) catalytic experiments inside FLP&#8208;containing chabazite zeolites. All these findings not only bring new recognition to the carbocation chemistry in zeolite cages but also put forward a new reaction pathway as one part of MTO reactions.

         <title>NHC Catalysis for Umpolung Pyridinium Alkylation via Deoxy&#8208;Breslow Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC deoxy&#8208;Breslow catalysis offers new umpolung possibilities for electron&#8208;poor arene rings. NHC organocatalysis is largely restricted to aldehydes, with other electrophiles proving difficult to harness. It is shown that a pyridinium system can react successfully with an NHC, enabling intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formation with a Michael acceptor through a deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediate.







Abstract
Umpolung N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis of non&#8208;aldehyde substrates offers new pathways for C&#8722;C bond formation, but has proven challenging to develop in terms of viable substrate classes. Here, we demonstrate that pyridinium ions can undergo NHC addition and subsequent intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formation through a deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediate. The alkylation demonstrates, for the first time, that deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediates are viable for catalytic umpolung of areniums.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Imprinting of the Helical Organization in Liquid&#8208;Crystal Networks Using Achiral Monomers and Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method has been developed to make cholesteric liquid&#8208;crystal networks from achiral monomers by irradiation with circularly polarized light. This approach allows simultaneous control over the photoalignment of the mesogens and the photopolymerization of the network.







Abstract
Control over molecular motion is facilitated in materials with highly ordered nanoscale structures. Here we report on the fabrication of cholesteric liquid&#8208;crystal networks by circularly polarized light irradiation, without the need for chiral dopant or plasticizer. The polymer network is obtained by photopolymerization of a smectic achiral diacrylate mesogen consisting of an azobenzene core and discrete oligodimethylsiloxane tails. The synchronous helical photoalignment and photopolymerization originate from the cooperative movement of the mesogens ordered in well&#8208;defined responsive structures, together with the flexibility of the oligodimethylsiloxane blocks. The resulting thin films show excellent thermal stability and light&#8208;induced memory features with reversible responses. Additionally, we demonstrate the fabrication of photo&#8208;patterned films of liquid&#8208;crystal networks with opposite helical senses. These findings provide a new method to make light&#8208;controllable chiroptical materials with exciting applications in optics and photonics.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of [3]Radialenes via [1+1+1] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first [1+1+1] cycloaddition reaction has been achieved on the Ag(111) surface to afford the aza[3]radialenes. The chlorine substituents in the isocyanides ensured the selectivity and orientational order of the products via the steric hindrance&#8208;directed molecular assembly.







Abstract
[3]Radialenes are the smallest carbocyclic structures with unusual topologies and cross&#8208;conjugated &#960;&#8208;electronic structures. Here, we report a novel [1+1+1] cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of aza[3]radialenes on the Ag(111) surface, where the steric hindrance of the chlorine substituents guides the selective and orientational assembling of the isocyanide precursors. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we determined the atomic structure of the produced aza[3]radialenes. Furthermore, two reaction pathways including synergistic and stepwise are proposed based on density functional theory calculations, which reveal the role of the chlorine substituents in the activation of the isocyano groups via electrostatic interaction.

         <title>Discovery of Two Polymorphs of TiP4N8 Synthesized from Binary Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TiP  4  N  8  was obtained from the binary nitrides TiN and P  3  N  5  upon addition of NH  4  F as a mineralizer at 8 GPa and 1400 &#176;C. An intricate interplay of disorder and polymorphism was elucidated by  in situ  temperature&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, STEM&#8208;HAADF, and the investigation of annealed samples. This revealed two polymorphs, that consist of dense networks of PN  4  tetrahedra (degree of condensation  &#954;  = 0.5) and either augmented triangular TiN  7  prisms or triangular TiN  6  prisms for  &#945;  &#8208; and  &#946;  &#8208;TiP  4  N  8  , respectively. The structures of TiP4N8  exhibit  body&#8208;centered tetragonal  (  bct  ) framework topology. DFT calculations confirm the measured bandgaps of  &#945;  &#8208; and  &#946;  &#8208;TiP  4  N  8  (1.6&#8211;1.8 eV) and predict the thermochemistry of the polymorphs in agreement with the experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Ion&#8208;Incorporated Mussel&#8208;Inspired Poly(Vinyl Alcohol)&#8208;Based Polymer Coating Offers Improved Antibacterial Activity and Cellular Mechanoresponse Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt (CoII) ions have been an attractive candidate for the biomedical modification of orthopedic implants for decades. However, limited research has been performed into how immobilized CoII  ions affect the physical properties of implant devices and how these changes regulate cellular behavior. In this study we modified biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) with terpyridine and catechol groups (PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA) to create a stable surface coating in which bioactive metal ions could be anchored, endowing the coating with improved broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against  Escherichia coli  and  Staphylococcus aureus  , as well as enhanced surface stiffness and cellular mechanoresponse manipulation. Strengthened by the addition of these metal ions, the coating elicited enhanced mechanosensing from adjacent cells, facilitating cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on the surface coating. This dual&#8208;functional PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA/Co surface coating offers a promising approach for improving clinical implantation outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual pH and Light&#8208;Responsive Spiropyrane&#8208;Based Surfactant: Investigations on its Switching Behavior and Remote Control over Emulsion Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cationic surfactant containing a spiropyrane unit is prepared exhibiting a dual&#8208;responsive adjustability of its surface&#8208;active characteristics. The switching mechanism of the system relies on the reversible conversion of the non&#8208;ionic spiropyrane (SP) to a zwitterionic merocyanine (MC) and can be controlled by adjusting the pH value and via light, resulting in a pH&#8208;dependent photoactivity: While the compound possesses a pronounced difference in surface activity between both forms under acidic conditions, this behavior is suppressed at a neutral pH level. The underlying switching processes are investigated in detail, and a thermodynamic explanation based on a combination of theoretical and experimental results is provided. This complex stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior enables remote&#8208;control of colloidal systems. To demonstrate its applicability, the surfactant is utilized for the pH&#8208;dependent manipulation of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptional Selectivity to Olefins from Deoxygenation of Fatty Acids over an Intermetallic Platinum&#8208;Zinc Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct deoxygenation of long&#8208;chain fatty acids can produce both saturated alkanes (C  n  H  2n+2  ) and unsaturated olefins (C  n  H  2n  ). However, the selectivity to olefins via the decarbonylation route is relatively low because of the more favorable decarboxylation pathway. We present an atomically&#8208;ordered intermetallic PtZn alloy on carbon catalyst (PtZn/C) with a record&#8208;high total selectivity (97%) towards undecane (C  11  H  24  ) and undecene (C  11  H  22  ) from the deoxygenation of lauric acid (C  12  H  24  O  2  ). Interestingly, the selectivity to C  11  H  22  is as high as 67.0% on PtZn/C, which is significantly higher than that of 27.5% obtained on Pt/C counterpart under the same reaction condition. Characterization and theoretical calculation results reveal that the intermetallic PtZn alloy not only inhibits the decarboxylation route via enhancing the energy barrier of cleavage of &#8208;COO*, but also facilitates the decarbonylation route via decreasing CO desorption energy, and therefore switching the major product from alkanes to olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroalkynylation of Unactivated 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic enantioselective functionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes is challenging due to the difficulty to discriminate the enantiotopic faces. Enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes with tunable Markovnikov and  anti  &#8208;Markovnikov selectivity remains elusive. We report here an amide directed, regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated alkenes. The regioselectivity can be readily tuned by the choice of a proper ligand. Catalytic alkynylations occurred with tunable Markovnikov and  anti  &#8208;Markovnikov selectivity to afford products containing acyclic tertiary or quaternary stereocenters &#946; to an amide. Combining a sequence of alkene isomerization and regioselective hydroalkynylation, we further realized an iridium catalyzed formal asymmetric conjugated alkynylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. Computational studies suggest that the regioselectivity is dictated the ligand structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Critical Role of Removing Impurities in Nickel Oxide on High&#8208;Efficiency and Long&#8208;Term Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance&#160;enhancement of inverted perovskite solar cells applying nickel oxide (NiOx) as hole transport layer (HTL) has been limited by impurity ions (such as nitrate ions). Herein, we have proposed a strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality NiOx  nanoparticles via ionic liquid&#8208;assisted synthesis method (NiOx&#8208;IL). Experimental and theoretical results illustrate that the cation of ionic liquid can inhibit the adsorption of impurity ions on nickel hydroxide through strong hydrogen bond and low adsorption energy, thereby obtaining NiOx&#8208;IL HTL with high conductivity and strong hole&#8208;extraction ability. Importantly, the removal of impurity ions can effectively suppress the redox reaction between NiOx  film and perovskite film, thus slowing down the deterioration of device performance. Consequently, the modified inverted device shows striking efficiency exceeding 22.62%, and superior stability maintaining 92% efficiency at maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination for 1000 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Soft Alloys Constructed with Distinct Mesoatoms via Self&#8208;Sorting Assembly of Giant Shape Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The packing structures of spherical motifs affect the properties of resultant condensed materials such as in metal alloys. Inspired by the classic metallurgy, developing complex alloy&#8208;like packing phases in soft matter (also called &#8220;soft alloys&#8221;) is promising for the next&#8208;generation superlattice engineering. Nevertheless, the formation of many alloy&#8208;like phases in single&#8208;component soft matter is usually thermodynamically unfavourable and technically challenging. Here, we utilize a novel self&#8208;sorting assembly approach to tackle this challenge in binary blends of soft matter. Two types of giant shape amphiphiles self&#8208;sort to form their discrete spherical motifs, which further simultaneously pack into alloy&#8208;like phases. Three unconventional spherical packing phases have been observed in these binary systems, including MgZn  2  , NaZn  13  , and CaCu  5  phases. It&#8217;s the first time that the CaCu  5  phase is experimentally observed in soft matter. This work demonstrates a general approach to constructing unconventional spherical packing phases and other complex superlattices in soft matter.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Stabilizing Point Mutation Enables High&#8208;Resolution Co&#8208;Crystal Structures of the Adenosine A2A Receptor with Preladenant Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The G protein&#8208;coupled adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) is an important new (potential) drug target in immuno&#8208;oncology, and for neurodegenerative diseases. Preladenant and its derivatives belong to the most potent A2AAR antagonists displaying exceptional selectivity. While crystal structures of the human A2AAR have been solved, mostly using the A2A&#8208;StaR2 protein that bears 9 point mutations, co&#8208;crystallization with Preladenant derivatives has so far been elusive. We developed a new A2AAR construct harboring a single point mutation (S913.39K) which renders it extremely thermostable. This allowed the co&#8208;crystallization of two novel Preladenant derivatives, the polyethylene glycol&#8208;conjugated (PEGylated) PSB&#8208;2113, and the fluorophore&#8208;labeled PSB&#8208;2115. The obtained crystal structures (2.25 &#197; and 2.6 &#197; resolution) provide explanations for the high potency and selectivity of Preladenant derivatives. They represent the first crystal structures of a GPCR in complex with PEG&#8208; and fluorophore&#8208;conjugated ligands. The applied strategy is predicted to be applicable to further class A GPCRs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the active center of the natural [FeFe] hydrogenases, we designed a compact and precious metal&#8208;free photosensitizer&#8208;catalyst dyad (PS&#8208;CAT) for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation.  PS&#8208;CAT  represents a prototype dyad comprising  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated oligothiophenes as light absorbers.  PS&#8208;CAT  and its interaction with the sacrificial donor 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazoline were studied by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical techniques and visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic investigations.

         <title>Spontaneous membranization in a silk&#8208;based coacervate protocell model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecularly crowded coacervate micro&#8208;droplets are useful protocell constructs but the absence of a physical membrane limits their application as cytomimetic models. Auxiliary surface&#8208;active agents have been harnessed to stabilize the coacervate droplets by irreversible shell formation but endogenous processes of reversible membranization have received minimal attention. Herein, we describe a dynamic alginate/silk coacervate&#8208;based protocell model in which membrane&#8208;less droplets are reversibly reconfigured into semipermeable coacervate vesicles by spontaneous self&#8208;organization of amphiphilic silk polymers at the droplet surface under non&#8208;neutral charge conditions in the absence of auxiliary agents. We show that membranization can be reversibly controlled endogenously by programming the pH within the protocells using an antagonistic enzyme system such that structural reconfigurations in the protocell microstructure are coupled to the trafficking of water&#8208;soluble solutes. Our results open new perspectives in the design of hybrid protocell models with dynamical structural properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity Differences Enable ROS for Selective Ablation of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective strategy to engineer selective photodynamic agents to surmount bacterial&#8208;infected diseases, especially Gram&#8208;positive bacteria remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed two examples of compounds for a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study where reactive differences in reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce selective ablation of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Sulfur&#8208;replaced phenoxazinium (  NBS&#8208;N  ) mainly generates superoxide anion radical capable of selectively killing Gram&#8208;positive bacteria while selenium&#8208;substituted phenoxazinium (  NBSe&#8208;N  ) has a higher generation of singlet oxygen that can kill both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This difference was further evidenced by bacterial fluorescence imaging and morphological changes. Moreover,  NBS&#8208;N  can also successfully heal the Gram&#8208;positive bacteria&#8208;infected wounds in mice. We believe that such reactive differences may pave a general way to design selective photodynamic agents for ablating Gram&#8208;positive bacteria&#8208;infected diseases.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein a highly efficient atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bipyrroles bearing an N&#8208;N linkage from simple hydrazine and 1,4&#8208;diones. Further product derivatizations led to axially chiral bifunctional compounds with high potential in asymmetric catalysis. For this CPA&#8208;catalyzed double Paal&#8208;Knorr reaction, an intriguing Fe(OTf)  3  &#8208;induced enantiodivergence was also observed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanosensitizer Performs Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Reprogrammed Oxygen Metabolism for Cancer Radiotherapy Intensification and Immunogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiotherapy (RT) was hampered by the limited oxygen in tumor, which could be potentiated via reprogramming oxygen metabolism and increasing oxygen utilization efficiency. Herein, a metal&#8208;phenolic nanosensitizer (Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX) was integrated by an acid&#8208;sensitive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (polyethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;polydithiocarbamates, PEG&#8208;DTC) and a hafnium&#8208;chelated polyphenolic semiconducting polymer (Hf&#8208;PSP) in an amphiphilic polymer (poloxamer F127, PLX). Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX elicited a high imaging performance for precise RT and generated H2S to reduce cellular oxygen consumption rate via mitochondrial respiration inhibiting, which reprogrammed oxygen metabolism for tumor oxygenation improvement. Then, Hf&#8208;sensitization would fully utilize the well&#8208;preserved oxygen to intensify RT efficacy and activate immunogenicity. Such synergistic strategy of improvement in oxygenation and oxygen utilization would have a promising prospect in optimizing oxygen&#8208;dependent therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new class of chiral 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine ligands, SBpy, featuring minimized short&#8208;range steric hindrance and structural tunability was rationally designed and developed, and the effectiveness was demonstrated in the first highly enantioselective Ni &#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl halides to aldehydes. In comparison with known approaches using preformed aryl metallic reagents, this reaction is more step&#8208;economical and functional group tolerant.

         <title>Reversible C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage of a Cobalt Diketimide into an Elusive Cobalt Aryl Nitrenoid Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of (  Tr  L)Co (  Tr  L = 5&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,9&#8208;(trityl)dipyrrin) toward various aryl azides was examined to elucidate the electronic structure and reactivity of dipyrrinato cobalt aryl nitrenoid complexes. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a Co  II  diketimide complex [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  and its reversible C&#8722;C bond cleavage to yield a monomeric Co nitrenoid complex (  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  ). Exposure of [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  to an excess amount of an H&#8722;atom donor cleanly affords the Co  II  anilide complex (  Tr  L)Co(NHC  6  F  5  ). The half&#8208;order decay of [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  via H&#8211;atom abstraction (HAA) reveals saturation kinetic behavior indicating a pre&#8208;equilibrium between [(  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  )]  2  and (  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  ) prior to HAA. Furthermore, (  Tr  L)Co(NC  6  F  5  ) undergoes reductive coupling with another equivalent of azide to furnish the four&#8208;coordinate tetrazido complex (  Tr  L)Co(  &#954;  2  &#8208;N  4  (C  6  F  5  )  2  ), expulsion of a fluorine atom to afford (  Tr  L)CoF, and N&#8722;group transfer reactivity to PPh  3&#160;  .</dc:description>

         <title>An Isolable Vinylidene ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commonly, an elusive intermediate is generated from a precursor and then trapped and consumed in a reaction. Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been demonstrated as transient axially chiral intermediates in asymmetric catalysis due to their orthogonal &#960;&#8208;bonds forming an allene motif. The current understanding of VQMs is primarily based on time&#8208;resolved absorption, trapping experiments and computational studies. Herein, we report the first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a VQM, including crystallographic analysis. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM led to its high reactivity as an electrophile or a 4&#960;&#8208;component capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient phenyl group. Notably, the VQM could be isolated in enantiomerically enriched form, and the subsequent transformation was stereospecific, indicating that the generation of the VQM was involved in the enantiodetermining step. This study paves the way for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and characterization of peri&#8208;heptacene on a metallic surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of long n&#8208;peri&#8208;acenes (n&#8208;PAs) is challenging as a result of their inherent open&#8208;shell radical character, which arises from the presence of parallel zigzag edges beyond a certain n value. They are considered as &#960;&#8208;electron model systems to study magnetism in graphene nanostructures; being potential candidates in the fabrication of optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Here, we report the on&#8208;surface formation of the largest pristine member of the n&#8208;PA family, i.e. peri&#8208;heptacene (n = 7, 7&#8208;PA), obtained on an Au(111) substrate under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions. Our high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy investigations, complemented by theoretical simulations, provide insight into the chemical structure of this previously elusive compound. In addition, scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet ground state of 7&#8208;PA, exhibiting singlet&#8211;triplet spin&#8208;flip inelastic excitations with an effective exchange coupling (Jeff) of 49 meV.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoselective Hydroformylation of Propylene by Iodide&#8208;Assisted Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isobutanal is a high value bulk material that, in principle, could be produced with 100% atom&#8208;economy by isoselective hydroformylation of propylene with syngas. However, leading industrial Rh&#8208; and Co&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation methods preferentially form n&#8208;butanal over the iso&#8208;product, and methods offering isoselectivity remain underdeveloped. Here we report an iodide&#8208;assisted Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of propylene that produces isobutanal with unprecedented levels of selectivity. The method involves PdI2, simple alkyl monophosphines, such as tricyclohexylphosphine, and common green solvents, enabling the title reaction to occur with isoselectivity in up to 50:1 iso/n product ratios under industrially relevant conditions (80&#8208;120 &#959;C). The catalytic and preliminary mechanistic experiments indicate a key role of the iodide anions in both the catalytic activity and the isoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electrooxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Alcohols to Aldehydes in a Neutral Medium: Promoted Water Dissociation over a Nickel&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biomass&#8208;derived alcohol oxidation reaction (BDAOR) holds great promise for sustainable production of chemicals.&#160;However, selective electrooxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds is still challenging.&#160;Herein, we report the electrocatalytic BDAORs to selectively produce aldehydes using single&#8208;atom ruthenium on nickel oxide (Ru  1  &#8208;NiO) as a catalyst in the neutral medium. For electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), Ru  1  &#8208;NiO exhibits a low potential of 1.283 V at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  , and an optimal 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) selectivity of 90%. Experimental studies reveal that the neutral electrolyte plays a critical role in achieving a high aldehyde selectivity, and the single&#8208;atom Ru boosts HMF oxidation in the neutral medium by promoting water dissociation to afford OH*.&#160;Furthermore, Ru  1  &#8208;NiO can be extended to selective electrooxidation of a series of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols to corresponding aldehydes, which are conventionally difficult to obtain in the alkaline medium.</dc:description>
