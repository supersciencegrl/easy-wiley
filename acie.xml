         <title>Construction of Multiform Hollow&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Frameworks via a Facile and Universal Strategy for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The special structural morphology of hollow covalent organic frameworks (HCOFs) has an important influence on their applications. However, the rapid and precise control of morphology for HCOFs still remains largely challenging. Herein, we present a facile and universal two&#8208;step strategy based on solvent evaporation and oxidation of imine bond for the controllable synthesis of HCOFs. The strategy enables to prepare HCOFs in a greatly shortened reaction time and seven kinds of HCOFs are fabricated by the oxidation of imine bond via hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) generated from Fenton reaction. Importantly, a fascinating library of HCOFs with diverse nanostructures, including bowl&#8208;like, yolk&#8208;shell, capsule&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like morphologies, has been ingeniously constructed. Owing to the large cavities, the obtained HCOFs are ideal candidates for drug delivery, which are employed to load five small molecule drugs, achieving the enhanced sonodynamic cancer therapy in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>A Target Recycling Amplification Process for the Digital Detection of Exosomal MicroRNAs through Photonic Resonator Absorption Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target recycling amplification process (TRAP) detection method was developed using photonic resonator absorption microscopy, which shows exciting potential for monitoring exosomal miRNAs with ultra&#8208;sensitivity and single&#8208;base mismatch selectivity. The approach is a single&#8208;step, wash&#8208;free, enzyme&#8208;free, isothermal, 20&#8208;minute, room temperature process that can be readily adapted toward any miRNA target through different DNA probe designs.







Abstract
Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have considerable potential as pivotal biomarkers to monitor cancer development, dis&#8208;ease progression, treatment effects and prognosis. Here, we report an efficient target recycling amplification process (TRAP) for the digital detection of miRNAs using photonic resonator absorption microscopy. We achieve multiplex digital detection with sub&#8208;attomolar sensitivity in 20&#8197;minutes, robust selectivity for single nucleotide variants, and a broad dynamic range from 1&#8197;aM to 1&#8197;pM. Compared with traditional qRT&#8208;PCR, TRAP showed similar accuracy in profiling exosomal miRNAs derived from cancer cells, but also exhibited at least 31&#8208;fold and 61&#8208;fold enhancement in the limits of miRNA&#8208;375 and miRNA&#8208;21 detection, respectively. The TRAP approach is ideal for exosomal or circulating miRNA biomarker quantification, where the miRNAs are present in low concentrations or sample volume, with potentials for frequent, low&#8208;cost, and minimally invasive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing.

         <title>A Metabolic&#8208;Tag&#8208;Based Method for Assessing the Permeation of Small Molecules Across the Mycomembrane in Live Mycobacteria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a method to systematically address the structural determinants of permeability in Mtb. This workflow, Peptidoglycan Accessibility Click&#8208;Mediated AssessmeNt (PAC&#8208;MAN), provides a screening platform to measure the permeation of any molecule that is modified with a small azide handle. When molecules reach the peptidoglycan layer, they react with DBCO (site selectively anchored by metabolic labeling), thus imprinting their permeation.







Abstract
The general lack of permeability of small molecules observed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is most ascribed to its unique cell envelope. More specifically, the outer mycomembrane is hypothesized to be the principal determinant for access of antibiotics to their molecular targets. We describe a novel assay that combines metabolic tagging of the peptidoglycan, which sits directly beneath the mycomembrane, click chemistry of test molecules, and a fluorescent labeling chase step, to measure the permeation of small molecules. We showed that the assay workflow was robust and compatible with high&#8208;throughput analysis in mycobacteria by testing a small panel of azide&#8208;tagged molecules. The general trend is similar across the two types of mycobacteria with some notable exceptions. We anticipate that this assay platform will lay the foundation for medicinal chemistry efforts to understand and improve uptake of both existing drugs and newly&#8208;discovered compounds into mycobacteria.

         <title>Alkaline&#8208;Stable Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes with Barium [2.2.2]Cryptate Cations: The Importance of High Binding Constants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex of [2.2.2]cryptand and Ba2+ is used as a novel cationic functional group for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membrane applications, which synergistically has high binding constant, excellent alkaline stability, and a stable main&#8208;group&#8208;metal center.







Abstract
The stability of cationic functional groups is one of the key factors determining lifetime of alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AAEMs) and the AAEM&#8208;based electrochemical devices. Main&#8208;group metal and crown ether complexes are stable cations due to the absence of degradation pathways including nucleophilic substitution, Hofmann elimination, and cation redox. However, the binding strength, a key feature for AAEM applications, is overlooked in previous work. We herein propose the use of barium [2.2.2]cryptate ([Cryp&#8208;Ba]2+) as a new cationic functional group for AAEMs due to its extremely strong binding (109.5&#8197;M&#8722;1 in water at 25&#8201;&#176;C). The [Cryp&#8208;Ba]2+&#8208;AAEMs with polyolefin backbones remain stable after treatment in 15&#8197;M KOH at 60&#8201;&#176;C for over 1500&#8197;hours. More importantly, these AAEMs are successfully applied in water electrolyzers, and an anolyte&#8208;feeding switch method is designed to further reveal the influence of binding constants.

         <dc:description>
Cellulose separators have some challenges for their application in sodium&#8208;ion batteries: In their Research Article (e202300258), Xing&#8208;Long Wu and co&#8208;workers prepare a composite separator (CP@PPC) using cellulose paper (CP) cured by impregnation with polypropylene carbonate (PPC). With the assistance of PPC, CP@PPC not only opens up additional Na+ migration paths through a new &#8220;pore&#8208;hopping&#8221; transport mechanism, but also achieves a flexible, safe and environmental friendly high&#8208;performance separator.

         <title>Molecular Engineering To Enhance Reactivity and Selectivity in an Ultrafast Photoclick Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of the key parameters of the 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone&#8208;electron&#8208;rich alkene (PQ&#8208;ERA) photocycloaddition has led to a system that combines PQs and enamines. This next&#8208;generation system shows drastically enhanced rates, high photoreaction quantum yields, tunable fluorescence output, and high fluorescence quantum yields of the adducts. Furthermore, an orthogonal reaction system was achieved in both solution and on nanoparticle surfaces.







Abstract
Light&#8208;induced 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone&#8208;electron&#8208;rich alkene (PQ&#8208;ERA) photocycloadditions are an attractive new type of photoclick reaction, featuring fast conversions and high biocompatibility. However, the tunability of the reaction was hardly investigated up to now. To this end, we explored the influence of substituents on both reaction partners and the reaction rate between the PQs and ERAs. We identified new handles for functionalization and discovered that using enamines as ERAs leads to drastically enhanced rates (&gt;5400&#8197;times faster), high photoreaction quantum yields (&#934;P, up to 65&#8201;%), and multicolor emission output as well as a high fluorescence quantum yield of the adducts (&#934;F, up to 97&#8201;%). Further investigation of the photophysical and photochemical properties provided insights to design orthogonal reaction systems both in solution and on nanoparticle surfaces for ultrafast chemoselective functionalization by photoclick reactions.

         <title>Experimental Determination of an Isolated trans&#8208;Dinitrosyl Manganese(II) Heme Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structure of a trans&#8208;dinitrosyl porphyrin complex [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] is reported. The complex was also characterized by FT&#8208;IR, EPR and DRIFT spectroscopy. The six&#8208;coordinate [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] complex shows distinct structural and spectroscopic features, including a much longer axial Mn&#8722;NNO bond and a higher NO stretching bond position than those of five&#8208;coordinate mononitrosyl analogues, as well as an isotropic resonance at g = 2.0.







Abstract
The lack of direct proof in either natural or synthetic systems for trans&#8208;dinitrosyl hemes, a key intermediate in the reactions of heme proteins (e.g. soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), cytochrome c&#8242; and So H&#8208;NOX) with nitric oxide (NO), has hampered understanding of the exact reaction mechanisms, such as the formation of the five&#8208;coordinate heme complex with NO at the proximal side (5c NOP). Herein, we report the first isolation of a dinitrosyl metalloporphyrin complex, the six&#8208;coordinate, low&#8208;spin {Mn(NO)2}7 species [Mn(TPP)(NO)2] (TPP2&#8722;=meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin dianion). The complex shows distinct features, such as an elongated axial bond (1.877(9) vs. 1.641(5)&#8197;&#197;), a higher NO stretching bond position (1760 vs. 1735&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and an isotropic resonance at g = 2.0, in sharp contrast to those of five&#8208;coordinate mononitrosyl analogues. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) and EPR studies provided deep insight into the reaction processes, demonstrating different responses of porphyrinates to NO.

         <title>Fundamental Understanding of Electronic Structure in FeN4 Site on Electrocatalytic Activity via dz2&#8208;Orbital&#8208;Driven Charge Tuning for Acidic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a fundamental perspective on the electron structure of the FeN4 site on the acidic oxygen reduction reaction activity of a COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs catalyst integrated into a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Via 
&#8208;orbital&#8208;driven charge tuning, the performance of the fuel cell is improved by an order of magnitude compared with that of an untuned FeN4 catalyst.







Abstract
The structural diversity of active sites resulting from traditional pyrolysis hinder our understanding of the local coordination environment (LCE) around the active site, and its effects on performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We created a series of FeN4 active&#8208;site configurations via a pyrolysis&#8208;free approach where LCEs are defined by covalent organic polymers (COPs). Our results suggest a more positive charge on iron atoms in the vicinity of an electron&#8208;withdrawing side&#8208;chain; that is, a high&#8208;valence configuration (FeH+N4) that is achieved with a COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs catalyst subject to 
&#8208;orbital tuning. A new descriptor &#958;, defined as the band center of iron atoms projected on the 
&#8208;orbital, was introduced to quantitively explain a volcano&#8208;like regulation mechanism. When &#958; is distributed between &#8722;1.887 and &#8722;1.862&#8197;eV, the catalytic performance of the COPBTC@Cl&#8208;CNTs electrocatalyst is optimized.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Potassium Batteries Enabled by Electric and Thermal Field Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual regulation strategy of electric and thermal field in Potassium metal battery is realized by a highly ordered 1D CNT nanoarray. This unique electrode not only provides uniform K ion flux distribution, but also reduces the thermal fluctuation, therefore, enabling PMBs work at low temperature.







Abstract
Recharging batteries operate at sub&#8208;zero temperature is usually limited by the slow ion diffusion and uneven charge distribution at low temperature. Here, we report a strategy to regulate electric field and thermal field simultaneously, creating a fast and uniform deposition surroundings for potassium ion in potassium metal batteries (PMBs). This regulation is achieved by using a highly ordered 1D nanoarray electrode which provides a dense and flat surface for uniforming the electric field and high thermal conductivity for reducing the temperature fluctuation. Consequently, this electrode could achieve high&#8208;areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Besides, the dependence of potassium nucleation on temperature is unveiled. Furthermore, a full&#8208;cell could steady operate with over 80&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Those respectable performances demonstrate that this strategy is valid, potentially providing guidelines for the rational design of advanced electrodes toward PMBs.

         <title>Tricrilactones A&#8211;H, Potent Antiosteoporosis Macrolides with Distinctive Ring Skeletons from Trichocladium crispatum, an Alpine Moss&#8208;Associated Fungus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of oligomeric 10&#8208;membered macrolides, tricrilactones A&#8211;H, was isolated from the moss&#8208;derived fungus T.&#8197;crispatum. Intermediate&#8208;trapping and isotope labeling experiments provided evidence for their proposed biosynthetic pathway. The compounds were found to be potent antiosteoporosis agents in vivo, whereby tricrilactone G (top right&#8208;hand structure) restored bone formation&#8208;resorption homeostasis and promoted cartilage and skeletal development.







Abstract
Tricrilactones A&#8211;H (1&#8211;8), a new family of oligomeric 10&#8208;membered macrolides featuring collectively five unique ring skeletons, were isolated from a hitherto unexplored fungus, Trichocladium crispatum. Compounds 1 and 7 contain two unconventional bridged (aza)tricyclic core skeletons, 2, 3, 5, and 6 share an undescribed tetracyclic 9/5/6/6 ring system, 4 bears an uncommon 9/5/6/10/3&#8208;fused pentacyclic architecture, and 8 is a dimer bridged by an unexpected C&#8722;C linkage. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, quantum chemical calculations, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Importantly, the absolute configuration of the highly flexible side chain of 1 was resolved by the asymmetric synthesis of its four stereoisomers. The intermediate&#8208;trapping and isotope labeling experiments facilitated the proposal of the biosynthetic pathway for these macrolides. In addition, their antiosteoporosis effects were evaluated in vivo (zebrafish).

Importantly, the absolute configuration of the highly flexible side chain of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was resolved by the asymmetric synthesis of its four stereoisomers. The intermediate-trapping and isotope labeling experiments facilitated the proposal of the biosynthetic pathway for these macrolides. In addition, their antiosteoporosis effects were evaluated in vivo (zebrafish).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diastereoselective Alkylation of Activated Nitrogen Heterocycles with Alkenyl Boronate Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylation of acylated quinolines and isoquinolines with alkenyl boron&#8208;&#8220;ate&#8221; complexes via 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement gives substituted, dearomatized nitrogen heterocycles with high diastereocontrol. The modularity of this multi&#8208;component coupling allows for facile access to a range of valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing scaffolds. This one&#8208;pot protocol installs a chiral boronic ester moiety which can be used in further stereospecific transformations.







Abstract
Alkenyl boronate complexes react with acylated quinolines and isoquinolines via 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement to give alkylated, dearomatized heterocycles in good yields, diastereoselectivities, and regioselectivities. This multi&#8208;component coupling is highly modular and can be used to access a wide scope of heterocyclic scaffolds. Chiral boronic esters made through this methodology possess high synthetic potential and can be transformed into various functional groups in one step without racemization.

         <title>Dithienylethene&#8208;Based Single Molecular Photothermal Linear Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mechanically controlled break junction (MCBJ) technique, we have demonstrated a single molecule&#8208;based photothermal linear actuator whose conductance remains constant during its operation. The actuation is achieved by the unique design of the molecular system, which allows a perfect balance of molecular length and band gap change upon isomerization that counteracts the effect of one another to give constant conductance with actuation.







Abstract
By employing a mechanically controllable break junction technique, we have realized an ideal single molecular linear actuator based on dithienylethene (DTE) based molecular architecture, which undergoes reversible photothermal isomerization when subjected to UV irradiation under ambient conditions. As a result, open form (compressed, UV OFF) and closed form (elongated, UV ON) of dithienylethene&#8208;based molecular junctions are achieved. Interestingly, the mechanical actuation is achieved without changing the conductance of the molecular junction around the Fermi level over several cycles, which is an essential property required for an ideal single molecular actuator. Our study demonstrates a unique example of achieving a perfect balance between tunneling width and barrier height change upon photothermal isomerization, resulting in no change in conductance but a change in the molecular length, which results in mechanical actuation at the single molecular level.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural switching of [3]catenane&#160;was induced by fitting the puzzle pieces. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202217002), Jun Terao et&#8197;al. report a method for ligand&#8208;controlled structural switching of [3]catenane, which was realized by the complexation of metal ions on [3]catenane with added complementarily fitted organic ligands, like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. The high tailorability of organic ligands offers multiple pieces with various sizes and numbers of coordination sites, enabling multistate structural switching of [3]catenane.

         <title>Hydrated Eutectic Electrolytes Stabilizing Quasi&#8208;Underpotential Mg Plating/Stripping for High&#8208;Voltage Mg Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable quasi&#8208;underpotential Mg stripping/plating chemistry (UPMC) on Zn substrate is initially achieved in new adiponitrile&#8208;based hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEEs), realizing ultralow UPMC overpotentials and high energy/voltage plateau of aqueous rechargeable Mg batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Mg batteries (ARMBs) usually fail from severe anode passivation, alternatively, executing quasi&#8208;underpotential Mg plating/stripping chemistry (UPMC) on a proper heterogeneous metal substrate is a crucial remedy. Herein, a stable UPMC on Zn substrate is initially achieved in new hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEEs), delivering an ultralow UPMC overpotential and high energy/voltage plateau of ARMBs. The unique eutectic property remarkably expands the lower limit of electrochemical stability window (ESW) of HEEs and undermines the competition between hydrogen evolution/corrosion reactions and UPMC, enabling a reversible UPMC. The UPMC is carefully revealed by multiple characterizations, which shows a low overpotential of 50&#8197;mV at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 550&#8197;h. With sulfonic acid&#8208;doped polyaniline (SPANI) cathodes, UPMC&#8208;based full cells show high energy/power densities of 168.6&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1/2.1&#8197;kWh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and voltage plateau of 1.3&#8197;V, far overwhelming conventional aqueous systems.

         <title>Chiral Single&#8208;Molecule Potentiometers Based on Stapled ortho&#8208; Oligo(phenylene)ethynylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stapled chiral helical single&#8208;molecule potentiometer based on ortho&#8208;oligophenylethynylene skeleton is described. Its stretching during STM measurements promotes different conductive pathways, attributed to different conformations of the helical scaffold, while maintaining the helicity. State of the art calculations on polarization pave the way to use these structures as unimolecular spin filters.







Abstract
We report on the chemical design of chiral molecular junctions with stress&#8208;dependent conductance, whose helicity is maintained during the stretching of a single molecule junction due to the stapling of both ends of the inner helix. In the reported compounds, different conductive pathways are observed, with clearly different conductance values and plateau&#8208;length distributions, attributed to different conformations of the helical structures. The large chiro&#8208;optical responses and the potential use of these molecules as unimolecular spin filters have been theoretically proved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, including a fully ab&#8208;initio estimation of the CISS&#8208;originating spin polarization which is done, for the first time, for a realistic molecular system.

It also discusses the challenges in translational research for the development of new solid sorbent&#8208;based separation technologies and highlights areas which require future research efforts.







Abstract
Since its first industrial production in 1890s, acetylene has played a vital role in manufacturing a wide spectrum of materials. Although current methods and infrastructures for various segments of acetylene industries are well&#8208;established, with emerging functional porous materials that enabled desired selectivity toward target molecules, it is of timely interest to develop new efficient technologies to promote safer acetylene processes with a higher energy efficiency and lower carbon footprint. In this Minireview, we, from the perspective of materials chemistry, review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of advanced porous materials, namely metal&#8211;organic frameworks and decorated zeolites, that have been applied to the purification and storage of acetylene. We also discuss the challenges on the roadmap of translational research in the development of new solid sorbent&#8208;based separation technologies and highlight areas which require future research efforts.

A reversible photo&#8208;induced single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal structural transformation was achieved for a mononuclear dysprosium&#8208;anthracene compound to form a 1D coordination polymer, accompanied by photoswitchable SMM properties with reduced effective spin&#8208;reversal energy barrier, narrowed butterfly&#8208;like hysteresis loop, and decreased blocking temperature.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;responsive lanthanide&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMM) hold great promise for future switching and memory devices. Herein, we report a dysprosium phosphonate [DyIII(SCN)2(NO3)(depma)2(4&#8208;hpy)2] (1Dy), which features a supramolecular framework containing layers of hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and pillars of &#960;&#8211;&#960; interacted anthracene units. The photocycloaddition reaction of anthracene pairs led to a rapid and reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8211;SC) structural transition to form the 1D coordination polymer [DyIII(SCN)2(NO3)(depma2)(4&#8208;hpy)2]n (2Dy), accompanied by photoswitchable SMM properties with the reduction of effective energy barrier by half and the narrowing of the butterfly&#8208;like hysteresis loop. The diluted sample showed a photo&#8208;induced switch of the blocking temperature (TB) from 3.8&#8197;K for 1Dy@Y to 2.6&#8197;K for 2Dy@Y. This work may inspire the construction of lanthanide&#8208;based molecular materials with targeted photo&#8208;responsive magnetic properties.

         <title>pH&#8208; and Redox&#8208;Responsive Pickering Emulsions Based on Cellulose Nanocrystal Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of the electrostatic interactions between sulfated cellulose nanocrystals (CNC&#8208;OSO3&#8722;) and ferrocenium terminated polystyrene (PS&#8208;Fc+) at the oil&#8208;water interface has resulted in a new type of smart surfactant, termed CNC surfactants. pH&#8208; and redox responsive Pickering emulsions have been achieved by using the CNC surfactants as emulsifiers, with promising applications in encapsulation, biocatalysis, and micro&#8208;reactions.







Abstract
Nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs), formed by using dynamic interactions between nanoparticles and complementary ligands at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface, have emerged as &#8220;smart emulsifiers&#8221; with attributes of high emulsification efficiency, long&#8208;term stability, and on&#8208;demand emulsification/demulsification capabilities. However, only pH&#8208;responsiveness can be adopted for the assembly of reported NPSs formed by electrostatic interactions. Here, we propose an alternative design strategy, by taking advantage of the ferrocenium (Fc+) sulfate ion pair, to develop a new type of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) surfactant. The Fc+ groups are sensitive to pH, redox reagents and voltage, imparting the CNC surfactants and derived Pickering emulsions with multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and showing promising applications in controllable delivery, release, and biphasic biocatalysis.

         <title>A Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Scalable Synthesis and Optimal Adsorption and Desorption for Energy&#8208;Efficient Ethylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel durable metal&#8208;organic framework ZU&#8208;901 with an ideal &#8220;S&#8221; shaped adsorption curve exhibits optimal adsorption and desorption behavior. It satisfies the basic criteria for potential industrial application: easy scale&#8208;up, low cost, and high stability. Benefiting from the continuous rapid ethylene/ethane adsorption&#8208;desorption performance, it is shown to be promising in the pressure&#8208;swing adsorption of ethylene and ethane.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative, but its advancement has been hindered by the challenge of industrially potential adsorbents development. Herein, a novel ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8208;organic framework ZU&#8208;901 is designed that satisfies the basic criteria raised by ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) pressure swing adsorption (PSA). ZU&#8208;901 exhibits an &#8220;S&#8221; shaped C2H4 curve with high sorbent selection parameter (65) and could be mildly regenerated. Through green aqueous&#8208;phase synthesis, ZU&#8208;901 is easily scalable with 99&#8201;% yield, and it is stable in water, acid, basic solutions and cycling breakthrough experiments. Polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (99.51&#8201;%) could be obtained via a simulating two&#8208;bed PSA process, and the corresponding energy consumption is only 1/10 of that of simulating cryogenic distillation. Our work has demonstrated the great potential of pore engineering in designing porous materials with desired adsorption and desorption behavior to implement an efficient PSA process.

         <title>A Simple, Transition Metal Catalyst&#8208;Free Method for the Design of Complex Organic Building Blocks Used to Construct Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology for the synthesis of ligands for large pore metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), based on cyclic diamine building blocks, has been developed. Twenty&#8208;one new carboxylate ligands having 6 different geometries, as well as 16 new MOFs were synthesized.







Abstract
The design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) having large pore sizes and volumes often requires the use of complex organic ligands, currently synthesized using costly and time&#8208;consuming palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling chemistry. Thus, in the present work, a new strategy for ligand design is reported, where piperazine and dihydrophenazine units are used as substitutes for benzene rings, which are the basic building block of most MOF ligands. This chemistry, which is based on simple, nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions, is used for the transition metal catalyst&#8208;free construction of 21 new, carboxylate&#8208;based ligands with varying sizes, shapes, and denticity and 15 linear di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;nitriles. Moreover, to demonstrate the utility of the ligands as building blocks, 16 new structurally diverse MOFs having surface areas up to 3100&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 were also synthesized.

         <title>Molecular Alignment&#8208;Induced Chemically Patchy Uniaxial Nanoparticles and Their Applications in Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Self&#8208;Assembled Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable particle patches were created by controlling the alignment of the molecules that form particles, and chemically patchy uniaxial nanoparticles were synthesized by synchronous polymerization and crystallization of liquid crystal monomers during precipitation polymerization. The resulting patchy particles have intriguing optical properties and show attractive applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and the construction of superstructures.







Abstract
We report an unusual strategy for synthesizing patchy nanoparticles (NPs) by controlling the orientation of the molecules that form the NPs. This is realized by synchronous polymerization and crystallization of liquid crystal (LC) monomers during scalable precipitation polymerization. The resulting NPs are cylinders with highly uniform shapes and have only a single LC domain. The patchy properties originate from the discrepancy of surface chemical compositions on flat and side surfaces and can be switched on and off by solvent. Extra colloidal blocks can be grown onto the patches, resulting in highly uniform triblock patchy dumbbells, which have integrated optical properties, and as demonstrated, show triple&#8208;mode optical authentication in anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels or patterns. We also demonstrate that the triblock patchy cylinders are attractive building blocks for long LC rods or porous colloidal materials through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly.

The one&#8208;electron oxidation converts the ferrocene&#8208;substituted borane into a Lewis Super&#8208;acid, as reported by Frank Breher, Jan Paradies et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202216959). The Lewis Super&#8208;acid activates almost inert carbon&#8211;fluorine and sulfur&#8211;fluorine bonds for reductions, alkylations and arylations in order to form new chemical bonds.

         <title>Unbiased Screening of Novel Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials with High Thermal Conductivity: Long&#8208;neglected Nitrides and Popular Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unbiased high&#8208;throughput screening that merges thermal conductivity estimation is realized, infrared nonlinear optical materials with high thermal conductivity from 100&#8201;000&#8208;level compounds are discovered successfully. 106 compounds show well&#8208;balanced optical performances, including 81 with good thermal conductivity. And unreported chalcogenides with larger SHG response and nitrides with higher thermal conductivity are discovered.







Abstract
Traditional infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials such as AgGaS2 are crucial to key devices for solid&#8208;state lasers, however, low laser damage thresholds intrinsically hinder their practical application. Here, a robust strategy is proposed for unbiased high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 140&#8201;000 materials to explore novel IR NLO materials with high thermal conductivity and wide band gap which are crucial to intrinsic laser damage threshold. Via our strategy, 106 compounds with desired band gaps, NLO coefficients and thermal conductivity are screened out, including 8 nitrides, 68 chalcogenides, in which Sr2SnS4 is synthesized to verify the reliability of our process. Remarkably, thermal conductivity of nitrides is much higher than that of chalcogenides, e.g., 5&#215;AgGaS2 (5.13&#8197;W/m&#8201;K) for ZrZnN2, indicating that nitrides could be a long&#8208;neglected system for IR NLO materials. This strategy provides a powerful tool for searching NLO compounds with high thermal conductivity.

         <dc:description>
A Rh+/H8&#8208;binap complex catalyzes the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of three unsymmetric 2&#960; components. The two&#8208;component [2+2+2] cycloaddition of two arylacetylenes and cis&#8208;enamides yields protected chiral cyclohexadienylamines. Replacing one arylacetylene with a silylacetylene enables the three&#8208;component [2+2+2] cycloaddition.







Abstract
We have developed the Rh+/H8&#8208;binap&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of three unsymmetric 2&#960; components. Thus, two arylacetylenes react with a cis&#8208;enamide to yield a protected chiral cyclohexadienylamine. Moreover, replacing one arylacetylene with a silylacetylene enables the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of three distinct unsymmetric 2&#960; components. These transformations proceed with excellent selectivity (complete regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity and up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Mechanistic studies suggest the chemo&#8208; and regioselective formation of a rhodacyclopentadiene intermediate from the two terminal alkynes.

         <title>Synthesis of BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 Chalcogenide Perovskite Films Using Single&#8208;Phase Molecular Precursors at Moderate Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a single&#8208;phase, solution&#8208;processed approach to create thin films of BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 at temperatures of 575&#8201;&#176;C with sulfurization times as short as 20&#8197;min. To create molecular precursor inks, we utilized known carbon disulfide insertion chemistry to synthesize Group 4 metal dithiocarbamates and extended this chemistry to create species such as barium dithiocarboxylates, that have not been reported before.







Abstract
Chalcogenide perovskites have garnered interest for applications in semiconductor devices due to their excellent predicted optoelectronic properties and stability. However, high synthesis temperatures have historically made these materials incompatible with the creation of photovoltaic devices. Here, we demonstrate the solution processed synthesis of luminescent BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 chalcogenide perovskite films using single&#8208;phase molecular precursors at sulfurization temperatures of 575&#8201;&#176;C and sulfurization times as short as one hour. These molecular precursor inks were synthesized using known carbon disulfide insertion chemistry to create Group 4 metal dithiocarbamates, and this chemistry was extended to create species, such as barium dithiocarboxylates, that have never been reported before. These findings, with added future research, have the potential to yield fully solution processed thin films of chalcogenide perovskites for various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Post&#8208;Assembly Modification of Homochiral Titanium&#8211;Organic Cages for Recognition and Separation of Molecular Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral metal&#8211;organic cage has been extended and introduced into a porous framework by using a post&#8208;assembly modification strategy. The microporous frameworks were successfully utilized for the recognition and separation of isomeric molecules, including aromatic compounds, nitriles, and chiral aromatic alcohols.







Abstract
A chiral metal&#8211;organic cage (MOC) was extended and fixed into a porous framework using a post&#8208;assembly modification strategy, which made it easier to study the host&#8211;guest chemistry of the solid&#8208;state MOC using a single&#8208;crystal diffraction technique. Anionic Ti4L6 (L=embonate) cage can be used as a 4&#8208;connecting crystal engineering tecton, and its optical resolution was achieved, thus homochiral &#916;&#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208; and &#923;&#923;&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ti4L6] cages were obtained. Accordingly, a pair of homochiral cage&#8208;based microporous frameworks (PTC&#8208;236(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;236(&#923;)) were easily prepared by a post&#8208;assembly reaction. PTC&#8208;236 has rich recognition sites provided by the Ti4L6 moieties, chiral channels and high framework stability, affording a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation for guest structure analyses. Thus it was successfully utilized for the recognition and separation of isomeric molecules. This study provides a new approach for the orderly combination of well&#8208;defined MOCs into functional porous frameworks.

&lt;p&gt;A chiral metal&#8211;organic cage has been extended and introduced into a porous framework by using a post-assembly modification strategy. The microporous frameworks were successfully utilized for the recognition and separation of isomeric molecules, including aromatic compounds, nitriles, and chiral aromatic alcohols.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral metal&#8211;organic cage (MOC) was extended and fixed into a porous framework using a post-assembly modification strategy, which made it easier to study the host&#8211;guest chemistry of the solid-state MOC using a single-crystal diffraction technique. Anionic Ti&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (L=embonate) cage can be used as a 4-connecting crystal engineering tecton, and its optical resolution was achieved, thus homochiral &#916;&#916;&#916;&#916;- and &#923;&#923;&#923;&#923;-[Ti&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] cages were obtained. Accordingly, a pair of homochiral cage-based microporous frameworks (&lt;b&gt;PTC-236(&#916;)&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PTC-236(&#923;)&lt;/b&gt;) were easily prepared by a post-assembly reaction. &lt;b&gt;PTC-236&lt;/b&gt; has rich recognition sites provided by the Ti&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; moieties, chiral channels and high framework stability, affording a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation for guest structure analyses. Thus it was successfully utilized for the recognition and separation of isomeric molecules.

         <title>High&#8208;Porosity Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glasses of carboxylate linkages were synthesized by reacting Ti&#8208;oxo clusters with carboxylic acid linkers. The activated MOF glass showed a N2 Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface area of 923&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly three times as high as the phenolate&#8208;linked MOF glass with the highest BET surface area prior to this report.







Abstract
We report a synthetic strategy to link titanium&#8208;oxo (Ti&#8208;oxo) clusters into metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glasses with high porosity though the carboxylate linkage. A new series of MOF glasses was synthesized by evaporation of solution containing Ti&#8208;oxo clusters Ti16O16(OEt)32, linkers, and m&#8208;cresol. The formation of carboxylate linkages between the Ti&#8208;oxo clusters and the carboxylate linkers was confirmed by Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy. The structural integrity of the Ti&#8208;oxo clusters within the glasses was evidenced by both X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and 17O magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR. After ligand exchange and activation, the fumarate&#8208;linked MOF glass, termed Ti&#8208;Fum, showed a N2 Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface areas of 923&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly three times as high as the phenolate&#8208;linked MOF glass with the highest BET surface area prior to this report.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for C6 Alkane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview summarizes the recent advancement in developing MOFs as energy&#8208;efficient adsorbents for the separation of C6 alkane isomers based on different separation mechanisms. Particular emphasis is made on the design and tailoring of their structures and pore properties to achieve optimal separation performance. Existing challenges and possible solutions, as well as future directions of this important research field is also discussed.







Abstract
The separation of alkane isomers is an important yet challenging process in the petrochemical industry. Being a crucial step to produce premium gasoline components as well as optimum ethylene feed, the current industrial separation by distillation is extremely energy intensive. Adsorptive separation based on zeolite is limited by insufficient adsorption capacity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold enormous promise as alternative adsorbents due to their diverse structural tunability and exceptional porosity. Precise control of their pore geometry/dimensions has led to superior performance. In this minireview, we highlight the recent progresses in developing MOFs for the separation of C6 alkane isomers. Representative MOFs are reviewed based on their separation mechanisms. Emphasis is put on the material design rationale for achieving optimal separation capability. Finally, we briefly discuss the existing challenges, possible solutions, and future directions of this important field.

         <title>Pore Aperture Control Toward Size&#8208;Exclusion&#8208;Based Hydrocarbon Separations</title>

Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom tuning and control of pore aperture in metal&#8211;organic frameworks was achieved through expansion of linker dimensionality for selective separation of linear, monobranched, and dibranched hexane isomers.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed as a promising material for non&#8208;thermal chemical separations owing to their high structural diversity and tunability. Here, we report the synthesis of a zinc&#8208;based MOF containing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) linker, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, with high thermal stability towards the separation of hexane isomers. The incorporation of the 3D linker enhances the structural stability and provides well&#8208;defined pore apertures/channels with sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom precision. This precision allowed for the separation of similarly sized hexane isomers based on subtle differences in their kinetic diameters. Multi&#8208;component liquid phase batch experiments confirmed the separation of hexanes mixture into linear, monobranched, and dibranched isomers. This work represents a significant milestone in the construction of stable Zn&#8208;based MOFs and the incorporation of 3D linkers as a potential solution to challenging separations.

         <title>A Diode&#8208;Like Dye&#8208;Cu Anisotropic Junction in a Coordination Polymer as a Logic State Ratchet for Intratumor Redox Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By merging CuII ions and diphenylphenazine carboxylate ligands with discrete HOMO&#8211;LUMO dye sections, a multistable radical cationic coordination polymer with an anisotropic dye&#8208;Cu junction was constructed to achieve a diode&#8208;inspired unidirectional electron transfer and redox logic ratchet for the first time. Additionally, this material showed great potential for intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy. @ZhangTiexin







Abstract
Redox logic materials offer new avenues to modulate intracellular pathologic redox environment area&#8208;specifically, but the unambiguity of redox logic states and their unidirectional and repetitive switchability are challenging to realize. By merging a bistable diisophthalic phenazine dye ligand with CuII salt, a multistable coordination polymer (CP) was constructed, of which the dye&#8208;Cu anisotropic junction achieved the diode&#8208;like unidirectional electron transfer and logic state ratchet for the first time. Radical cationic CP maintained OFF status with low toxicity in healthy tissues, but was reduced to the neutral SERVO state by the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in hypoxic tumors. After photoirradiation, the stabilized charge&#8208;separated ON status promoted photo&#8208;Fenton reaction for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal transduction, and simultaneously recovered the initial state for catalytic signal amplification of ROS, furnishing intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy.

         <title>Direct &#960;&#8208;Activation vs. O&#8208;Activation in Halogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen Bond (XB) donors are under active development in organocatalysis. In analogy to Hydrogen Bond (HB) donors, they have been considered to activate most organic substrates through the O&#8208;complexation of carbonyl groups. Our results suggest that direct &#960;&#8208;activation (i.e., of the &#960;&#8208;bond involved in the reaction) can be dominant in many cases of XB catalysis, largely altering our view on this type of catalysis.







Abstract
Halogen bond donors had an increasing impact on catalysis in recent years, and their development is highly active. In particular, numerous iodine&#8208;based halogen bond donors have been developed and used to promote various reactions through coordinating carbonyl groups, a ubiquitous mode of activation in catalysis. We now report computational data which strongly suggests that an alternative activation mode, through direct &#960;&#8208;complexation, is operative for unsaturated carbonyl substrates. Calculations also suggest that solvent polarity could have a clear impact on the preference of the mode of activation, raising the possibility of a mechanistic manifold switch through solvent variation.

     alt="Direct &#960;-Activation vs. O-Activation in Halogen-Bonding Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halogen Bond (XB) donors are under active development in organocatalysis. In analogy to Hydrogen Bond (HB) donors, they have been considered to activate most organic substrates through the &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-complexation of carbonyl groups. Our results suggest that direct &#960;-activation (i.e., of the &#960;-bond involved in the reaction) can be dominant in many cases of XB catalysis, largely altering our view on this type of catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halogen bond donors had an increasing impact on catalysis in recent years, and their development is highly active. In particular, numerous iodine-based halogen bond donors have been developed and used to promote various reactions through coordinating carbonyl groups, a ubiquitous mode of activation in catalysis. We now report computational data which strongly suggests that an alternative activation mode, through direct &#960;-complexation, is operative for unsaturated carbonyl substrates. Calculations also suggest that solvent polarity could have a clear impact on the preference of the mode of activation, raising the possibility of a mechanistic manifold switch through solvent variation. These findings could profoundly impact the development of the next generation of halogen-bond donor catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework (COF) anode with acid&#8211;alkaline co&#8208;tolerance, long cycle life and high rate&#8208;performance was developed for aqueous batteries. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202218745), Haiyan Zhang, Chunyi Zhi, Haiming Lv et&#8197;al. designed the robust covalent linkage (&#8722;NH&#8722;) and the hydrogen bond network between &#8208;NH&#8208; and H2O, which collectively improve the chemical stability and promote the rapid conduction of H+/OH&#8722; by the Grotthuss mechanism. Thus the COF displays superior stability and rate&#8208;performance.

         <title>Sulfonyl&#8211;PYBOX Ligands Enable Kinetic Resolution of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Azides by CuAAC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first highly selective kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;chiral azides via Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Newly developed pyridine&#8211;bisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands bearing a C4 sulfonyl group enable effective kinetic resolution of racemic azides derived from privileged scaffolds such as indanone, cyclopentenone and oxindole, and their asymmetric CuAAC to afford &#945;&#8208;tertiary 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles in high to excellent ee values. Theoretical studies by DFT calculation and control experiments reveal the role of C4 sulfonyl is to decrease the Lewis basicity of ligand to increase the electrophilicity of the copper center for better recognition of azides, and to function as a shielding group to make the chiral pocket of the catalyst more effective.</dc:description>

         <title>Study of intermolecular reconfiguration of flexible COF&#8208;5 film and its ultra&#8208;high chemiresistive humidity sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, abundant active materials are developed to achieve the wearable detection of human body humidity. However, the limited response signal and sensitivity restrict further application due to their moderate affinity to water. Herein, we propose a flexible COF&#8208;5 film synthesized by a brief vapor&#8208;assisted method at room temperature. Intermediates are calculated by DTF simulation to investigate the interaction between COF&#8208;5 and water. The adsorption and desorption of water molecule result in a reversible deformation of COF layers while creating new conductive path by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. The as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;5 films are applied to the flexible humidity sensors, exhibiting a resistance change in 4 orders of magnitude with remarkable linear relation between log function of resistance and relative humidity (RH) in 11%&#8208;98% RH range. Applications including respiratory monitoring and non&#8208;contact switch are tested, providing a promising prospect for the detection of human body humidity.</dc:description>

         <title>Multitargeted Platinum(IV) Anticancer Complexes Bearing Pyridinyl Ligands as Axial Leaving Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although multitargeted Pt(IV) anticancer prodrugs have shown significant activities in reducing drug resistance, the types of bioactive ligands and drugs that can be conjugated to the Pt center, remain limited to O&#8208;donors. Herein, we report the synthesis of Pt(IV) complexes bearing axial pyridines via ligand exchange reactions. Unexpectedly, the axial pyridines are quickly released after reduction, indicating their potential to be utilized as axial leaving groups. We further expand our synthetic approach to obtaining two multitargeted Pt(IV) prodrugs containing bioactive pyridinyl ligands: a PARP inhibitor and an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor; these conjugates exhibit great potential for overcoming drug resistance, and the latter conjugate inhibits the growth of Pt&#8208;resistant tumor in vivo. This research adds to the array of synthetic methods for accessing Pt(IV) prodrugs and significantly increases the types of bioactive axial ligands that can be conjugated to a Pt(IV) center.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Pairing&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement from Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diads Decorated with Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane as an Electrochemical Protector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports an effective peripheral decoration of organic donor&#8208;acceptor diads with B(C6F5)3 for stabilizing electrogenerated radical ions. By employing a common p&#8208;type organic semiconductor benzothienobenzothiophene (BTBT) as the donor, tetracoordinate boron complexes improved solution electrochemi&#8208;luminescence (ECL) intensity, reaching a 156&#8208;fold increase compared to that of the parent diad. The unprecedented Lewis pairing&#8208;induced ECL enhancement is attributed to the multiple roles of B(C6F5)3: 1) redistributing frontier orbitals, 2) facilitating electrochemical excitation, and 3) restricting molecular motions. Furthermore, B(C6F5)3 converted the molecular arrangement of BTBT from conventional 2D herringbones to 1D p&#8208;stacks. This robust, highly ordered columnar nanostructure allowed red&#8208;shifting of crystalline film ECL with electrochemical doping along the electronic coupling pathways of BTBT. Our approach will facilitate the development of elaborate metal&#8208;free ECL systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells in different states can release diverse types of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in intracellular communication or pathological processes. The identification and isolation of EV subpopulations are significant to explore their physiological functions and clinical value. In this study, structurally heterogeneous T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR)&#8208;CD3 EVs were proposed and verified for the first time using a caliper strategy. Two CD3&#8208;targeting aptamers were designed in the shape of a caliper with an optimized probe distance and were assembled on gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;Caliper) to distinguish TCR&#8208;CD3 monomeric and dimeric EVs (m/dCD3 EVs) in skin&#8208;transplanted mouse plasma. Phenotyping and sequencing analysis revealed clear heterogeneity in the isolated m/dCD3 EVs, providing the potential for mCD3 EVs as a candidate biomarker of acute cellular rejection (ACR) and holding great prospects for distinguishing EV subpopulations based on protein oligomerization states.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8211;C Cleavage of Methylenecyclobutanes for &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes by Strain Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical additions onto olefines have surfaced as an increasingly powerful strategy for the synthesis of difunctionalized scaffolds. However, despite of major advances, known approaches continue to be largely limited to two manifolds, namely 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes and remote difunctionalization via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Herein, we describe a mechanistically distinct approach by photo&#8208;induced carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8211;C) activation/ring&#8208;opening to access  &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from methylenecyclobutanols and sulfonyl chlorides by strain release. Remarkably, the sulfonyl motif on the products was easily removed by another photocatalytic process, which enabled the concise assembly of the natural product alatanone A. The synthetic utility of our approach was reflected by versatile functional group tolerance, ample substrate scope, and scalability. The photocatalysis represents a conceptually distinct alternative to existing approaches for remote 1,4&#8208;diversifications, with a double bond remaining in the thus obtained products.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Azulene&#8208;embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Knoevenagel&#8208;type Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The research interest in azulene&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has significantly increased recently, but the lack of efficient synthetic strategy impedes the investigation of their structure&#8208;property relation and further opto&#8208;electronic applications. Here we report a novel modular synthetic strategy towards diverse azulene&#8208;embedded PAHs via a tandem Suzuki coupling and base&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel&#8208;type condensation with good yields and great structural versatility, including non&#8208;alternant thiophene&#8208;rich PAHs, butterfly&#8208; or Z&#8208;shaped PAHs bearing two azulene units, and the first example of two&#8208;azulene&#8208;embedded double [5]helicene. The structural topology, aromaticity and photophysical properties were investigated by NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy assisted by DFT calculations. This strategy provides a new platform for rapidly synthesizing unexplored non&#8208;alternant PAHs or even graphene nanoribbons with multiple azulene units.</dc:description>

         <title>Red Emissive Double Aza[7]helicenes with Antiaromaticity/Aromaticity Switching via the Redox&#8208;Induced Radical Cation and Dication Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein present the synthetic approach to a new antiaromatic double aza[7]helicene C that features NN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This heteroatom&#8208;doped helicene showed a rarely obtained long&#8208;wavelength emission and far&#8208; red circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state. These optical and chiroptical properties could be ascribed to both the NN&#8208;PAH core structure and the further extension via angular ring fusions. Such a unique electronic structure also culminated in facile chemical oxidations of neutral C to the positively charged chiral radical (C&#8226;+) and dication species (C2+). Interestingly, DFT computations revealed that the pyridazine central core showed an antiaromaticity&#8208;to&#8208;aromaticity switching, in contrast to the inversed transition for the helical periphery in cationic states. The reported approaches are anticipated to further develop redox&#8208;active chiral systems for potential applications in chiroptoelectronics, spintronics as well as fluorescent bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Multimodal Analysis of Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Nanoporous Block Copolymer Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis is a cornerstone of sustainable energy conversion. Most catalytic studies focus on bulk analyses of the hydrogen and oxygen evolved, which impede the correlation of matrix heterogeneities, molecular features, and bulk reactivity. Here, we report studies of a heterogenized catalyst / photosensitizer system using a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst and a model, molecular photosensitizer that were co&#8208;immobilized within a nanoporous block copolymer membrane. Via operando scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), light&#8208;induced oxygen evolution was determined using sodium peroxodisulfate (Na2S2O8) as sacrificial electron acceptor. Ex situ element analyses provided spatially resolved information on the local concentration and distribution of the molecular components. Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR&#8208;ATR) studies of the modified membranes showed no degradation of the water oxidation catalyst under the reported light&#8208;driven conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We developed a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in&#8208;situ synthesize new aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based free&#8208;standing porous organic polymer films at room temperature. The crystalline properties of POP films were confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The good porosity of these POP films was proved by their N2 uptake experiments. The thickness of POP films can be easily regulated from 16 nm to ~1 &#956;m by adjusting monomer concentration. More importantly, these AIEgen&#8208;based POP films show bright luminescence with high absolute photoluminescent quantum yields up to 37.8% and good chemical and thermal stability. The AIEgen&#8208;based POP film can encapsulate an organic dye (e.g., Nile red) to further form an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with a large red&#8208;shift (&#916;&#955; = 141 nm), highly efficient energy&#8208;transfer ability (&#934;ET = 91%), and high antenna effect (11.3).</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly as a Tool To Preserve the Electronic Purity of Perylene Diimide Chromophores
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analysis of the photophysics of a supramolecular pseudo&#8208;cube formed from perylene diimide (PDI) chromophores shows that, in contrast to the rapid excited&#8208;state quenching observed upon uncontrolled aggregation of chromophores, the shape&#8208;persistent cage retains the electronic purity of the PDIs. This allows delayed fluorescence arising from an excited multimer to be observed and showcases molecular self&#8208;assembly as a powerful tool in organic electronics.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors are promising for efficient, printable optoelectronics. However, strong excited&#8208;state quenching due to uncontrolled aggregation limits their use in devices. We report on the self&#8208;assembly of a supramolecular pseudo&#8208;cube formed from six perylene diimides (PDIs). The rigid, shape&#8208;persistent cage sets the distance and orientation of the PDIs and suppresses intramolecular rotations and vibrations, leading to non&#8208;aggregated, monomer&#8208;like properties in solution and the solid state, in contrast to the fast fluorescence quenching in the free ligand. The stabilized excited state and electronic purity in the cage enables the observation of delayed fluorescence due to a bright excited multimer, acting as excited&#8208;state reservoir in a rare case of benign inter&#8208;chromophore interactions in the cage. We show that self&#8208;assembly provides a powerful tool for retaining and controlling the electronic properties of chromophores, and to bring molecular electronics devices within reach.

         <title>Open&#8208;Cage Fullerene as a Selective Molecular Trap for LiF/[BeF]+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative (trap) was prepared with a hydroxy group (bait/hook) pointing towards the center of the cavity and a diphenyl pocket above the 21&#8208;membered orifice. The hydroxy group could coordinate lithium and beryllium cations, which led to the encapsulation of LiF and [BeF]+ in the fullerene. The hydroxy group was also shown to form hydrogen bonds with molecules such as water, methanol, and ethanol in the diphenyl pocket.







Abstract
The insertion of ionic compounds into open&#8208;cage fullerenes is a challenging task due to the electropositive nature of the cavity. The present work reports the preparation of an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative with a hydroxy group pointing towards the centre of the cavity, which can coordinate to a metal cation, thus acting as a bait/hook to trap the metal cation such as the lithium cation in neutral LiF and the beryllium cation in the cationic [BeF]+ species. Other metal salts could not be inserted under similar conditions. The structure of MF in the cage was unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Owing to its tendency to undergo polycoordination, Li+ monomer salts have not been isolated before, despite extensive research on Li bonds. The present results provide a unique example of a Li bond.

&lt;p&gt;An open-cage fullerene derivative (trap) was prepared with a hydroxy group (bait/hook) pointing towards the center of the cavity and a diphenyl pocket above the 21-membered orifice. The hydroxy group could coordinate lithium and beryllium cations, which led to the encapsulation of LiF and [BeF]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the fullerene. The hydroxy group was also shown to form hydrogen bonds with molecules such as water, methanol, and ethanol in the diphenyl pocket.

         <title>Controlling the Fluorescence Performance of AIE Polymers by Controlling the Polymer Microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling fluorescence efficiency is achieved without changing emission wavelength/color by controlling the (co)polymer chemical structures/physical properties, including molecular weight, crystallinity, monomer composition, glass transition temperature, side length, and flexibility/rigidity of the chain.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) polymers with expected emission wavelength/color and fluorescence efficiency are valuable in applications. However, most AIE polymers exhibit irregular emission wavelength/color changes compared to the original AIE monomers. Here, we report the synthesis of AIE polymers with unchanged emission wavelength by ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerizations of 4&#8208;(triphenylethenyl)phenoxymethyloxirane (TPEO) and other epoxides or phthalic anhydride. The chemical structures/physical properties of all (co)polymers were characterized by NMR, SEC, MALDI&#8208;TOF, and DSC. The co&#8208;polyether microstructures were revealed by calculating the reactivity ratios and visualized by Monte Carlo simulation. The photoluminescence quantum yields of all the (co)polymers were determined in the solid state. We systematically correlated the fluorescence performance with molecular weights, crystallinity, monomer compositions, glass transition temperatures, side lengths, and flexibility/rigidity.

         <title>Porous and Water Stable 2D Hybrid Metal Halide with Broad Light Emission and Selective H2O Vapor Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous and water&#8208;stable hybrid semiconductors pose as multifunctional materials combining traits that are essential for demanding commercial applications. A strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide semiconductors by using molecular cages as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations is reported. This strategy gave rise to a direct band gap semiconductor, with record water stability and selective vapor&#8208;sorption.







Abstract
In this work we report a strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide materials using molecular cages that serve as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations. Reaction of the [2.2.2] cryptand (DHS) linker with PbII in acidic media gave rise to the first porous and water&#8208;stable 2D metal halide semiconductor (DHS)2Pb5Br14. The corresponding material is stable in water for a year, while gas and vapor&#8208;sorption studies revealed that it can selectively and reversibly adsorb H2O and D2O at room temperature (RT). Solid&#8208;state NMR measurements and DFT calculations verified the incorporation of H2O and D2O in the organic linker cavities and shed light on their molecular configuration. In addition to porosity, the material exhibits broad light emission centered at 617&#8197;nm with a full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 284&#8197;nm (0.96&#8197;eV). The recorded water stability is unparalleled for hybrid metal halide and perovskite materials, while the generation of porosity opens new pathways towards unexplored applications (e.g. solid&#8208;state batteries) for this class of hybrid semiconductors.

We report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the design of a new class of L&#8208;shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy=imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in a locked conformation. Experimental and DFT studies demonstrate pivotal stabilization of AuIII species by the hemilabile nitrogen for successful AuI/AuIII catalysis.







Abstract
In the last decade, major advances have been made in homogeneous gold catalysis. However, AuI/AuIII catalytic cycle remains much less explored due to the reluctance of AuI to undergo oxidative addition and the stability of the AuIII intermediate. Herein, we report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the development of a new class of L&#8208;shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy=imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in combination with strong &#963;&#8208;donation of the carbene center in a rigid conformation, imposed by the ligand architecture. Detailed characterization and control studies reveal key ligand features for AuI/AuIII redox cycle, wherein the hemilabile nitrogen is placed at the coordinating position of a rigid framework. Given the tremendous significance of homogeneous gold catalysis, we anticipate that this ligand platform will find widespread application.

         <title>Perfluoroalkyl Selenoxides, Selenones and Selenoximines: General Preparation and Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides, selenones and selenoximines was possible through a selective oxidation of perfluoroalkyl selenoethers. Synthesis of perfluoroalkyl selenoxides was also described via a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction from selenocyanates. The perfluoroalkyl selenoximine family was synthesized. The Hansch&#8208;Leo parameters of the compounds were determined and some aryl perfluoroalkyl selenoxides were separated by chiral HPLC.







Abstract
A selective access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides, via Oxone&#174; as oxidant or to selenones by using a Polyoxometalate&#8208;based Ionic Liquid (POM&#8208;IL) as a catalyst for the oxidation step is described. The reaction works with various perfluoralkyl chains and substituents with satisfactory to excellent yields. A two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction from selenocyanates was performed to gain access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides. The previously unknown perfluoroalkyl selenoximines family was also prepared with good yields. Having unlocked two strategies for the synthesis of fluoroalkylated SeIV and SeVI compounds, we then evaluated the Hansch&#8208;Leo lipophilicity parameters of these groups. Finally, asymmetric aryl perfluoroalkyl selenoximines were resolved to determine their absolute configurations.

         <title>A Polymeric Extracellular Matrix Nanoremodeler for Activatable Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer&#8208;based extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeler (SPNcb) with photodynamic antitumor activity and inhibition of collagen&#8208;crosslinking enzymes is developed for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNcb&#8208;mediated ECM&#8208;remodeling therapy synergizes with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to reinvigorate cytotoxic T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has shown tremendous potential to train the intrinsic immune system against malignancy in the clinic. However, the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor microenvironment is a formidable barrier that not only restricts the penetration of therapeutic drugs but also prevents the infiltration of antitumor immune cells. We herein report a semiconducting polymer&#8208;based ECM nanoremodeler (SPNcb) to combine photodynamic antitumor activity with cancer&#8208;specific inhibition of collagen&#8208;crosslinking enzymes (lysyl oxidase (LOX) family) for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNcb is self&#8208;assembled from an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer conjugated with a LOX inhibitor (&#946;&#8208;aminopropionitrile, BAPN) via a cancer biomarker (cathepsin B, CatB)&#8208;cleavable segment. BAPN can be exclusively activated to inhibit LOX activity in the presence of the tumor&#8208;overexpressed CatB, thus blocking collagen crosslinking and decreasing ECM stiffness. Such an ECM nanoremodeler synergizes immunogenic phototherapy and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to improve the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.

         <title>Benzotrithiophene&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts with Controlled Conjugation of Building Blocks for Charge Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzotrithiophene (BTT) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared with different electron accepting units, which could be attributable to the photocatalytic reduction reaction. Based on both experimental results and theoretical calculations, the photocatalytic performance of BTT&#8208;COFs closely depended on the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks have recently shown high potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, their structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship has not been sufficiently explored to identify a research direction for structural design. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of four benzotrithiophene (BTT)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different conjugations of building units, and their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. All four BTT&#8208;COFs had slipped parallel stacking patterns with high crystallinity and specific surface areas. The change in the degree of conjugation was found to rationally tune the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Based on the experimental and calculation results, the tunable photocatalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units. This study provides important insights for designing covalent organic frameworks for efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>A Double Atomic&#8208;Tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG Nanostructure with Optimum Charge Redistribution for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double atomic&#8208;tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG nanostructure was prepared by one&#8208;step pyrolysis method. The electron density on surface of Ru nanoparticle can be synergistically modulated by alloyed Bi single atom and adjacent Bi&#8722;O single site leading to optimum charge redistribution. Thus, the resulting RuBi SAA/Bi@OG exhibits superior alkaline HER activity.







Abstract
Charge redistribution on surface of Ru nanoparticle can significantly affect electrocatalytic HER activity. Herein, a double atomic&#8208;tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG nanostructure that features RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticle supported by Bi&#8722;O single&#8208;site&#8208;doped graphene was successfully developed by one&#8208;step pyrolysis method. The alloyed Bi single atom and adjacent Bi&#8722;O single site in RuBi SAA/Bi@OG can synergistically manipulate electron transfer on Ru surface leading to optimum charge redistribution. Thus, the resulting RuBi SAA/Bi@OG exhibits superior alkaline HER activity. Its mass activity is up to 65000&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 150&#8197;mV, which is 72.2&#8197;times as much as that of commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations reveal that the RuBi SAA/Bi@OG possesses the optimum charge redistribution, which is most beneficial to strengthen adsorption of water and weaken hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy in HER process. This double atomic&#8208;tuned strategy on surface charge redistribution of Ru nanoparticle opens a new way to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
The in situ polymerization of solid&#8208;state dioxolane electrolytes on interconnected CNTs and active materials is the key to realize excellent interfacial contact. Electrons/ions enable full access to active materials in the whole electrode. Therefore, the integrated batteries demonstrated high energy density, amazing charge/discharge rate and long cycle life.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are promising and safe energy storage devices for mobile electronics and electric vehicles. In this work, we report a facile in situ polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane electrolytes to fabricate integrated solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The in situ polymerization and formation of solid&#8208;state dioxolane electrolytes on interconnected carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and active materials is the key to realizing a high&#8208;performance battery with excellent interfacial contact among CNTs, active materials and electrolytes. Therefore, the electrodes could be tightly integrated into batteries through the CNTs and electrolyte. Electrons/ions enable full access to active materials in the whole electrode. Electrodes with a low resistance of 4.5&#8197;&#937;&#8201;&#9633;&#8722;1 and high lithium&#8208;ion diffusion efficiency of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 can significantly improve the electrochemical kinetics. Subsequently, the batteries demonstrated high energy density, amazing charge/discharge rate and long cycle life.

         <title>Metalla&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement in Gold&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Reaction: A New Elementary Reaction Suggested for Future Reaction Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first computational evidence for the involvement of metalla&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement (MCR) in the gold&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] reaction of yne&#8208;dienes, together with detailed analysis of different pathways and their competition. Such a MCR does not take place when the reaction is run under rhodium catalysis. The reasons behind this are given.







Abstract
We report here computational evidence for a metalla&#8208;Claisen rearrangement (MCR) in the case of gold&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of yne&#8208;dienes. The [4+2] reaction starts from exo cyclopropanation, followed by MCR and reductive elimination. The cyclopropane moiety formed in the first step is crucial for a low barrier of the MCR step. In addition, the importance of an appropriate combination of the tether group and the terminal substituent on alkyne in the yne&#8208;diene substrates was studied. The mechanism of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] reaction of yne&#8208;dienes was also investigated to see whether an MCR mechanism is involved or not. The findings and new understanding hereby reported represent an important advance in the catalysis field.

         <title>Stereospecific Oxycyanation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Cyanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular oxycyanation of alkenes using p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN) in the presence of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as a catalyst was shown to be feasible. The developed method offers a simple, scalable, and straightforward approach to access synthetically useful &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile derivatives.







Abstract
Oxycyanation of alkenes would allow the direct construction of useful &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile scaffolds. However, only limited examples of such reactions have been reported, and some problems including limited substrate scope and the lack of diastereocontrol in the case of the oxycyanation of internal alkenes have arisen. We herein report on the intermolecular oxycyanation of alkenes using p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN) in the presence of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as a catalyst, affording products that contain a sulfinyloxy group and a cyano group at the vicinal position. The reaction features a stereospecific syn&#8208;addition. The reaction also shows a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations by experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the reaction proceeds via an unprecedented stereospecific mechanism through the electrophilic cyanation of alkenes, in which B(C6F5)3 efficiently activates TsCN through the coordination of the cyano group to the boron center.

         <title>Bandgap&#8208;Engineered Germanene Nanosheets as an Efficient Photodynamic Agent for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;terminated germanene nanosheets with a biomedically favorable direct band gap were synthesized by a simple surface chemical modulation and can be applied to cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). The surface chemical modulation strategy addresses the major medical application challenges of Xenes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) science.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monoelemental materials (Xenes) show considerable potential in bioapplications owing to their unique 2D physicochemical features and the favored biosafety resulting from their monoelemental composition. However, the narrow band gaps of Xenes prevent their broad applications in biosensors, bioimaging and phototherapeutics. In this study, it is demonstrated that 2D germanene terminated with &#8722;H via surface chemical engineering, shows a much broadened direct band gap of 1.65&#8197;eV, which enables the material to be used as a novel inorganic photosensitizer for the photodynamic therapy of singlet oxygen. Through theoretical analysis and in vitro studies, H&#8208;germanene nanosheets demonstrate a substantially enlarged band gap and favorable biodegradability, demonstrating a substantial cancer treatment capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of constructing novel therapeutic photodynamic agents by surface covalent engineering for catalytic tumor therapy.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Multiple Charge Separation by Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple charge separation with a long lifetime has been realized in an organic cocrystal by a proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer reaction under irradiation with light. The enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths can be applied for near&#8208;infrared imaging and bacterial inhibition.







Abstract
Multiple charge separation has been successfully realized by a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction in an organic cocrystal. Benefiting from the adjustable electronic energy level of the electron donor and acceptor through thermal&#8208;induced proton migration, distinct optical absorption behaviors combined with color changes to blue or green are observed in these charge&#8208;separated states. It is of interest to note that such charge&#8208;separated states exhibit a longer lifetime of over a month as a result of the excellent coplanarity and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction of the electron acceptors. Moreover, the enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths endows the charge&#8208;separated state with near&#8208;infrared (808&#8197;nm) photothermal conversion for imaging and bacterial inhibition, whereby the conversion performance can be controlled by the degree of proton migration.

         <title>A Symmetry&#8208;Broken Charge&#8208;Separated State in the Marcus Inverted Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the Marcus&#8208;inverted&#8208;region&#8208;assisted evolution of a long&#8208;lived symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state in a near&#8208;orthogonal bichromophoric system consisting of perylenediimide dimers.







Abstract
We report a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state in a chromophoric pair (DC&#8208;PDI2) that uniquely integrates the advantages of fundamental processes of photosynthetic reaction centers: i) Symmetry&#8208;breaking charge&#8208;separation (SB&#8208;CS) and ii) Marcus&#8208;inverted&#8208;region dependence. The near&#8208;orthogonal bichromophoric DC&#8208;PDI2 manifests an ultrafast evolution of the SB&#8208;CS state with a time constant of 
=0.35&#177;0.02&#8197;ps and a slow charge recombination (CR) kinetics with 
=4.09&#177;0.01&#8197;ns in ACN. The rate constant of CR of DC&#8208;PDI2 is 11&#8201;686 times slower than SB&#8208;CS in ACN, as the CR of the PDI radical ion&#8208;pair occurs in the deep inverted region of the Marcus parabola (
&gt;&#955;). In contrast, an analogous benzyloxy (BnO)&#8208;substituted DC&#8208;BPDI2 showcases a &#8776;10&#8208;fold accelerated CR kinetics with 
 lowering to &#8776;1536 in ACN, by virtue of a decreased CR driving force. The present investigation demonstrates a control of molecular engineering to tune the energetics and kinetics of the SB&#8208;CS material, which is essential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Bridged Heterometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets Incorporating Four Lanthanoceniums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;bridged organometallic heterometallic single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) were isolated for the first time, representing a new class of organometallic lanthanide (Ln) SMMs. The novel strategy effectively overcomes the limited number of metal centers in radical&#8208;bridged Ln&#8208;SMMs, opening up new ways to construct larger strongly coupled Ln&#8208;SMMs.







Abstract
The syntheses and magnetic properties of organometallic heterometallic compounds [K(THF)6]{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (1&#8208;RE) and [K(Crypt)]2{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (2&#8208;RE) containing hexaazatrinaphthylene radicals (HAN&#8901;3&#8722;) and four rare earth (RE) ions are reported. 1&#8208;RE shows isolable species with ligand&#8208;based mixed valency as revealed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) thus leading to the isolation of 2&#8208;RE via one&#8208;electron chemical reduction. Strong electronic communication in mixed&#8208;valency supports stronger overall ferromagnetic behaviors in 2&#8208;RE than 1&#8208;RE containing Gd and Dy ions. Ac magnetic susceptibility data reveal 1&#8208;Dy and 2&#8208;Dy both exhibit slow magnetic relaxation. Importantly, larger coercive field was observed in the hysteresis of 2&#8208;Dy at 2.0&#8197;K, indicating the enhanced SMM behavior compared with 1&#8208;Dy. Ligand&#8208;based mixed&#8208;valency strategy has been used for the first time to improve the magnetic coupling in lanthanide (Ln) SMMs, thus opening up new ways to construct strongly coupled Ln&#8208;SMMs.

&lt;p&gt;Radical-bridged organometallic heterometallic single-molecule magnets (SMMs) were isolated for the first time, representing a new class of organometallic lanthanide (Ln) SMMs. The novel strategy effectively overcomes the limited number of metal centers in radical-bridged Ln-SMMs, opening up new ways to construct larger strongly coupled Ln-SMMs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntheses and magnetic properties of organometallic heterometallic compounds [K(THF)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]{Co&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;[(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-HAN)RE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cp*&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} (&lt;b&gt;2-RE&lt;/b&gt;) containing hexaazatrinaphthylene radicals (HAN&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and four rare earth (RE) ions are reported. &lt;b&gt;1-RE&lt;/b&gt; shows isolable species with ligand-based mixed valency as revealed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) thus leading to the isolation of &lt;b&gt;2-RE&lt;/b&gt; via one-electron chemical reduction. Strong electronic communication in mixed-valency supports stronger overall ferromagnetic behaviors in &lt;b&gt;2-RE&lt;/b&gt; than &lt;b&gt;1-RE&lt;/b&gt; containing Gd and Dy ions. Ac magnetic susceptibility data reveal &lt;b&gt;1-Dy&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2-Dy&lt;/b&gt; both exhibit slow magnetic relaxation. Importantly, larger coercive field was observed in the hysteresis of &lt;b&gt;2-Dy&lt;/b&gt; at 2.0&#8197;K, indicating the enhanced SMM behavior compared with &lt;b&gt;1-Dy&lt;/b&gt;. Ligand-based mixed-valency strategy has been used for the first time to improve the magnetic coupling in lanthanide (Ln) SMMs, thus opening up new ways to construct strongly coupled Ln-SMMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrothermal Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction at Room Temperature with a Silicomolybdate&#8208;Based Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrothermal water&#8208;gas shift reaction was achieved with a system comprised of a Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst and redox mediator, simplifying the separation of products and avoiding the use of alkaline electrolyte. The reduction degree of the redox mediator was a key effect in modifying the reaction kinetics and performance of both thermal&#8208; and electrocatalytic reaction steps.







Abstract
The water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction is often conducted at elevated temperature and requires energy&#8208;intensive separation of hydrogen (H2) from methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and residual carbon monoxide (CO). Designing processes to decouple CO oxidation and H2 production provides an alternative strategy to obtain high&#8208;purity H2 streams. We report an electrothermal WGS process combining thermal oxidation of CO on a silicomolybdic acid (SMA)&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pd1/CsSMA) and electrocatalytic H2 evolution. The two half&#8208;reactions are coupled through phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) as a redox mediator at a moderate anodic potential of 0.6&#8197;V (versus Ag/AgCl). Under optimized conditions, our catalyst exhibited a TOF of 1.2&#8197;s&#8722;1 with turnover numbers above 40&#8201;000&#8197;mol
&#8201;molPd&#8722;1 achieving stable H2 production with a purity consistently exceeding 99.99&#8201;%.

         <title>Supramolecular Polyphenol&#8208;DNA Microparticles for In Vivo Adjuvant and Antigen Co&#8208;Delivery and Immune Stimulation</title>

DNA&#8208;based particles with various morphologies and functions are fabricated via the supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and DNA. The engineered particles enable in vivo co&#8208;delivery of adjuvant/antigen to boost cytokine and antibody production.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based materials have attracted interest due to the tunable structure and encoded biological functionality of nucleic acids. A simple and general approach to synthesize DNA&#8208;based materials with fine control over morphology and bioactivity is important to expand their applications. Here, we report the synthesis of DNA&#8208;based particles via the supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and DNA. Uniform particles with different morphologies are obtained using a variety of DNA building blocks. The particles enable the co&#8208;delivery of cytosine&#8208;guanine adjuvant sequences and the antigen ovalbumin in model cells. Intramuscular injection of the particles in mice induces antigen&#8208;specific antibody production and T cell responses with no apparent toxicity. Protein expression in cells is shown using capsules assembled from TA and plasmid DNA. This work highlights the potential of TA as a universal material for directing the supramolecular assembly of DNA into gene and vaccine delivery platforms.

         <title>Differentiating between Acidic and Basic Surface Hydroxyls on Metal Oxides by Fluoride Substitution: A Case Study on Blue TiO2 from Laser Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probing surface OH with F&#8722; ions: Surface OH of TiO2 were substituted by F&#8722; ions, which were then quantified by XPS and ion chromatography. The acidic (bridging) and basic (terminal) surface OH can be distinguished at different pH. Using this fluoride substitution, it was demonstrated that laser defect engineering selectively created more acidic OH but not basic OH on TiO2.







Abstract
Both oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyls play a crucial role in catalysis. Yet, their relationship is not often explored. Herein, we prepare two series of TiO2 (rutile and P25) with increasing oxygen deficiency and Ti3+ concentration by pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL), and selectively quantify the acidic and basic surface OH by fluoride substitution. As indicated by EPR spectroscopy, the laser&#8208;generated Ti3+ exist near the surface of rutile, but appear to be deeper in the bulk for P25. Fluoride substitution shows that extra acidic bridging OH are selectively created on rutile, while the surface OH density remains constant for P25. These observations suggest near&#8208;surface Ti3+ are highly related to surface bridging OH, presumably the former increasing the electron density of the bridging oxygen to form more of the latter. We anticipate that fluoride substitution will enable better characterization of surface OH and its correlation with defects in metal oxides.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Guided Construction of Nanozymes for Determining H2O2 Produced by Sonication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the nanoconfinement effect, cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt&#8201;c) has been successfully confined within a hierarchical MOF scaffold, PCN&#8208;222, leading to a 3&#8211;4&#8208;fold improvement in its peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. The fabricated Cyt&#8201;c@PCN&#8208;222 nanoparticles were further employed to sensitively monitor sonication&#8208;induced H2O2.







Abstract
Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities, termed as nanozymes, have found wide applications in various fields. It has been a long&#8208;term aim to rationally design and synthesize highly active nanozymes and thus to further improve their application performance. Guided by the nanoconfinement effect, we confine cytochrome c (Cyt&#8201;c) within a mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), PCN&#8208;222 nanoparticle (NP), forming a protein/MOF hybrid nanozyme, termed as Cyt&#8201;c@PCN&#8208;222 NP. The confined Cyt&#8201;c exhibits around 3&#8211;4&#8208;fold higher peroxidase&#8208;like activity than free Cyt&#8201;c. Due to the increase in the activity of Cyt&#8201;c, the Cyt&#8201;c@PCN&#8208;222 NPs exhibit a quite low limit of detection (&#8776;0.13&#8197;&#956;M) towards H2O2. Sonication&#8208;induced H2O2 formation in water by using a lab&#8208;quipped ultrasonic cleaner can be sensitively probed, which suggests that H2O2&#8208;sensitive materials should be carefully handled during the utilization of ultrasonic equipment. We speculate that this nanoconfinement strategy can broaden our synthetic methodology for the rational design of nanozymes.

We speculate that this nanoconfinement strategy can broaden our synthetic methodology for the rational design of nanozymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Substituted&#8208;Rhodamine&#8208;Based Reversible Fluorescent Probe for In Vivo Quantification of Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms by bioimaging is achieved by using ZpSiP, a substituted&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based ratiometric probe with reliable reactivity with GSH. The probe succeeded in monitoring the dynamics of GSH in the organisms bearing tumor tissues, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis, and thus unveiling the related pathological processes and mechanisms.







Abstract
Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the quantification by fluorescence bioimaging in living tissues has much stricter requirements than the &#8220;Petri dish&#8221;&#8208;cultured cells in flat plates. Based on the evaluation of the electronic structure and steric hindrance&#8208;tuned reactivity of phospha&#8208;substituted rhodamine with GSH, a reversible F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe ZpSiP with a distinct performance (Kd=4.9&#8197;mM, t1/2=0.57&#8197;s, k=81&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) is developed for real time quantifying GSH in living cells. Furthermore, the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probe succeeded in sensitively tracking the dynamics of GSH in the real organisms bearing tumors, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis for unveiling the related pathological processes. We believe that the advance in chemistry with quantitative analysis methods will initiate more promising progress and broad applications.

         <title>Water&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Colloidal Quantum Wells for Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creatively water&#8208;driven strategy is devised to obtain size&#8208;homogenized and strongly confined deep&#8208;blue perovskite quantum wells (QWs) with remarkable stability and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. The electroluminescent devices based on the QWs show high luminance of 2946&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, demonstrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art brightness for perovskite QWs based devices.







Abstract
Perovskite colloidal quantum wells (QWs) are promising to realize narrow deep&#8208;blue emission, but the poor optical performance and stability suppress their practical application. Here, we creatively propose a water&#8208;driven synthesis strategy to obtain size&#8208;homogenized and strongly confined deep&#8208;blue CsPbBr3 QWs, corresponding to three monolayers, which emit at the deep&#8208;blue wavelength of 456&#8197;nm. The water controls the orientation and distribution of the ligands on the surface of the nanocrystals, thus inducing orientated growth through the Ostwald ripening process by phagocytizing unstable nanocrystals to form well&#8208;crystallized QWs. These QWs present remarkable stability and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. Furthermore, we have prepared light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the QWs via the all&#8208;solution fabrication strategy, achieving an external quantum efficiency of 1&#8201;% and luminance of 2946&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, demonstrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art brightness for perovskite QW&#8208;based LEDs.

         <title>Deciphering Siloxane Bond Exchanges: From a Molecular Study to Vitrimerization and Recycling of Silicone Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic exchanges in polymer networks are only desirable during reprocessing or recycling. We exploit thermal degradation of active exchangeable species to stop dynamic exchanges in siloxane networks and yield permanent networks. A rheological model for stress relaxation accounts for deactivation of exchanges and extracts the key kinetics parameters from simple experiments to predict the evolution of processability of the material.







Abstract
The activity of various additives promoting siloxane equilibration reactions is examined and quantified on model compounds. We found in particular that the &#8220;superbase&#8221; phosphazene derivative P4&#8208;tBu can promote very fast exchanges (a few seconds at 90&#8201;&#176;C) even at low concentration (&lt;0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%). We demonstrate that permanent silicone networks can be transformed into reprocessable and recyclable dynamic networks by mere introduction of such additives. Annealing at high temperature degrades the additives and deactivates the dynamic features of the silicone networks, reverting them back into permanent networks. A simple rheological experiment and the corresponding model allow to extract the critical kinetic parameters to predict and control such deactivations.

         <title>Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Chiral Bimetallic Ag22Cu7 Superatom with Multiple Chirality Origins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkynyl&#8208;protected chiral bimetallic AgCu superatomic nanocluster [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6]&#8722; with a high free valence electron count is reported. This cluster exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, metal&#8208;ligand interface and ligand layer.







Abstract
Understanding the origin of chirality in the nanostructured materials is essential for chiroptical and catalytic applications. Here we report a chiral AgCu superatomic cluster, [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6](PPh4), Ag22Cu7, protected by an achiral alkynyl ligand (HC&#8801;CR: 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetylene). Its crystal structure comprises a rare interpenetrating biicosahedral Ag17Cu2 core, which is stabilized by four different types of motifs: one Cu(C&#8801;CR)2, four &#8722;C&#8801;CR, two chlorides and one helical Ag5Cu4(C&#8801;CR)10(PPh3)5Cl4. Structural analysis reveals that Ag22Cu7 exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, the metal&#8208;ligand interface and the ligand layer. Furthermore, the circular dichroism spectra of R/S&#8208;Ag22Cu7 are obtained by employing appropriate chiral molecules as optical enrichment agents. DFT calculations show that Ag22Cu7 is an eight&#8208;electron superatom, confirm that the cluster is chirally active, and help to analyze the origins of the circular dichroism.

         <title>Synthesis, Biochemical Characterization, and Genetic Encoding of a 1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Amino Acid as an Acetyllysine Mimic for Bromodomains of the BET Family</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triazole&#8208;containing amino acid (ApmTri) was established as a mimic of acetyllysine for bromodomains of the BET family. Biochemical and structural investigations showed that ApmTri binds with similar affinity to bromodomains as acetyllysine and reflects the binding mode of the native modification at the atomic level. Genetic encoding enables ApmTri incorporation into proteins allowing investigations of bromodomain binding properties and inhibition.







Abstract
Lysine acetylation is a charge&#8208;neutralizing post&#8208;translational modification of proteins bound by bromodomains (Brds). A 1,2,4&#8208;triazole amino acid (ApmTri) was established as acetyllysine (Kac) mimic recruiting Brds of the BET family in contrast to glutamine commonly used for simulating this modification. Optimization of triazole substituents and side chain spacing allowed BET Brd recruitment to ApmTri&#8208;containing peptides with affinities similar to native substrates. Crystal structures of ApmTri&#8208;containing peptides in complex with two BET Brds revealed the binding mode which mirrored that of Kac ligands. ApmTri was genetically encoded and recombinant ApmTri&#8208;containing proteins co&#8208;enriched BRD3(2) from cellular lysates. This interaction was blocked by BET inhibitor JQ1. With genetically encoded ApmTri, biochemistry is now provided with a stable Kac mimic reflecting charge neutralization and Brd recruitment, allowing new investigations into BET proteins in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Semiconductor SERS on Colourful Substrates with Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colourful SERS substrates can be achieved by involving Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot cavities with semiconductor materials. These are capable of enhancing the sensitivity by manipulating light into resonant absorption.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metallic materials have emerged as a new family of active substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), with unique advantages over their metal counterparts. However, owing to their inefficient interaction with the incident wavelength, the Raman enhancement achieved with non&#8208;metallic materials is considerably lower with respect to the metallic ones. Herein, we propose colourful semiconductor&#8208;based SERS substrates for the first time by utilizing a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot cavity, which realize a large freedom in manipulating light. Owing to the delicate adjustment of the absorption in terms of both frequency and intensity, resonant absorption can be achieved with a variety of non&#8208;metal SERS substrates, with the sensitivity further enhanced by &#8776;100&#8197;times. As a typical example, by introducing a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot&#8208;type substrate fabricated with SiO2/Si, a rather low detection limit of 10&#8722;16&#8197;M for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2S protein is achieved on SnS2. This study provides a realistic strategy for increasing SERS sensitivity when semiconductors are employed as SERS substrates.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Metal Electrocatalyst Powders and Electrodes and their Application for Oxygen Evolution and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer/metal precursor spraying synthesis technique was developed as a straightforward and scalable method to produce multi&#8208;metal catalyst powders and Ni&#8208;foam based electrodes. 11 different multi&#8208;metal catalyst powders were characterized and investigated towards the oxygen evolution reaction. CoNiFeMoCr&#8208;modified Ni&#8208;foam electrodes were investigated for water splitting in MEA&#8208;type model electrolyzers up to current densities of 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;metal electrocatalysts provide nearly unlimited catalytic possibilities arising from synergistic element interactions. We propose a polymer/metal precursor spraying technique that can easily be adapted to produce a large variety of compositional different multi&#8208;metal catalyst materials. To demonstrate this, 11 catalysts were synthesized, characterized, and investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further investigation of the most active OER catalyst, namely CoNiFeMoCr, revealed a polycrystalline structure, and operando Raman measurements indicate that multiple active sites are participating in the reaction. Moreover, Ni foam&#8208;supported CoNiFeMoCr electrodes were developed and applied for water splitting in flow&#8208;through electrolysis cells with electrolyte gaps and in zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. The proposed alkaline MEA&#8208;type electrolyzers reached up to 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 24&#8197;h measurements demonstrated no loss of current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Amplification of Lipid Peroxidation by Regulating Cell Membrane Unsaturation To Enhance Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reinforcing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent was prepared by loading oleanolic acid (OA) into hollow carbon&#8208;supported iron single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SAC) prior to coating with erythrocyte membrane (EM). Fe&#8208;SAC&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation from H2O2, in addition to initiating CDT, triggers EM destruction to release OA, which can amplify lipid peroxidation by enriching cell membranes with polyunsaturated fatty acids, enabling enhanced CDT efficacy.







Abstract
Lipid peroxidation (LPO) is one of the most damaging processes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although it is well known that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are much more susceptible than saturated or monounsaturated ones to LPO, there is no study exploring the effect of cell membrane unsaturation degree on CDT. Here, we report a self&#8208;reinforcing CDT agent (denoted as OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs), consisting of oleanolic acid (OA)&#8208;loaded iron single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;SAC)&#8208;embedded hollow carbon nanospheres encapsulated by an erythrocyte membrane (EM), which promotes LPO to improve chemodynamic efficacy via modulating the degree of membrane unsaturation. Upon uptake of OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs by cancer cells, Fe&#8208;SAC&#8208;catalyzed conversion of endogenous hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, in addition to initiating the chemodynamic therapeutic process, causes the dissociation of the EM shell and the ensuing release of OA that can enrich cellular membranes with PUFAs, enabling LPO amplification&#8208;enhanced CDT.

         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of internal alkynes is reported. A library of methyl containing tetra&#8208;substituted olefins was successfully built using readily available and bench&#8208;stable coupling partners, iodo&#8208;arenes, and methyl boronic acid.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of internal alkynes (ynamides/yne&#8208;acetates/alkynes) is described. The readily available and bench stable coupling partners iodo&#8208;arenes, and methyl boronic acid are successfully used in this coupling strategy to access the methyl&#8208;containing tetra&#8208;substituted olefins; the scope is broad showing excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. Notably, the transformation is regio&#8208; as well as stereoselective. The biologically relevant motifs (BRM) bearing iodo&#8208;arenes and ynamides are also used for the late&#8208;stage syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of alkynes. Aryl&#8208;alkylation, aryl&#8208;trideuteriomethylation, alkynyl&#8208;methylation, and alkenyl&#8208;methylation of ynamides are also presented. The Me&#8208;substituted alkenes are further transformed into synthetically important &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;indenones and &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;methyl ketones.

&lt;p&gt;A regio- and stereoselective Pd-catalyzed three-component &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-arylmethylation of internal alkynes is reported. A library of methyl containing tetra-substituted olefins was successfully built using readily available and bench-stable coupling partners, iodo-arenes, and methyl boronic acid.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pd-catalyzed three-component s&lt;i&gt;yn&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-arylmethylation of internal alkynes (ynamides/yne-acetates/alkynes) is described. The readily available and bench stable coupling partners iodo-arenes, and methyl boronic acid are successfully used in this coupling strategy to access the methyl-containing tetra-substituted olefins; the scope is broad showing excellent functional-group tolerance. Notably, the transformation is regio- as well as stereoselective. The biologically relevant motifs (BRM) bearing iodo-arenes and ynamides are also used for the late-stage s&lt;i&gt;yn&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-arylmethylation of alkynes. Aryl-alkylation, aryl-trideuteriomethylation, alkynyl-methylation, and alkenyl-methylation of ynamides are also presented. The Me-substituted alkenes are further transformed into synthetically important &#946;-amino-indenones and &#945;-fluoro-&#945;&#8242;-methyl ketones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prebiotic Synthesis and Isomerization in Interstellar Analog Ice: Glycinal, Acetamide, and Their Enol Tautomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out of the cold: Ammonia (NH3) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) are exposed to galactic cosmic ray proxies while frozen at 5&#8197;K to simulate the environment of an interstellar molecular cloud. Reactants undergo dissociation and radical recombination to produce glycinal (NH2CH2CHO) and acetamide (CH3CONH2) prior to tautomerization to 2&#8208;aminoethenol (HOCHCHNH2) and 1&#8208;aminoethenol (H2CC(OH)NH2), respectively.







Abstract
Glycinal (HCOCH2NH2) and acetamide (CH3CONH2) are simple molecular building blocks of biomolecules in prebiotic chemistry, though their origin on early Earth and formation in interstellar media remain a mystery. These molecules are formed with their tautomers in low temperature interstellar model ices upon interaction with simulated galactic cosmic rays. Glycinal and acetamide are accessed via barrierless radical&#8208;radical reactions of vinoxy (&#8901;CH2CHO) and acetyl (&#8901;C(O)CH3), and then undergo keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Exploiting tunable photoionization reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy and photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves, these results demonstrate fundamental reaction pathways for the formation of complex organics through non&#8208;equilibrium ice reactions in cold molecular cloud environments. These molecules demonstrate an unconventional starting point for abiotic synthesis of organics relevant to contemporary biomolecules like polypeptides and cell membranes in deep space.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Cationic Disordering Induces two Distinct Degradation Pathways in Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ni&#8208;rich Li1&#8722;m(Ni0.94Al0.06)1+mO2 (NA) oxides are synthesized through tailoring the heating temperature. The NA oxides with high cation disorder experience a comparably homogeneous fatigue process upon extended cycling, while a disordered surface with lattice mismatch is gradually formed in the NA with low cation disorder (i.e. heterogeneous degradation) which results in a rapid capacity decay during the fast charge&#8211;discharge cycling.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are one of the most attractive cathode materials in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries, their degradation mechanisms are still not completely elucidated. Herein, we report a strong dependence of degradation pathways on the long&#8208;range cationic disordering of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich Li1&#8722;m(Ni0.94Al0.06)1+mO2 (NA). Interestingly, a disordered layered phase with lattice mismatch can be easily formed in the near&#8208;surface region of NA particles with very low cation disorder (NA&#8208;LCD, m&#8804;0.06) over electrochemical cycling, while the layered structure is basically maintained in the core of particles forming a &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; structure. Such surface reconstruction triggers a rapid capacity decay during the first 100&#8197;cycles between 2.7 and 4.3&#8197;V at 1&#8197;C or 3&#8197;C. On the contrary, the local lattice distortions are gradually accumulated throughout the whole NA particles with higher degrees of cation disorder (NA&#8208;HCD, 0.06&#8804;m&#8804;0.15) that lead to a slow capacity decay upon cycling.

         <title>Organic Additive&#8208;derived Films on Cu Electrodes Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products Under Strongly Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modified copper electrodes with N&#8208;tolyl pyridinium additive&#8208;derived films show boosted selectivity of the CO2 reduction to C2+ products (&gt;70&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency) and great suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction in strongly acidic electrolytes with low alkali cation concentrations.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) at low pH is desired for high CO2 utilization; the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a challenge. High alkali cation concentration at a high operating current density has recently been used to promote electrochemical CO2R at low pH. Herein we report an alternative approach to selective CO2R (&gt;70&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for C2+ products, FEC2+) at low pH (pH&#8197;2; H3PO4/KH2PO4) and low potassium concentration ([K+]=0.1&#8197;M) using organic film&#8208;modified polycrystalline copper (Modified&#8208;Cu). Such an electrode effectively mitigates HER due to attenuated proton transport. Modified&#8208;Cu still achieves high FEC2+ (45&#8201;% with Cu foil /55&#8201;% with Cu GDE) under 1.0&#8197;M H3PO4 (pH&#8776;1) at low [K+] (0.1&#8197;M), even at low operating current, conditions where HER can otherwise dominate.

         <title>A New Thiolate&#8208;Bound Dimanganese Cluster as a Structural and Functional Model for Class Ib Ribonucleotide Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aim to mimic the reactivity of class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs), a new thiolate&#8208;bound MnII2 compound was studied. Upon superoxide activation it forms a reactive intermediate that exhibits a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 EPR signal at g=2 and oxidizes substituted phenols, thereby resembling the enzymatic behavior and, thus, providing new mechanistic insight into class&#8197;Ib RNR reactivity.







Abstract
In class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) a dimanganese(II) cluster activates superoxide (O2&#8901;&#8722;) rather than dioxygen (O2), to access a high valent MnIII&#8722;O2&#8722;MnIV species, responsible for the oxidation of tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. In a biomimetic approach, we report the synthesis of a thiolate&#8208;bound dimanganese complex [MnII2(BPMT)(OAc)2](ClO)4 (BPMT=(2,6&#8208;bis{[bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}&#8208;4&#8208;methylthiophenolate) (1) and its reaction with O2&#8901;&#8722; to form a [(BPMT)MnO2Mn]2+ complex 2. Resonance Raman investigation revealed the presence of an O&#8722;O bond in 2, while EPR analysis displayed a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 signal at g=2 typically associated with a MnIIIMnIV core, as detected in class&#8197;Ib RNRs. Unlike all other previously reported Mn&#8722;O2&#8722;Mn complexes, generated by O2&#8901;&#8722; activation at Mn2 centers, 2 proved to be a capable electrophilic oxidant in aldehyde deformylation and phenol oxidation reactions, rendering it one of the best structural and functional models for class&#8197;Ib RNRs.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) a dimanganese(II) cluster activates superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) rather than dioxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), to access a high valent Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Mn&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; species, responsible for the oxidation of tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. In a biomimetic approach, we report the synthesis of a thiolate-bound dimanganese complex [Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BPMT)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](ClO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (BPMT=(2,6-bis{[bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}-4-methylthiophenolate) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and its reaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to form a [(BPMT)MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. Resonance Raman investigation revealed the presence of an O&#8722;O bond in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, while EPR analysis displayed a 16-line &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;=1/2 signal at &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;=2 typically associated with a Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Mn&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; core, as detected in class&#8197;Ib RNRs. Unlike all other previously reported Mn&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Mn complexes, generated by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; activation at Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; centers, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; proved to be a capable electrophilic oxidant in aldehyde deformylation and phenol oxidation reactions, rendering it one of the best structural and functional models for class&#8197;Ib RNRs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel Aluminum&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Uniform Micropores for Trace BTEX Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Al&#8208;based MOF is described with uniform micropore size of 8.37&#177;0.73&#8197;&#197; and excellent chemical&#8208;thermal stability for trace BTEX, e.g., benzene adsorption of 3.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at relative pressure (P/P0)=0.01 and 298&#8197;K, which is the largest value reported.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential porous adsorbents for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX). A novel MOF, using low toxic aluminum (Al) as the metal, named as ZJU&#8208;620(Al), with uniform micropore size of 8.37&#177;0.73&#8197;&#197; and specific surface area of 1347&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, was synthesized. It is constructed by one&#8208;dimensional rod&#8208;shaped AlO6 clusters, formate ligands and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tribenzoic ligands. ZJU&#8208;620(Al) exhibits excellent chemical&#8208;thermal stability and adsorption for trace BTEX, e.g., benzene adsorption of 3.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at P/P0=0.01 and 298&#8197;K, which is the largest one reported. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations and Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, it was observed that the excellent adsorption could be attributed to the high affinity of BTEX molecules in ZJU&#8208;620(Al) micropores because the kinetic diameters of BTEX are close up to the pore size of ZJU&#8208;620(Al).

         <title>Elucidating Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Kinetics via Intermediates by Time&#8208;Dependent Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond electron transfer number and rate constant for oxygen reduction reaction, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species in the diffusion layer was successfully revealed from time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence decay curves. Such uncovered information would guide electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability.







Abstract
Facile evaluation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics for electrocatalysts is critical for sustainable fuel&#8208;cell development and industrial H2O2 production. Despite great success in ORR studies using mainstream strategies, such as the membrane electrode assembly, rotation electrodes, and advanced surface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopy, the time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) intermediates in the diffusion layer remain unknown. Using time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence (Td&#8208;ECL), we report an intermediate&#8208;oriented method for ORR kinetics analysis. Owing to multiple ultrasensitive stoichiometric reactions between ROS and the ECL emitter, except for electron transfer numbers and rate constants, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of ROS were successfully obtained for the first time. Such exclusively uncovered information would guide the development of electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability.

         <title>In situ Observation of Porosity Formation in Porous Single&#8208;crystalline TiO2 Monolith for Enhanced and Stable Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate the comprehensive growth methodology of porous single crystals at the macroscale by using in situ transmission electron microscopy.







Abstract
Introducing pores in single crystals creates a new type of porous materials that incorporate porosity and structural coherence. Herein, we use in situ transmission electron microscopy to disclose the porosity formation by converting KTiOPO4 (KTP) single crystals into porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) TiO2 monoliths in a solid&#8208;solid transformation. The isolated crystalline nuclei of TiO2 clusters with identical lattice orientation on KTP surface moves TiO2/KTP interface toward mother phase for growing PSC TiO2 monoliths. The relative density in PSC TiO2 monoliths dominates porosity while the macroscopic dimensions remain unchanged in the transformation. The single&#8208;crystalline nature of porous architecture stabilizes oxygen vacancy to activate lattice oxygen while the three&#8208;dimensional percolation enhances species diffusion. PSC TiO2 monoliths with deposited Pt clusters show enhanced and stable catalytic CO oxidation in air at &#8764;75&#8201;&#176;C for 200&#8197;hours of operation.

         <title>Discovery of a Unique Flavonoid Biosynthesis Mechanism in Fungi by Genome Mining</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plant flavonoids are synthesized by type&#8197;III PKS followed by chalcone isomerase (CHI) and flavone synthase (FNS). Now a unique flavonoid biosynthesis mechanism has been identified in fungi by genome mining. The chalcone skeleton is assembled by an NRPS&#8208;PKS hybrid enzyme, and subsequent conversion into a flavone is catalyzed by new types of CHI and FNS. This finding provides new insight into the microbial production of valuable plant flavonoids.







Abstract
Flavonoids are important plant natural products with variable structures and bioactivities. All known plant flavonoids are generated under the catalysis of a type&#8197;III polyketide synthase (PKS) followed by a chalcone isomerase (CHI) and a flavone synthase (FNS). In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of chlorflavonin, a fungal flavonoid with acetolactate synthase inhibitory activity, was discovered using a self&#8208;resistance&#8208;gene&#8208;directed strategy. A novel flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in fungi was revealed. A core nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase (NRPS&#8208;PKS) is responsible for the generation of the key precursor chalcone. Then, a new type of CHI catalyzes the conversion of a chalcone into a flavanone by a histidine&#8208;mediated oxa&#8208;Michael addition mechanism. Finally, the desaturation of flavanone to flavone is catalyzed by a new type of FNS, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase.

         <title>Evolving Robust and Interpretable Enzymes for the Bioethanol Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are at the core of biotransformation in first&#8208; and second&#8208;generation bioethanol production processes. By integrating the transferable protein evolution strategy InSiReP 2.0 (In Silico guided Recombination Process), the model cellulase PvCel5A was evolved to overcome the remaining challenge of low ethanol tolerance and thermal stability, which hindered the further improvement of biomass transformation and bioethanol yield prior to this study.







Abstract
Obtaining a robust and applicable enzyme for bioethanol production is a dream for biorefinery engineers. Herein, we describe a general method to evolve an all&#8208;round and interpretable enzyme that can be directly employed in the bioethanol industry. By integrating the transferable protein evolution strategy InSiReP 2.0 (In Silico guided Recombination Process), enzymatic characterization for actual production, and computational molecular understanding, the model cellulase PvCel5A (endoglucanase II Cel5A from Penicillium verruculosum) was successfully evolved to overcome the remaining challenges of low ethanol and temperature tolerance, which primarily limited biomass transformation and bioethanol yield. Remarkably, application of the PvCel5A variants in both first&#8208; and second&#8208;generation bioethanol production processes (i. Conventional corn ethanol fermentation combined with the in situ pretreatment process; ii. cellulosic ethanol fermentation process) resulted in a 5.7&#8211;10.1&#8201;% increase in the ethanol yield, which was unlikely to be achieved by other optimization techniques.

         <title>Organic Photovoltaic Catalyst with &#963;&#8208;&#960; Anchor for High&#8208;Performance Solar Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic photovoltaic catalyst (Y6CO) with a central steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;free carbonyl group, achieves efficient Pt0 in situ deposition through &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchoring, leading to significantly enhanced utilization of the Pt cocatalyst and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of Y6CO/Pt based nanoparticles under simulated solar light illumination.







Abstract
Efficient in situ deposition of metallic cocatalyst, like zero&#8208;valent platinum (Pt), on organic photovoltaic catalysts (OPCs) is the prerequisite for their high catalytic activities. Here we develop the OPC (Y6CO), by introducing carbonyl in the core, which is available to &#963;&#8208;&#960; coordinate with transition metals, due to the high&#8208;energy empty &#960;* orbital of carbonyl. Y6CO exhibits a stronger capability to anchor Pt species and reduce them to metallic state, resulting in more Pt0 deposition, relative to the control OPC without the central &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchor. Single&#8208;component and heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) employing Y6CO show enhanced average hydrogen evolution rates of 230.98 and 323.22&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g[OPC]&#8722;1, respectively, under AM 1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 10&#8197;h, and heterojunction NPs yield the external quantum efficiencies of ca. 10&#8201;% in 500&#8211;800&#8197;nm. This work demonstrates that &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchoring is one efficient strategy for integrating metallic cocatalyst and OPC for high&#8208;performance photocatalysis.

         <title>Solid&#8208;state Fluorescence from Carbon Dots Widely Tunable from Blue to Deep Red through Surface Ligand Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state fluorescent (SSF) carbon dots (CDs) with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300&#8197;nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained through surface ligand modulation. The emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering the conjugation ability between substituent ligands and carbon core. The developed SSF CDs showed great potential for widespread use in three&#8208;dimensional printing and various types of optical displays.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) find widespread attention due to their remarkable fluorescent and electronic properties. However, aggregation&#8208;caused quenching currently limits the application of CDs in colored displays. The construction of CDs with color&#8208;tunable solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSF) is rarely reported, since the preparation of SSF CDs is technically challenging. Herein, through surface ligand modulation, SSF CDs with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300&#8197;nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained. In&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property studies reveal that intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding inside SSF CDs provokes the emission properties in the aggregated state. Photodynamic characterizations demonstrate emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering conjugation ability between substituent ligands and CDs core. Three&#8208;dimensional printing patterning is used to create a range of emissive objects, demonstrating the commercial potential for use in optical lamps.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Porphyrin Coordination Supramolecular Network Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via charge&#8208;transfer interaction between porphyrin nitrogen and I3&#8722;, Zn&#8208;TCPP achieves an effective anchoring of I3&#8722;. Besides, the open channels constructed by 2D layered network are beneficial to the penetration of I3&#8722; and the accessibility of the porphyrin nitrogen active sites, which brings an excellent electrochemical performance to the Zn&#8208;TCPP cathode.







Abstract
Iodine has great potential in the energy storage, but high solubility of I3&#8722; has seriously delayed its promotion. Benefited from abundant active sites and the open channel, two&#8208;dimensional coordination supramolecular networks (2D CSNs) is considered to be a candidate for the energy storage. Herein, a 2D porphyrin&#8208;CSN cathode named Zn&#8208;TCPP for aqueous iodine dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) shows an excellent specific capacity of 278&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high energy density of 340&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, as well as a durable cycle performance of 5000 cycles and a high Coulombic efficiency of 98&#8201;%. Molecular orbital theory, UV/VIS, Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal charge&#8208;transfer interaction between the donor of porphyrin nitrogen and the acceptor of I3&#8722;, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations demonstrate the contribution of 2D layered network structure of Zn&#8208;TCPP to the penetration of I3&#8722;.

         <title>Evaluation and Improvement of the Stability of Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based Solid&#8208;state Batteries with High&#8208;Voltage Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The failure of cells in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries at high voltages, indicated by &#8220;voltage noise&#8221; and attributed to the formation of lithium dendrites, was effectively overcome by using higher molecular weight PEO. In addition, the PEO/NCM interface was investigated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirming oxidative degradation of PEO.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The failure of cells in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based solid-state lithium batteries at high voltages, indicated by &#8220;voltage noise&#8221; and attributed to the formation of lithium dendrites, was effectively overcome by using higher molecular weight PEO. In addition, the PEO/NCM interface was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirming oxidative degradation of PEO.

         <title>Functional Roles of Polymers in Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials: Modulation of Intersystem Crossing, Air Sensitivity and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional roles of polymers, other than &#8220;inert&#8221; protecting media, were introduced and highlighted in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. Three exemplary roles include modulations of intersystem crossing, air sensitivity and biological activity, respectively, which greatly expand the application horizons for sophisticated polymeric RTP materials in the future.







Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials routinely incorporate polymeric components, which usually act as non&#8208;functional or &#8220;inert&#8221; media to protect excited&#8208;state phosphors from thermal and collisional quenching, but are lesser explored for other influences. Here, we report some exemplary &#8220;active roles&#8221; of polymer matrices played in organic RTP materials, including: 1)&#8197;color modulation of total delayed emissions via balancing the population ratio between thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and RTP due to dielectric&#8208;dependent intersystem crossing; 2)&#8197;altered air sensitivity of RTP materials by generating various surface morphologies such as nano&#8208;sized granules; 3)&#8197;enhanced bacterial elimination for enhanced electrostatic interactions with negatively charged bio&#8208;membranes. These active roles demonstrated that the vast library of polymeric structures and functionalities can be married to organic phosphors to broaden new application horizons for RTP materials.

         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a series of electron&#8208;deficient isoindolium&#8208;based allenes 1 with sulfhydryl compounds has been studied. The vinyl sulfides 2 generated were converted into indanones 3 and amines 4 in good yields upon heating at 30&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C. Applications of the vinyl sulfides 2 include the design and synthesis of a novel FRET&#8208;based fluorescent temperature sensor and chemoselective cysteine bioconjugation to provide multifunctional peptide bioconjugates.







Abstract
The reaction of a series of electron&#8208;deficient isoindolium&#8208;based allenes with sulfhydryl compounds has been studied, leading to the formation of isoindolium&#8208;based vinyl sulfides. The vinyl sulfides generated could be readily converted into the corresponding indanones and amines upon heating at 30&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C with good yields up to 61&#8201;%. The thermal cleavage reaction of vinyl sulfides was further studied for developing temperature&#8208;sensitive systems. Notably, a novel FRET&#8208;based fluorescent temperature sensor was designed and synthesized for temperature sensing at 50&#8201;&#176;C, giving a 6.5&#8208;fold blue fluorescence enhancement. Moreover, chemoselective bioconjugation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides with the isoindolium&#8208;based allenes for the construction of multifunctional peptide bioconjugates was investigated. Thermal cleavage of isoindoliums on the modified peptides at 35&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C gave indanone bioconjugates with up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. These results indicated the biocompatibility of this novel temperature&#8208;sensitive reaction.

         <title>Origin and Regulation of Interface Fusion during Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystal Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface atom migration plays a key role in the formation of Ni&#8208;based layered oxide single&#8208;crystals, which is mainly controlled by the intermediate lithiation state. Strengthening the lithiation kinetics is helpful to promote the formation of intermediate states and further accelerate the formation of the single&#8208;crystal morphology.







Abstract
Interface fusion plays a key role in constructing Ni&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal cathodes, and is governed by the atomic migration related to kinetics. However, the interfacial atom migration path and its control factors are lack of clearly understanding. Herein, we systematically probe the solid&#8208;state synthesis mechanism of single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, including the effects of precursor size, Li/transition metal (TM) ratio and sintering temperature on the structure. Multi&#8208;dimensional analysis unravels that thermodynamics drives interface atoms migration through intermediate state (i.e., cation mixing phase) to induce grain boundary fusion. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller precursor size (&lt;6&#8197;&#956;m), lager Li/TM ratio (&gt;1.0) and higher temperature (&#8805;810&#8201;&#176;C) are conducive to promote the growth of the intermediate state due to reaction kinetics enhancement, and ultimately strengthen the atomic migration&#8208;induced interface fusion.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuned Multicolor Emission of 2D Lead Halide Perovskites with Ultrahigh Color Purity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;range and ultrapure emissions are achieved in 2D lead halide perovskites (LHPs) by combined chemical pressure from halogen doping/substitution and physical pressure from hydrostatic compression. This work demonstrates precise emission tuning and effective color regulation of 2D LHPs by pressure engineering, which would open a new pathway for developing ultrapure emitters and highly sensitive pressure sensors.







Abstract
The chemical diversity and structural flexibility of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) offer tremendous opportunities to tune their optical properties through internal molecular engineering and external stimuli. Herein, we report the wide&#8208;range and ultrapure photoluminescence emissions in a family of homologous 2D LHPs, [MeOPEA]2PbBr4&#8722;4xI4x (MeOPEA=4&#8208;methoxyphenethylammonium; x=0, 0.2, 0.425, 0.575, 1) enabled through internal chemical pressure and external hydrostatic pressure. The chemical pressure, induced by the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and halogen doping/substitution strengthens the structural rigidity to give sustained narrow emissions, and regulates the emission energy, respectively. Further manipulation of physical pressure leads to wide&#8208;range emission tuning from 412 to 647&#8197;nm in a continuous and reversible manner. This work could open up new pathways for developing 2D LHP emitters with ultra&#8208;wide color gamut and high color purity which are highly useful for pressure sensing.

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Transition&#8208;Metal Migration in Layered Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes: Random Na Extraction and Na&#8208;Free Layer Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of cation migration in layered sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode is first elucidated, which is attributed to the Na&#8208;free layer forming under high charge potential due to the random desodiation reaction. A 3d/4d metal co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to address the unfavourable cation migration by creating a selective desodiation reaction.







Abstract
Cation migration often occurs in layered oxide cathodes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the similar ion radius of Li and transition metals (TMs). Although Na and TM show a big difference of ion radius, TMs in layered cathodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) can still migrate to Na layer, leading to serious electrochemical degeneration. To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na&#8208;free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru&#8208;contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na&#8208;free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.

         <title>Scalable Green Synthesis of Robust Ultra&#8208;Microporous Hofmann Clathrate Material with Record C3H6 Storage Density for Efficient C3H6/C3H8 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy that incorporates high&#8208;density strong binding sites into ultra&#8208;microporous Hofmann clathrate material for dense packing of C3H6 molecules is reported. The use of this new porous material not only overcomes the trade&#8208;off between uptake capacity and selectivity but also combines excellent separation performance with high stability, economic feasibility and easy scalability of synthesis.







Abstract
Developing porous materials for C3H6/C3H8 separation faces the challenge of merging excellent separation performance with high stability and easy scalability of synthesis. Herein, we report a robust Hofmann clathrate material (ZJU&#8208;75a), featuring high&#8208;density strong binding sites to achieve all the above requirements. ZJU&#8208;75a adsorbs large amount of C3H6 with a record high storage density of 0.818&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, and concurrently shows high C3H6/C3H8 selectivity (54.2) at 296&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis unveil that the high&#8208;density binding sites in ZJU&#8208;75a not only provide much stronger interactions with C3H6 but also enable the dense packing of C3H6. Breakthrough experiments on gas mixtures afford both high separation factor of 14.7 and large C3H6 uptake (2.79&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1). This material is highly stable and can be easily produced at kilogram&#8208;scale using a green synthesis method, making it as a benchmark material to address major challenges for industrial C3H6/C3H8 separation.

         <title>Photothermally Triggered Copper Payload Release for Cuproptosis&#8208;Promoted Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;nanorod&#8208;based, copper&#8208;doped, and disulfiram (DSF)&#8208;loaded multifunctional therapeutic nanoplatform (Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF) was fabricated to deliver DSF and Cu2+ into cancer cells efficiently. A photothermal effect triggered on&#8208;command payload release remotely to form cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)copper (CuET) and Cu+ in situ. This cuproptosis&#8208;based strategy offers synergistic therapeutic modalities.







Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new form of programmed cell death and exhibits enormous potential in cancer treatment. However, reducing the undesirable Cu ion release in normal tissue and maximizing the copper&#8208;induced therapeutic effect in cancer sites are two main challenges. In this study, we constructed a photothermally triggered nanoplatform (Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF) to realize on&#8208;demand delivery for synergistic therapy. The released disulfiram (DSF) chelated with Cu2+ in situ to generate highly cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)copper (CuET), causing cell apoptosis, and the formed Cu+ species promoted toxic mitochondrial protein aggregation, leading to cell cuproptosis. Synergistic with photothermal therapy, Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF could effectively kill tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth (inhibition rate up to 80.1&#8201;%). These results provide a promising perspective for potential cancer treatment based on cuproptosis, and may also inspire the design of advanced nano&#8208;therapeutic platforms.

         <title>Cover Picture: Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly as a Tool To Preserve the Electronic Purity of Perylene Diimide Chromophores (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 12/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular chromophore cube based on perylene diimides (PDIs) is reported by Sascha Feldmann and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202216729). The rigid and shape&#8208;persistent cage preserves the electronic purity of its PDI constituents and enables the observation of delayed fluorescence because of its bright excited multimer state, acting as an excitation reservoir. Self&#8208;assembly can thus serve as a powerful tool for controlling electronic properties in molecular electronics devices.

The photoreduction of monofluoroarenes is a challenge due to their high reduction potentials. In their Communication (e202218468), Zhi&#8208;Xiang Wang, Xiang&#8208;Yu Chen, and co&#8208;workers show that an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and tBuOK give a photoactive charge transfer complex that generates a highly reducing NHC radical anion, enabling the single&#8208;electron reduction of monofluoroarenes.

Porous and water&#8208;stable hybrid semiconductors as multifunctional materials display traits that are essential for demanding commercial applications. In their Research Article (e202218429), Ioannis Spanopoulos and co&#8208;workers report a strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide semiconductors by using molecular cages as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations. This strategy gave rise to a direct bandgap semiconductor with record water stability and selective vapor sorption.

         <title>A New PETase from the Human Saliva Metagenome and Its Functional Modification via Genetic Code Expansion in Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uttamapinant et&#8197;al. reported the discovery of new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degrading enzymes from aquatic and human saliva metagenomes. Their catalytic performance is up to 83 times higher than known PETases. Site&#8208;specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid results in a stable acyl&#8208;enzyme intermediate and a PET&#8208;enzyme conjugate which can be imaged via confocal microscopy.







Abstract
The discovery and engineering of new plastic degrading enzymes is an important challenge in chemical biotechnology to enable transition to a more sustainable and circular plastics economy. This field has so far yielded a range of enzymes and microbial pathways for the recycling and valorization of plastic waste. New research from Uttamapinant et&#8197;al. reports the discovery of a novel polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase from the human saliva metagenome that displays improved properties and catalytic performance over previously characterized PET hydrolases (PETases). The authors also demonstrate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of a photocaged unnatural amino acid, 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (DAP), which upon photodecaging enables covalent binding of DAP to the PET surface. Thus, this work highlights metagenomic datasets as an untapped source of new PET degrading enzymes and the chemical modification of PETases via genetic code expansion, enabling new biotechnologies for the circular plastics economy.

         <title>Gold Extracted from Wastewater as an Efficient MOF&#8208;Supported Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent work by Zhao and co&#8208;workers takes advantage of the versatility of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), to selectively recover gold from wastewater. More interestingly, the studied MOF serves as a stable platform to transform adsorbed gold into an efficient catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CO, reaching currents of more than 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The recovery of gold from wastewater is necessary from both environmental and economic standpoints. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can serve as high&#8208;capacity and selective adsorbents, as shown in a recent work by Zhao and co&#8208;workers. Their novel three&#8208;dimension cationic framework goes further than selectively adsorbing AuCl4&#8722;. It also serves as a stable platform to transform adsorbed gold into an efficient catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. This work highlights the versatility of MOFs, which can serve as selective adsorbents and as a support for nanoparticle catalysts.

         <title>Sustainable Design of Structural and Functional Polymers for a Circular Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and functional polymers provide functions, sustainability benefits, and CO2 savings during their use phase, but present challenges at end of life. Polymer science and adjacent disciplines can enable a circular economy of polymers via biodegradation or recycling through the application of strategies for molecular and system design that leverage the latest advances in the field.







Abstract
To achieve a sustainable circular economy, polymer production must start transitioning to recycled and biobased feedstock and accomplish CO2 emission neutrality. This is not only true for structural polymers, such as in packaging or engineering applications, but also for functional polymers in liquid formulations, such as adhesives, lubricants, thickeners or dispersants. At their end of life, polymers must be either collected and recycled via a technical pathway, or be biodegradable if they are not collectable. Advances in polymer chemistry and applications, aided by computational material science, open the way to addressing these issues comprehensively by designing for recyclability and biodegradability. This Review explores how scientific progress, together with emerging regulatory frameworks, societal expectations and economic boundary conditions, paint pathways for the transformation towards a circular economy of polymers.

         <title>Deciphering the Biological Activities of Antifungal Agents with Chemical Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rising percentage of fungal pathogens resistant to antifungal drugs and fungicides emphasizes the threat that they pose to animal and human health and global food security. This Minireview outlines the pivotal role of chemical biology in uncovering biological activities, detecting resistance, and in characterizing the interactions between antifungal agents and their targets.







Abstract
The growing number of fungal infections caused by pathogens resistant to one or more classes of antifungal drugs emphasizes the threat that these microorganisms pose to animal and human health and global food security. Open questions remain regarding the mechanisms of action of the limited repertoire of antifungal agents, making it challenging to rationally develop more efficacious therapeutics. In recent years, the use of chemical biology approaches has resolved some of these questions and has provided new promising concepts to guide the design of antifungal agents. By focusing on examples from studies carried out in recent years, this minireview describes the key roles that probes based on antifungal agents and their derivatives have played in uncovering details about their activities, in detecting resistance, and in characterizing the interactions between these agents and their targets.

         <title>Interfaces with Fluorinated Amphiphiles: Superstructures and Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated amphiphiles show interfacial properties distinctively different from ordinary nonfluorinated amphiphiles, such as unique and highly branched superstructures and better stabilization of microdroplets. Further fluorine&#8208;specific phenomena of fluorinated amphiphiles can be observed at solid/liquid interfaces, such as during their adsorption on fluorous adsorber materials or formation of amphiphobic surface coatings upon cross&#8208;linking.







Abstract
This Minireview discusses recent developments in research on the interfacial phenomena of fluorinated amphiphiles, with a focus on applications that exploit the unique and manifold interfacial properties associated with these amphiphiles. Most notably, fluorinated amphiphiles form stable aggregates with often distinctly different morphologies compared to their nonfluorinated counterparts. Consequently, fluorinated surfactants have found wide use in high&#8208;performance applications such as microfluidic&#8208;assisted screening. Additionally, their fluorine&#8208;specific behaviour at solid/liquid interfaces, such as the formation of superhydrophobic coatings after deposition on surfaces, will be discussed. As fluorinated surfactants and perfluorinated materials in general pose potential environmental threats, recent developments in their remediation based on their adsorption onto fluorinated surfaces will be evaluated.

         <title>Elastic Moduli: a Tool for Understanding Chemical Bonding and Thermal Transport in Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastic moduli are fundamentally connected to chemical bonding, making them a powerful tool for in&#8208;depth studies of trends in sound velocity and anharmonicity in thermoelectric materials.







Abstract
The elastic behavior of a material can be a powerful tool to decipher thermal transport. In thermoelectrics, measuring the elastic moduli&#8212;directly tied to sound velocity&#8212;is critical to understand trends in lattice thermal conductivity, as well as study bond anharmonicity and phase transitions, given the sensitivity of elastic moduli to the chemical bonding. In this review, we introduce the basics of elasticity and explain the origin of high&#8208;temperature lattice softening from a bonding perspective. We then review elasticity data throughout classes of thermoelectrics, and explore trends in sound velocity, anharmonicity, and thermal conductivity. We reveal how experimental sound velocities can improve the accuracy of common thermal conductivity models and present a critical discussion of Gr&#252;neisen parameter estimates from elastic moduli. Readers will be equipped with tools to leverage elasticity measurements or calculations to accurately interpret thermal transport trends.

         <title>Electronically Ambivalent Hydrodefluorination of Aryl&#8208;CF3 groups enabled by Electrochemical Deep&#8208;Reduction on a Ni Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general procedure for the direct mono&#8208; and di&#8208;hydrodefluorination of ArCF3 compounds. Exploiting the tunability of electrochemistry and the selectivity enabled by a Ni cathode, the deep reduction garners high selectivity with good to excellent yields up to gram scale. The late&#8208;stage peripheral editing of CF3 feedstocks to construct fluoromethyl moieties will aid the rapid diversification of lead&#8208;compounds and compound libraries.







Abstract
The Ar&#8208;CF2H moiety is featured in an increasing number of bioactive compounds due to its unique combination of properties. The hydrodefluorination of Ar&#8208;CF3 compounds is a direct and efficient route toward this motif. As reported methods for this transformation have focused on specific substrate families, herein we describe a general&#8212;electronically ambivalent&#8212;procedure for the single&#8208;step direct mono&#8208;hydrodefluorination of a variety of feedstock and functionalized Ar&#8208;CF3 compounds. Exploiting the inherent tunability of electrochemistry and the selectivity enabled by a Ni cathode, the deep reduction garners high selectivity for ArCF2H products, with good to excellent yields up to gram scale. The protocol has been extended to a single&#8208;step di&#8208;hydrodefluorination yielding benzyl fluorides. The late&#8208;stage peripheral editing of a single CF3 feedstock to construct fluoromethyl (CF2H, CFH2) moieties will aid the rapid diversification of lead&#8208;compounds and compound libraries.

         <title>Stereoselective Assembly of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Anionic Cages Dictated by Organophosphate&#8208;Based Chiral Nodes</title>

Organophosphates are critically involved in biological signal transduction, and they can play a similar role in supramolecular systems. Organophosphates have now been utilized as chiral nodes to transfer asymmetry information to hydrogen&#8208;bonded anionic cages, with the supramolecular chirality readily modulated by encapsulated achiral guests, temperature, and protonation/deprotonation of the anions.







Abstract
Inspired by the signal transduction function of organophosphates in biological systems, bioactive organophosphates were utilized for the first time as chiral nodes to dictate the stereoselective assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded anionic cages. Phosphonomycin (antibiotics), tenofovir (antivirals), adenosine monophosphate (natural product, AMP) and clindamycin phosphate (antibiotics) were assembled with an achiral bis&#8208;monourea ligand, thereby leading to the stereoselective formation of quadruple or triple helicates. The extent of the stereoselectivity could be enhanced by either lowering the temperature or adding stronger&#8208;binding cations as templates. With the chiral anionic cages as the host, some enantioselectivity was achieved when binding chiral quaternary ammonium cations.

         <title>Easily Switchable 18&#960;&#8208;, 19&#960;&#8208;, and 20&#960;&#8208;Conjugation of Diazaporphyrin Double&#8208;Pincer Bispalladium Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
The reaction of NiII 3,7,13,17&#8208;tetrapyridyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrin with PdII ions has led to a highly twisted bispalladium complex, which shows an excellent ability to accept electrons and be readily reduced to a monocationic and a neutral species using weak reductants. A combination of spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the palladium complexes exhibit aromaticity (dicationic state) and antiaromaticity (neutral state).







Abstract
NiII 3,7,13,17&#8208;tetrapyridyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrin serves as a double tridentate ligand to PdII ions to provide a pincer&#8208;type bispalladium complex. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the bispalladium complex shows excellent ability to accept electrons and reversible redox properties due to the coordination of the two cationic PdII centers to the meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. We isolated and characterized one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction species of the bispalladium complex. The 20&#960; antiaromatic nature of the two&#8208;electron reduction species was confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis&#8208;near&#8208;IR (NIR) absorption spectra, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed highly twisted structures for the bispalladium complexes regardless of the oxidation state.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Single Electron Reduction of Mono&#8208;Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/tBuOK system was reported for the photoreduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the generation of NHC radical anion as a potent reductant, and the Ar&#8722;F bond cleavage proceeds via a concerted mechanism, where single electron transfer, Ar&#8722;F bond cleavage and KF bond formation take place simultaneously.







Abstract
Fluoroarenes are abundant and readily available feedstocks. However, due to the high reduction potentials of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes, their photoreduction remains a continuing challenge, motivating the development of efficient activation modes to address this issue. This report presents the blue light&#8208;induced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed single electron reduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings. We discovered that under blue light irradiation, NHC/tBuOK combination could construct powerful photoactive architectures to promote single electron transfer for Caryl&#8722;F bond reduction via forming highly reducing NHC radical anion. Notably, the strategy was also successful to reduce Caryl&#8722;O, Caryl&#8722;N, and Caryl&#8722;S bonds for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Propargyl Alcohols as Bifunctional Reagents for Divergent Annulations of Biphenylamines via Dual C&#8722;H Functionalization/Dual Oxidative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed divergent and regioselective annulation of biphenylamines with propargyl alcohols (PAs) is demonstrated. These annulations run through an unsymmetrical dual C&#8722;H functionalization via a C&#8801;C bond cleavage, or through a dual oxidative cyclization. The method accommodates a wide range of PAs and showcases late&#8208;stage diversification of some natural products.







Abstract
The C&#8722;H functionalization strategy provides access to valuable molecules that previously required convoluted synthetic attempts. Dual C&#8722;H unsymmetrical functionalization, with a single bifunctional reagent, is an effective tactic. Propargyl alcohols (PAs), despite containing a reactive C&#8801;C bond, have not been explored as building blocks via oxidative cleavage. Annulations via C&#8722;H activation are a versatile and synthetically attractive strategy. We disclose PA as a new bifunctional reagent for unsymmetrical dual C&#8722;H functionalization of biphenylamine for regioselectively annulated outcomes. On tuning the conditions, the annulation bifurcated towards an unusual dual oxidative cyclization. This method accommodates a wide range of PAs and showcases late&#8208;stage diversification of some natural products.

         <title>Simultaneous Detection of L&#8208;Lactate and D&#8208;Glucose Using DNA Aptamers in Human Blood Serum
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly specific DNA aptamer for L&#8208;lactate with a Kd of around 0.4&#8197;mM was selected, showing binding even in 90&#8201;% human serum. Multiplexed detection of two highly related biomarkers, L&#8208;lactate and D&#8208;glucose, was achieved in the same sample by using aptamer sensors labeled with different fluorophores.







Abstract
L&#8208;lactate is a key metabolite indicative of physiological states, glycolysis pathways, and various diseases such as sepsis, heart attack, lactate acidosis, and cancer. Detection of lactate has been relying on a few enzymes that need additional oxidants. In this work, DNA aptamers for L&#8208;lactate were obtained using a library&#8208;immobilization selection method and the highest affinity aptamer reached a Kd of 0.43&#8197;mM as determined using isothermal titration calorimetry. The aptamers showed up to 50&#8208;fold selectivity for L&#8208;lactate over D&#8208;lactate and had little responses to other closely related analogs such as pyruvate or 3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate. A fluorescent biosensor based on the strand displacement method showed a limit of detection of 0.55&#8197;mM L&#8208;lactate, and the sensor worked in 90&#8201;% serum. Simultaneous detection of L&#8208;lactate and D&#8208;glucose in the same solution was achieved. This work has broadened the scope of aptamers to simple metabolites and provided a useful probe for continuous and multiplexed monitoring.

         <title>Homochiral versus Heterochiral Dimeric Helical Foldamer Bundles: Chlorinated&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic foldamer helices form stable head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimers in solution and in the solid state mediated by linear arrays of hydrogen bonds. The preference for dimerization between helices with opposite or identical handedness can be quantitatively reversed by the choice of chlorinated solvent.







Abstract
Aromatic oligoamide sequences programmed to fold into stable helical conformations were designed to display a linear array of hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors at their surface. Sequences were prepared by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Solution 1H NMR spectroscopic studies and solid&#8208;state crystallographic structures demonstrated the formation of stable hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated dimeric helix bundles that could be either heterochiral (with a P and an M helix) or homochiral (with two P or two M helices). Formation of the hetero&#8208; or homochiral dimers could be driven quantitatively using different chlorinated solvents&#8212;exemplifying a remarkable case of either social or narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting or upon imposing absolute handedness to the helices to forbid PM species.

         <title>In Situ Probing and Identification of Electrochemical Reaction Intermediates by Floating Electrolytic Electrospray Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Floating electrolytic electrospray ionization provided a general solution for the in situ monitoring and characterization of electrochemical reaction intermediates by mass spectrometry. Its successful application in discovery and identification of active nitrene intermediates during electrochemical processes proved this platform a powerful tool for reaction&#8208;mechanism studies in the future.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study of electrochemical (EC) synthesis can require a powerful mass spectrometry (MS) analytical platform which can discover and identify fleeting intermediates in EC reactions. Here we report a floating electrolytic electrospray ionization (FE&#8208;ESI) strategy that can perform EC processes in a floating electrolytic cell and monitor intermediates by high&#8208;resolution MS. Compared with previous EC&#8208;MS methods, a significant advantage of FE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS is that it allows one to modulate the electrolytic and electrospray process individually, ensuring its high sensitivity in discovering intermediates and universality to investigate redox reactions in different scenarios. This powerful platform has been successfully used to investigate the EC reductive coupling of p&#8208;tolylboronic acid and p&#8208;nitrotoluene. A series of nitrene intermediates were discovered and identified by FE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, indicating that a hidden mechanism involving nitrene formation might play a key role in EC reductive coupling process.

         <dc:description>
[Bis(monofluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene, an efficient and alternative reagent for radical monofluoromethylation under visible&#8208;light copper(I) photoredox catalysis, provides access to CH2F&#8208;containing organic compounds. The broad utility of this radical monofluoromethylating reagent in alkene oxy&#8208;monofluoromethylation reactions, including for the synthesis of fluoromethylated amino acid derivatives and heterocycles, is demonstrated.







Abstract
A simple process for the oxy&#8208;monofluoromethylation of alkenes is described. In combination with visible&#8208;light copper(I) photoredox catalysis, an easily accessible iodine(III) reagent containing monofluoroacetoxy ligands serves as a powerful source of a monofluoromethyl (CH2F) radical, enabling the step economical synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;acetates from a broad range of olefinic substrates under mild conditions. Applications to late&#8208;stage diversification of alkenes derived from complex molecules, amino acids and the synthesis of fluoromethylated heterocycles are also demonstrated.

         <title>Medium&#8208;Ring Strategy Enables Multiple Resonance Emitters with Twisted Geometry and Fast Spin&#8208;Flip to Suppress Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>

The medium&#8208;ring molecular design strategy enables the first example of blue multi&#8208;resonance emitter with radiative decay rate (kR) as fast as 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) as fast as 106&#8197;s&#8722;1 simultaneously. It exhibits superior electroluminescence performance with high efficiency and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Suppressing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and reducing device efficiency roll&#8208;off are both crucial yet challenging for multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters. Herein, we put forward a medium&#8208;ring strategy to design efficient MR emitters that feature heptagonal tribenzo[b,d,f]azepine (TBA) donors. The highly twisted conformation enlarges the intermolecular distances between the MR&#8208;emitting cores, and thus suppresses ACQ effect. Meanwhile, the introduction of heptagonal donors enhances spin&#8208;orbital coupling, so as to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This medium&#8208;ring strategy gives rise to the first example of blue MR emitter that simultaneously possesses radiative decay rate as fast as 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and RISC rate as fast as 106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Accordingly, DTBA&#8208;B2N3 enables to assemble high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 30.9&#8201;% and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 20.5&#8201;%).

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Surfactant&#8208;Polyoxovanadate Soft Materials as Tuneable Vanadium Oxide Cathode Precursors for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decavanadate anions self&#8208;assemble with a dicationic surfactant to form ordered arrays which, when calcined, yield highly crystalline V2O5. In contrast, calcination of alkylammonium decavanadate leads to smaller V2O5 crystallites. The systems show contrasting, topology&#8208;dependent performance as cathode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries, offering a route to the controlled preparation of V2O5 electrode materials that balance energy and rate performance.







Abstract
The mixing of [V10O28]6&#8722; decavanadate anions with a dicationic gemini surfactant (gem) leads to the spontaneous self&#8208;assembly of surfactant&#8208;templated nanostructured arrays of decavanadate clusters. Calcination of the material under air yields highly crystalline, sponge&#8208;like V2O5 (gem&#8208;V2O5). In contrast, calcination of the amorphous tetrabutylammonium decavanadate allows isolation of a more agglomerated V2O5 consisting of very small crystallites (TBA&#8208;V2O5). Electrochemical analysis of the materials&#8217; performance as lithium&#8208;ion intercalation electrodes highlights the role of morphology in cathode performance. The large crystallites and long&#8208;range microstructure of the gem&#8208;V2O5 cathode deliver higher initial capacity and superior capacity retention than TBA&#8208;V2O5. The smaller crystallite size and higher surface area of TBA&#8208;V2O5 allow faster lithium insertion and superior rate performance to gem&#8208;V2O5.

&lt;p&gt;The mixing of [V&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; decavanadate anions with a dicationic gemini surfactant (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;gem&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) leads to the spontaneous self-assembly of surfactant-templated nanostructured arrays of decavanadate clusters. Calcination of the material under air yields highly crystalline, sponge-like V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). In contrast, calcination of the amorphous tetrabutylammonium decavanadate allows isolation of a more agglomerated V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of very small crystallites (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;TBA&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). Electrochemical analysis of the materials&#8217; performance as lithium-ion intercalation electrodes highlights the role of morphology in cathode performance. The large crystallites and long-range microstructure of the &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;gem&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; cathode deliver higher initial capacity and superior capacity retention than &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;TBA&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; allow faster lithium insertion and superior rate performance to &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;gem&lt;/b&gt;

         <title>Selective Removal of Sulfate from Water by Precipitation with a Rigid Bis&#8208;amidinium Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A readily prepared bis&#8208;amidinium compound can achieve near quantitative precipitation of SO42&#8722; from water with complete selectivity over a range of other anions. The precipitant functions by fully dehydrating the sulfate anion and surrounding it with eight charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A simple, readily prepared biphenyl bis&#8208;amidinium compound (1&#8901;Cl2) is able to selectively precipitate sulfate from water. The precipitant is effective at concentrations as low as 1&#8197;mM and shows complete selectivity against monovalent anions, and high selectivity even against CO32&#8722; and HPO42&#8722;. It is highly effective (&gt;90&#8201;% sulfate removed) in both seawater and highly acidic conditions relevant to mining waste&#8208;streams. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that 1&#8901;SO4 forms a tightly packed, anhydrous, structure where each sulfate anion receives eight hydrogen bonds from amidinium N&#8722;H hydrogen bond donors.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Intramolecular para&#8208;Cycloadditions on Simple Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first synthesis of bridged bicycles through the dearomatization of sterically and electronically unbiased aryl fragments. The visible&#8208;light promoted method occurs at room temperature and has ample functional&#8208;group tolerance. The key to the difunctionalization of the aryl partner is the use of naphthalene as an additive, which stabilizes transient (bi)radicals through its extended &#960; cloud. This effect might lead to its broad use in radical sequences.







Abstract
Dearomative cycloadditions are a powerful tool to access a large chemical space exploiting simple and ubiquitous building blocks. The energetic burden due to the loss of aromaticity has however greatly limited their synthetic potential. We devised a general intramolecular method that overcomes these limitations thanks to the photosensitization of allenamides. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted process gives complex [2.2.2]&#8208;(hetero)&#8208;bicyclooctadienes at room temperature, likely through the stabilization of transient (bi)radicals by naphthalene. The reaction tolerates several valuable functionalities, offering a convenient handle for a myriad of applications, including original isoindoles and metal complexes.

         <title>Molecular Level Modulation of Anthraquinone&#8208;containing Resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde Resin Photocatalysts for H2O2 Production with Exceeding 1.2&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

Electron&#8208;deficient 1,4&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) molecules were adopted to modulate the donor/acceptor ratio in resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) resin at the molecular level. The RF&#8208;DHAQ with matching donor and acceptor displays enhanced charge separation ability, lower energy barrier and overall photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by dual&#8208;pathway with solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency exceeding 1.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Designing polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level to modulate the photogenerated charge behavior is a promising and challenging strategy for efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis. Here, we introduce electron&#8208;deficient 1,4&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) into the framework of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) resin, which modulates the donor/acceptor ratio from the perspective of molecular design for promoting the charge separation. Interestingly, H2O2 can be produced via oxygen reduction and water oxidation pathways, verified by isotopic labeling and in situ characterization techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that DHAQ can reduce the energy barrier for H2O2 production. RF&#8208;DHAQ exhibits excellent overall photosynthesis of H2O2 with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency exceeding 1.2&#8201;%. This work opens a new avenue to design polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level for high&#8208;efficiency artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Au(310)@Cu High&#8208;index Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au(310)@Cu truncated ditetragonal prisms (DTPs) enhance the activity and selectivity for CO2 electromethanation. Elemental mapping analysis shows Cu surface layers are uniformly distributed on the Au {310} facets of the DTPs. Operando Fourier transform infrared spectra show reactive adsorbed *CO as the main intermediate. CO stripping experiments reveal the high&#8208;index facets enhance the *CO formation followed by rapid desorption or hydrogenation.







Abstract
The chemical selectivity and faradaic efficiency of high&#8208;index Cu facets for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is investigated. More specifically, shape&#8208;controlled nanoparticles enclosed by Cu {hk0} facets are fabricated using Cu multilayer deposition at three distinct layer thicknesses on the surface facets of Au truncated ditetragonal nanoprisms (Au DTPs). Au DTPs are shapes enclosed by 12 high&#8208;index {310} facets. Facet angle analysis confirms DTP geometry. Elemental mapping analysis shows Cu surface layers are uniformly distributed on the Au {310} facets of the DTPs. The 7&#8197;nm Au@Cu DTPs high&#8208;index {hk0} facets exhibit a CH4&#8201;:&#8201;CO product ratio of almost 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 compared to a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio for the reference 7&#8197;nm Au@Cu nanoparticles (NPs). Operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra disclose reactive adsorbed *CO as the main intermediate, whereas CO stripping experiments reveal the high&#8208;index facets enhance the *CO formation followed by rapid desorption or hydrogenation.

         <title>Selective Preparation of Phosphorus Mononitride (P&#8801;N) from Phosphinoazide and Reversible Oxidation to Phosphinonitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interstellar candidate phosphorus mononitride PN, a metastable species, was generated through high&#8208;vacuum flash pyrolysis of (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)phosphinoazide in cryogenic matrices. Although the PN stretching band was not directly detected because of its low infrared intensity and possible overlaps with other strong bands, o&#8208;benzoquinone, carbon monoxide, and cyclopentadienone as additional fragmentation products were clearly identified. Moreover, an elusive o&#8208;benzoquinone&#8208;PN complex formed when (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)phosphinoazide was exposed to UV irradiation at &#955; = 254 nm. Its recombination to (o&#8208;phenyldioxyl)&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;phosphinonitrile was observed upon irradiation with the light &#955; = 523 nm, which demonstrates for the first time the reactivity of PN towards an organic molecule. Free energy profile computations at the B3LYP/def2&#8208;TZVP density functional theory level reveal a concerted mechanism. To provide further evidence, UV/Vis spectra of the precursor and the irradiation products were recorded and agree well with time&#8208;dependent DFT computations.</dc:description>

         <title>A universal synthesis strategy for tuneable metal&#8208;organic framework nanohybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated pre&#8208;formed nanoparticles (NPs) enjoy a vastly expanded application potential in catalysis, filtration, and sensing. In the process of integrating pre&#8208;formed NPs, the selection of suitable core&#8208;NPs, such as capping agent or self&#8208;sacrificing template modified NPs, have yielded partial successes in overcoming the lattice mismatch. However, restrictions on the choice of NPs not only limit the diversity, but also affect the properties of nanohybrids. To this date, no universally applicable synthesis for MOF&#8208;nanohybrids emerged that covers the full diversity of all possible core&#8208;shell combinations. Here, we show a versatile synthesis strategy using a representative set of seven MOF&#8208;shells (ZIF&#8208;zni, ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;67, FJU&#8208;30, MIL&#8208;88(Fe), HKUST&#8208;1, and MOF&#8208;74(Co)) and six NP&#8208;cores (Ag, Au, NaYF4, &#946;&#8208;FeOOH, Fe2O3 and Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2) that are fine&#8208;tuned to incorporate from single to hundreds of cores in mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208; and quaternary composites. This method does not require the presence of any specific surface structures or functionalities on the pre&#8208;formed cores. This key strategy is to regulate the rate of diffusion of alkaline vapours that deprotonate the organic building blocks and trigger the controlled MOF&#8208;growth and encapsulation of NP&#8208;cores. This strategy is expected to pave the way for the exploration of sophisticated MOF&#8208;nanohybrids that draws from the full range of hitherto known MOF&#8208;architectures and core&#8208;compositions.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Two Light and Pressure Responsive Physisorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An emerging strategy in the design of efficient gas storage technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents which undergo transformations in response to a particular stimulus, such as pressure, heat or light. Herein, we report two isostructural light modulated adsorbents (LMAs) containing bis&#8208;3&#8208;thienylcyclopentene&#160;(BTCP), LMA&#8208;1 [Cd(BTCP)(DPT)2] (DPT = 2,5&#8208;diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate)&#160;and LMA&#8208;2 [Cd(BTCP)(FDPT)2] (FDPT = 5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4,dicarboxylate). Both LMAs underwent&#160;pressure induced switching transformations from non&#8208;porous to porous via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2. LMA&#8208;1 exhibited multi&#8208;step adsorption while LMA&#8208;2 showed a single&#8208;step adsorption isotherm. The light responsive nature of the BTPC ligand in both frameworks was exploited with irradiation of LMA&#8208;1 resulting in a 55% maximum reduction of CO2 uptake at 298 K. This study reports the first example of a switching sorbent (closed to open) that can be further modulated by light.</dc:description>

         <title>Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circumcoronene, a hexagonal graphene fragment with six zigzag edges, has been the focus of theoretical studies for many years, but its synthesis in solution has remained a challenge. In this study, we present a facile method for synthesizing three derivatives of circumcoronene using Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ether or alkyne. Their structures were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis, NMR measurement, and theoretical calculations showed that circumcoronene mostly follows Clar's bonding model and exhibits dominant local aromaticity. Its absorption and emission spectra are similar to those of the smaller hexagonal coronene due to its six&#8208;fold symmetry.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation with MFU&#8208;4 and Selectivity Reversal via Postsynthetic Ligand Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although many porous materials, including metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), have been reported to selectively adsorb C2H2 in C2H2/CO2 separation processes, CO2&#8208;selective sorbents are much less common. Here, we report the remarkable performance of MFU&#8208;4 (Zn5Cl4(bbta)3, bbta = benzo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;bistriazolate) toward inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The MOF facilitates kinetic separation of CO2 from C2H2, enabling the generation of high purity C2H2 (&gt;98%) with good productivity in dynamic breakthrough experiments. Adsorption kinetics measurements and computational studies show C2H2 is excluded from MFU&#8208;4 by narrow pore windows formed by Zn&#8211;Cl groups. Postsynthetic F&#8211;/Cl&#8211; ligand exchange was used to synthesize an analogue (MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F) with expanded pore apertures, resulting in equilibrium C2H2/CO2 separation with reversed selectivity compared to MFU&#8208;4. MFU&#8208;4&#8208;F also exhibits a remarkably high C2H2 adsorption capacity (6.7 mmol/g), allowing fuel grade C2H2 (98% purity) to be captured from C2H2/CO2 mixtures and harvested by room temperature desorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical and Electrochemical Probes for Monitoring Cytochrome c in Subcellular Compartments During Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome c (Cyt. c) is a key initiator of caspases activating cell apoptosis. The spatiotemporal evaluation of the contents of Cyt. c in cellular subdomains and the detection of Cyt. c delivery between cellular domains upon apoptosis is important to probe cell viabilities. We introduce an optical probe and an electrochemical probe for the quantitative assessment of Cyt. c in cellular subdomains at the single cell levels. The optical or electrochemical probes are functionalized with photoresponsive o&#8208;nitrobenzylphosphate ester caged Cyt. c aptamer constituents. These are uncaged by light stimuli at single cell subdomains, allowing the spatiotemporal detection of Cyt. c through the formation of Cyt. c/aptamer complexes at non&#8208;apoptotic or apoptotic constraints. The probes are applied to distinguish the contents of Cyt. c in cellular subdomains of epithelial MCF&#8208;10A breast cells and malignant MCF&#8208;7 and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cells under apoptotic/non&#8208;apoptotic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of a Spoked 18&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rings of porphyrins mimic natural light&#8208;harvesting chlorophyll arrays and provide insights into electronic delocalization, providing a motivation for creating larger nanorings with closely spaced porphyrin units. Here, we demonstrate the first synthesis of a macrocycle consisting entirely of 5,15&#8208;linked porphyrins. This porphyrin octadecamer was constructed using a covalent six&#8208;armed template, made by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed cyclotrimerization of an H&#8208;shaped tolan with porphyrin trimer ends. The porphyrins around the circumference of the nanoring were linked together by intramolecular oxidative&#160;meso&#8208;meso&#160;coupling and partial &#946;&#8208;&#946; fusion, to give a nanoring consisting of six edge&#8208;fused zinc(II) porphyrin dimer units and six un&#8208;fused nickel(II) porphyrins. STM imaging on a gold surface confirms the size and shape of the spoked 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring (calculated diameter: 4.7 nm).</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Regulation of Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes: Engineering High&#8208;Efficiency Catalase Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes aim to mimic the highly evolved active centers of natural enzymes. Despite progress in nanozyme engineering, their catalytic performance is much less favorable compared with natural enzymes. This study shows that precise control over the atomic configuration of the active centers of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) enables the rational regulation of their catalase&#8208;like performance guided by theorical calculations. The constructed Co&#8208;N3PS SAzyme exhibits an excellent catalase&#8208;like activity and kinetics, exceeding the representative controls of Co&#8208;based SAzymes with different atomic configurations. Moreover, we developed an ordered structure&#8208;oriented coordination design strategy for rationally engineering SAzymes and established a correlation between the structure and enzyme&#8208;like performance. This work demonstrates that precise control over the active centers of SAzymes is an efficient strategy to mimic the highly evolved active sites of natural enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination of Iridium Single&#8208;atom IrN3O Boosting Formic Acid Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of the proximal coordination of an active site to achieve its optimum catalytic activity is the ultimate goal in single&#8208;atom catalysis, but still challenging. Here, we report theoretical prediction and experimental realization of an asymmetrically coordinated iridium single&#8208;atom catalyst (IrN3O) for the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). Theoretical calculations reveal that the substitution of one or two nitrogen with more electronegative oxygen in the symmetric IrN4 motif splits and downshifts the Ir 5d orbitals with respect to the Fermi level, moderating the binding strength of key intermediates on IrN4&#8208;xOx (x= 1, 2) sites, especially that the IrN3O motif shows ideal activity for FAOR with a near&#8208;zero overpotential. The as&#8208;designed asymmetric Ir motifs were realized by pyrolyzing Ir precursor with oxygen&#8208;rich glucose and nitrogen&#8208;rich melamine, exhibiting a mass activity of 25 and 87 times greater than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rational design of the proximal coordination of an active site to achieve its optimum catalytic activity is the ultimate goal in single-atom catalysis, but still challenging. Here, we report theoretical prediction and experimental realization of an asymmetrically coordinated iridium single-atom catalyst (IrN3O) for the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). Theoretical calculations reveal that the substitution of one or two nitrogen with more electronegative oxygen in the symmetric IrN4 motif splits and downshifts the Ir 5d orbitals with respect to the Fermi level, moderating the binding strength of key intermediates on IrN4-xOx (x= 1, 2) sites, especially that the IrN3O motif shows ideal activity for FAOR with a near-zero overpotential. The as-designed asymmetric Ir motifs were realized by pyrolyzing Ir precursor with oxygen-rich glucose and nitrogen-rich melamine, exhibiting a mass activity of 25 and 87 times greater than those of state-of-the-art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Flexible Metal&#8210;Phenolic Networks with Guest Responsiveness via Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible metal&#8211;organic materials are of growing interest owing to their ability to undergo reversible structural transformations under external stimuli. Here, we report flexible metal&#8210;phenolic networks (MPNs) featuring stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior to diverse solute guests. The competitive coordination of metal ions to phenolic ligands of multiple coordination sites and solute guests (e.g., glucose) primarily determines the responsive behavior of the MPNs, as revealed experimentally and computationally. Glucose molecules can be embedded into the dynamic MPNs upon mixing, leading to the reconfiguration of the metal&#8210;organic networks and thus changes in their physicochemical properties for targeting applications. This study expands the library of stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible metal&#8210;organic materials and the understanding of intermolecular interactions between metal&#8210;organic materials and solute guests, which is essential for the rational design of responsive materials for broader applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphdiyne (GDY) with a direct bandgap, excellent carrier mobility and uniform pores, is regarded as a promising photocatalytic material for solar energy conversion, although the development of GDY in photocatalysis is far behind. Herein, the distinctive structure, adjustable bandgap, and electronic properties of GDY for photocatalysis is firstly summarized. The construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion, including H2 evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and N2 reduction reaction (NRR) are then elaborated. At last, the challenges and perspectives in developing GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production are discussed. It is anticipated that a timely review will be helpful for rapid progress of GDY in solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus Effect of Lewis Acid Enables One&#8208;Step Block Copolymerization of Ethylene Oxide and N&#8209;Sulfonyl Aziridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step sequence&#8208;selective block copolymerization requires stringent catalytic control of monomers relative activity and enchainment order. It has been especially rare for AnBm&#8208;type block copolymers from simple binary monomer mixtures. Here, ethylene oxide (EO) and N&#8209;sulfonyl aziridine (Az) compose a valid pair provided with a bicomponent metal&#8208;free catalyst. Optimal Lewis acid/base ratio allows the two monomers to strictly block&#8208;copolymerize in a reverse order (EO&#8208;first) as compared with the conventional anionic route (Az&#8208;first). Livingness of the copolymerization facilitates one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers by addition of mixed monomers in batches. Calculation results reveal that a Janus effect of Lewis acid on the two monomers is key to enlarge the activity difference and reverse the enchainment order.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterobimetallic NiFe Cooperative Molecular Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported herein the development of heterobimetallic NiFe molecular platform to understand NiFe synergistic effect in water oxidation catalysis. Compared to homonuclear bimetallic compounds (NiNi and FeFe), NiFe complex possesses more remarkable catalytic water oxidation performance. Mechanistic studies suggest that this remarkable difference is attributed to the fact that NiFe synergy can effectively promote O&#8208;O bond formation. The generated NiIII(&#956;&#8208;O)FeIV=O is the key intermediate and O&#8208;O bond was formed via intramolecular oxyl&#8208;oxo coupling between bridged O radical and terminal FeIV=O moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Piperazinones Enabled by Benzilic Amide Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedent asymmetric catalytic benzilic amide rearrangement for the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitutedpiperazinones is reported. The reaction proceeds via a domino [4+1] imidazolidination/formal 1,2&#8208;nitrogen shift/1,2&#8208;aryl or alkyl migration sequence, employing readily available vicinal tricarbonyl compounds and 1,2&#8208;diamines as starting materials. This approach provides an efficient access to chiral C3&#8208;disubsituted piperazin&#8208;2&#8208;ones with high enantiocontrol, which are exceedingly difficult to access from the existing synthetic methodologies. The observed enantioselectivity was proposed to be controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution in the 1,2&#8208;aryl/alkyl migration step. The resulting densely functionalized products are versatile building blocks to bioactive natural products, drug molecules and their analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Nucleation&#8208;Growth Strategy for Controllable Heterogeneous Supramolecular Polymerization of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers and Their Hierarchical Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly morphologies of subunits are largely governed by thermodynamics, which plays a less important role in dimensional control. Particularly for one&#8208;dimensional assemblies from block copolymers (BCPs), the negligible energy difference between short and long ones imposes great challenges in length control. Herein, we report that by incorporating additional polymers to induce in&#8208;situ nucleation and trigger the subsequent growth, controllable supramolecular polymerization driven by mesogenic ordering effect could be realized from liquid crystalline BCPs. The length of the resultant fibrillar supramolecular polymers (SP) is controlled by tuning the ratio between nucleating and growing components. Depending on the choice of BCPs, the SPs can be homopolymer&#8208;like, heterogeneous triblock, and even pentablock copolymer&#8208;like. More interestingly, with insoluble BCP as a nucleating component, amphiphilic SPs are fabricated, which can undergo spontaneous hierarchical assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;to&#8208;Static Planar Chirality Conversion in Pillar[5]arenes Regulated by Guest Solvents or Amplified by Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling dynamic chirality and memorizing the controlled chirality are important. The chirality memory mainly has been achieved using noncovalent interactions. However, in many cases, the memorized chirality by noncovalent interactions is erased by changing conditions such as solvent and temperature. In this study, the dynamic planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes was successfully converted to static planar chirality by introducing bulky groups using covalent bonds. Before introducing the bulky groups, pillar[5]arene with stereogenic carbons at both rims existed as a pair of diastereomers, and thus showed planar chiral inversion dependent on guest solvent chain length. The pS and pR forms, regulated by guest solvents, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups. Furthermore,&#160;diastereomeric excess was amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene&#160;The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded pillar[5]arene with excellent diastereomeric excess (95%de).</dc:description>

         <title>Uniform Growth of Nanocrystalline ZIF&#8208;8 on Cellulose Nanocrystals: Useful Template for Microporous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals were uniformly grown on the surface of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) to give a hybrid material, ZIF@CNCs. By varying the stoichiometry of the components, it was possible to control the size of the ZIF&#8208;8 crystals grown on the CNC surface. Optimized ZIF@CNC (ZIF@CNC&#8208;2) was used as a template to synthesize a microporous organic polymer (MOP), ZIF@MOP@CNC. After etching the ZIF&#8208;8 with 6 M HCl solution, a MOP material with encapsulated CNCs (MOP@CNC) was formed. Zinc coordination into the porphyrin unit of the MOP yielded the ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle structure, Zn MOP@CNC, comprised of CNCs encapsulated within the Zn&#8208;MOP. In comparison to ZIF@CNC&#8208;2, Zn MOP@CNC showed better catalytic activity and chemical stability for CO2 fixation, converting epichlorohydrin to chloroethylene carbonate. This work demonstrates a novel approach to create porous materials through CNC templating.</dc:description>

         <title>A polarized gel electrolyte for wide&#8208;temperature flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries (FZABs) has attracted broad attention in the field of portable and wearable electronic devices. Gel electrolyte is one of the most important components in FZABs, which is urgent to be optimized to match with the Zn anode and adapt to the severe climates at high and ultralow temperatures. In this work, a polarized gel electrolyte of polyacrylamide&#8208;sodium citric (PAM&#8208;SC) is designed for FZABs, in which the SC molecules contain a large amount of polarized &#8208;COO&#8208; functional groups. The polarized &#8208;COO&#8208; groups forms an electrical field at the interface of gel electrolyte and Zn anode to uniformize the Zn2+ transport and suppress the formation of Zn dendrites. Besides, the polarized &#8208;COO&#8208; terminal groups in PAM&#8208;SC can fix numerous water molecules in the gel electrolyte, which prevents the water from freezing at ultralow temperatures and evaporating at high temperatures. The polarized PAM&#8208;SC hydrogel delivers a high ionic conductivity of 324.68 mS cm&#8208;1 and water retention of 96.85% after being exposed to air for 96 h. FZABs with the PAM&#8208;SC gel electrolyte exhibit a long cycling life of 700 cycles at a low temperature of &#8208;40 &#8451;, showing the application prospect of FZABs under extreme conditions.</dc:description>

Gel electrolyte is one of the most important components in FZABs, which is urgent to be optimized to match with the Zn anode and adapt to the severe climates at high and ultralow temperatures. In this work, a polarized gel electrolyte of polyacrylamide-sodium citric (PAM-SC) is designed for FZABs, in which the SC molecules contain a large amount of polarized -COO- functional groups. The polarized -COO- groups forms an electrical field at the interface of gel electrolyte and Zn anode to uniformize the Zn2+ transport and suppress the formation of Zn dendrites. Besides, the polarized -COO- terminal groups in PAM-SC can fix numerous water molecules in the gel electrolyte, which prevents the water from freezing at ultralow temperatures and evaporating at high temperatures. The polarized PAM-SC hydrogel delivers a high ionic conductivity of 324.68 mS cm-1 and water retention of 96.85% after being exposed to air for 96 h.

         <dc:description>Developing deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with both high efficiency and color purity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we proposed a design strategy by integrating asymmetric oxygen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (O&#8208;B&#8208;N) MR unit into traditional N&#8208;B&#8208;N MR molecules to form a rigid and extended O&#8208;B&#8208;N&#8208;B&#8208;N MR &#960;&#8208;skeleton. Three deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters of OBN, NBN and ODBN featuring asymmetric O&#8208;B&#8208;N, symmetric N&#8208;B&#8208;N and extended O&#8208;B&#8208;N&#8208;B&#8208;N MR units were synthesized through the regioselective one&#8208;shot electrophilic C&#8208;H borylation at different positions of the same precursor. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitter ODBN exhibited respectable deep&#8208;blue emission with CIE coordinate of (0.16, 0.03), high PLQY of 93% and narrow full width at half maximum of 26 nm in toluene. Impressively, the simple trilayer OLED employing ODBN as emitter achieved a high external quantum efficiency up to 24.15% accompanied by a deep blue emission with the corresponding CIE y coordinate below 0.1.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bandgap&#8208;tunableTransition Metal Sulfides through Gas&#8208;phase Cation Exchange&#8208;induced Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oriented synthesis of transition metal sulfides (TMSs) with controlled compositions and crystal structures has long been promising for electronic devices and energy applications. Liquid&#8208;phase cation exchange (LCE) is a well&#8208;studied route by varying the compositions. However, achieving crystal structure selectivity is still a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate gas&#8208;phase cation exchange (GCE), which can induce a specific topological transformation (TT), for the synthesis of versatile TMSs with identified cubic or hexagonal crystal structures. The parallel six&#8208;sided subunit (PSS), a new descriptor, is defined to describe the substitution of cations and the transition of the anion sublattice. Under this principle, the bandgap of targeted TMSs can be tailored. Using the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as an example, the optimal hydrogen evolution rate of a zinc&#8208;cadmium sulfide (ZCS4) is determined to be 11.59 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, showing a 36.2&#8208;fold improvement over CdS.</dc:description>

         <title>Defective Organic Cations and Their in&#8208;Framework Dynamics on Properties of ASnI3 (A = FA or MA) Perovskites: Why FA Yield Higher Photovoltaic Performance than MA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites (tin OIHPs) possess a desirable band gap and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 14%. A commonly held view is that the organic cations in tin OIHPs would have little impact on the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we show that the defective organic cations with randomly dynamic characteristics can have marked effect on optoelectronic properties of the tin OIHPs. Hydrogen vacancies originated from the proton dissociation from FA (HC(NH2)2) in FASnI3 can induce deep transition levels in the band gap but yield relatively small nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8211;15 cm3 s&#8722;1, whereas those from MA (CH3NH3) in MASnI3 can yield much larger nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;11 cm3 s&#8722;1. Additional insight into the &#8220;defect tolerance&#8221; is gained by disentangling the correlations between dynamic rotation of organic cations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Linear and Bent Cp*2Si: Reversable Phase Transition of a Key Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TThe solid&#8208;state structure of decamethylsilicocene Cp*2Si with a bent and a linear molecule in the same unit cell was so far considered an exception in relation to the structures of its all&#8208;bent heavier analogues Cp*2E with E=Ge, Sn, Pb. Here, we present the solution to this conundrum by reporting a low&#8208;temperature phase, where all three symmetrically independent molecules are present in a bent formation. This reversible enantiotropic phase transition occurs in the temperature range between 80 K and 130 K and provides a rationale for the unexpected linear molecule based in entropy beyond hand&#8208;waving explanations such as electronic reasons or packing effects.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the efficient access to long, branched and complex lipopolysaccharides remains challenging. Here, we report the first, modular and orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthesis of tridecasaccharide 1 from Bacteroides vulgates based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoids the issues of thioglycosides&#8208;based one&#8208;pot synthesis. Our approach also featured the followings: (1) 5,7&#8208;O&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene group directed glycosylation for stereoselective construction of &#945;&#8208;Kdo linkage; (2) hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery for stereoselective formation of &#946;&#8208;mannosidic bonds; (3) remote anchimeric assistance effect for stereoselective assembly of &#945;&#8208;fucosyl linkage; (4) several orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthesis and strategic uses of orthogonal protecting groups to streamline oligosaccharides assembly; (5) convergent [1+6+6] one&#8208;pot synthesis of the target 1</dc:description>

         <title>Exciton Localization for Highly Luminescent Two&#8208;Dimensional Tin&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskites through Tin Vacancy Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exciton localization is a conventional approach for preparing highly luminescent semiconductors. However, realizing a strongly localized excitonic recombination in low&#8208;dimensional materials such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites remains challenging. Herein, we first propose a simple and efficient Sn2+ vacancy (VSn) tuning strategy to enhance excitonic localization in 2D (OA)2SnI4 (OA = octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets (PNSs), increasing their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to ~64%, which is among the highest values reported for tin iodide perovskites. Combining experimental with first&#8208;principles calculation results, we confirm that the significantly increased PLQY of (OA)2SnI4 PNSs is primarily due to self&#8208;trapped excitons with highly localized energy states induced by VSn. Moreover, this universal strategy can be applied for improving other 2D Sn&#8208;based perovskites, thereby paving a new way to fabricate diverse 2D lead&#8208;free perovskites with desirable PL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Pretrichodermamide A Biosynthesis Reveals the Hidden Diversity of Epidithiodiketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fungal epidithiodiketopiperazines (ETPs) possess large structural diversity and complexity due to modifications of the cyclodipeptide skeleton. Elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of pretrichodermamide A (1) in Trichoderma hypoxylon revealed a flexible catalytic machinery of multiple enzymes for generating ETP diversity. Seven tailoring enzymes encoded by the tda cluster are involved in 1 biosynthesis, i.e., four P450s TdaB and TdaQ for 1,2&#8208;oxazine formation, TdaI for C7'&#8208;hydroxylation, and TdaG for C4, C5&#8208;epoxidation, two methyltransferases TdaH for C6'&#8208; and TdaO for C7'&#8208;O&#8208;methylation, and a reductase TdaD for furan opening. Gene deletions led to the identification of twenty&#8208;five novel ETPs, including twenty shunt products, indicating the catalytic promiscuities of Tda enzymes. Particularly, TdaG and TdaD accept various substrates and catalyze regiospecific reactions at different stages of 1 biosynthesis. Our study not only uncovers a hidden library of ETP alkaloids, but also helps to understand the hidden chemical diversity of natural products by pathway manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable NIR Fluorescent Probe for NAD(P)H and Its Application to the Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of p53 Abnormalities In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NAD(P)H is crucial for biosynthetic reactions and antioxidant functions. However, the current probes developed for detecting NAD(P)H in vivo require intratumoral injection, which limited their application for animal imaging. To address this issue, we have developed a liposoluble cationic probe, KC8, which exhibits excellent tumor&#8208;targeting ability and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence after reaction with NAD(P)H. By using KC8, it was demonstrated for the first time that the level of NAD(P)H in the mitochondria of living colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was highly related to the abnormality of the p53. Furthermore, KC8 was successfully used to differentiate not only between tumor and normal tissue but also between tumors with p53 abnormality and normal tumors when administered intravenously. Finally, we evaluated tumor heterogeneity through two fluorescent channels after treating a tumor with 5&#8208;Fu. This study provides a new tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of the p53 abnormality of CRC cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering of Titania Boosts Electroassisted Propane Dehydrogenation at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electric field catalysis using surface proton conduction, in which proton hopping and collision on the reactant are promoted by external electricity, is a promising approach to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation in endothermic propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This study proposes a catalyst design concept for more efficient electroassisted PDH at low temperature. Sm was doped into the anatase TiO2 surface to increase surface proton density by charge compensation. Pt&#8211;In alloy was deposited on the Sm&#8208;doped TiO2 for more favorable proton collision and selective propylene formation. The catalytic activity in electroassisted PDH drastically increased by doping an appropriate amount of Sm (1mol % to Ti) where the highest propylene yield of 19.3% was obtained at 300&#176;C where the thermodynamic equilibrium yield was only 0.5%. Results show that surface proton enrichment boosts alkane dehydrogenation at low temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multiresponsive Functional AIEgen for Spatiotemporal Pattern Control and All&#8208;round Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional materials with multi&#8208;responsive properties and good controllability are highly desired for developing bioinspired and intelligent multifunctional systems. Although some chromic molecules have been developed, it is still challenging to realize in&#8208;situ multicolor fluorescence changes based on a single luminogen. Herein, we reported an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen called CPVCM, which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines to trigger luminescence change and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site. Detailed mechanistic insights were carried out to illustrate the reactivity and reaction pathways. Accordingly, multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors, and an all&#8208;round information encryption system were demonstrated to show the properties of multiple controls and responses. It is believed that this work not only provides a strategy to develop multiresponsive luminogens but also develops an information encryption system based on luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Manipulation in a Metal&#8210;Organic Layer through Mechanical Exfoliation for Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin manipulation of transition&#8208;metal catalysts has great potential in mimicking enzyme electronic structures to improve catalytic activity and product selectivity. However, it remains a great challenge to manipulate spin state of catalytic centers for their fixed electronic configurations at room temperature. Herein, we report a facile mechanical exfoliation strategy to in&#8208;situ induce partial spin crossover from high&#8208;spin (s = 5/2) to low&#8208;spin (s = 1/2) of the ferric center across the lattice. Due to spin transition of catalytic center, mixed&#8208;spin catalyst exhibits a high CO yield of 19.7 mmol g&#8722;1 with selectivity of 91.6%, much superior to that of high&#8208;spin bulk counterpart (50% selectivity). Density functional theory calculations reveal that low&#8208;spin 3d&#8208;orbital electronic configuration performs a key function in increasing orbital overlap, significantly promoting CO2 selective adsorption and reducing its activation barrier. Hence, the facile spin manipulation through mechanical exfoliation highlights a new insight into designing highly efficient biomimetic catalysts via optimizing spin state.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Asymmetric Structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Light&#8208;promoted Selective and Efficient Gold Extraction and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing adsorption materials with high adsorption capacities and selectivities is highly desirable for precious metal recovery. Desorption performance is also particularly crucial for subsequent precious metal recovery and adsorbent regeneration. Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) material (NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) with an asymmetric electronic structure of the central zirconium oxygen cluster has an exceptional gold extraction capacity of 2.04 g/g under light irradiation. The selectivity of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 for gold ions is up to 98.8% in the presence of interfering ions. Interestingly, the gold ions adsorbed on the surface of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 spontaneously reduce in situ, undergo nucleation and growth and finally achieve the phase separation of high&#8208;purity gold particles from NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66. The desorption and separation efficiency of gold particles from the adsorbent surface reaches 89%. Theoretical calculations indicate that &#8208;NH2 functions as a dual donor of electrons and protons, and the asymmetric structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 leads to energetically advantageous multinuclear gold capture and desorption. This adsorption material can greatly facilitate the recovery of gold from wastewater and can easily realize the recycling of the adsorbent.</dc:description>

         <title>Deacylative Thiolation by Redox&#8208;Neutral Aromatization&#8208;Driven C&#8722;C Fragmentation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach has been developed to realize deacylative thiolation of common ketones, which provides a unique method to introduce thioether groups site&#8208;specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.







Abstract
Herein we report the development of deacylative thiolation of diverse methyl ketones. The reaction is redox&#8208;neutral, and heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free, which provides a new way to introduce thioether groups site&#8208;specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. It also features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, thus allowing late&#8208;stage derivatization. The process benefits from efficient condensation between the activation reagent and ketone substrates, which triggers aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;C fragmentation and rapid radical coupling with thiosulfonates. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.

         <title>Harnessing the Structure&#8208;Performance Relationships in Designing Non&#8208;Fused Ring Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused ring acceptors for organic solar cells are presented in this Review from the viewpoint of materials design. The cencepts of noncovalent interactions, insertion of sterically hindered side chains, and planarization of the molecular backbone by conformational locking are summarized toward the design of high&#8208;performance materials.







Abstract
The prerequisite for commercially viable organic solar cells (OSC) is to reduce the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;cost gap. Therefore, the cost of organic materials should be reduced by minimizing the synthetic steps, yet maintaining the molecular planarity and efficiencies achieved by the fused ring acceptors (FRA). In this respect, developing non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRA) with suitable functionalization to favor conformational planarity and effective molecular packing is beneficial and cost&#8208;effective. Presently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for NFRAs is around 16&#8201;%, yet lower than the 19&#8201;% achieved for FRAs. Despite their potential, a thorough understanding of the effective structural design of NFRAs is necessary for developing efficient OSCs. This article pays special attention to the molecular design concept for NFRAs developed in the last years and analyzed the approach toward materials design and efficiency improvement, an important step toward technological application.

         <title>ECNU&#8208;13: A High&#8208;Silica Zeolite with Three&#8208;Dimensional and High&#8208;Connectivity Multi&#8208;Pore Structures for Selective Alkene Cracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;silica zeolite skeleton, ECNU&#8208;13, was designed and synthesized by a phase&#8208;discrimination strategy. The crystallization process was directed by the regulation of single four&#8208;membered ring (s4r) units to give rise to two kinds of polymorphs with tridimensional high&#8208;connectivity multi&#8208;pore systems. The ECNU&#8208;13 zeolite demonstrated high propene selectivity in cracking of 1&#8208;butene, with minimized formation of aromatics.







Abstract
A high&#8208;silica zeolite ECNU&#8208;13 (Si/Al=23) with a new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pore system and a nanosized morphology has been developed, consisting of multitudes of 10&#8208;membered ring (10&#8208;R) medium pores and one set of 8&#8208;R small pores. A phase&#8208;discrimination strategy was proposed to synthesize ECNU&#8208;13 by regulating the gel compositions and nucleation processes that were used for preparing 12&#8208;R large&#8208;pore germanosilicate IM&#8208;20 with the known UWY topology. The crystallization was directed towards forming one set of single four&#8208;ring (s4r) composite building units together with one set of double four&#8208;ring (d4r) rather than two different types of d4r units in IM&#8208;20. The electron crystallographic investigations elucidated that the ECNU&#8208;13 structure was composed of two kinds of polymorphs as a result of distinct atomic positionings in s4r units. In catalytic cracking of 1&#8208;butene, ECNU&#8208;13 exhibited high propene selectivity (55.6&#8201;%) and propene to ethylene molar ratio (&gt;4.7) superior to well&#8208;studied conventional ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalyst.

         <title>Peptide Bond Formation in the Protonated Serine Dimer Following Vacuum UV Photon&#8208;Induced Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While collision induced dissociation of protonated serine dimers leads only to cluster breakup, clear evidence that irradiation by Vacuum UV (PID) light leads to intra&#8208;cluster bond formation is presented. Furthermore, comparison with the PID of serine dipeptides suggests that peptide bond formation is involved in the process.







Abstract
Possible routes for intra&#8208;cluster bond formation (ICBF) in protonated serine dimers have been studied. We found no evidence of ICBF following low energy collision&#8208;induced dissociation (in correspondence with previous works), however, we do observe clear evidence for ICBF following photon absorption in the 4.6&#8211;14&#8197;eV range. Moreover, the comparison of photon&#8208;induced dissociation measurements of the protonated serine dimer to those of a protonated serine dipeptide provides evidence that ICBF, in this case, involves peptide bond formation (PBF). The experimental results are supported by ab initio molecular dynamics and exploration of several excited state potential energy surfaces, unraveling a pathway for PBF following photon absorption. The combination of experiments and theory provides insight into the PBF mechanisms in clusters of amino acids, and reveals the importance of electronic excited states reached upon UV/VUV light excitation.

         <title>Directional Transformation of Heterometallic Oxo Clusters: A New Approach to Prepare Wide&#8208;Bandgap Cathode Interlayers for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by sulfur&#8208;containing organic ligands is employed as a molecular model to realize the directional preparation of PbSO4&#8208;PbTi3O7 heterostructure at the cathode interlayer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The oxygen atoms from the sulfate ion in the heterostructure connect with iodine from the perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. An efficiency as high as 24.2&#8201;% for the modified PSC is realized, and the stability of the devices is also improved.







Abstract
Typical wide&#8208;band gap cathode interlayer materials are difficulty in reducing interface recombination without limiting charge transport in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by S&#8208;containing ligands is introduced at the interface of perovskite and SnO2.

&lt;p&gt;A lead-doped titanium-oxo cluster protected by sulfur-containing organic ligands is employed as a molecular model to realize the directional preparation of PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-PbTi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure at the cathode interlayer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The oxygen atoms from the sulfate ion in the heterostructure connect with iodine from the perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. An efficiency as high as 24.2&#8201;% for the modified PSC is realized, and the stability of the devices is also improved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical wide-band gap cathode interlayer materials are difficulty in reducing interface recombination without limiting charge transport in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a lead-doped titanium-oxo cluster protected by S-containing ligands is introduced at the interface of perovskite and SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. By in situ heating, the cluster is transformed into PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-PbTi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure. The oxygen atoms from sulfate ion in heterostructure connect with iodine from perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. While the yielded metallic interface between PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and PbTi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; promotes the electron transport across the interface. Finally, an efficiency as high as 24.2&#8201;% for the modified PSC is obtained. The heterostructure well-stabilize the interface of perovskite and SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to greatly improve the device stability. This work provides a novel strategy to prepare wide-band gap cathode interlayer by directional transformation of heterometallic oxo clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Mediated Spinel Octahedral Structures for Elevated Performances of Li&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;atomic metal could render highly active Co3+ centers exposed through the electron promoter effect and also separate the active sites, thereby regulating the morphology of Li2O2 to elevated performances of Li&#8208;oxygen battery. We found that the single atoms could effectively modulate the active metal oxide with which it is coordinated, thus collectively boosting the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Li&#8208;oxygen batteries have attracted much attention due to its ultra&#8208;high theoretical specific capacity, but the discharge product Li2O2 is easy to accumulate, leading to low battery stability. Here, we demonstrate a series of high&#8208;efficiency cathode catalysts of Co3O4 loaded with single&#8208;atomic metals (M=Ru, Pd, Pt, Au, Ir). The single&#8208;atomic metal could substitute the central Co atom in the octahedral coordination structure and maintain the structural stability; benefiting from the electron promoter effect, rendering more highly active Co3+ exposed, providing rich nucleation sites for Li2O2 deposition. And the loaded M atoms could separate the active Co3+ centers, thereby regulating the dispersion of Li2O2 to obtained a sheet&#8208;like morphology, which could facilitate its decomposition in the subsequent charge cycle. Our work found that the single atoms could effectively modulate the active metal oxide with which it is coordinated, thus collectively boosting the catalytic performance.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Intermolecular Charge Separation of Cationic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high contrast to other dimerization modes of ionic radicals, the cationic radical Pyr&#8208;BA&#8901;+ demonstrates unparalleled spontaneous symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation, generating the mixed valence complex of Pyr&#8208;BA+1+q&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pyr&#8208;BA+1&#8722;q, where q is the degree of charge transfer. Such a unique phenomenon sheds new light on fundamental concepts and uncharted material science.







Abstract
A quadrupolar compound Pyr&#8208;BA with two pyrrole&#8208;type nitrogen atoms doped externally was prepared in this work. In high contrast with other &#960; ionic radicals, its cationic radical Pyr&#8208;BA&#8901;+ undergoes unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), generating the mixed valence complex of Pyr&#8208;BA+1&#8722;q&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pyr&#8208;BA+1+q, where q is the degree of charge transfer. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) single&#8208;crystal analysis, absorption and EPR experiments all confirmed that aggregation and lower temperature would help to facilitate this SB&#8208;CS process. Gibbs energy calculations and gauge&#8208;including magnetically induced current simulation both validate that, for Pyr&#8208;BA&#8901;+, SB&#8208;CS behavior is more favorable than the conventional dimerization mode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows solid single&#8208;crystal evidence for spontaneous SB&#8208;CS between identical ionic radicals. Such a unique phenomenon is of great significance both in terms of fundamental aspects and uncharted material science.

         <title>Spatial Localization of Two Enzymes at Pickering Emulsion Droplet Interfaces for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different enzymes were precisely localized at the inner and outer interfaces of Pickering emulsion droplets with the aid of an asymmetrically modified mesoporous nanosheet. This unique system exhibited significantly enhanced cascading efficiency in oxidation reactions by creating reaction microenvironments appropriate for the different enzymes and enabling efficient intermediate transportation at the droplet interfaces.







Abstract
Developing biocatalytic cascades in abiological conditions is of utmost significance, but such processes often suffer from low reaction efficiency because of incompatible reaction environments and suppressed intermediate transportation. Herein we report a new type of biocatalytic cascade by localizing two different enzymes separately in the outer and inner interfacial layers of Pickering emulsion droplets. This versatile approach enables the localization of two enzymes in their preferred reaction microenvironments and simultaneously in nanoscale proximity of each other. The thus&#8208;designed interfacial biocatalytic cascades show outstanding catalytic efficiency in alkene epoxidation and thioether oxidation with in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions, 6.9&#8211;13.6 times higher than the catalytic efficiency of the free enzymes in solution and their multi&#8208;enzymatic counterparts. The remarkable interfacial effect of Pickering droplets was found to be responsible for the significantly enhanced cascading efficiency.

A novel concept of a &#8220;Zn&#8208;organic battery&#8221; and a Cu nanosheet/Cu foil electrocatalyst were presented for the simultaneous efficient energy delivery and semi&#8208;hydrogenation of biomass aldehyde derivatives, achieving an impressive electrochemical performance of 2.00&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maximum power density and 14.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maximum current density.







Abstract
Electricity generation and chemical productions are both critically important for the sustainable development of modern civilization. Here, a novel bifunctional Zn&#8208;organic battery has been established for the concurrent enhanced electricity output and semi&#8208;hydrogenations of a series of biomass aldehyderivatives, for the high value&#8208;added chemical syntheses. Among them, the typical Zn&#8208;furfural (FF) battery equipped with Cu foil&#8208;supported edge&#8208;enriched Cu nanosheets as cathodic electrocatalyst (Cu NS/Cu foil), provides a maximum current density and power density of 14.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 2.00&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and in the meantime, produces high value product, furfural alcohol (FAL). The Cu NS/Cu foil catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance of &#8776;93.5&#8201;% conversion ratio and &#8776;93.1&#8201;% selectivity for FF semi&#8208;hydrogenation at a low potential of &#8208;1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl by using H2O as H source, and shows impressive performance for various biomass aldehyderivatives semi&#8208;hydrogenation.

         <title>Boranes Paving the Way to Anionic Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First examples of anionic cAACs (Ani&#8208;cAACs) bearing B(CN)3 or C2F5BF2 as N&#8208;substituents are reported and their stereo&#8208;electronic parameters have been evaluated. These anionic carbenes can replace anionic substituents as exemplified by the formation of selenium adducts and [Ani&#8208;cAAC&#8208;Au&#8208;PPh3].







Abstract
First examples of anionic cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs) that contain borane substituents have been synthesized. The nature of the borane substituents allows a modulation of the &#963;&#8208;donor or &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities compared to their neutral analogues. A B(CN)3&#8208;substituted Ani&#8208;cAAC has been generated and used in situ. The corresponding C2F5BF2&#8208;Ani&#8208;cAAC 6 was obtained in high yield on a multigram scale. First reactions of these novel ligands with elemental selenium and chloro(triphenylphosphine)gold(I) led to the anionic selenium adducts 7 and 8 and the Ani&#8208;cAAC gold complex 9. The properties of these compounds and data derived from theoretical calculations provide an insight into the electronic and steric properties of these novel anionic cAACs. Especially the ease of synthesis and the combination of properties such as negative charge, large buried volume, and good &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability renders Ani&#8208;cAACs unique and promising new building blocks.

         <title>Synergistic Fe&#8722;Se Atom Pairs as Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts Boost Low&#8208;Temperature Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional Fe&#8722;Se atom pair electrocatalyst shows a remarkable oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) performance, and the Fe&#8722;Se/NC based cable&#8208;structure Zn&#8208;air batteries deliver an ultra&#8208;high cycling performance of 741&#8197;h @1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a negligible activity delay at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which mainly attributes to the synergistic interactions of Fe and Se sites.







Abstract
Herein, we successfully construct bifunctional electrocatalysts by synthesizing atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;Se atom pairs supported on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;Se/NC). The obtained Fe&#8722;Se/NC shows a noteworthy bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance with a low potential difference of 0.698&#8197;V, far superior to that of reported Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts. The theoretical calculations reveal that p&#8208;d orbital hybridization around the Fe&#8722;Se atom pairs leads to remarkably asymmetrical polarized charge distributions. Fe&#8722;Se/NC based solid&#8208;state rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC) present stable charge/discharge of 200&#8197;h (1090&#8197;cycles) at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is 6.9&#8197;times of ZABs&#8722;Pt/C+Ir/C. At extremely low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC displays an ultra&#8208;robust cycling performance of 741&#8197;h (4041&#8197;cycles) at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is about 11.7&#8197;times of ZABs&#8722;Pt/C+Ir/C. More importantly, ZABs&#8722;Fe&#8722;Se/NC could be operated for 133&#8197;h (725&#8197;cycles) even at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Extended Pentadecabenzo[9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral bilayer nanographene (EP9H) containing a pentadecabenzo[9]helicene core fragment has been synthesized with an extended &#960;&#8208;system perpendicular to the helical axis of [9]helicene. Furthermore, the structure extension induced significant improvements in the fluorescence quantum yield and circularly polarized luminescence, as evident from the large glum and BCPL values.







Abstract
A novel chiral nanographene (i.e. EP9H) with a pentadecabenzo[9]helicene core fragment has been synthesized and fully characterized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction unambiguously confirms the helical structure. The fluorescence emission of EP9H is located in the near infrared region (&#955;em=684&#8197;nm) with a medium quantum yield (0.10) for helicene derivatives. Cyclic voltammetry reveals its seven quasi&#8208;reversible redox states from &#8722;2 to +5. Furthermore, enantiopure EP9H displays distinct CD signals in a broad spectral range from 300 to 700&#8197;nm. Notably, compared to the reported small organic molecules, EP9H displays an outstanding |glum| value of 4.50&#215;10&#8722;2 and BCPL as 304&#8197;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Triplet Inversions in Non&#8208;Alternant Hydrocarbons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of molecules displaying an inversion of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states has been identified through computational screening of synthesized structures. This observed behavior is attributed to a high&#8208;symmetry pentalene core motif, which is stabilized via aromaticity.







Abstract
Molecules with inversion of the singlet and triplet excited&#8208;state energies are highly promising for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To date, azaphenalenes are the only class of molecules where these inversions have been identified. Here, we screen a curated database of organic crystal structures to identify existing compounds for violations of Hund's rule in the lowest excited states. We identify two further classes with this behavior. The first, a class of zwitterions, has limited relevance to molecular emitters as the singlet&#8208;triplet inversions occur in the third excited singlet state. The second class consists of two D2h&#8208;symmetry non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons, a fused azulene dimer and a bicalicene, whose lowest excited singlet states violate Hund's rule. Due to the connectivity of the polycyclic structure, they achieve this symmetry through aromatic stabilization. These hydrocarbons show promise as the next generation of building blocks for OLED emitters.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of a Continuous ZIF&#8208;67 Membrane for Efficient Azeotropic Organic Solvent Mixture Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To prepare zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes, an ultrathin hydroxy salt precursor layer with high reactivity was constructed in situ. Its excellent induction effect allowed the formation of a continuous and ultrathin ZIF&#8208;67 membrane on various surfaces at room temperature. Due to its pore size and preferential adsorption of polar molecules, the membrane gave excellent separation of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.







Abstract
Azeotropic organic solvent mixture separation is common in the chemical industry but extremely difficult. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) shows great potential in organic solvent mixture separation due to its rigid micropores and excellent stability. However, due to the fast nucleation rate, it is a great challenge to prepare continuous ZIF&#8208;67 membrane layers with ultrathin thickness. In this study, a hydroxy salt layer with high inducible activity was synthesized as a precursor on different porous substrates to prepare ZIF&#8208;67 membranes at room temperature. The precursor layer enables an intact ZIF&#8208;67 membrane with an ultrathin thickness of 176&#177;12&#8197;nm. The experimental and simulation results confirmed that the size sieving through the pore windows and the preferential adsorption of polar solvent molecules provide the ZIF&#8208;67 membrane an unprecedented separation performance such as high separation factors and fluxes, for four types of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.

     alt="Facile Fabrication of a Continuous ZIF-67 Membrane for Efficient Azeotropic Organic Solvent Mixture Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes, an ultrathin hydroxy salt precursor layer with high reactivity was constructed in situ. Its excellent induction effect allowed the formation of a continuous and ultrathin ZIF-67 membrane on various surfaces at room temperature. Due to its pore size and preferential adsorption of polar molecules, the membrane gave excellent separation of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azeotropic organic solvent mixture separation is common in the chemical industry but extremely difficult. Zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) shows great potential in organic solvent mixture separation due to its rigid micropores and excellent stability. However, due to the fast nucleation rate, it is a great challenge to prepare continuous ZIF-67 membrane layers with ultrathin thickness. In this study, a hydroxy salt layer with high inducible activity was synthesized as a precursor on different porous substrates to prepare ZIF-67 membranes at room temperature. The precursor layer enables an intact ZIF-67 membrane with an ultrathin thickness of 176&#177;12&#8197;nm. The experimental and simulation results confirmed that the size sieving through the pore windows and the preferential adsorption of polar solvent molecules provide the ZIF-67 membrane an unprecedented separation performance such as high separation factors and fluxes, for four types of azeotropic organic solvent mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanostructuring of Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets as Long&#8208;range Ordered Arrays in the Framework of Organic Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first compound with long&#8208;range ordered single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) encapsulated in protective framework was synthesized and its structure and magnetic properties were investigated. The findings provide a method to control the nanostructuring of SMM within protective frameworks and further the development of molecular spintronics.







Abstract
The nanostructuring of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) on substrates, in nanotubes and periodic frameworks is highly desired for the future magnetic recording devices. However, the ability to organize SMMs into long&#8208;range ordered arrays in these systems is still lacking. Here, we report the incorporation of magnetic (RECl2(H2O)6)+ (RE=rare earths) molecular groups into the framework of an organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP)&#8212;(H2dabco)CsCl3. Intriguingly, we show the incorporated rare&#8208;earth groups self&#8208;organized into long&#8208;range ordered arrays that uniformly and periodically distributed in the A sites of OMHP. The ordered (RECl2(H2O)6)+ groups serve as SMMs in the perovskite frameworks, exhibiting large effective magnetic moment, moderate magnetic anisotropy and two&#8208;step relaxation behavior. With the additional merit of great structural flexibility and multifunction of OMHPs, the preparation of the first SMMs@OMHP magnetic materials furthers the development of molecular spintronics.

         <title>Stable Ketenyl Anions via Ligand Exchange at an Anionic Carbon as Powerful Synthons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide, a (phosphino)diazomethyl anion salt (1) undergoes a facile N2/CO exchange reaction giving a (phosphino)ketenyl anion salt (2). Reactivity investigations showed that the ketenyl anion can be a versatile synthon for derivatives of ketene, enolate, acrylate and acrylimidate moieties.







Abstract
Under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide (CO), a (phosphino)diazomethyl anion salt [[P]&#8208;CN2][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)(THF)] (1) ([P]=[(CH2)(NDipp)]2P; 18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) undergoes a facile N2/CO exchange reaction giving the (phosphino)ketenyl anion salt [[P]&#8208;CCO][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)] (2). Oxidation of 2 with elemental Se affords the (selenophosphoryl)ketenyl anion salt [P](Se)&#8208;CCO][K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)] (3). These ketenyl anions feature a strongly bent geometry at the P&#8208;bound carbon and this carbon atom is highly nucleophilic. The electronic structure of the ketenyl anion [[P]&#8208;CCO]&#8722; of 2 is examined by theoretical studies. Reactivity investigations demonstrate 2 as a versatile synthon for derivatives of ketene, enolate, acrylate and acrylimidate moieties.

         <title>ARMOR: Auto&#8208;Assembled Resilient Biomimetic Calcified Ornaments for Selective Cell Protection by Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Driven Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Auto&#8208;assembled Resilient bioMimetic calcified ORnaments (ARMOR) strategy was created by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based HCR and Ca2+ assisted calcification for selective cell protection. The ARMOR can shield cells from external assaults and enhance the survival rate of the protected cells in an unfavorable environment. The ARMOR&#8208;based cell capture strategy can obtain more intact genetic information and provide a new method for clinical CTC analysis.







Abstract
Unlike plant and microbial cells having cell walls, the outermost layer of mammalian cell is a delicate, two&#8208;layered structure of phospholipids with proteins embedded, which is susceptible to environmental changes. It is necessary to create an &#8220;armor&#8221; on cell surface to protect cell integrity. Here, we propose an Auto&#8208;assembled Resilient bioMimetic calcified ORnaments (ARMOR) strategy driven by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and Ca2+ assisted calcification for selective cell protection. This co&#8208;recognition design enhances the selectivity and leverages robust in situ signal amplification by HCR to improve the sensitivity. The calcified shell is cogenerated by crosslinking the alginate&#8208;HCR product with Ca2+ ion. ARMOR has high efficiency for shielding cells from environmental assaults, which can be applied to circulating tumor cell (CTC) protection, isolation, and identification, maintaining the native state and intact genetic information for downstream analysis.

Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are one of the most intriguing electrocatalysts with maximized material efficiency. For their viable applications in industries, the next challenge is ensuring their long&#8208;term stability. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in understanding the operational stability of SACs and provides an outlook for their future developments.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are appealing next&#8208;generation catalysts for various electrochemical technologies. Along with significant breakthroughs in their initial activity, SACs now face the next challenge for their viable applications, insufficient operational stability. In this Minireview, we summarize the current knowledge of SAC degradation mechanisms mainly based on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SACs, some of the most investigated SACs. Recent studies on isolated metal, ligand, and support degradations are introduced, and the underlying fundamentals of each degradation path are categorized into active site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF) losses. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects for the future outlook of stable SACs.

         <title>Highly Strained Oxygen&#8208;Doped Chiral Molecular Belts of the Zigzag&#8208;Type with Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;directional cyclization strategy has been used to synthesize depth&#8208;expanded oxygen&#8208;doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag&#8208;type. The approach involved the closure of fjords at the upper rim and the growth of fused rings at the lower rim of resorcin[4]arene derivatives to afford highly strained chiral belts having excellent CPL properties, with |glum| up to 0.022.







Abstract
Herein we report a two&#8208;directional cyclization strategy for the synthesis of highly strained depth&#8208;expanded oxygen&#8208;doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag&#8208;type. From the easily accessible resorcin[4]arenes, an unprecedented cyclization cascade generating fused 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phenalenes has been developed to access expanded molecular belts. Stitching up the fjords through intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution and ring&#8208;closing olefin metathesis reactions furnished a highly strained O&#8208;doped C2&#8208;symmetric belt. The enantiomers of the acquired compounds exhibited excellent chiroptical properties. The calculated parallelly aligned electric (&#956;) and magnetic (m) transition dipole moments are translated to the high dissymmetry factor (|glum| up to 0.022). This study provides not only an appealing and useful strategy for the synthesis of strained molecular belts but also a new paradigm for the fabrication of belt&#8208;derived chiroptical materials with high CPL activities.

&lt;p&gt;A two-directional cyclization strategy has been used to synthesize depth-expanded oxygen-doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag-type. The approach involved the closure of fjords at the upper rim and the growth of fused rings at the lower rim of resorcin[4]arene derivatives to afford highly strained chiral belts having excellent CPL properties, with |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| up to 0.022.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report a two-directional cyclization strategy for the synthesis of highly strained depth-expanded oxygen-doped chiral molecular belts of the zigzag-type. From the easily accessible resorcin[4]arenes, an unprecedented cyclization cascade generating fused 2,3-dihydro-1H-phenalenes has been developed to access expanded molecular belts. Stitching up the fjords through intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution and ring-closing olefin metathesis reactions furnished a highly strained O-doped C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric belt. The enantiomers of the acquired compounds exhibited excellent chiroptical properties. The calculated parallelly aligned electric (&lt;b&gt;&#956;&lt;/b&gt;) and magnetic (&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;) transition dipole moments are translated to the high dissymmetry factor (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| up to 0.022). This study provides not only an appealing and useful strategy for the synthesis of strained molecular belts but also a new paradigm for the fabrication of belt-derived chiroptical materials with high CPL activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Solvated Double&#8208;Layer Polymer Electrolytes with Molecular Interactions Mediated Stable Interfaces for Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte and/or anode&#8208;electrolyte interface in polymer&#8208;based sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) will deteriorate their cycle performance. Herein, a unique solvated double&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (SDL&#8208;QSPE) with high Na+ ion conductivity is designed to simultaneously improve stability on both cathode and anode sides. Different functional fillers are solvated with plasticizers to improve Na+ conductivity and thermal stability. The SDL&#8208;QSPE is laminated by cathode&#8208; and anode&#8208;facing polymer electrolyte to meet the independent interfacial requirements of the two electrodes. The interfacial evolution is elucidated by theoretical calculations and 3D X&#8208;ray microtomography analysis. The Na0.67Mn2/3Ni1/3O2|SDL&#8208;QSPE|Na batteries exhibit 80.4 mAh g&#8208;1 after 400 cycles at 1 C with the Coulombic efficiency close to 100%, which significantly outperforms those batteries using the monolayer&#8208;structured QSPE.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Local Lattice Distortion for Spectrally Stable and Efficient Mixed&#8208;halide Blue Perovskite LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Mixed&#8208;halide perovskites are considered the most straightforward candidates to realize blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, they suffer severe halide migration, leading to spectral instability, which is particularly exaggerated in high chloride alloying perovskites. Here, we demonstrate energy barrier of halide migration can be tuned by manipulating the degree of local lattice distortion (LLD). Enlarging the LLD degree to a suitable level can increase the halide migration energy barrier. We herein report an &#8216;A&#8208;site&#8217; cation engineering to tune the LLD degree to an optimal level. DFT simulation and experimental data confirm that LLD manipulation suppresses the halide migration in perovskites. Conclusively, mixed&#8208;halide blue PeLEDs with a champion EQE of 14.2% at 475 nm have been achieved. Moreover, the devices exhibit excellent operational spectral stability (T50 of 72 min), representing one of the most efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs reported yet.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplification of Dissymmetry&#160;for Circularly Polarized Photodetection by Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly&#160;polarized photodetectors&#160;require chiral light absorption materials&#160;with high sensing efficiency and low costs. Here the readily accessible point chirality has been introduced to dicyanostilbenes as the chiral source, facilitating remote chirality transfer to the &#960;&#8208;aromatic core by cooperative supramolecular polymerization. The single&#8208;handed supramolecular polymers display powerful circularly polarized photodetection&#160;capability with the dissymmetry factor value as high as 0.83, superior to those of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and oligomers. Strong chiral amplification occurs between the enantiopure sergeants and the achiral soldiers. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit comparable photodetection efficiency to that of the homopolymeric ones, with a 90% decrease in the enantiopure compound consumption. Therefore, cooperative supramolecular polymerizationprovides an effective yet economical avenue toward circularly polarized photodetection applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Stable Diazoalkenes by Diazo Transfer from Azides: Pyridine&#8208;Derived Diazoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, stable diazoalkenes have received significant attention as a new substance class in organic chemistry. While their previous synthetic access was exclusively limited to the activation of nitrous oxide, we here establish a much more general synthetic approach utilizing a Regitz&#8208;type diazo transfer with azides. Importantly, this approach is also applicable to weakly polarized olefins such as 2&#8208;pyridine olefins. The new pyridine diazoalkenes are not accessible by the activation of nitrous oxide, allowing for a considerable extension of the scope of this only recently accessed functional group. The new diazoalkene class has properties distinct from the previously reported classes, such as photochemical triggered loss of dinitrogen affords cumulenes and not C&#8208;H insertion products. Pyridine derived diazoalkenes represent the so far least polarized stable diazoalkene class reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral control of gas&#8208;phase molecules using microwave pulses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microwave three&#8208;wave mixing has emerged as a novel approach for studying chiral molecules in the gas phase. This technique employs resonant microwave pulses and is a non&#8208;linear and coherent approach. It serves as a robust method to differentiate between the enantiomers of chiral molecules and to determine the enantiomeric excess, even in complex chiral mixtures. Besides such analytical applications, the use of tailored microwave pulses allows us to control and manipulate chirality at the molecular level. Here, an overview of some recent developments in the area of microwave three&#8208;wave mixing and its extension to enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer is provided. The latter is an important step towards enantiomer separation &#8211; in energy and finally in space. In the last section, we present new experimental results on how to improve enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer to achieve an enantiomeric excess of about 40% in the rotational level of interest using microwave pulses alone.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosterically Regulated Guest Binding Determines Framework Symmetry for an FeII4L4 Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of a flexible tritopic aniline and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;formylpyridine subcomponents around iron(II) templates gave rise to low&#8208;spin FeII4L4 capsule, whereas a high&#8208;spin FeII3L2 sandwich species formed when a sterically hindered 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;formylpyridine was used. The FeII4L4 cage adopted a new structure type with S4 symmetry, having two mer&#8208;&#916; and two mer&#8208;&#581; metal vertices, as confirmed by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The flexibility of the face&#8208;capping ligand endows the resulting FeII4L4 framework with conformational plasticity, enabling it to adapt structurally from S4 to T or C3 symmetry upon guest binding. The cage also displayed negative allosteric cooperativity in simultaneously binding different guests within its cavity and at the apertures between its faces.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantiopure seven&#8208;membered ring embedded [6]helicene and carbo[7]helicene (&gt;99% ee) with an opposite helicity were simultaneously and quantitatively (&gt;99%) synthesized with a perfect stereospecificity through stepwise acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne annulations of doubly axial&#8208;chiral cyclization precursors. The helical handedness of the [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes was fully stereo&#8208;controlled by the doubly axial chirality of the precursors as a result of complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer. The cyclizations proceeded in a stepwise manner; the first six&#8208;membered ring formation was followed by the kinetically&#8208;controlled seven&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring formation with or without helix&#8208;inversion of a [4]helicene intermediate generated during the first cyclization step, thus quantitatively producing enantiopure circularly polarized luminescent [6]&#8208; and [7]helicenes with an opposite helicity, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Zn metal anodes enabled by trace amounts of underpotential deposition initiators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Routine electrolyte additives are not effective enough for uniform zinc (Zn) deposition, because they are hard to proactively guide atomic&#8208;level Zn deposition. Here, based on underpotential deposition (UPD), we propose an &#8220;escort effect&#8221; of electrolyte additives for uniform Zn deposition at the atomic level. With nickel ion (Ni2+) additives, we found that metallic Ni deposits preferentially and triggers the UPD of Zn on Ni. This facilitates firm nucleation and uniform growth of Zn while suppressing side reactions. Besides, Ni dissolves back into the electrolyte after Zn stripping with no influence on interfacial charge transfer resistance. Consequently, the optimized cell operates for over 900 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2 (more than 4 times longer than the blank one). Moreover, the universality of &#8220;escort effect&#8221; is identified by using Cr3+ and Co2+ additives. This work would inspire a wide range of atomic&#8208;level principles by controlling interfacial electrochemistry for various metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chasing the Elusive "In&#8208;Between" State of the Copper&#8208;Amyloid&#946; Complex by X&#8208;ray Absorption through Partial Thermal Relaxation after Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The redox activity of Cu ions bound to the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide is implicated as a source of oxidative stress in the context of Alzheimer's disease. In order to explain the efficient redox cycling between Cu(II)&#8208;A&#946; (distorted square pyramidal) and Cu(I)&#8208;A&#946; (digonal) resting states, the existence of a low&#8208;populated "in&#8208;between" state, prone to bind Cu in both oxidation states, has been postulated. Here, we exploited the partial X&#8208;ray induced photoreduction at 10 K, followed by a thermal relaxation at 200 K, to trap and characterize by X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) a partially reduced Cu&#8208;A&#946;1&#8722;16 species different from the resting states. Remarkably, the XAS spectrum is well&#8208;fitted by a previously proposed model of the "in&#8208;between" state, hence providing the first direct spectroscopic characterization of this intermediate state. The present approach could be used to explore and identify the catalytic intermediates of other relevant metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Stabilized Defective Black Phosphorene as a Lithium&#8208;Like Catalyst for Boosting Nitrogen Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is recognized as a zero&#8208;carbon emission method for NH3 synthesis. However, to date, this technology still suffers from low yield and low selectivity associated with the catalyst. Herein, inspired by the activation of N2 by lithium metal, a highly reactive defective black phosphorene (D&#8208;BPene) is proposed as a lithium&#8208;like catalyst for boosting electrochemical N2 activation. Correspondingly, we also report a strategy for producing environmentally stable D&#8208;BPene by simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection based on topochemical reactions.&#160;Reliable performance evaluations show that the fluorine&#8208;stabilized D&#8208;BPene can induce a high NH3 yield rate of ~70 &#181;g h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of ~26% at &#8208;0.5 V vs. RHE in an aqueous electrolyte. This work not only exemplifies the first stable preparation and practical application of D&#8208;BPene, but also brings a new design idea for NRR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ heterogeneous olefin polymerization has attracted much attention for the synthesis of polyolefin composites. However, the complicated syntheses of specially designed catalysts or the detrimental effects of interactions between catalyst and solid supports pose great challenges. In this contribution, an outer&#8208;shell self&#8208;supporting strategy was designed to heterogenize nickel catalysts on different fillers via precipitation homopolymerization of ionic cluster type polar monomer. These catalysts demonstrated high activity, good product morphology control, and stable performances in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization. Moreover, various polyolefin composites with great mechanical and customized properties can be efficiently synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Polythiophene Derivative with Excellent Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Typical n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are based on fused&#8208;ring electron&#8208;accepting building blocks. Herein, we report a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring strategy to design n&#8208;type conjugated polymers, i.e. introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring polythiophene backbone. The resulting polymer, n&#8208;PT1, shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels of &#8208;3.91 eV/&#8208;6.22 eV, high electron mobility of 0.39 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 and high crystallinity in thin film. After n&#8208;doping, n&#8208;PT1 exhibits excellent thermoelectric performance with an electrical conductivity of 61.2 S cm&#8208;1 and a power factor (PF) of 141.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. This PF is the highest value reported so far for n&#8208;type conjugated polymers and this is the first time for polythiophene derivatives to be used in n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics. The excellent thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;PT1 is due to its superior tolerance to doping. This work indicates that polythiophene derivatives without fused rings are low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Near IR&#160;bandgap semiconducting&#160;2D conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework with rhombic lattice and high mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as a unique class of electronic materials. However, 2D c&#8208;MOFs with band gaps in the Vis&#8208;NIR and high charge carrier mobility are rare. Most of the reported semiconducting 2D c&#8208;MOFs are metallic (i.e. gapless), which largely limits their use in logic devices. Herein, we design a phenanthrotriphenylene&#8208;based, D2h&#8208;symmetric &#960;&#8208;extended ligand (OHPTP), and synthesize the first rhombic 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystals (Cu2(OHPTP)). The continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) analysis unveils the orthorhombic crystal structure at the atomic level with a unique AB layer stacking. The Cu2(OHPTP) is a p&#8208;type semiconductor with an indirect band gap of ~0.50 eV and exhibits high electrical conductivity of 0.10 S cm&#8208;1 and high charge carrier mobility of ~10.0 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1. Theoretical calculations underline the predominant role of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport in this semiquinone&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromatic Amides: A Smart Backbone toward Isolated Ultralong Bright Blue&#8208;Phosphorescence in Confined Polymeric Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Represented herein is heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free aromatic amides enabling population of 3(&#1087;,&#1087;*) configuration for bright long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence. Isolated inherent deep&#8208;blue (0.155, 0.056) to sky&#8208;blue (0.175, 0.232) phosphorescence with high quantum yield (up to 34.7%) in confined films are achieved. Spectroscopic study and theoretical calculation demonstrated the strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling of 1(&#1087;,&#1087;*)/3(n,&#1087;*) and 1(n,&#1087;*)/3(&#1087;,&#1087;*) states within the aromatic amides (4&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;N&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzamide (P1), 3,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;N&#8208;(yridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzamide (P2), 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzamide (P3)), as well as the robust hydrogen bonding with polyvinyl alcohol to suppress vibrational relaxation and stacking&#8208;induced quenching. The blue afterglow films can last for several seconds showcasing in information display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting and white light afterglow. The high population of emissive 3(&#1087;,&#1087;*) states and facile accessibility of aromatic amide skeleton provide an important molecular design prototype to manipulate triplet excited states for ultralong phosphorescence at blue and other regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerization Strategies to Construct a 3D&#160;Polymer Passivation Network toward High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;spontaneously formed uncoordinated Pb2+ defects usually make the perovskite films demonstrate strong n&#8208;type with relatively lower carrier diffusion length and serious non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss. In this work, we adopt different polymerization strategies to construct three&#8208;dimensional passivation frameworks in the perovskite layer. Thanks to the strong C&#8801;N&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb coordination bonding and the penetrating passivation structure, the defect state density is obviously reduced, accompanied by a significant increase in the carrier diffusion length. Additionally, the reduction of iodine vacancies also changed the Fermi level of the perovskite layer from strong n&#8208;type to weak n&#8208;type, which substantially promotes the energy level alignment and carrier injection efficiency. As a result, the optimized device achieved an efficiency exceeded 24% (the certified efficiency is 24.16%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194 V, and the corresponding module achieved an efficiency of 21.55%.</dc:description>

         <title>The Lewis acid&#8208;mediated radical stabilization and dynamic covalent bonding: tunable, reversible and photocontrollable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a strategy not only to isolate a dynamically stable radical with physical property tunability, but to efficiently regulate the radical dissociation with reversibility and photo controllability. The addition of Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (BCF) into the solution of a radical &#963;&#8208;dimer (1&#8208;1) led to a stable radical (1&#8226;&#8208;2B), which has been characterized by EPR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in conjunction with theoretical calculation. The radical species is stabilized mainly by captodative effect, single electron transfer and steric effect. The absorption maximum of the radical can be tuned by using different Lewis acids. Dimer 1&#8208;1 can be achieved back by addition of a stronger base into the solution of 1&#8226;&#8208;2B, exhibiting a reversible process. By introducing a photo BCF generator, the dissociation of the dimer and the formation of the radical adduct become photocontrollable.</dc:description>

         <title>A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vacuum&#8208;stable&#8208;by&#8208;design MALDI matrix enables long MALDI MS imaging measurements of at least 72&#8197;hours. Using a photo&#8208;removable 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) group, organic synthesis transformed the widely used, but unfortunately very volatile MALDI matrix 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy acetophenone (2,5&#8208;DHAP) into a vacuum&#8208;stable matrix, which can be uncaged by the MALDI laser in the ion source and then perform as the common matrix 2,5&#8208;DHAP.







Abstract
Insufficient vacuum stability of matrix chemicals is a major limitation in matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of large tissue sample cohorts. Here, we designed and synthesized the photo&#8208;cleavable caged molecule 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxyacetophenone (DMNB&#8208;2,5&#8208;DHAP) and employed it for lipid MALDI&#8208;MSI of mouse brain tissue sections. DMNB&#8208;2,5&#8208;DHAP is vacuum&#8208;stable in a high vacuum MALDI ion source for at least 72&#8197;h. Investigation of the uncaging process suggested that the built&#8208;in laser (355&#8197;nm) in the MALDI ion source promoted the in situ generation of 2,5&#8208;DHAP. A caging group is used for the first time in designing a MALDI matrix that is vacuum&#8208;stable, uncaged upon laser irradiation during the measurement process, and that boosts lipid ion intensity with MALDI&#8208;2 laser&#8208;induced postionization.

         <title>Amorphous NiFe Oxide&#8208;based Nanoreactors for Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous NiFe oxide&#8208;based nanoreactors were synthesized and applied as water oxidation electrocatalysts. The nanoreactor structure changes the catalyst&#8242;s spatial curvature and mass transfer, enriching OH&#8722; on the catalyst surface and inside the channels, so that a high current density is obtained. In addition, the combination of amorphousness and nanoreactors synergistically promotes oxygen evolution, achieving the effect of &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221;.







Abstract
Synergy engineering is an important way to enhance the kinetic activity of oxygen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Here, we fabricated NiFe amorphous nanoreactor (NiFe&#8208;ANR) oxide as OER electrocatalysts via a mild self&#8208;catalytic reaction. Firstly, the amorphousness helps transform NiFe&#8208;ANR into highly active hydroxyhydroxides, and its many fine&#8208;grain boundaries increase active sites. More importantly, as proved by experiments and finite element analysis, the nanoreactor structure alters the spatial curvature and the mass transfer over the catalyst, thereby enriching OH&#8722; in the catalyst surface and inner part. Thus, the catalyst with the structure of amorphous nanoreactors gained excellent activity, far superior to the NiFe catalyst with the structure of crystalline nanoreactor or amorphous non&#8208;nanoreactor. This work provides new insights into the applications and mechanisms of amorphousness and nanoreactors, embodying the &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; synergy of crystalline state and morphology.

     alt="Amorphous NiFe Oxide-based Nanoreactors for Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amorphous NiFe oxide-based nanoreactors were synthesized and applied as water oxidation electrocatalysts. The nanoreactor structure changes the catalyst&#8242;s spatial curvature and mass transfer, enriching OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on the catalyst surface and inside the channels, so that a high current density is obtained. In addition, the combination of amorphousness and nanoreactors synergistically promotes oxygen evolution, achieving the effect of &#8220;1+1&amp;gt;2&#8221;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergy engineering is an important way to enhance the kinetic activity of oxygen-evolution-reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Here, we fabricated NiFe amorphous nanoreactor (NiFe-ANR) oxide as OER electrocatalysts via a mild self-catalytic reaction. Firstly, the amorphousness helps transform NiFe-ANR into highly active hydroxyhydroxides, and its many fine-grain boundaries increase active sites. More importantly, as proved by experiments and finite element analysis, the nanoreactor structure alters the spatial curvature and the mass transfer over the catalyst, thereby enriching OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the catalyst surface and inner part. Thus, the catalyst with the structure of amorphous nanoreactors gained excellent activity, far superior to the NiFe catalyst with the structure of crystalline nanoreactor or amorphous non-nanoreactor. This work provides new insights into the applications and mechanisms of amorphousness and nanoreactors, embodying the &#8220;1+1&amp;gt;2&#8221; synergy of crystalline state and morphology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Studying Regioisomer Formation in the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Fluorination of Cyclic Vinyl Triflates: Evidence for in situ Ligand Modification
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental and computational study was conducted to investigate the regioisomer formation in the Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates. Results suggested that the TESCF3 additive unlocked an alternative reaction pathway involving a usual in situ ligand dearomatization. This new mechanism prevented the formation of Pd&#8208;cyclohexyne intermediates and significantly increased the regioselectivity of the reaction.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic fluorination reactions are important methods for the synthesis of fluoroarenes and fluoroalkenes. However, these reactions can generate a mixture of regioisomeric products that are often difficult to separate. While investigating the Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates, we observed that the addition of a substoichiometric quantity of TESCF3 significantly improved the regioselectivity of the reaction. Herein, we report a combined experimental and computational study on the mechanism of this transformation focusing on the role of TESCF3. The poor regioselectivity of the reaction in the absence of additives results from the formation of LPd&#8208;cyclohexyne complexes (L=biaryl monophosphine ligand). When TESCF3 is added to the reaction mixture, the generation of the Pd&#8208;cyclohexyne complexes is diminished by an unexpected pathway involving the dearomatization of the ligand by nucleophilic attack from a trifluoromethyl anion (CF3&#8722;).

         <title>A Spiro Phosphamide Catalyzed Enantioselective Proton Transfer of Ylides in a Free Carbene Insertion into N&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective free carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond of amines has been achieved. Newly designed high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts, chiral spiro phosphamides, were found to be key and promote the proton transfer of the ylide intermediates and control the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The reaction provides a new approach to amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
Free carbene readily causes multiple side reactions due to its high energy, thus its asymmetric transformation is very difficult. We present here our findings of high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts that enable free carbene insertion into N&#8722;H bonds of amines to prepare chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives with high enantioselectivity. Under irradiation with visible light, diazo compounds produce high&#8208;energy free carbenes that are captured by amines to form free ylide intermediates, and then the newly designed high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acids, chiral spiro phosphamides, promote the proton transfer of ylides to afford the products. Computational and kinetic studies uncover the principle for the rational design of proton&#8208;transfer catalysts and explain how the catalysts accelerate this transformation and provide stereocontrol.

         <title>Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Photoconversion Enabled by Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Triatomic Sites in Partially Oxidized Bimetallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two metallic sites in a pristine bimetallic sulfide do not form sufficiently tight bonds with the C2 intermediate during CO2 photoreduction, which results in an incomplete C&#8722;C coupling, thus giving mixtures of C1 and C2 products. Partial oxidation of the bimetallic sulfide leads to the formation of triatomic sites, enabling enhanced C&#8722;C coupling of the key intermediates to selectively generate C2 products.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction into C2 fuels under mild conditions suffers from low product yield and poor selectivity owing to the kinetic challenge of C&#8722;C coupling. Here, triatomic sites are introduced into bimetallic sulfide to promote C&#8722;C coupling for selectively forming C2 products. As an example, FeCoS2 atomic layers with different oxidation degrees are first synthesized, demonstrated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra. Both experiment and theoretical calculation verify more charges aggregate around the introduced oxygen atom, which enables the original Co&#8722;Fe dual sites to turn into Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe triatomic sites, thus promoting C&#8722;C coupling of double *COOH intermediates. Accordingly, the mildly oxidized FeCoS2 atomic layers exhibit C2H4 formation rate of 20.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, with the product selectivity and electron selectivity of 82.9&#8201;% and 96.7&#8201;%, outperforming most previously reported photocatalysts under similar conditions.

         <title>Enhancement of Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution Activity of 2D &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Bipyridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks via Post&#8208;Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of bipyridine motifs in the 2D conjugated covalent organic framework, 2D&#8208;c&#8208;COF, creates dedicated photoactive sites. Through a simple post&#8208;protonation strategy, the photo&#8208;generated electron&#8211;hole separation of 2D&#8208;c&#8208;COF was significantly enhanced and a hydrophilic pore channel was generated, which synergically lead to a significant improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution represents a promising and sustainable technology. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based photocatalysts have received growing attention. A 2D fully conjugated ethylene&#8208;linked COF (BTT&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF) was fabricated with a dedicated designed active site. The introduced bipyridine sites enable a facile post&#8208;protonation strategy to fine&#8208;tune the actives sites, which results in a largely improved charge&#8208;separation efficiency and increased hydrophilicity in the pore channels synergically. After modulating the degree of protonation, the optimal BTT&#8208;BPy&#8208;PCOF exhibits a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 15.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, which surpasses the biphenyl&#8208;based COF 6 times. By using different types of acids, the post&#8208;protonation is proved to be a potential universal strategy for promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution. This strategy would provide important guidance for the design of highly efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for achieving the multi&#8208;enzymatic performance of SAzymes through regulating the coordination number of heterogeneous manganese single&#8208;atom catalysts (MnSA&#8722;Nx&#8722;C) is designed and implemented. A series of colorimetric biosensing platforms based on MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C SAzyme is successfully built for the specific recognition of biological molecules.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are promising in next&#8208;generation nanozymes, nevertheless, how to rationally modulate the microenvironment of SAzymes with controllable multi&#8208;enzyme properties is still challenging. Herein, we systematically investigate the relationship between atomic configuration and multi&#8208;enzymatic performances. The constructed MnSA&#8722;N3&#8208;coordinated SAzymes (MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C) exhibits much more remarkable oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and glutathione oxidase&#8208;like activities than that of MnSA&#8722;N4&#8722;C. Based on experimental and theoretical results, these multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like behaviors are highly dependent on the coordination number of single atomic Mn sites by local charge polarization. As a consequence, a series of colorimetric biosensing platforms based on MnSA&#8722;N3&#8722;C SAzymes is successfully built for specific recognition of biological molecules. These findings provide atomic&#8208;level insight into the microenvironment of nanozymes, promoting rational design of other demanding biocatalysts.

         <title>Easy Access to Diverse Multiblock Copolymers with On&#8208;Demand Blocks via Thioester&#8208;Relayed In&#8208;Chain Cascade Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization is developed for preparation of diverse multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks, in which thioester groups are built in the polymer backbone by controlled/living polymerizations. These thioester groups further serve as the in&#8208;chain initiating centers to trigger the acyl group transfer ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfides to extend the polymer backbone into multiblock structures.







Abstract
Multiblock copolymers are envisioned as promising materials with enhanced properties and functionality compared with their diblock/triblock counterparts. However, the current approaches can construct multiblock copolymers with a limited number of blocks but tedious procedures. Here, we report a thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization strategy for the easy preparation of multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks, in which thioester groups with on&#8208;demand numbers are built in the polymer backbone by controlled/living polymerizations. These thioester groups further serve as the in&#8208;chain initiating centers to trigger the acyl group transfer ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfides independently and concurrently to extend the polymer backbone into multiblock structures. The compositions, number of blocks, and block degree of polymerization can be easily regulated. This strategy can offer easy access to a library of multiblock copolymers with &#8776;100 blocks in only 2 to 4&#8197;steps.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric Bi0.6Sb0.4Te: Elimination of Detrimental Band Inversion in BiTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual synergistic effect of Sb doping in BiTe is reported that eliminates the detrimental band inversion by weakening the spin&#8208;orbit coupling, thus leading to a rare overlap of conduction band and valence band that significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient. In addition, this effect enhances the carrier mobility owing to the sharp increase in the CB slope along the &#915;&#8208;A direction in the first Brillouin zone.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric materials are the key to miniaturizing refrigeration equipment and have great scientific and social implications, yet their application is hindered by their extreme scarcity. BiTe exhibiting strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling peaks ZT at 600&#8197;K. Herein, we discover the synergy effect of Sb doping in BiTe that eliminates the detrimental band inversion and leads to an overlap of conduction band (CB) and valence band that significantly increases the S from 33 to 124&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;K&#8722;1. In addition, this effect enhances the &#956; from 58 to 92&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 owing to the sharp increase in the CB slope along the &#915;&#8208;A in the first Brillouin zone. Furthermore, Sb doping increases the anharmonicity, shortens the phonon lifetime and lowers &#954;lat. Finally, Se/Sb codoping further optimizes the ZT to 0.6 at 300&#8197;K, suggesting that Bi0.6Sb0.4Te1&#8722;ySey is a potential room&#8208;temperature TE material.

         <title>Fabrication of Highly Oriented Ultrathin Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane from Nanosheets towards Unprecedented Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented sub&#8208;200&#8208;nm&#8208;thick UiO&#8208;66 and NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic framework membranes showed unprecedented CO2/N2 and H2/CO2 separation performances, respectively. Their formation was aided by the preparation of uniform triangular&#8208;shaped UiO&#8208;66 nanosheet seeds via anisotropic etching, confined counter&#8208;diffusion&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth, and the use of a ZrS2 source during epitaxial growth.







Abstract
Concurrent regulation of crystallographic orientation and thickness of zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) membranes is challenging but promising for their performance enhancement. In this study, we pioneered the fabrication of uniform triangular&#8208;shaped, 40&#8197;nm thick UiO&#8208;66 nanosheet (NS) seeds by employing an anisotropic etching strategy. Through innovating confined counter&#8208;diffusion&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth, highly (111)&#8208;oriented 165&#8197;nm&#8208;thick UiO&#8208;66 membrane was prepared. The significant reduction in thickness and diffusion barrier in the framework endowed the membrane with unprecedented CO2 permeance (2070 GPU) as well as high CO2/N2 selectivity (35.4), which surpassed the performance limits of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polycrystalline MOF membranes. In addition, highly (111)&#8208;oriented 180&#8197;nm&#8208;thick NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 membrane showing superb H2/CO2 separation performance with H2 permeance of 1230 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of 41.3, was prepared with the above synthetic procedure.
