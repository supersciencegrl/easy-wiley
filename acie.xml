         <title>Enabling Efficient Anchoring&#8208;Conversion Interface by Fabricating Double&#8208;Layer Functionalized Separator for Suppressing Shuttle Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LiSBs) with high energy density still face challenges on sluggish conversion kinetics, severe shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and low blocking feature of ordinary separators to LiPSs. To tackle these, a novel double&#8208;layer strategy to functionalize separators is proposed, which consists of Co with atomically dispersed CoN4 decorated on Ketjen black (Co/CoN4@KB) layer and an ultrathin 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene layer. The theoretical calculations and experimental results jointly demonstrate metallic Co sites provide efficient adsorption and catalytic capability for long&#8208;chain LiPSs, while CoN4 active sites facilitate the absorption of short&#8208;chain LiPSs and promote the conversion to Li2S. The stacking MXene layer serves as a microscopic barrier to further physically block and chemically anchor leaked LiPSs from the pores and gaps of the Co/CoN4@KB layer, thus preserving LiPSs within efficient anchoring&#8208;conversion reaction interfaces to balance the accumulation of &#8220;dead S&#8221; and Li2S. Consequently, with an ultralight loading of Co/CoN4@KB&#8208;MXene, the LiSBs exhibit amazing electrochemical performance even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte, and the outperforming performance for lithium&#8208;selenium batteries (LiSeBs) can also be achieved. This work exploits a universal and effective strategy of a double&#8208;layer functionalized separator to regulate the equilibrium adsorption&#8208;catalytic interface, enabling high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycle LiSBs/LiSeBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline red phosphorus(CRP), known for its promising photocatalytic properties, faces challenges in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution(PHE) due to undesired inherent charge deep trapping and recombination effects induced by defects. This study overcomes these limitations through an innovative strategy in integrating ruthenium single atoms(Ru1) within CRP to simultaneously repair the intrinsic undesired vacancy defects and serve as the uniformly distributed anchoring sites for a controllable growth into ruthenium nanoparticles(RuNP). Hence, a highly functionalized CRP with Ru1 and RuNP(Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP) with concerted effects in regulating electronic structures and promoting interfacial charge transfer has been achieved. Advanced characterizations unveil the pioneering dual role of pre&#8208;anchored Ru1&#160;in transforming CRP photocatalysis. The regulations of vacancy defects on the surface of CRP minimize the detrimental deep charge trapping, resulting in the prolonged lifetime of charges. With the well&#8208;distributed in&#8208;situ growth of RuNP on Ru1 sites, the constructed robust &#8220;bridge&#8221; that connects CRP and RuNP facilitates constructive interfacial charge transfer. Ultimately, the synergistic effect induced by the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 endows Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP with an exceptional PHE rate of 3175&#956;molh&#8208;1g&#8208;1, positioning it as one of the most efficient elemental&#8208;based photocatalysts. This breakthrough underscores the crucial role of pre&#8208;anchoring metal single atoms at defect sites of catalysts in enhancing hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Nanoclusters and Single Atoms on &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Achieves Low&#8208;Input/Input&#8208;Free Hydrogen Evolution via Decoupled/Coupled Hydrazine Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
The synergistic activation of the bifunctional reaction kinetics of cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles decorated&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon by the concomitant Ru nanoclusters and single atom enables the efficient coupling or decoupling of hydrazine oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction for the multifold H2 production via the zinc hydrazine battery&#8208;driven overall hydrazine splitting system.







Abstract
The hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted H2 evolution method promises low&#8208;input and input&#8208;free hydrogen production. However, developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution (HER) is challenging. Here, we introduce a bifunctional electrocatalyst &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA, merging ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters (NCs) and single atoms (SA) into cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles&#8208;decorated N&#8208;doped carbon (&#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C) nanowires, through electrodeposition. The composite showcases exceptional activity for both HzOR and HER, requiring &#8722;80&#8197;mV and &#8722;9&#8197;mV respectively to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical and experimental insights confirm the importance of two Ru species for bifunctionality: NCs enhance the conductivity, and its coexistence with SA balances the H ad/desorption for HER and facilitates the initial dehydrogenation during the HzOR. In the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system, &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA excels as both anode and cathode materials, achieving 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at just 64&#8197;mV. The zinc hydrazine (Zn&#8722;Hz) battery assembled with &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA cathode and Zn foil anode can exhibit 97.3&#8201;% energy efficiency, as well as temporary separation of hydrogen gas during the discharge process. Therefore, integrating Zn&#8722;Hz with OHzS system enables self&#8208;powered H2 evolution, even in hydrazine sewage. Overall, the amalgamation of NCs with SA achieves diverse catalytic activities for yielding multifold hydrogen gas through advanced cell&#8208;integrated&#8208;electrolyzer system.

         <title>Paper&#8208;in&#8208;Tip Bipolar Electrospray Mass Spectrometry for Real&#8208;Time Chemical Reaction Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first combination of a paper&#8208;based bipolar electrode with mass spectrometry to address the need not only to capture ultrafast dynamics in chemistry, but also to access complementary structural information from diverse reaction scenarios and to explore electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Capturing short&#8208;lived intermediates at the molecular level is key to understanding the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions. Here, we have developed a paper&#8208;in&#8208;tip bipolar electrolytic electrospray mass spectrometry platform, in which a piece of triangular conductive paper incorporated into a plastic pipette tip serves not only as an electrospray emitter but also as a bipolar electrode (BPE), thus triggering both electrospray and electrolysis simultaneously upon application of a high voltage. The bipolar electrolysis induces a pair of redox reactions on both sides of BPE, enabling both electro&#8208;oxidation and electro&#8208;reduction processes regardless of the positive or negative ion mode, thus facilitating access to complementary structural information for mechanism elucidation. Our method enables real&#8208;time monitoring of transient intermediates (such as N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline radical cation, dopamine o&#8208;quinone (DAQ) and sulfenic acid with half&#8208;lives ranging from microseconds to minutes) and transient processes (such as DAQ cyclization with a rate constant of 0.15&#8197;s&#8722;1). This platform also provides key insights into electrocatalytic reactions such as Fe (III)&#8208;catalyzed dopamine oxidation to quinone species at physiological pH for neuromelanin formation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

Automated synthesis of a wide range of unique multicompositional multiblock copolymers via emulsion polymerization is described. These include a heptablock comprising seven different methacrylates, a high molecular weight (&gt;150,000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) tridecablock, and a library of multiblock copolymers with randomized degrees of polymerization, composition, and monomer order. Notably, this library includes a multiblock copolymer containing polymers from four different families (methacrylate, styreme, acrylate, and acrylamide).







Abstract
Synthetic polymers are of paramount importance in modern life &#8208; an incredibly wide range of polymeric materials possessing an impressive variety of properties have been developed to date. The recent emergence of artificial intelligence and automation presents a great opportunity to significantly speed up discovery and development of the next generation of advanced polymeric materials. We have focused on the high&#8208;throughput automated synthesis of multiblock copolymers that comprise three or more distinct polymer segments of different monomer composition bonded in linear sequence. The present work has exploited automation to prepare high molar mass multiblock copolymers (typically&gt;100,000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) using reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in aqueous emulsion. A variety of original multiblock copolymers have been synthesised via a Chemspeed robot, exemplified by a multiblock copolymer comprising thirteen constituent blocks. Moreover, libraries of copolymers of randomized monomer compositions (acrylates, acrylamides, methacrylates, and styrenes), block orders, and block lengths were also generated, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our synthetic approach. One multiblock copolymer contained all four monomer families listed in the pool, which is unprecedented in the literature. The present work demonstrates that automation has the power to render complex and laborious syntheses of such unprecedented materials not just possible, but facile and straightforward, thus representing the way forward to the next generation of complex macromolecular architectures.

         <title>Zwitterionic Cellulose&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte Enabled by Aqueous Solution Casting for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new PEO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte (PL&#8208;ZCNF) is synthesized by integrating zwitterionic cellulose nanofiber (ZCNF) into PEO matrix mixed with LiTFSI, using a straightforward and eco&#8208;friendly aqueous solution casting method. Due to the unique zwitterionic properties, PL&#8208;ZCNF enables an optimized balance between Li ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as the resultant extraordinary long&#8208;term cyclability in full and punch cells.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries hold great promise as the next&#8208;generation batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, PEO&#8208;based electrolytes encounter certain limitations, including inferior ionic conductivity, low Li+ transference number, and poor mechanical strength. Herein, we aim to simultaneously address these issues by utilizing one&#8208;dimensional zwitterionic cellulose nanofiber (ZCNF) as fillers for PEO&#8208;based electrolytes using a simple aqueous solution casting method. Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the unique zwitterionic structure imparts ZCNF with various functions, such as disrupting PEO crystallization, dissociating lithium salts, anchoring anions through cationic groups, accelerating Li+ migration by anionic groups, as well as its inherent reinforcement effect. As a result, the prepared PL&#8208;ZCNF electrolyte exhibits remarkable ionic conductivity (5.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.62) at 60&#8201;&#176;C without sacrificing mechanical strength (9.2&#8197;MPa), together with high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Attributed to these merits of PL&#8208;ZCNF, the LiFePO4|PL&#8208;ZCNF|Li solid&#8208;state full&#8208;cell delivers exceptional rate capability and cycling performance (900&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C). Notably, the assembled pouch&#8208;cell can maintain steady operation over 1000&#8197;cycles with an impressive 93.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 0.5&#8197;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the great potential of PL&#8208;ZCNF for practical applications.

         <title>Reverse Separation of Carbon Dioxide and Acetylene in Two Isostructural Copper Pyridine&#8208;Carboxylate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

Different pore structures can adjust binding configurations of CO2 and C2H2 molecules in two isoreticular ultramicroporous MOFs to show selective adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 for efficient purification of C2H2.







Abstract
Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide is important but highly challenging due to their similar molecular shapes and physical properties. Adsorptive separation of carbon dioxide from acetylene can directly produce pure acetylene but is hardly realized because of relatively polarizable acetylene binds more strongly. Here, we reverse the CO2 and C2H2 separation by adjusting the pore structures in two isoreticular ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Under ambient conditions, copper isonicotinate (Cu(ina)2), with relatively large pore channels shows C2H2&#8208;selective adsorption with a C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 3.4, whereas its smaller&#8208;pore analogue, copper quinoline&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate (Cu(Qc)2) shows an inverse CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 5.6. Cu(Qc)2 shows compact pore space that well matches the optimal orientation of CO2 but is not compatible for C2H2. Neutron powder diffraction experiments confirmed that CO2 molecules adopt preferential orientation along the pore channels during adsorption binding, whereas C2H2 molecules bind in an opposite fashion with distorted configurations due to their opposite quadrupole moments. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have validated the separation performance of Cu(Qc)2 for CO2/C2H2 separation.

         <title>Design, Preparation, and Implementation of Axially Chiral Benzotetramisoles as Lewis Base Catalysts for Asymmetric Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of benzotetramisole Lewis base catalysts (AxBTMs) that have both central and axial chirality were developed. This unique feature of these catalysts results in a three&#8208;dimensional microenvironment with multi&#8208;layers of chirality. The performance of the developed catalysts were tested in a series of cycloaddition reactions, giving cycloaddition products with high stereoselectivities that are otherwise difficult to achieve with conventional BTM catalysts. Control experiments indicated that the axial and central chirality played a synergistic role in controlling the stereochemistry.







Abstract
Developing novel catalysts with potent activity is of great importance in organocatalysis. In this study, we designed and prepared a new class of benzotetramisole Lewis base catalysts (AxBTM) that have both central and axial chirality. This unique feature of these catalysts results in a three&#8208;dimensional microenvironment with multi&#8208;layers of chirality. The performance of the developed catalysts was tested in a series of cycloaddition reactions. These included the AxBTM&#8208;catalyzed (2+2) cycloaddition between &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl anhydride with imines or oxindoles, and the sequential gold/AxBTM&#8208;catalyzed (4+2) cycloaddition of enynamides with pentafluorophenyl esters. The interplay between axial and central chirality had a collaborative effect in regulating the stereochemistry in these cycloadditions, leading to high levels of stereoselectivity that would otherwise be challenging to achieve using conventional BTM catalysts. However, the (2+2) and (4+2) cycloadditions have different predilections for axial and central chirality combinations.

         <title>2D Exfoliation Chemistry Towards Covalent Pseudo&#8208;Layered Phosphate Framework Derived by Radical/Strain&#8208;Synergistical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong ionic/covalent bonding usually requires more aggressive pathways for effective exfoliation purposes. Here, we propose for the first time a radical/strain synergistic strategy for exfoliation of non&#8208;van der Waals interacting pseudolamellar phosphate frameworks. Innovative 2D layered NASICON&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2O2F crystals exfoliated via &#8208;OH/H2O synergism exhibit significantly improved Na&#8208;storage properties compared to bulk frameworks.







Abstract
2D compounds exfoliated from weakly bonded bulk materials with van der Waals (vdW) interaction are easily accessible. However, the strong internal ionic/covalent bonding of most inorganic crystal frameworks greatly hinders 2D material exfoliation. Herein, we first proposed a radical/strain&#8208;synergistic strategy to exfoliate non&#8208;vdW interacting pseudo&#8208;layered phosphate framework. Specifically, hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) distort the covalent bond irreversibly, meanwhile, H2O molecules as solvents, further accelerating interlayered ionic bond breakage but mechanical expansion. The innovative 2D laminar NASICON&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2O2F crystal, exfoliated by &#8901;OH/H2O synergistic strategy, exhibits enhanced sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity, high&#8208;rate performance (85.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;C), cyclic life (2300 cycles), and ion migration rates, compared with the bulk framework. Importantly, this chemical/physical dual driving technique realized the effective exfoliation for strongly coupled pseudo&#8208;layered frameworks, which accelerates 2D functional material development.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure Enables Stable Operation of Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte in High&#8208;Voltage Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure is realized in the co&#8208;solvent ether&#8208;based electrolyte at a medium concentration of 1.5&#8197;M. The introduction of weakly solvated DBE cosolvent greatly weakens the K+&#8208;solvent coordination, reducing the K+ desolvation energy. Furthermore, more anions occupy the inner solvation sheath, which enhances the oxidative stability and facilitates the formation of robust and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. These assure the ultrahigh compatibility with K metal anode and excellent electrochemical performance at high voltage.







Abstract
Electrolytes with anion&#8208;dominated solvation are promising candidates to achieve dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;voltage potassium metal batteries. However, it's challenging to form anion&#8208;reinforced solvates at low salt concentrations. Herein, we construct an anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure at a moderate concentration of 1.5&#8197;M with weakly coordinated cosolvent ethylene glycol dibutyl ether. The unique solvation structure accelerates the desolvation of K+, strengthens the oxidative stability to 4.94&#8197;V and facilitates the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. These enable stable plating/stripping of K metal anode over 2200&#8197;h, high capacity retention of 83.0&#8201;% after 150 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V in K0.67MnO2//K cells, and even 91.5&#8201;% after 30 cycles under 4.7&#8197;V. This work provides insight into weakly coordinated cosolvent and opens new avenues for designing ether&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage electrolytes.

         <title>Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce an alternative to the use of open metal vacancies in the design of amine&#8208;appended adsorbents based on the use of secondary building units combining of hard and soft metal sites. This endows MUV&#8208;10 with a flexible response to the uptake of tetraamines that facilitates their translocation into the microporous cavities of the framework to form stable bis&#8208;coordinate adducts that can remain stable in water.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks can be grafted with amines by coordination to metal vacancies to create amine&#8208;appended solid adsorbents, which are being considered as an alternative to using aqueous amine solutions for CO2 capture. In this study, we propose an alternative mechanism that does not rely on the use of neutral metal vacancies as binding sites but is enabled by the structural adaptability of heterobimetallic Ti2Ca2 clusters. The combination of hard (Ti4+) and soft (Ca2+) metal centers in the inorganic nodes of the framework enables MUV&#8208;10 to adapt its pore windows to the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules. This dynamic cluster response facilitates the translocation and binding of tetraamine inside the microporous cavities to enable the formation of bis&#8208;coordinate adducts that are stable in water. The extension of this grafting concept from MUV&#8208;10 to larger cavities not restrictive to CO2 diffusion will complement other strategies available for the design of molecular sorbents for decarbonization applications.

         <title>Probing Particle&#8208;Carbon/Binder Degradation Behavior in Fatigued Layered Cathode Materials through Machine Learning Aided Diffraction Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique combination of machine learning and &#956;&#8208;XRD CT has been used to unveil the spatial distribution of structure and microstrain in the fatigued layered materials. Smaller NCM622 particles and the surface of larger NCM622 particles in contact with the carbon/binder matrix experience intensified structural fatigue after long&#8208;term cycling. Serious structural fatigue occurs in both the surface and bulk of LLNMO particles during extended cycling.







Abstract
Understanding how reaction heterogeneity impacts cathode materials during Li&#8208;ion battery (LIB) electrochemical cycling is pivotal for unraveling their electrochemical performance. Yet, experimentally verifying these reactions has proven to be a challenge. To address this, we employed scanning &#956;&#8208;XRD computed tomography to scrutinize Ni&#8208;rich layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) and Li&#8208;rich layered Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 (LLNMO). By harnessing machine learning (ML) techniques, we scrutinized an extensive dataset of &#956;&#8208;XRD patterns, about 100,000&#8197;patterns per slice, to unveil the spatial distribution of crystalline structure and microstrain. Our experimental findings unequivocally reveal the distinct behavior of these materials. NCM622 exhibits structural degradation and lattice strain intricately linked to the size of secondary particles. Smaller particles and the surface of larger particles in contact with the carbon/binder matrix experience intensified structural fatigue after long&#8208;term cycling. Conversely, both the surface and bulk of LLNMO particles endure severe strain&#8208;induced structural degradation during high&#8208;voltage cycling, resulting in significant voltage decay and capacity fade. This work holds the potential to fine&#8208;tune the microstructure of advanced layered materials and manipulate composite electrode construction in order to enhance the performance of LIBs and beyond.

         <title>Mechanical Strain Induces and Increases Vesicular Release Monitored by Microfabricated Stretchable Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has reported the fabrication of stretchable microelectrodes and achieved real&#8208;time quantifying of strain&#8208;induced catecholamine release from single vesicles. The results proved that mechanical strain could trigger the exocytotic events by activating Piezo1 channel and increase catecholamine release by accelerating the opening and prolonging the closure of fusion pores.

Exocytosis involving the fusion of intracellular vesicles with cell membrane, is thought to be modulated by the mechanical cues in the microenvironment. Single&#8208;cell electrochemistry can offer unique information about the quantification and kinetics of exocytotic events; however, the effects of mechanical force on vesicular release have been poorly explored. Herein, we developed a stretchable microelectrode with excellent electrochemical stability under mechanical deformation by microfabrication of functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) conductive ink, which achieved real&#8208;time quantitation of strain&#8208;induced vesicular exocytosis from a single cell for the first time. We found that mechanical strain could cause calcium influx via the activation of Piezo1 channels in chromaffin cell, initiating the vesicular exocytosis process. Interestingly, mechanical strain increases the amount of catecholamines released by accelerating the opening and prolonging the closing of fusion pore during exocytosis. This work is expected to provide revealing insights into the regulatory effects of mechanical stimuli on vesicular exocytosis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct ortho&#8208;Arylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly applicable rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct ortho&#8208;arylation of anilines with (hetero)aryl halides based on readily available aminophosphines as traceless directing groups is reported. The ortho&#8208;arylated anilines could be obtained in high yields, without any competing diarylation and with full regioselectivity. The catalytic cycle was elucidated by DFT and supporting experiments.







Abstract
An efficient and broadly applicable rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct ortho&#8208;arylation of anilines with aryl iodides relying on readily available aminophosphines as traceless directing groups is reported. Its scope and functional group compatibility were both found to be quite broad as a large variety of both aminophosphines and (hetero)aryl iodides, including complex ones, could be utilized. The ortho&#8208;arylated anilines could be obtained in high average yields, without any competing diarylation and with full regioselectivity, which constitutes a major step forward compared to other processes. The reaction is moreover not limited to aryl iodides, as an aryl bromide and a triflate could be successfully used, and could be extended to diarylation. Mechanistic studies revealed the key and unique role of the aminophosphine, acting not only as a substrate but also as a ligand for the rhodium catalyst.

         <title>Studies on the Biomimetic Synthesis of Marine Ladder Polyethers via Endo&#8208;Selective Epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;Epoxonium Ring&#8208;Opening Cascades</title>

         <dc:description>
By reducing the nucleophilicity of the terminal hydroxy group of a polyepoxy alcohol precursor and adding a Lewis acid, we can effectively construct polyethers with hydrogen atoms at ring junctions, consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring, and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyethers through epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization. We suggest that marine ladder polyethers may also be biosynthesized via this mode of cyclization.







Abstract
Marine ladder polyethers have attracted the attention of chemists and biologists because of their potent biological activities. Synthetic chemists have attempted to construct their polyether frameworks by epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades, as Nakanishi hypothesis describes. However, Baldwin's rules of ring closure state that exo&#8208;selective intramolecular cyclization of epoxy alcohols is preferred over endo&#8208;selective cyclization. Herein, we investigated epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades of polyepoxy alcohols in [EMIM]BF4/PFTB (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate /perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol) and found that all&#8208;endo products were formed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations (not restricted by Baldwin's rules, which only apply to intramolecular hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclizations). We determined that the key factor enabling polyepoxy alcohols to undergo a high proportion of all&#8208;endo&#8208;selective cyclization was inhibition of exo&#8208;selective hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclization starting from the terminal hydroxyl group of a polyepoxy alcohol. By introducing a slow&#8208;release protecting group to the terminal hydroxyl group, we could markedly increase the cyclization yields of polyether fragments with hydrogen atoms at the ring junctions. For the first time, we constructed consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyether fragments by epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations through the addition of a suitable Lewis acid. We also suggest that the biosynthesis of marine ladder polyethers may proceed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization of polyepoxide.

         <title>Alkyl Chains Tune Molecular Orientations to Enable Dual Passivation in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminothiol hydrochlorides with different alkyl chains were employed to investigate the interplay between molecular structure, orientation, and interaction on perovskite surface. The 2&#8208;Aminoethane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol hydrochloride with shorter alkyl chains exhibited a preference of parallel orientation, enhancing its interaction with surface defects. Consequently, this led to the successful fabrication of a stable inverted device with an impressive PCE of 25&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nonradiative recombination losses occurring at the interface pose a significant obstacle to achieve high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly in inverted PSCs. Passivating surface defects using molecules with different functional groups represents one of the key strategies for enhancing PSCs efficiency. However, a lack of insight into the passivation orientation of molecules on the surface is a challenge for rational molecular design. In this study, aminothiol hydrochlorides with different alkyl chains but identical electron&#8208;donating (&#8722;SH) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#8722;NH3+) groups were employed to investigate the interplay between molecular structure, orientation, and interaction on perovskite surface. The 2&#8208;Aminoethane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol hydrochloride with shorter alkyl chains exhibited a preference of parallel orientations, which facilitating stronger interactions with the surface defects through strong coordination and hydrogen bonding. The resultant perovskite films following defect passivation demonstrate reduced ion migration, inhibition of nonradiative recombination, and more n&#8208;type characteristics for efficient electron transfer. Consequently, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25&#8201;% was achieved, maintaining 95&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 500&#8197;hours of continuous maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Mechanochemical Cyclotrimerization: A Versatile Tool to Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Stacking Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents, for the first time, the mechanochemical cyclotrimerization of nitriles. Utilizing Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and a ball mill, both small molecules and large organic frameworks could be obtained. Screening the reaction of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene by various parameters, such as reaction time, frequency, or temperature, significant impacts on the porosity of the polymer and its crystallinity were revealed.







Abstract
We introduce the first mechanochemical cyclotrimerization of nitriles, a facile strategy for synthesizing triazine&#8208;containing molecules and materials, overcoming challenges related to carbonization and solubility. Conducting this solid&#8208;state approach in a mixer ball mill with 4&#8208;Methylbenzonitrile, we synthesize Tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine quantitatively in as little as 90&#8197;minutes. Just as fast, this mechanochemical method facilitates the synthesis of the covalent triazine framework CTF&#8208;1 using 1,4&#8197;Dicyanobenzene. Material characterization confirms its porous (650&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and crystalline nature. Adjusting the induced mechanical energy allows control over the obtained stacking conformation of the resulting CTFs &#8208; from a staggered AB arrangement to an eclipsed AA stacking conformation. Finally, a substrate scope demonstrates the versatility of this approach, successfully yielding various CTFs.

Material characterization confirms its porous (650&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and crystalline nature. Adjusting the induced mechanical energy allows control over the obtained stacking conformation of the resulting CTFs - from a staggered AB arrangement to an eclipsed AA stacking conformation. Finally, a substrate scope demonstrates the versatility of this approach, successfully yielding various CTFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indium Tin Oxide Induced Internal Positive Feedback and Indium Ion Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

The interaction between perovskite decomposition products and indium tin oxide substrate triggers positive feedback cycle and deteriorates the stability of perovskite solar cell.







Abstract
Stability is the most pressing challenge hindering the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and previous efforts focused more on enhancing the resistance of PSCs to external stimulus. Here, we found that the indium tin oxide (ITO) will deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of PSCs through positive feedback cycles. Specifically, the perovskite degradation products will cross the electron transport layer to chemically etch the electrode ITO to generate In3+, which will migrate upwards into the perovskite film. Then, the reaction that corrodes ITO consumes the decomposition products of perovskite and shifts the balance of the perovskite decomposition reaction, further promoting the degradation and thus falling into a positive feedback cycle. Moreover, the In3+ in the perovskite film was found to accumulate at the upper surface, which would lead to n&#8208;type doping of perovskite film to form the energy barrier for interface carrier extraction. Subsequently, the chelating molecule ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA&#8208;2Na) was introduced onto ITO to firmly chelate the In3+ and prevent it from migrating upward, thus breaking this internal positive feedback cycle and significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs. This work provides new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of photovoltaic performance loss and ionic transport in PSCs.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Ortho/Ipso C&#8722;H Difunctionalizations of Arenes using Thianthrene as a Leaving Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the development of a &#8220;C&#8722;H thianthrenation/Catellani&#8221; strategy, the regioselective C&#8722;H difunctionalization of various non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes was successfully achieved. Starting from thianthrenium salts and using a commercially available norbornene, this approach will further open the chemical space of late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective ortho/ipso C&#8722;H difunctionalizations of aromatic compounds were designed to afford polyfunctionalized arenes including challenging 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted ones (62&#8197;examples, up to 97&#8201;% yields). To ensure the excellent regioselectivity of the process while keeping high efficiency, an original strategy based on a &#8220;C&#8722;H thianthenation/Catellani&#8208;type reaction&#8221; sequence was developed starting from simple arenes. Non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes were first regioselectively converted into the corresponding thianthrenium salts. Then, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, norbornene (NBE)&#8208;mediated process allowed the synthesis of ipso&#8208;olefinated/ortho&#8208;alkylated polyfunctionalized arenes using a thianthrene as a leaving group (revisited Catellani reaction). Pleasingly, using a commercially available norbornene (NBE) and a unique catalytic system, synthetic challenges known for the Catellani reaction with aryl iodides were smoothly and successfully tackled with the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; approach. The protocol was robust (gram&#8208;scale reaction) and was widely applied to the two&#8208;fold functionalization of various arenes including bio&#8208;active compounds. Moreover, a panel of olefins and alkyl halides as coupling partners was suitable. Pleasingly, the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; strategy was successfully further applied to the incorporation of other groups at the ipso (CN/alkyl/H, aryl) and ortho (alkyl, aryl, amine, thiol) positions, showcasing the generality of the process.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Photodetector with High Operational Stability Using Self&#8208;Trapped Cs3Cu2I5 Interfacial Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals transport layer has been embedded in photodiode structures to simultaneously realize bias&#8208;switchable organic photodetectors exhibiting photovoltaic (0&#8197;V) and photomultiplication operating modes (1&#8197;V) with fast response speed, remarkable stability and broad to different organic systems, indicating a versatile strategy for future integrated organic optoelectronic scenarios.







Abstract
Conventional photovoltaic (PV)&#8208;photodetectors are hard to detect fainted signals, while photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;capable devices indispensable for detecting weak light and are prone to degrade under strong light illumination and large bias, and it is urgent to realize highly efficient integrated detecting system with both PM and PV operation modes. In this work, one lead&#8208;free Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals with self&#8208;trapping exciton nature was introduced as interfacial layer adjacent to bulk and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer heterojunction structure, and corresponding organic photodetectors with bias&#8208;switchable dual modes are demonstrated. The fabricated device exhibits low operating bias (0&#8197;V for PV mode and 0.8&#8197;V for PM mode), high specific detectivity (~1013&#8197;Jones), fast response speed as low as 1.59&#8197;&#956;s, large bandwidth over 0.2&#8197;MHz and long&#8208;term operational stability last for 4&#8197;months in ambient condition. This synergy strategy also validated in different materials and device architectures, providing a convenient and scalable production process to develop highly efficient bias&#8208;switchable multi&#8208;functional organic optoelectrical applications.

         <title>Cyclic Azahelicene Dimers Showing Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Selective Fluoride Recognition</title>

         <dc:description>
Aza[7]helicenes or closed&#8208;aza[7]helicenes with (1R)&#8208;menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized, and the diastereomeric pairs were successively separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers which showed bright circularly polarized luminescence and selective recognition of a fluoride anion.







Abstract
Although helicenes are promising molecules, the synthetic difficulty and tediousness have often been problems, and only small amounts of optically pure helicenes have been obtained by using chiral HPLC in most cases. Herein, aza[7]helicenes or closed&#8208;aza[7]helicenes with (1R)&#8208;menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized via the intramolecular Scholl reaction, and the diastereomeric pairs were separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers, and the chiroptical properties were investigated. The rigid &#960;&#8208;frameworks of the dimers led to the high molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields, while the twisted helicene moieties induced clear Cotton effects and CPL in the visible region, and the high CPL brightness (BCPL) was achieved. Furthermore, the cyclic dimers were found to have the macrocyclic cavity with the two NH groups suitable for the selective binding of a fluoride anion, which induced significantly redshifted fluorescence and CPL in the red region.

The synthesis of quinoline&#8208;based benzophosphole oxides from ortho&#8208;alkynylated aromatic phosphine oxides and aryl isonitriles is presented. These &#960;&#8208;extended benzophosphole oxides exhibit interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
Herein, we present a radical cascade addition cyclization sequence to access quinoline&#8208;based benzophosphole oxides from ortho&#8208;alkynylated aromatic phosphine oxides using various aryl isonitriles as radical acceptors and inexpensive tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a terminal oxidant in the presence of a catalytic amount of silver acetate. Alternatively, the same cascade can be realized through a sustainable photochemical approach utilizing 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as an organic photocatalyst at room temperature. The introduced modular approach shows broad functional group tolerance and offers straightforward access to complex P,N&#8208;containing polyheterocyclic arenes. These novel &#960;&#8208;extended benzophosphole oxides exhibit interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties such as absorption in the visible region, emission and reversible reduction at low potentials, which makes them promising for potential materials science applications. The photophysical properties can further be tuned by the addition of external Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids.

Three new donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type interfacial dipole molecules are designed by incorporating hole transporting and different anchoring groups, which contributing to energy&#8208;level alignment, improved charge extraction and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination at the perovskite interface. TPA&#8208;BAM&#8208;treated PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 25.29&#8201;% with the enhanced voltage of 1.174&#8197;V and fill factor of 84.34&#8201;%, while also demonstrating improved stability.







Abstract
Interfacial engineering of perovskite films has been the main strategies in improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, three new donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;type interfacial dipole (DAID) molecules with hole&#8208;transporting and different anchoring units are designed and employed in PSCs. The formation of interface dipoles by the DAID molecules on the perovskite film can efficiently modulate the energy level alignment, improve charge extraction, and reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination. Among the three DAID molecules, TPA&#8208;BAM with amide group exhibits the best chemical and optoelectrical properties, achieving a champion PCE of 25.29&#8201;% with the enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.174&#8197;V and fill factor of 84.34&#8201;%, due to the reduced defect density and improved interfacial hole extraction. Meanwhile, the operational stability of the unencapsulated device has been significantly improved. Our study provides a prospect for rationalized screening of interfacial dipole materials for efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Using Metastable Zirconium Suboxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The suboxide zirconium (Zr3O) formed at the Zr&#8722;ZrO2 interface serves as an exceptional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), demonstrating remarkable durability lasting up to 50&#8197;days in Zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) devices, highlighting the potential of metastable phases in advancing the development of advanced electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Strategies for discovery of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts are important to advance clean energy technologies. Metastable phases such as low temperature or interfacial structures that are difficult to access in bulk may offer such catalytically active surfaces. We report here that the suboxide Zr3O, which is formed at Zr&#8722;ZrO2 interfaces but does not appear in the experimental Zr&#8722;O phase diagram exhibits outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance surpassing that of benchmark Pt/C and most transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Addition of Fe3C nanoparticles to give a Zr&#8722;Zr3O&#8722;Fe3C/NC catalyst (NC=nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon) gives a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.914&#8197;V, outperforming Pt/C and showing only a 3&#8197;mV decrease after 20,000 electrochemical cycles. A zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) using this cathode material has a high power density of 241.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remains stable for over 50&#8197;days of continuous cycling, demonstrating potential for practical applications. Zr3O demonstrates that interfacial or other phases that are difficult to stabilize may offer new directions for the discovery of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Grafted Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8722;Nx Complex with a Precisely Regulating Coordination Sphere for Efficient Electron Acceptor&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt SAs through the strategy of external ligand grafting on MOFs, the electron density and steric factor of Pt(II) centers thereby were achieved accurate modulation. In addition, the incorporation of Pt(bpy)Cl2 as an electron acceptor induced the efficient interface migration of photoinduced electrons, relizing a 225&#8208;times improvement of photocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Based on the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the Pt(bpy)Cl2 molecule, a simple post&#8208;modification amide reaction was firstly used to graft it onto the surface of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, which performed as a highly efficient electron acceptor that induced the conversion of the photoinduced charge migration pathway from internal BDC&#8594;TiOx migration to external BDC&#8594;PtNx migration, significantly improving the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer and separation. Furthermore, precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt single atoms was achieved using further post&#8208;modification with additional bipyridine to investigate the effect of Pt&#8722;Nx coordination numbers on reaction activity. The as&#8208;synthesized NML&#8208;PtN2 exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 7.608&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a remarkable improvement of 225 and 2.26&#8197;times compared to pristine NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and NML&#8208;PtN4, respectively. In addition, the superior apparent quantum yield of 4.01&#8201;% (390&#8197;nm) and turnover frequency of 190.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 (0.78&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt SA; 129&#8197;times compared to Pt nanoparticles/NML) revealed the high solar utilization efficiency and hydrogen evolution activity of the material. And macroscopic color changes caused by the transition of carrier migration paths was first observed. It holds profound significance for the design of MOF&#8208;Molecule catalysts with efficient charge carrier separation and precise regulation of single&#8208;atom coordination sphere.

The strong bonding DTE&#8901;PbI2 and DA&#8901;PbI2 retard perovskite crystallization process for high&#8208;quality and low defects perovskite film. Finally, a champion PCE of 25.28&#8201;% was achieved with excellent environmental stability, which retained 95.75&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1152&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C under 25&#8201;% RH.







Abstract
It is a crucial role for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite films, which can be achieved by delaying the crystallization of perovskite film. Hence, we designed difluoroacetic anhydride (DFA) as an additive to regulating crystallization process thus reducing defect formation during perovskite film formation. It was found DFA reacts with DMSO by forming two molecules, difluoroacetate thioether ester (DTE) and difluoroacetic acid (DA). The strong bonding DTE&#8901;PbI2 and DA&#8901;PbI2 retard perovskite crystallization process for high&#8208;quality film formation, which was monitored through in situ UV/Vis and PL tests. By using DFA additives, we prepared perovskite films with high&#8208;quality and low defects. Finally, a champion PCE of 25.28&#8201;% was achieved with excellent environmental stability, which retained 95.75&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1152&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C under 25&#8201;% RH.

         <title>Local Self&#8208;Assembly of Dissipative Structures Sustained by Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients.







Abstract
The coupling between energy&#8208;consuming molecular processes and the macroscopic dimension plays an important role in nature and in the development of active matter. Here, we study the temporal evolution of a macroscopic system upon the local activation of a dissipative self&#8208;assembly process. Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic (pseudo&#8208;)non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients. For elevated substrate concentrations, this state can be maintained for more than 4&#8197;days. The studies reveal an interdependence between the dissipative assemblies and the concentration gradients: catalytic activity by the assemblies results in sustained concentration gradients and, vice versa, continuous diffusion of substrate to the assemblies stabilizes their size. The possibility to activate dissipative processes with spatial control and create long lasting non&#8208;equilibrium steady states enables dissipative structures to be studied in the space&#8208;time domain, which is of relevance for understanding biological systems and for the development of active matter.

         <title>Bridging Nickel&#8208;MOF and Copper Single Atoms/Clusters with H&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for the Tandem Catalysis of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Few&#8208;layered H&#8208;substituted graphdiyne bridges ultrathin Ni&#8208;MOF nanosheets and Cu single atoms/clusters to construct a tandem electrocatalyst for enhanced nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia transformation. The synergistic effect between Ni2+ and Cu is revealed to optimize the reaction path, resulting in a high efficiency over a wide potential window.







Abstract
Interfacial engineering of synergistic catalysts is one of the keys to achieving multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes in nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. Herein, by joining ultrathin nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (denoted Ni&#8208;MOF) nanosheets with few&#8208;layered hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne&#8208;supported copper single atoms and clusters (denoted HsGDY@Cu), a tandem catalyst of Ni&#8208;MOFs@HsGDY@Cu with dual&#8208;active interfaces was developed for the concerted catalysis of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia. In such a system, the sandwiched HsGDY layer could serve as a bridge to connect the coordinated unsaturated Ni2+ sites with Cu single atoms/clusters in a limited range of 0 to 3.6&#8197;nm. From Ni2+ to Cu, via the hydrogen spillover process, the hydrogen radicals (H&#8901;) generated at the unsaturated Ni2+ sites could migrate across HsGDY to the Cu sites to participate in the transformation of *HNO3 to NH3. From Cu to Ni2+, bypassing the higher reaction energy for *HNO3 formation on the Ni2+ sites, the NO2&#8722; detached from the Cu sites could diffuse onto the unsaturated Ni2+ sites to form NH3 as well. The combined results make this hybrid a tandem catalyst with dual active sites for the catalysis of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion with improved Faradaic efficiency at lower overpotentials.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembled Active and Stable Ir@MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; Interfaces for CO2 Electrolysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The internal B&#8208;site supplement of Mn ions via topotactic exchange and external protective barrier of MnOx shell via redispersion in reduction atmosphere facilitate the formation of Ir@MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; interfaces and enhance their structural stability, achieving improved activity and durability for CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells.







Abstract
Solid oxide electrolysis cells are prospective approaches for CO2 utilization but face significant challenges due to the sluggish reaction kinetics and poor stability of the fuel electrodes. Herein, we strategically addressed the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off phenomenon between enhanced exsolution and improved structural stability via topotactic ion exchange. The surface dynamic reconstruction of the MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; (LSCIr) catalyst was visualized at the atomic scale. Compared with the Ir@LSCIr interface, the in situ self&#8208;assembled Ir@MnOx/LSCIr interface exhibited greater CO2 activation and easily removable carbonate intermediates, thus reached a 42&#8201;% improvement in CO2 electrolysis performance at 1.6&#8197;V. Furthermore, an improved CO2 electrolysis stability was achieved due to the uniformly wrapped MnOx shell of the Ir@MnOx/LSCIr cathode. Our approach enables a detailed understanding of the dynamic microstructure evolution at active interfaces and provides a roadmap for the rational design and evaluation of efficient metal/oxide catalysts for CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Tuning Ion Mobility in Lithium Argyrodite Solid Electrolytes via Entropy Engineering</title>

Configurational entropy in the cation sublattice, induced by complex substitution, shows a direct correlation with Li+ mobility in superionic lithium argyrodite solid electrolytes.







Abstract
The development of improved solid electrolytes (SEs) plays a crucial role in the advancement of bulk&#8208;type solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) technologies. In recent years, multicomponent or high&#8208;entropy SEs are gaining increased attention for their advantageous charge&#8208;transport and (electro)chemical properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of how configurational entropy affects ionic conductivity is largely lacking.

&lt;p&gt;Configurational entropy in the cation sublattice, induced by complex substitution, shows a direct correlation with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mobility in superionic lithium argyrodite solid electrolytes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of improved solid electrolytes (SEs) plays a crucial role in the advancement of bulk-type solid-state battery (SSB) technologies. In recent years, multicomponent or high-entropy SEs are gaining increased attention for their advantageous charge-transport and (electro)chemical properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of how configurational entropy affects ionic conductivity is largely lacking. Herein we investigate a series of multication-substituted lithium argyrodites with the general formula Li&lt;sub&gt;6+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;[M1&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;M2&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;M3&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;M4&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;]S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;I, with M being P, Si, Ge, and Sb.

         <title>Surface Coordination Modulated Morphological Anisotropic Engineering of Iron&#8208;Benzoquinone Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

Modulation of the surface coordination of carbon for morphological engineering of Fe&#8208;THBQ is realized, the morphology of which evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the content of O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon substrate. It exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performance for lithium storage.







Abstract
Morphological anisotropic engineering is powerful to synthesize metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with versatile physicochemical properties for diverse applications ranging from gas storage/separation to electrocatalysis and batteries, etc. Herein, we developed a carbon substrate guided strategy to manipulate the facet&#8208;dependent coordination for morphology engineering of Fe&#8208;THBQ (tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) frameworks, which is built with cubic Fe octamer bridged by two parallel THBQ ligands along three orthogonal axes, extending to a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework with pcu&#8208;e network topology. The electronegative O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon surfaces compete with THBQ linkers to selectively interact with the unsaturated coordinated Fe cations on the {111} facets and inhibit crystal growth along the &lt;111&gt; direction. The morphology of Fe&#8208;THBQ evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the content of O&#8208;containing functional groups on the carbon substrate. The Fe&#8208;THBQ with varied morphologies exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performances for electrochemical lithium storage. This work will shed light on the morphology modulation of MOFs for promising applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Formation of Charge Transfer Trions at Molecular&#8208;Functionalized 2D MoS2 Interfaces</title>

         <dc:description>
Trion dynamics at an organometallic molecule/monolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML&#8722;MoS2) is investigated via transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. We observed an ultrafast hole transfer, followed by the formation of charge&#8208;transfer trions.







Abstract
In this work, we investigate trion dynamics occurring at the heterojunction between organometallic molecules and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) with transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. By pumping at 2.4&#8197;eV with laser pulses, we have observed an ultrafast hole transfer, succeeded by the emergence of charge&#8208;transfer trions. This observation is facilitated by the cancellation of ground state bleach and stimulated emission signals due to their opposite phases, making tr&#8208;ESFG especially sensitive to the trion formation dynamics. The presence of charge&#8208;transfer trion at molecular functionalized TMD monolayers suggests the potential for engineering the local electronic structures and dynamics of specific locations on TMDs and offers a potential for transferring unique electronic attributes of TMD to the molecular layers.

         <title>Direct &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acid Loading onto a Bacterial Thiotemplate Assembly Line via a Multienzyme Gateway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular warhead for the virulence factor malleicyprol derives from trigonic acid, a cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid. Its incorporation involves an incomplete nonribosomal peptide synthetase module and two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, an adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme and an FkbH&#8208;like enzyme for translocation. The mechanism for the direct loading of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids may inspire synthetic biology and antivirulence approaches.







Abstract
Various nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) create structural and functional diversity by incorporating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids into peptide backbones. Trigonic acid, an unusual cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid, is the source of the molecular warhead of malleicyprol, a critical virulence factor of human and animal pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group. The process of selecting and loading this building block remained enigmatic as the NRPS module designated for this task is incomplete. Using a combination of bioinformatics, mutational analyses, targeted metabolomics, and in vitro biochemical assays, we show that two trans&#8208;acting enzymes are required to load this central building block onto the modular assembly line. An adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme (BurJ) activates trigonic acid, followed by the translocation of the enzyme&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid thioester by an FkbH&#8208;like protein with a mutated phosphatase domain (BurH). This specialized gateway is the first reported direct loading of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid onto a bona fide NRPS module in bacteria and expands the synthetic biology toolbox for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of non&#8208;canonical building blocks. Moreover, insight into the biochemical basis of virulence factor biosynthesis can provide a foundation for developing enzyme inhibitors as anti&#8208;virulence therapeutics against BP pathogen infections.

         <title>Electric Double Layer Regulator Design through a Functional Group Assembly Strategy towards Long&#8208;Lasting Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric double layer regulator, N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonamide (IS), is rationally designed by a functional group assembly strategy. The high adsorption ability of the imidazole group in IS with zinc anode facilitates the formation of an IS molecular layer to suppress side reactions. Meanwhile, the high binding capability of sulfone group in IS with Zn2+ promotes the de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ to achieve uniform zinc deposition.







Abstract
Regulating the electric double layer (EDL) structure of the zinc metal anode by using electrolyte additives is an efficient way to suppress interface side reactions and facilitate uniform zinc deposition. Nevertheless, there are no reports investigating the proactive design of EDL&#8208;regulating additives before the start of experiments. Herein, a functional group assembly strategy is proposed to design electrolyte additives for modulating the EDL, thereby realizing a long&#8208;lasting zinc metal anode. Specifically, by screening ten common functional groups, N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonamide (IS) is designed by assembling an imidazole group, characterized by its high adsorption capability on the zinc anode, and a sulfone group, which exhibits strong binding with Zn2+ ions. Benefiting from the adsorption functionalization of the imidazole group, the IS molecules occupy the position of H2O in the inner Helmholtz layer of the EDL, forming a molecular protective layer to inhibit H2O&#8208;induced side reactions. Meanwhile, the sulfone group in IS, acting as a binding site to Zn2+, promotes the de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ ions, facilitating compact zinc deposition. Consequently, the utilization of IS significantly extending the cycling stability of Zn||Zn and Zn||NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O full cell. This study offers an innovative approach to the design of EDL regulators for high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;Migration at Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters Constructed from &#945;&#8208;Keto Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective allylation of &#945;&#8208;keto imines generated enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imines possessing synthetically challenging vicinal tetrasubstituted stereocenters. The electrophilicity of the imine and steric effects promoted a face&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;allyl migration in the presence of Lewis acidic boronic acids, yielding chiral &#945;&#8208;amino ketones with excellent diastereoselectivity. This method was applied to the total synthesis of hapalindole alkaloids.







Abstract
A carbonyl&#8208;assisted asymmetric 1,2&#8208;migratory allylation through in situ generation of vicinal tetrasubstituted stereocenters is reported to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;amino ketones and amino alcohols with excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. In a remarkable divergence, despite higher steric hindrance, the allylation exclusively occurs on ketones over imines in the first step, followed by a face&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;allyl transfer, thus highlighting an exciting interplay between two distinct electrophiles. The methodology distinguishes itself through its adaptability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, showcasing broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and stereodivergence. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis led to a deeper understanding of its selectivity and mechanistic framework. Highlighting its transformative potential, the method was applied to the total synthesis of hapalindole alkaloids.

         <title>Strong and Tough MXene Bridging&#8208;induced Conductive Nacre</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the need to reduce global carbon emissions, it remains a great challenge to prepare nacre&#8208;inspired composites using more economical and environmentally friendly building blocks. We fabricated tough and conductive nacre composites through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridging by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The resultant conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance.







Abstract
Nacre is a classic model, providing an inspiration for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites with the two&#8208;dimensional platelets. However, the &#8220;brick&#8221; of nacre, aragonite platelet, is an ideal building block for making high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites. Herein, we demonstrated a strong and tough conductive nacre through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridged by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The flexural strength and fracture toughness of the obtained conductive nacre reach ~282&#8197;MPa and ~6.3&#8197;MPa&#8201;m1/2, which is 1.6 and 1.6&#8197;times higher than that of natural nacre, respectively. These properties are attributed to densification and high orientation degree of the conductive nacre, which is effectively induced by the combined interactions of hydrogen bonding and MXene nanosheets bridging. The crack propagations in conductive nacre are effectively inhibited through crack deflection with hydrogen bonding, and MXene nanosheets bridging between aragonite platelets. In addition, our conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance. Our strategy of reassembling the aragonite platelets exfoliated from waste nacre into high&#8208;performance artificial nacre, provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites through the sustainable reutilization of shell resources.

         <title>ON&#8211;OFF Control of Marangoni Self&#8208;propulsion via A Supra&#8208;amphiphile Fuel and Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; to realize ON&#8211;OFF control of Marangoni self&#8208;propulsion of miniaturized devices. The supra&#8208;amphiphile shows two competitive processes on water surface: adsorption and hydrolysis, whose competence is pH&#8208;responsive. They have comparable rates under neutral conditions to prolong the motion by 50&#8208;fold; when changing to acid, motion stop is realized owing to faster hydrolysis than adsorption.







Abstract
Marangoni self&#8208;propulsion refers to motion of liquid or solid driven by a surface tension gradient, and has applications in soft robots/devices, cargo delivery, self&#8208;assembly etc. However, two problems remain to be addressed for motion control (e.g., ON&#8211;OFF) with conventional surfactants as Marangoni fuel: (1)&#8197;limited motion lifetime due to saturated interfacial adsorption of surfactants; (2)&#8197;in&#8208; situ motion stop is difficult once Marangoni flows are triggered. Instead of covalent surfactants, supra&#8208;amphiphiles with hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts linked noncovalently, hold promise to solve these problems owing to its dynamic and reversible surface activity responsively. Here, we propose a new concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; based on the facile synthesis of disodium&#8208;4&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedisulfonate (DABS) linked by a Schiff base, which has amphiphilicity for self&#8208;propulsion, hydrolyzes timely to avoid saturated adsorption, and provides pH&#8208;responsive control over ON&#8208;OFF motion. The self&#8208;propulsion lifetime is extended by 50&#8208;fold with DABS and motion control is achieved. The mechanism is revealed with coupled interface chemistry involving two competitive processes of interfacial adsorption and hydrolysis of DABS based on both experiments and simulation. The concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; provides an active solution to prolong and control Marangoni self&#8208;propulsive devices for the advance of intelligent material systems.

         <title>Stepwise Protonation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;linked 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs were constructed and modified through a stepwise protonation of imine and porphyrin sites. Both benzo&#8208;selenadiazole functional groups and dual protonation increase the visible light absorption and charge separation, synergistically promoting the photocatalytic H2O2 production.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs), recognized for their tailorable structures and accessible active sites, offer a promising platform for developing advanced photocatalysts. However, the difficulty in the synthesis and functionalization of 3D COFs hinders their further development. In this study, we present a series of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs with 8 connected porphyrin units linked by linear linkers through imine bonds as a versatile platform for photocatalyst design. The photoresponse of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs was initially modulated by functionalizing linear linkers with benzo&#8208;thiadiazole or benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups. Furthermore, taking advantage of the well&#8208;exposed porphyrin and imine sites in 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs, their photocatalytic activity was optimized by stepwise protonation of imine bonds and porphyrin centers. The dual protonated COF with benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups exhibited enhanced charge separation, leading to an increased photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light. This enhancement demonstrates the combined benefits of linker functionalization and stepwise protonation on photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Eosinophil&#8208;Activating Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

The eosinophil&#8208;activating semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNe) synergized with immune checkpoint inhibitors are developed to reinvigorate eosinophil&#8208; and T&#8197;cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, providing a new avenue for cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Eosinophils are important immune effector cells that affect T&#8197;cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. However, the low frequency and restrained activity of eosinophils restricted the outcome of cancer immunotherapies. We herein report an eosinophil&#8208;activating semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNe) to improve photodynamic tumor immunogenicity, modulate eosinophil chemotaxis, and reinvigorate T&#8208;cell immunity for activated cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNe comprises an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor sitagliptin via a 1O2&#8208;cleavable thioketal linker. Upon localized NIR photoirradiation, SPNe generates 1O2 to elicit immunogenic cell death of tumors and induce specific activation of sitagliptin. The subsequent inhibition of DPP4 increases intratumoral CCL11 levels to promote eosinophil chemotaxis and activation. SPNe&#8208;mediated photo&#8208;immunotherapy synergized with immune checkpoint blockade greatly promotes tumor infiltration and activation of both eosinophils and T&#8197;cells, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, this study presents a generic polymeric nanoplatform to modulate specific immune cells for precision cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Leveraging Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect for Catalytic Polymerization and Degradation of a Cyclobutane Monomer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations guide to unveil the electron push&#8208;pull effect in reshaping the polymerizability of non&#8208;polymerizable cyclobutane to afford densely functionalized all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as their degradation to afford alkene derivatives. Successful polymerization conditions consist of Lewis acid, Br&#248;nsted base, and a C(sp3)&#8208;H initiator, while degradation proceeds with catalytic amount of an acid.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) offers a striking solution to solve problems encountered in step&#8208;growth condensation polymerization, including precise control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and topology. This has inspired our interest in ROP of cycloalkanes with an ultimate goal to rethink polyolefins, which clearly poses a number of challenges. Practicality of ROP of cycloalkanes is actually limited by their low polymerizability and elusive mechanisms which arise from significantly varied ring size and non&#8208;polar C&#8722;C bonds in monomers. In this work, by using Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base/C(sp3)&#8208;H initiator system previously developed in our laboratory, we focus on cyclobutanes and explore the positional and electronic effects of substituents on the ring, namely electron push&#8208;pull effect, in promoting controlled polymerization to afford densely functionalized poly(cyclobutanes), as well as catalytic degradation of obtained polymers for upcycling. More importantly, experiments and DFT calculations unveil considerable population of Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;induced thermostabilized 1,4&#8208;zwitterions, which distinguish cyclobutanes from cyclopropanes and others. All these findings would shed light on catalytic synthesis and degradation of saturated all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as small molecule transformations of cyclobutanes.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Donor&#8208;Modification of Boracyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems beyond Steric Protection to Produce Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of a boracyclic &#960;&#8208;skeleton with only sp2 carbons and electron&#8208;donating phenothiazinyl groups resulted in a short ortho B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N distance. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor structures, these compounds exhibited thermally activated delayed orange&#8208;red fluorescence when doped into thin films. In organic light emitting diodes, a bis&#8208;ortho&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted derivative exhibited better performance than the corresponding mono&#8208;substituted congener.







Abstract
Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds that contain tricoordinate boron atoms at their periphery represent an attractive class of materials with electron&#8208;accepting character. Their molecular design generally requires the introduction of a bulky aryl group onto the boron atom, where it provides predominantly kinetic stabilization. The addition of extra functionality to the aryl group on the boron atom can be expected to further expand the potential utility of this class of materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of boracyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with firm ortho B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N nonbonding interactions by introducing N&#8208;containing electron&#8208;donors at the ortho&#8208;positions of the aryl group on the boron atom. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the combination of a planar boracyclic &#960;&#8208;skeleton with only sp2 carbons and a strong electron&#8208;donating phenothiazine moiety results in a particularly short B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N distance. Theoretical study provided insights into the inherent nature of the B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structures, these molecules exhibit substantially red&#8208;shifted fluorescence in solution, albeit that the fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) are low. In contrast, when incorporated into films, these compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with improved &#934;F values. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) fabricated using the ortho&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit orange&#8208;red electroluminescence.

Developing synthetic polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras provides new opportunities for material development. Herein, we demonstrate that the micellar nanostructures self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA chimeras can efficiently, straightforwardly, and bio&#8208;compatibly co&#8208;deliver siRNA and organic photosensitizers, resulting in significantly enhanced gene/photodynamic synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy.







Abstract
Photochemical internalization is an efficient strategy relying on photodynamic reactions to promote siRNA endosomal escape for the success of RNA&#8208;interference gene regulation, which makes gene&#8208;photodynamic combined therapy highly synergistic and efficient. However, it is still desired to explore capable carriers to improve the delivery efficiency of the immiscible siRNA and organic photosensitizers simultaneously. Herein, we employ a micellar nanostructure (PSNA) self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras to fulfill this task. PSNA can plentifully load photosensitizers in its hydrophobic core simply by the nanoprecipitation method. Moreover, it can organize siRNA self&#8208;assembly by the densely packed DNA shell, which leads to a higher loading capacity than the typical electrostatic condensation method. The experimental results prove that this PSNA carrier can greatly facilitate siRNA escape from the endosome/lysosome and enhance transfection. Accordingly, the PSNA&#8208;administrated therapy exhibits a significantly improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy owing to the highly efficient co&#8208;delivery capability.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Carbon Nanoneedle Electrodes for Dopamine Detection in Drosophila</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectrodes were generated by a new 3D printing process that utilize pulling force of a bridge between two blocks. We optimized the block size, bridge length, and bridge diameter to maximize shrinkage and make smaller electrodes. These nanoneedle electrodes have long, straight, and thin tips, which enable dopamine detection in Drosophila larvae ventral nerve cord (VNC).







Abstract
In vivo electrochemistry in small brain regions or synapses requires nanoelectrodes with long straight tips for submicron scale measurements. Nanoelectrodes can be fabricated using a Nanoscribe two&#8208;photon printer, but annealed tips curl if they are long and thin. We propose a new pulling&#8208;force strategy to fabricate a straight carbon nanoneedle structure. A micron&#8208;width bridge is printed between two blocks. The annealed structure shrinks during pyrolysis, and the blocks create a pulling force to form a long, thin, and straight carbon bridge. Parameterization study and COMSOL modeling indicate changes in the block size, bridge size and length affect the pulling force and bridge shrinkage. Electrodes were printed on niobium wires, insulated with aluminum oxide, and the bridge cut with focused ion beam (FIB) to expose the nanoneedle tip. Annealed needle diameters ranged from 400&#8197;nm to 5.25&#8197;&#956;m and length varied from 50.5&#8197;&#956;m to 146&#8197;&#956;m. The electrochemical properties are similar to glassy carbon, with good performance for dopamine detection with fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry. Nanoelectrodes enable biological applications, such as dopamine detection in a specific Drosophila brain region. Long and thin nanoneedles are generally useful for other applications such as cellular sensing, drug delivery, or gas sensing.

&lt;p&gt;Nanoelectrodes were generated by a new 3D printing process that utilize pulling force of a bridge between two blocks. We optimized the block size, bridge length, and bridge diameter to maximize shrinkage and make smaller electrodes. These nanoneedle electrodes have long, straight, and thin tips, which enable dopamine detection in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae ventral nerve cord (VNC).

         <title>Sono&#8208;Triggered Cascade Lactate Depletion by Semiconducting Polymer Nanoreactors for Cuproptosis&#8208;Immunotherapy of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nanoreactor is developed to achieve sono&#8208;triggered cascade lactate depletion for cuproptosis&#8208;immunotherapy. Upon ultrasound irradiation, this nanoreactor generates singlet oxygen to allow lactate oxidase release, leading to lactate depletion and hydrogen peroxide generation for promoting cuproptosis. This therapeutic strategy can observably restrict the growth of subcutaneous and deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer.







Abstract
The high level of lactate in tumor microenvironment not only promotes tumor development and metastasis, but also induces immune escape, which often leads to failures of various tumor therapy strategies. We here report a sono&#8208;triggered cascade lactate depletion strategy by using semiconducting polymer nanoreactors (SPNLCu) for cancer cuproptosis&#8208;immunotherapy. The SPNLCu mainly contain a semiconducting polymer as sonosensitizer, lactate oxidase (LOx) conjugated via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;cleavable linker and chelated Cu2+. Upon ultrasound (US) irradiation, the semiconducting polymer generates singlet oxygen (1O2) to cut ROS&#8208;cleavable linker to allow the release of LOx that catalyzes lactate depletion to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The Cu2+ will be reduced to Cu+ in tumor microenvironment, which reacts with the produced H2O2 to obtain hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) that further improves LOx release via destroying ROS&#8208;cleavable linkers. As such, sono&#8208;triggered cascade release of LOx achieves effective lactate depletion, thus relieving immunosuppressive roles of lactate. Moreover, the toxic Cu+ induces cuproptosis to cause immunogenic cell death (ICD) for activating antitumor immunological effect. SPNLCu are used to treat both subcutaneous and deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer with observably enhanced efficacy in restricting the tumor growths. This study thus provides a precise and effective lactate depletion tactic for cancer therapy.

         <title>Ligand Isomerization Driven Electrocatalytic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand geometry can direct the reactivity and selectivity of dioxygen cleavage in molecular electrocatalysis. It is shown that even on exclusively peroxide&#8208;producing catalytic sites, the dioxygen binding modes can be precisely controlled via a seemingly minor change in ligand isomerization, with their activity almost equaling that of Pt in an actual H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell.







Abstract
The prevailing view about molecular catalysts is that the central metal ion is responsible for the reaction mechanism and selectivity, whereas the ligands mainly affect the reaction kinetics. Here, we question this paradigm and show that ligands have a dramatic influence on the selectivity of the product. We show how even a seemingly small change in ligand isomerization sharply alters the selectivity of the well&#8208;researched oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) Co phthalocyanine catalyst from an indirect 2e&#8722; to a direct 4e&#8722; pathway. Detailed analysis reveals that intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions in the ligand activate the catalytic Co, directing the oxygen binding and thus deciding the final product. The resulting catalyst is the first example of a Co&#8208;based molecular catalyst catalyzing a direct 4e&#8722; ORR via ligand isomerization, for which it shows an activity close to the benchmark Pt in an actual H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell. The effect of the ligand isomerism is demonstrated with different central metal ions, thus highlighting the generalizability of the findings and their potential to open new possibilities in the design of molecular catalysts.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Effect&#8208;Enabled Photocatalytic 4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Cyclization Cascade to Access Fluoroalkylated Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing fluoroalkylcyclobutanes is realized by photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. DFT calculations suggest that a fluorine effect, resulting from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the &#945;&#8208;selective radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates the uncommon 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes are popular structural units in bioactive compounds and versatile intermediates in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis is challenging owing to high ring strain. In this study, a novel method for highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of fluoroalkylcyclobutanes bearing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters is realized by a photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. Density functional theory calculations reveal that a unique fluorine effect, arising from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the regio&#8208;reversed radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates an unprecedented 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure. This chemistry enables the direct and controllable construction of medicinally valuable quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing cyclobutanes from readily available raw materials, nicely complementing the existing methods.

         <title>Synthesis of n&#8208;Propanol from CO2 Electroreduction on Bicontinuous Cu2O/Cu Nanodomains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Propanol can be efficiently produced by ampere&#8208;level CO2 electroreduction by a Cu2O/Cu catalyst with bicontinuous structure. The catalyst is assembled by nanodomains (&lt;10&#8197;nm) of Cu2O and Cu and possesses numerous grain boundaries between the Cu and Cu2O phases.







Abstract
n&#8208;propanol is an important pharmaceutical and pesticide intermediate. To produce n&#8208;propanol by electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising way, but is largely restricted by the very low selectivity and activity. How to promote the coupling of *C1 and *C2 intermediates to form the *C3 intermediate for n&#8208;propanol formation is challenging. Here, we propose the construction of bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu electrocatalyst, which consists of ultra&#8208;small Cu2O nanodomains, Cu nanodomains and large amounts of grain boundaries between Cu2O and Cu nanodomains. The n&#8208;propanol current density is as high as 101.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in flow cell, with the Faradaic efficiency up to 12.1&#8201;%. Moreover, the catalyst keeps relatively stable during electrochemical CO2 reduction process. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu can facilitate the *CO formation, *CO&#8208;*CO coupling and *CO&#8208;*OCCO coupling for the final generation of n&#8208;propanol.

How to promote the coupling of *C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and *C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates to form the *C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate for n-propanol formation is challenging. Here, we propose the construction of bicontinuous structure of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu electrocatalyst, which consists of ultra-small Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanodomains, Cu nanodomains and large amounts of grain boundaries between Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Cu nanodomains. The n-propanol current density is as high as 101.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in flow cell, with the Faradaic efficiency up to 12.1&#8201;%. Moreover, the catalyst keeps relatively stable during electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction process. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the bicontinuous structure of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu can facilitate the *CO formation, *CO-*CO coupling and *CO-*OCCO coupling for the final generation of n-propanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Responsive Peptide&#8208;Based Ultrathin Nanosheets Prepared by a Horizontal Monolayer Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;based ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of ~1&#8197;nm were prepared via a hierarchical covalent physical approach and enabled by two&#8208;dimensional horizontal monolayer self&#8208;assembly. The ultrathin nanosheets can respond to various external stimuli and transform into diverse morphologies, with morphological changes in response to pH, allowing them to selectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
In this study, peptide&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 1&#8197;nm were prepared using a hierarchical covalent physical fabrication strategy. The covalent alternating polymerization of helical peptide E3 with an azobenzene (AZO) structure yielded copolymers CoP(E3&#8208;AZO), which physically self&#8208;assembled into ultrathin nanosheets in an unanticipated two&#8208;dimensional horizontal monolayer arrangement. This special monolayer arrangement enabled the thickness of the nanosheets to be equal to the cross&#8208;sectional diameter of a single linear copolymer, which is a rare phenomenon. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the synergistic effect of multiple molecular interactions drives the self&#8208;assembly of CoP(E3&#8208;AZO) into nanosheets and that various methods, including phototreatment, pH adjustment, the addition of additives, and introduction of cosolvents, can alter the molecular interactions and modulate the self&#8208;assembly of CoP(E3&#8208;AZO), yielding diverse nanostructures. Remarkably, the ultrathin nanosheets selectively inhibited cancer cells at certain concentrations.

         <title>Ordering Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Pd Catalysts onto Orderly Mesoporous SrTiO3&#8208;Crystal Nanotubular Networks for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work resolved the inherent contradiction between the superior pore structure and crystallinity of metal oxides by developing an updated synthesis method using the electrospinning technique, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer in photocatalytic heterogeneous reactions. With the assistance of ordered Cu&#8722;Pd alloy, the catalysts exhibit a remarkable enhancement in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis of fuels has garnered significant attention, with SrTiO3 emerging as a potential candidate for photocatalysis due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. However, selectively converting CO2 into fuels with desired reaction products remains a grand challenge. Herein, we design an updated method via an aging strategy based on the electrospinning technique to synthesize a single&#8208;crystalline Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 nanotubular networks with self&#8208;assembled orderly mesopores, further modified by Cu&#8722;Pd alloy. It exhibits both high crystallinity and superior cross&#8208;linked mesoporous structures, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer, with a remarkable enhancement from 0.025&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 1.090&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 in the CO production rate. Meanwhile, the ordered arrangement of Cu and Pd atoms on the (111) surface can promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*CO2 to *COOH), which is also responsible for its good activity. The presence of CuO in the reaction confers a significant advantage for CO desorption, leading to a remarkable CO selectivity of 95.54&#8201;%. This work highlights new insights into developing advanced heterogeneous photocatalysts.

Molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems offer a promising solution for solar energy storage. We present silver salts as a distinctive catalyst class capable of releasing stored energy from the promising dihydroazaborinine&#8208;based MOST system. Through mechanistic investigations and computational analysis, we gained insights into the silver&#8208;catalyzed thermal back reaction, while revealing the first crystal structure of a Dewar dihydroazaborinine.







Abstract
Molecular solar thermal systems (MOST) represent an auspicious solution for the storage of solar energy. We report silver salts as a unique class of catalysts, capable of releasing the stored energy from the promising 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine based MOST system. Mechanistic investigations provided insights into the silver catalyzed thermal backreaction, concurrently unveiling the first crystal structure of a 2&#8208;aza&#8208;3&#8208;borabicyclo[2.2.0]hex&#8208;5&#8208;ene, the Dewar isomer of 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine. Quantification of activation energies by kinetic experiments has elucidated the advantageous energy change associated with Lewis acid catalysts, a phenomenon corroborated through computational analysis. By means of low temperature NMR spectroscopy, mechanistic insights into the coordination of Ag+ to the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine were gained.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl Thiazolines from 4&#8208;Hydroxybenzaldehydes Using Vanillyl Alcohol Oxidases</title>

         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols in the presence of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) occurred through a spontaneous condensation reaction followed by preferential enzymatic oxidation of the in situ generated C&#8722;N bond over other competing functional groups. The biocatalysts showed good substrate tolerance, and the enzymatic products could be chemically modified to expand the structural diversity.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocycles are commonly found in bioactive natural products and drugs. However, the biocatalytic tools for nitrogen heterocycle synthesis are limited. Herein, we report the discovery of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) as efficient biocatalysts for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from various 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols. The wild&#8208;type biocatalyst features a broad scope of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes. Though the scope of aminothiols is limited, it could be improved via semi&#8208;rational protein engineering, generating a variant to produce previously inaccessible cysteine&#8208;derived bioactive 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines using the wild&#8208;type VAO. Benefiting from the derivatizable functional groups in the enzymatic products, we further chemically modified these products to expand the chemical space, offering a new chemoenzymatic strategy for the green and efficient synthesis of structurally diverse 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;thiazoline derivatives to prompt their use in drug discovery and catalysis.

         <title>Reaction, Recognition, Relay: Anhydride Hydrolysis Reported by Conformationally Responsive Fluorinated Foldamers in Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ hydrolysis of an insoluble anhydride produces chiral carboxylate in the aqueous phase, a signal that is recognized by artificial zinc(II)&#8208;capped membrane receptors embedded in micelles. These receptors relay the effect of this binding event along their length to produce a distinct 19F&#8197;NMR output, &#916;&#948;, from inside the hydrophobic region of the micelles.







Abstract
Natural membrane receptors are proteins that can report on changes in the concentration of external chemical messengers. Messenger binding to a receptor produces conformational changes that are relayed through the membrane into the cell; this information allows cells to adapt to changes in their environment. Artificial membrane receptors (R)&#8208;1 and (S)&#8208;1 are helical &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) foldamers that replicate key parts of this information relay. Solution&#8208;phase 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy of zinc(II)&#8208;capped receptor 1, either in organic solvent or in membrane&#8208;mimetic micelles, showed messenger binding produced an enrichment of either left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed screw&#8208;sense; the chirality of the bound messenger was relayed to the other receptor terminus. Furthermore, in situ production of a chemical messenger in the external aqueous environment could be detected in real&#8208;time by a racemic mixture of receptor 1 in micelles. The hydrolysis of insoluble anhydrides produced carboxylate in the aqueous phase, which bound to the receptors and gave a distinct 19F&#8197;NMR output from inside the hydrophobic region of the micelles.

         <title>Influence of Ti&#8208;incorporated Zeolite Topology and Pore Condensation on Vapor Phase Propylene Epoxidation Kinetics with Gaseous H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Propylene epoxidation and sequential reaction kinetics reflect the physical properties of catalysts and pore filling with gaseous solvents even without bulk liquid phase. Interactions between zeolite pores, reactant, and solvent molecules respond to changes in zeolite topology, pore polarity, and solvent pressure, resulting in significant changes in propylene epoxidation rates and propylene oxide product selectivities.







Abstract
Vapor&#8208;phase propylene (C3H6) epoxidation kinetics with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) strongly reflects the physical properties of Ti&#8208;incorporated zeolite catalysts and the presence of spectating molecules (&#8220;solvent&#8221;) near active sites even without a bulk liquid phase. Steady&#8208;state turnover rates of C3H6 epoxidation and product selectivities vary by orders of magnitudes, depending on the zeolite silanol ((SiOH)x) density, pore topology (MFI, *BEA, FAU), and the quantity of condensed acetonitrile (CH3CN) molecules nearby active sites, under identical reaction mechanisms sharing activated H2O2 intermediates on Ti surfaces. Individual kinetic analyses for propylene oxide (PO) ring&#8208;opening, homogeneous diol oxidative cleavage, and homogeneous aldehyde oxidation reveal that secondary reaction kinetics following C3H6 epoxidation responds more sensitively to the changes in zeolite physical properties and pore condensation with CH3CN. Thus, higher PO selectivities achieved in hydrophilic Ti&#8208;MFI at steady&#8208;state reflect the preferential stabilization of transition states for C3H6 epoxidation (a primary reaction) relative to PO ring&#8208;opening and oxidative cleavage (secondary reactions) that solvation effects that reflect interactions among condensed CH3CN within pores and the extended pore structure.

         <title>Controlling On&#8208;Surface Photoactivity: The Impact of &#960;&#8208;Conjugation in Anhydride&#8208;Functionalized Molecules on a Semiconductor Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the on&#8208;surface reaction of anhydride&#8208;functionalized molecules as precursors on a SnSe surface investigated by SPM and XPS techniques. Quantum chemical calculations demonstrate how their photoactivity can be controlled by modulating the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the molecular core.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has become a prominent method for growing low&#8208;dimensional carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials on metal surfaces. However, the necessity of decoupling organic nanostructures from metal substrates to exploit their properties requires either transfer methods or new strategies to perform reactions directly on inert surfaces. The use of on&#8208;surface light&#8208;induced reactions directly on semiconductor/insulating surfaces represents an alternative approach to address these challenges. Here, exploring the photochemical activity of different organic molecules on a SnSe semiconductor surface under ultra&#8208;high vacuum, we present a novel on&#8208;surface light&#8208;induced reaction. The selective photodissociation of the anhydride group is observed, releasing CO and CO2. Moreover, we rationalize the relationship between the photochemical activity and the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the molecular core. The different experimental behaviour of two model anhydrides was elucidated by theoretical calculations, showing how the molecular structure influences the distribution of the excited states. Our findings open new pathways for on&#8208;surface synthesis directly on technologically relevant substrates.

         <title>Acyl Phosphates as Chemically Fueled Building Blocks for Self&#8208;Sustaining Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium compartments regulated by an acyl phosphate chemical reaction network via chemical activation of carboxylic acids and alkyl phosphates. The compartments exist in the presence of chemical energy and decay without it. The chemical reaction network produces compartments even with prebiotically relevant activating agents, thus making it an attractive tool for studying Darwinian evolution in prebiotically plausible chemical systems incorporated with genotype&#8208;possessing structures.







Abstract
Lipids spontaneously assemble into vesicle&#8208;forming membranes. Such vesicles serve as compartments for even the simplest living systems. Vesicles have been extensively studied for constructing synthetic cells or as models for protocells&#8212;the cells hypothesized to have existed before life. These compartments exist almost always close to equilibrium. Life, however, exists out of equilibrium. In this work, we studied vesicle&#8208;based compartments regulated by a non&#8208;equilibrium chemical reaction network that converts activating agents. In this way, the compartments require a constant or periodic supply of activating agents to sustain themselves. Specifically, we use activating agents to condense carboxylates and phosphate esters into acyl phosphate&#8208;based lipids that form vesicles. These vesicles can only be sustained when condensing agents are present; without them, they decay. We demonstrate that the chemical reaction network can operate on prebiotic activating agents, opening the door to prebiotically plausible, self&#8208;sustainable protocells that compete for resources. In future work, such protocells should be endowed with a genotype, e.g., self&#8208;replicating RNA structures, to alter the protocell's behavior. Such protocells could enable Darwinian evolution in a prebiotically plausible chemical system.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Packing via Steric Hindrance for Reducing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the study, three new acceptors BTP&#8208;Biso, BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains, are reported. Due to the intense spatial hindrance effect, the intramolecular rotation is obviously restricted, and the intermolecular packing is substantially altered. Consequently, PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB&#8208;TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Bme&#8208;based ternary device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.3&#8201;% with a notably low &#916;Enr of 0.19&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Innovative molecule design strategy holds promise for the development of next&#8208;generation acceptor materials for efficient organic solar cells with low non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). In this study, we designed and prepared three novel acceptors, namely BTP&#8208;Biso, BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains inserted into the shoulder of the central core.

     alt="Optimizing Molecular Packing via Steric Hindrance for Reducing Non-Radiative Recombination in Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, three new acceptors BTP-Biso, BTP-Bme and BTP-B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains, are reported. Due to the intense spatial hindrance effect, the intramolecular rotation is obviously restricted, and the intermolecular packing is substantially altered. Consequently, PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB-TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP-Bme-based ternary device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.3&#8201;% with a notably low &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.19&#8197;eV.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovative molecule design strategy holds promise for the development of next-generation acceptor materials for efficient organic solar cells with low non-radiative energy loss (&lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt;). In this study, we designed and prepared three novel acceptors, namely BTP-Biso, BTP-Bme and BTP-B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains inserted into the shoulder of the central core. The progressively enlarged steric hindrance from BTP-B to BTP-Bme and BTP-Biso induces suppressed intramolecular rotation and altered the molecule packing mode in their aggregation states, leading to significant changes in absorption spectra and energy levels. By regulating the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, BTP-Bme possesses relatively reduced non-radiative recombination rate and extended exciton diffusion lengths. The binary device based on PB2&#8201;:&#8201;BTP-Bme exhibits an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5&#8201;% with a low &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.19&#8197;eV. Furthermore, the ternary device comprising PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB-TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP-Bme achieves an outstanding PCE of 19.3&#8201;%.

         <title>Leveraging DNA&#8208;Encoded Cell&#8208;Mimics for Environment&#8208;Adaptive Transmembrane Channel Release&#8208;Induced Cell Death</title>

In this study, a pioneering DNA&#8208;encoded artificial T cell mimics model (ARTC) that effectively mimics the behavior of natural T cells and establishes physicochemical interactions with biological cells. ARTC induce cellular apoptosis by releasing transmembrane channels that respond to the mildly acidic microenvironment, leading to selective outflow of intracellular potassium ions and consequent potent cytotoxic effects.







Abstract
The advancement of cell&#8208;mimic materials, which can forge sophisticated physicochemical dialogues with living cells, has unlocked a realm of intriguing prospects within the fields of synthetic biology and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the evolutionarily acquired ability of T lymphocytes to release perforin and generate transmembrane channels on targeted cells for killing, herein we present a pioneering DNA&#8208;encoded artificial T cell mimic model (ARTC) that accurately mimics T&#8208;cell&#8208;like behavior. ARTC responds to acidic conditions similar to those found in the tumor microenvironment and then selectively releases a G&#8208;rich DNA strand (LG4) embedded with C12 lipid and cholesterol molecules. Once released, LG4 effectively integrates into the membranes of neighboring live cells, behaving as an artificial transmembrane channel that selectively transports K+ ions and disrupts cellular homeostasis, ultimately inducing apoptosis. We hope that the emergence of ARTC will usher in new perspectives for revolutionizing future disease treatment and catalyzing the development of advanced biomedical technologies.

         <title>Assembly of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated [B3O6] Units by Mer&#8208;Isomer [YO3F3] Octahedra to Design a UV Nonlinear Optical Material, Cs2YB3O6F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new UV NLO material, Cs2YB3O6F2 with optimal arrangement of [B3O6] groups has been synthesized with the aid of structure&#8208;directing property of mer&#8208;isomer [YO3F3] octahedra. It exhibits the rare coexistence of the largest SHG response of 5.6&#215;KDP, the largest birefringence of 0.091 at 532&#8197;nm, the shortest Type I phase&#8208;matching down to 200.5&#8197;nm and DUV transparency among reported acentric rare&#8208;earth borates with [B3O6] groups.







Abstract
Achieving the extreme balance of the key performance requirements is the crucial to breakthrough the application bottleneck for nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Herein, by assembly of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B3O6] functional species with the aid of structure&#8208;directing property of mer&#8208;isomer [YO3F3] octahedra, a new ultraviolet (UV) NLO material, Cs2YB3O6F2 with aligned arrangement of coplanar [B3O6] groups has been synthesized. The polar material exhibits the rare coexistence of the largest second harmonic generation response of 5.6&#215;KDP, the largest birefringence of 0.091 at 532&#8197;nm, the shortest Type I phase&#8208;matching down to 200.5&#8197;nm and deep&#8208;ultraviolet transparency among reported acentric rare&#8208;earth borates with [B3O6] groups. Remarkably, benefiting from the enhanced bonding force among functional units [B3O6], a firm three&#8208;dimensional framework is constructed, which facilitates the growth of large crystals. This can be proved by a block shape crystal with dimensional of 6&#215;5&#215;4&#8197;mm3, indicating that it was a promising UV NLO crystal. This work provides a powerful strategy to design UV NLO materials with good performances.

         <title>A Processible and Ultrahigh&#8208;temperature Organic Photothermal Material through Spontaneous and Quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8211;Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

A processible and stable organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material ATT was facilely prepare by a spontaneous and quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Cycloreversion. ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photo&#8208;irradiation, enabling its applications in the high&#8208;temperature processes, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;fusion, photo&#8208;stamp, photo&#8208;weld and photo&#8208;controlled shaper memory.







Abstract
Energy conversion, particularly light to heat conversion, has garnered significant attention owing to its prospect in renewable energy exploitation and utilization. Most previous efforts have focused on developing organic photothermal materials for low&#8208;temperature applications, whereas the importance of simplifying the preparation methods of photothermal materials and enhancing their maximum photothermal temperature have been less taken. Herein, we prepare an organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material namely ATT by a spontaneous [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;cycloreversion reaction. In addition to the solution&#8208;based method, ATT could also be readily preapred by ball milling in a high yield of 90&#8201;% in just 15&#8197;min. ATT powder exhibits a broad absorption extending beyond 2000&#8197;nm, excellent processability, and thermal stability. Remarkably, ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photoirradiation. Leveraging its extraordinary photothermal and processable properties, ATT was used in the high&#8208;temperature applications, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;controlled metal processing and high&#8208;temperature shape memory, all of which offer spatiotemporal control capabilities. This work provides a new approach to prepare organic photothermal materials with high temperatures, and pave the way for their applications in extreme environments.

         <title>Highly Efficient Acidic Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Densities Promoted by Alkali Metal Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, promote selective electrocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O2 instead of H2O in a highly concentrated acidic electrolyte at high currents. The electrocatalytic environments involving water and alkali metal cations are pivotal in boosting H2O2 generation by stabilizing the crucial *OOH intermediate.







Abstract
Acidic H2O2 synthesis through electrocatalytic 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction presents a sustainable alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone oxidation technology. Nevertheless, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from low H2O2 Faradaic efficiencies primarily due to the competing reactions of 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction to H2O and hydrogen evolution in environments with high H+ concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, in promoting acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis at industrial&#8208;level currents, resulting in an effective current densities of 50&#8211;421&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 84&#8211;100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and a production rate of 856&#8211;7842&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 that far exceeds the performance observed in pure acidic electrolytes or low&#8208;current electrolysis. Finite&#8208;element simulations indicate that high interfacial pH near the electrode surface formed at high currents is crucial for activating the promotional effect of K+. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the central role of alkali metal cations in stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate to suppress 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction through interacting with coordinated H2O.

         <title>Selective Photoreforming of Waste Plastics into Diesel Olefins via Single Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;TCPP facilitates the generation of triplet excitons, yielding 1O2, enabling the selective photoreformation of PVC into diesel olefins. Conversely, Zn&#8208;TCPP promotes exciton dissociation due to its built&#8208;in electric field, generating &#8901;O2&#8722;, leading to the selective photoreformation of PE into diesel olefins. This highlights a universal approach for selective photoreforming of waste plastics via single ROS.







Abstract
The accumulation of plastic waste poses a pressing environmental challenge. Catalytic conversion stands out as an ideal approach for plastics upcycling, particularly through solar&#8208;driven plastics photoreforming. However, due to the common effects of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS), selectively generating high&#8208;value chemicals becomes challenging. In this study, we developed a universal strategy to achieve &gt;85&#8201;% selective production of diesel olefins (C15&#8211;C28) from polyolefin waste plastics via single ROS. Using tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin supramolecular (TCPP) with different central metals as an example to regulate single ROS generation, results show Ni&#8208;TCPP facilitates triplet exciton production, yielding 1O2, while Zn&#8208;TCPP generates &#8901;O2&#8722; due to its strong built&#8208;in electric field (IEF). 1O2 directly dechlorinates polyvinyl chloride (PVC) due to the electro&#8208;negativity of chlorine atoms and the low dissociation energy of C&#8722;Cl bonds, while &#8901;O2&#8722; promotes direct dehydrogenation of polyethylene (PE) due to the electro&#8208;positivity of hydrogen atoms and the high dissociation energy of C&#8722;H bonds. This method is universally applicable to various single ROS systems. Installation experiments further affirm the application potential, achieving the highest diesel olefin production of 76.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1. Such a universally adaptive approach holds promise for addressing the global plastic pollution problem.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3+2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ConPET as a powerful and novel technique for photoredox catalysis has been first employed in asymmetric synthesis. In collaboration with chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis, an unprecedented redox&#8208;neutral [3+2] photocycloaddition has been developed, facilitating the synthesis of a wide range of valuable azaarene&#8208;functionalized cyclopentyl ketones with high yields, ees and dr.







Abstract
Consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) is a powerful and atom&#8208;economical protocol to overcome the limitations of the intrinsic redox potential of visible light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers, thereby considerably improving the substrate and reaction types. Likely because such an exothermic single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process usually does not require the aid of chiral catalysts, resulting in an inevitable racemic background reaction, notably, no enantioselective manifolds have been reported. Herein, we report on the viability of cooperative ConPET and chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis for the [3+2] photocycloaddition of cyclopropyl ketones with vinylazaarenes. In addition to enabling the first use of olefins that preferentially interact with chiral catalysts, this catalysis platform paves the way for the efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically and synthetically important cyclopentyl ketones functionalized by azaarenes with high yields, ees and dr. The robust capacity of the method can be further highlighted by the low loading of the chiral catalyst (1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the good compatibility of both 2&#8208;azaarene and 3&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based olefins, and the successful concurrent construction of three stereocenters on cyclopentane rings involving an elusive but important all&#8208;carbon quaternary.

         <title>Dimensional Regulation in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskites by Compositional Engineering to Achieve Record Low X&#8208;Ray Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work innovatively utilizes compositional engineering to tailor octahedra, achieving a dimensional evolution in metal&#8208;free perovskites, and reports on metal&#8208;free perovskites with a two&#8208;dimensional structure for the first time. With the evolution in dimensions, there is a significant variation in their fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Importantly, the 2D SC&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector achieved an ultra&#8208;low LOD of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Utilizing the manipulation of perovskite dimensions has been proven as an effective approach in regulating perovskite properties. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over the dimensions of perovskites within the same system poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a sophisticated method to attain precise dimensional control in metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs), specifically through the process of octahedron tailoring by compositional engineering. Accordingly, we successfully instigated a transition from HPIP&#8722;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (3D), HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 (2D) and HPIP3&#8722;NH4I7 (1D) structures. Notably, HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 is the first 2D MFP. As anticipated, these perovskites exhibited completely distinct fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities due to their differing dimensions. Remarkably, the 2D HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 device effectively hindered ion migration perpendicular to the 2D layers, achieving the lowest detection limit of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 among metal&#8208;free single crystals&#8208;based detectors. This study expands the dimensionality control strategies for MFPs and introduces, for the first time, the potential of 2D MFPs as high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors, thereby enriching the diversity of the MFPs family.

     alt="Dimensional Regulation in Metal-Free Perovskites by Compositional Engineering to Achieve Record Low X-Ray Detection Limits"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work innovatively utilizes compositional engineering to tailor octahedra, achieving a dimensional evolution in metal-free perovskites, and reports on metal-free perovskites with a two-dimensional structure for the first time. With the evolution in dimensions, there is a significant variation in their fluorescence and X-ray detection capabilities. Importantly, the 2D SC-based X-ray detector achieved an ultra-low LOD of 12.2&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the manipulation of perovskite dimensions has been proven as an effective approach in regulating perovskite properties. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over the dimensions of perovskites within the same system poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a sophisticated method to attain precise dimensional control in metal-free perovskites (MFPs), specifically through the process of octahedron tailoring by compositional engineering. Accordingly, we successfully instigated a transition from HPIP&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (3D), HPIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (2D) and HPIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (1D) structures. Notably, HPIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the first 2D MFP. As anticipated, these perovskites exhibited completely distinct fluorescence and X-ray detection capabilities due to their differing dimensions. Remarkably, the 2D HPIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; device effectively hindered ion migration perpendicular to the 2D layers, achieving the lowest detection limit of 12.2&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; among metal-free single crystals-based detectors.

         <title>Cover Picture: Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 30/2024)</title>

An alternative mechanism for amine grafting in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Carlos Mart&#237;&#8208;Gastaldo et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402973). The image shows in a Warholian style how the adaptable response of the framework allows the rearrangement of pore windows necessary to enable the translocation and binding of tetraamines inside cavities that would otherwise be inaccessible. This behaviour is activated by the dynamic response of the heterometallic Ti2Ca2 clusters in MUV&#8208;10 in the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules.

The radicals , in collaboration with water molecules, drive the breakage of V&#8208;F&#8208;V bonds in bulk phase phosphate and subsequently form a new 2D phosphate through recoordination, as reported by Xing&#8208;Long Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402371). The 2D phosphate exhibits superior carrier transport capability, lower Na+ migration barriers, and reduced volumetric strain, endowing it with excellent fast charging characteristics as sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. This effective strategy will provide a new insight for the optimization of SIBs.

A fluorine&#8208;free , dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer was synthesized and used as a hydrocarbon polymer electrolyte membrane for fuel cells, as reported by Il&#8197;Seok Chae, Jong&#8197;Hak Kim et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202406796). The unique structure of the polymer chains led to the alignment of phase&#8208;separated domains and continuous proton channels were constructed throughout the membrane. This enabled efficient proton transport and ensured stable performance. A novel design of polymer structure demonstrates a promising prospect for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Life of Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries in Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>

Xiao et&#8197;al. demonstrate the use of an ionic liquid (IL) additive in zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries, which serves to optimize Zn solvation and the anode interface, as well as aids in inhibiting polyiodide dissolution. The research findings reveal a capacity decay rate of 0.01&#8201;% per cycle over 18,000 cycles (4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) in a full cell. Such promising results suggest a significant advancement in the field, offering high performing Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries are gaining significant attention due to their low&#8208;cost, high safety and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, their long cycle and durability have been hampered due to the use of aqueous media that, over time, lead to Zn dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution reaction, and polyiodide dissolution. Xiao et&#8197;al. recently reported the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) to an aqueous electrolyte and found that the IL plays a key role in modifying the solvation of Zn2+ ions in the bulk electrolyte and the inner Helmholtz plane,&#160;repelling H2O molecules away from the Zn anode surface. UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy also indicates a strong interaction between imidazolium cation [EMIM]+ and I3&#8722;, thereby reducing polyiodide shuttling and enhancing the cycle life of the battery. Overall, a capacity decay rate of only 0.01&#8201;% per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, is observed, making the use of IL additives in aqueous electrolytes highly promising candidates for Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Nanohoops: A New Generation of Curved Materials for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different nanohoops used to date in organic electronics are described in this Review. Through a structure&#8208;properties relationship study, the different performances reached are analysed and the potential of this new generation of curved materials discussed. This Review aims to stimulate future molecular designs of functional materials based on these conjugated macrocycles.







Abstract
Nanohoops, cyclic association of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems to form a hoop&#8208;shaped molecule, have been widely developed in the last 15&#8197;years. Beyond the synthetic challenge, the strong interest towards these molecules arises from their radially oriented &#960;&#8208;orbitals, which provide singular properties to these fascinating structures. Thanks to their particular cylindrical arrangement, this new generation of curved molecules have been already used in many applications such as host&#8211;guest complexation, biosensing, bioimaging, solid&#8208;state emission and catalysis. However, their potential in organic electronics has only started to be explored. From the first incorporation as an emitter in a fluorescent organic light emitting diode (OLED), to the recent first incorporation as a host in phosphorescent OLEDs or as charge transporter in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and in organic photovoltaics, this field has shown important breakthroughs in recent years. These findings have revealed that curved materials can play a key role in the future and can even be more efficient than their linear counterparts. This can have important repercussions for the future of electronics. Time has now come to overview the different nanohoops used to date in electronic devices in order to stimulate the future molecular designs of functional materials based on these macrocycles.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Heteroatom&#8208;Linked Non&#8208;Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful atroposelective synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;linked non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers marks a significant milestone in organic synthesis. Unlike conventional atropisomers, these unique molecules display generally lower enantiomerization barriers due to possible concerted bond rotations. Through innovative strategies, chemists have succeeded in controlling the atroposelectivity of these reactions, enabling the construction of original optically active molecular structures.







Abstract
Atropisomers hold significant fascination, not only for their prevalence in natural compounds but also for their biological importance and wide&#8208;ranging applications as chiral materials, ligands, and organocatalysts. While biaryl and heterobiaryl atropisomers are commonly studied, the enantioselective synthesis of less abundant heteroatom&#8208;linked non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers presents a formidable challenge in modern organic synthesis. Unlike classical atropisomers, these molecules allow rotation around two bonds, resulting in low barriers to enantiomerization through concerted bond rotations. In recent years the discovery of new configurationally stable rare non&#8208;biaryl scaffolds such as aryl amines, aryl ethers and aryl sulfones as well as innovative methodologies to control their configuration have been disclosed in the literature and constitute the topic of this minireview.

         <title>Progressive Optimization of Lanthanide Nanoparticle Scintillators for Enhanced Triple&#8208;Activated Radioluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A progressive optimization on lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators was performed to maximize their radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) emission intensity and reveal the underlying relationship between the scintillators&#8242; structure and RL efficiency. The results regarding the RL mechanism and in vivo multimodal imaging strongly indicated the significant potential of tailored LnNP scintillators to achieve seamlessly integrated tumor radio&#8208;phototheranostics.







Abstract
Lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators exhibit huge potential in achieving radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (radioluminescence, RL). However, their structure&#8211;activity relationship remains largely unexplored. Herein, progressive optimization of LnNP scintillators is presented to unveil their structure&#8208;dependent RL property and enhance their RL output efficiency. Benefiting from the favorable host matrix and the luminescence&#8208;protective effect of core&#8211;shell engineering, NaGdF4&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8201;%Eu@NaLuF4 nanoparticle scintillators with tailored structures emerged as the top candidates. Living imaging experiments based on optimal LnNP scintillators validated the feasibility of laser&#8208;free continuous RL activated by clinical radiopharmaceuticals for tumor multiplex visualization. This research provides unprecedented insights into the rational design of LnNP scintillators, which would enable efficient energy conversion from Cerenkov luminescence, &#947;&#8208;radiation, and &#946;&#8208;electrons into visible photon signals, thus establishing a robust nanotechnology&#8208;aided approach for tumor&#8208;directed radio&#8208;phototheranostics.

         <title>Reviving Cost&#8208;Effective Organic Cathodes in Halide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. The PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high working voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
The evolution of inorganic solid electrolytes has revolutionized the field of sustainable organic cathode materials, particularly by addressing the dissolution problems in traditional liquid electrolytes. However, current sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries still face challenges such as high working temperatures, high costs, and low voltages. Here, we design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. Thanks to the good compatibility between PQ and Li2ZrCl6, the PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high average discharge voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, the interactions between the high&#8208;voltage carbonyl PQ cathode and both sulfide and halide solid electrolytes, as well as the redox mechanism of the PQ cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, were carefully studied by a variety of advanced characterizations. We believe such a design and the corresponding investigations into the underlying chemistry give insights for the further development of practical all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries.

     alt="Reviving Cost-Effective Organic Cathodes in Halide-Based All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We design an all-solid-state lithium battery based on a cost-effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high working voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of inorganic solid electrolytes has revolutionized the field of sustainable organic cathode materials, particularly by addressing the dissolution problems in traditional liquid electrolytes. However, current sulfide-based all-solid-state lithium-organic batteries still face challenges such as high working temperatures, high costs, and low voltages. Here, we design an all-solid-state lithium battery based on a cost-effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Thanks to the good compatibility between PQ and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high average discharge voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, the interactions between the high-voltage carbonyl PQ cathode and both sulfide and halide solid electrolytes, as well as the redox mechanism of the PQ cathode in all-solid-state batteries, were carefully studied by a variety of advanced characterizations. We believe such a design and the corresponding investigations into the underlying chemistry give insights for the further development of practical all-solid-state lithium-organic batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Gold(I)&#8211;Acetylene Complex Synthesised using Single&#8208;Crystal Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of &#960;&#8208;acetylene gold(I) compounds as intermediates in catalysis has been postulated, but their isolation or spectroscopic detection has remained elusive. Herein, the combination of a bulky cavity&#8208;shaped phosphine along with single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reactivity allowed for the isolation of the first gold(I)&#8211;acetylene complex, which was thoroughly characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution and solid&#8208;state NMR, periodic DFT, and electronic structure analyses.







Abstract
Using single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal solid/gas reactivity the gold(I) acetylene complex [Au(L1)(&#951;2&#8208;HC&#8801;CH)][BArF4] is cleanly synthesized by addition of acetylene gas to single crystals of [Au(L1)(CO)][BArF4] [L1=tris&#8208;2&#8208;(4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbiphenyl)phosphine, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3]. This simplest gold&#8208;alkyne complex has been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and periodic DFT. Bonding of HC&#8801;CH with [Au(L1)]+ comprises both &#963;&#8208;donation and &#960;&#8208;backdonation with additional dispersion interactions within the cavity&#8208;shaped phosphine.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Hemicyanines as Modular Scaffolds for in vivo Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a modular chemical platform for the synthesis of targeted near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers including enzymatic cages and biocompatible units. We demonstrated its utility with the design of a cathepsin B&#8208;activatable agent for safe ablation of microtumors in vivo in a zebrafish preclinical model.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy is an anti&#8208;cancer treatment that requires illumination of photosensitizers to induce local cell death. Current near&#8208;infrared organic photosensitizers are built from large and non&#8208;modular structures that cannot be tuned to improve safety and minimize off&#8208;target toxicity. This work describes a novel chemical platform to generate enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers. We optimized the Se&#8208;bridged hemicyanine scaffold to include caging groups and biocompatible moieties, and generated cathepsin&#8208;triggered photosensitizers for effective ablation of human glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that enzyme&#8208;activatable Se&#8208;bridged hemicyanines are effective photosensitizers for the safe ablation of microtumors in vivo, creating new avenues in the chemical design of targeted anti&#8208;cancer photodynamic therapy agents.

         <title>Cascaded *CO&#8722;*COH Intermediates on a Nonmetallic Plasmonic Photocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 with 90.6&#8201;% Selectivity</title>

The &#8220;photoelectron injection&#8221;&#8208;stabilized W/Z plasmonic photocatalyst achieved efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion (653.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under visible light irradiation, with an exceptionally high selectivity of 90.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
Oxygen vacancies (OV) in nonmetallic plasmonic photocatalysts can decrease the energy barrier for CO2 reduction, boosting C1 intermediate production for potential C2 formation. However, their susceptibility to oxidation weakens C1 intermediate adsorption. Herein we proposed a &#8220;photoelectron injection&#8221; strategy to safeguard OV in W18O49 by creating a W18O49/ZIS (W/Z) plasmonic photocatalyst. Moreover, photoelectrons contribute to the local multi&#8208;electron environment of W18O49, enhancing the intrinsic excitation of its hot electrons with extended lifetimes, as confirmed by in situ XPS and femtosecond transient absorption analysis. Density functional theory calculations revealed that W/Z with OV enhances CO2 adsorption, activating *CO production, while reducing the energy barrier for *COH production (0.054&#8197;eV) and subsequent *CO&#8722;*COH coupling (0.574&#8197;eV). Successive hydrogenation revealed that the free energy for *CH2CH2 hydrogenation (0.108&#8197;eV) was lower than that for *CH2CH2 desorption for C2H4 production (0.277&#8197;eV), favouring C2H6 production. Consequently, W/Z achieves an efficient C2H6 activity of 653.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, with an exceptionally high selectivity of 90.6&#8201;%. This work offers a new strategy for the rational design of plasmonic photocatalysts with high selectivity for C2+ products.

         <title>Alkene 1,3&#8208;Difluorination via Transient Oxonium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a diastereoselective hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers. The transformation proceeds through a transiently formed oxonium intermediate that is opened by fluoride to rearrange an alkyl chain. The protocol is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain. Mechanistic studies reveal key insights into the reaction selectivity.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is an under&#8208;explored transformation that leads to moieties that are otherwise challenging to prepare. Herein, we report a hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers to give unreported 1,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;oxy groups with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. The transformation proceeds through a different mode of reactivity for 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization, in which a regioselective addition of fluoride opens a transiently formed oxonium intermediate to rearrange an alkyl chain. The optimized protocol is scalable and shown to proceed well with a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain, hence providing ready access to this fluorinated, conformationally controlled moiety.

The transformation proceeds through a transiently formed oxonium intermediate that is opened by fluoride to rearrange an alkyl chain. The protocol is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain. Mechanistic studies reveal key insights into the reaction selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1,3-difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is an under-explored transformation that leads to moieties that are otherwise challenging to prepare. Herein, we report a hypervalent iodine-mediated 1,3-difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers to give unreported 1,3-difluoro-4-oxy groups with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. The transformation proceeds through a different mode of reactivity for 1,3-difunctionalization, in which a regioselective addition of fluoride opens a transiently formed oxonium intermediate to rearrange an alkyl chain. The optimized protocol is scalable and shown to proceed well with a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain, hence providing ready access to this fluorinated, conformationally controlled moiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Borylation and subsequent halide abstraction of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand affords a cationic complex featuring a rare linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes an unique chain elongation reaction via iminoborane carboration reaction with bis(tert&#8208;butyl)iminoborane, giving access to a five&#8208;atom B/N chain.







Abstract
Borylation of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand and halide abstraction provides access to a cationic complex with an unprecedented linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with azides, and an unexpected chain&#8208;extension reaction with an iminoborane, leading to a complex with a five&#8208;atom B/N chain. These two [NNBR]&#8208;containing complexes, inorganic analogues of E.&#8197;O. Fischer's alkynylcarbynes, are very rare examples of molecules containing all&#8208;inorganic chains of sp&#8208;hybridized atoms.

         <title>Efficient Enzymatic Synthesis of Carbamates in Water Using Promiscuous Esterases/Acyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis performed under harsh reaction conditions often requires the need for protecting groups to prevent off&#8208;target reactions. While traditional chemical introduction of protecting groups disagrees with the principles of green chemistry, biocatalysis provides a promising alternative. Herein, we present an unprecedented enzymatic approach for the efficient synthesis of carbamate&#8208;protected amines in water achieving up to 99&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Biocatalysis provides an attractive approach to facilitate synthetic reactions in aqueous media. Motivated by the discovery of promiscuous aminolysis activity of esterases, we exploited the esterase from Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 (PestE) for the synthesis of carbamates from different aliphatic, aromatic, and arylaliphatic amines and a set of carbonates such as dimethyl&#8208;, dibenzyl&#8208;, or diallyl carbonate. Thus, aniline and benzylamine derivatives, aliphatic and even secondary amines could be efficiently converted into the corresponding benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)&#8208; or allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc)&#8208;protected products in bulk water, with (isolated) yields of up to 99&#8201;%.

         <title>Selective Macrocyclization of Unprotected Peptides with an Ex Situ Gaseous Linchpin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that enables amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8208;aniline crosslinking by a minimalist linchpin strategy was used to form macrocyclic urea or carbamate products in unprotected peptides. The reaction is operationally simple and tolerates a wide range of other amino acids. Cyclization of bioactive cyclic peptides provided a variety of bicyclic peptides with novel topologies.







Abstract
Peptide cyclization has dramatic effects on a variety of important properties, enhancing metabolic stability, limiting conformational flexibility, and altering cellular entry and intracellular localization. The hydrophilic, polyfunctional nature of peptides creates chemoselectivity challenges in macrocyclization, especially for natural sequences without biorthogonal handles. Herein, we describe a gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that achieves amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8211;aniline crosslinking through a minimalist linchpin strategy that affords macrocyclic urea or carbamate products. The cyclization reaction is metal&#8208;mediated and involves a novel application of sulfine species that remains unexplored in aqueous or biological contexts. The aqueous method delivers unique cyclic or bicyclic topologies directly from a variety of natural bioactive peptides without the need for protecting&#8208;group strategies.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Formation of Sulfurous Acid (H2SO3) in the Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laboratory experiments show the formation of sulfurous acid (H2SO3) from the gas&#8208;phase reaction of OH radicals with CH3S(O)OH for atmospheric reaction conditions with a molar yield of &#8764;50&#8201;%. H2SO3 represents a hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach acid that has never been observed in aqueous solution. In the gas phase, if once formed, it shows a certain kinetic stability with an estimated lifetime of at least one second for atmospheric water vapor conditions.







Abstract
Sulfurous acid (H2SO3) is known to be thermodynamically instable decomposing into SO2 and H2O. All attempts to detect this elusive acid in solution failed up to now. Reported H2SO3 formation from an experiment carried out in a mass spectrometer as well as results from theoretical calculations, however, indicated a possible kinetic stability in the gas phase. Here, it is shown experimentally that H2SO3 is formed in the OH radical&#8208;initiated gas&#8208;phase oxidation of methanesulfinic acid (CH3S(O)OH) at 295&#177;0.5&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar of air with a molar yield of 

53-17+7

 ${{53}_{-17}^{+\ 7}}$



&#8201;%. Further main products are SO2, SO3 and methanesulfonic acid. CH3S(O)OH represents an important intermediate product of dimethyl sulfide oxidation in the atmosphere. Global modeling predicts an annual H2SO3 production of &#8764;8&#8197;million metric tons from the OH+CH3S(O)OH reaction. The investigated H2SO3 depletion in the presence of water vapor results in k(H2O+H2SO3) &lt;3&#215;10&#8722;18&#8197;cm3&#8201;molecule&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which indicates a lifetime of at least one second for atmospheric humidity. This work provides experimental evidence that H2SO3, once formed in the gas phase, is kinetically stable enough to allow its characterization and subsequent reactions.

         <title>Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped, Block&#8208;Graft Copolymer with Aligned Domains for High&#8208;Performance Hydrocarbon Polymer Electrolyte Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dumbbell&#8208;shaped hydrocarbon block&#8208;graft copolymer was synthesized for use as a polymer electrolyte membrane. The introduction of comb&#8208;type side chains resulted in a highly aligned morphology with enhanced microphase separation. The poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene&#8208;b&#8208;styrene)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(styrene sulfonic acid) membrane achieved outstanding ion conductivity and maintained stable fuel cell performance for 150&#8197;h.







Abstract
Given the environmental concerns surrounding fluoromaterials, the use of high&#8208;cost perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) in fuel cells and water electrolysis contradicts the pursuit of clean energy systems. Herein, we present a fluorine&#8208;free dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer, derived from the cost&#8208;effective triblock copolymer, poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (SEBS), for polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs). This unique polymer shape led to the alignment of the hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic domains along a preferred orientation, resulting in the construction of interconnected proton channels across the membrane. A bicontinuous network allowed efficient proton transport with reduced tortuosity, leading to an exceptional ionic conductivity (249&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH)), despite a low ion exchange capacity (IEC; 1.41). Furthermore, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) prepared with our membrane exhibited stable performance over a period of 150&#8197;h at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 30&#8201;% RH. This study demonstrates a novel polymer structure design and highlights a promising outlook for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.

         <title>Subsurface Single&#8208;atom Catalyst Enabled by Mechanochemical Synthesis for Oxidation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional atom utilization and unique properties. However, the practical application of these catalysts is often impeded by challenges such as sintering&#8208;induced instability and poisoning of isolated atoms due to strong gas adsorption. In this study, we employed the mechanochemical method to insert single Cu atoms into the subsurface of Fe2O3 support. By manipulating the location of single atoms at the surface or subsurface, catalysts with distinct adsorption properties and reaction mechanisms can be achieved. It was observed that the subsurface Cu single atoms in Fe2O3 remained isolated under both oxidation and reduction environments, whereas surface Cu single atoms on Fe2O3 experienced sintering under reduction conditions. The unique properties of these subsurface single&#8208;atom catalysts call for innovations and new understandings in catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Main Group Element Lewis Acid Thionyl chloride Adduct and its Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the adduct of aluminum trichloride with thionyl chloride has been reported, no thionyl chloride adduct of a main group element Lewis acid or organometallic compound has been structurally characterized. In this communication we present the synthesis and reactivity of the structurally ascertained adduct of thionyl chloride with tris(pentafluoroethyl)gallane as a representative of a main group element Lewis acid. Gallium and indium compounds with electron withdrawing groups, e.g. the pentafluoroethyl ligand, display versatile properties. While gallates and indates, [MR4]&#8211;, behave as weakly coordinating anions, neutral gallanes and indanes, MR3, are strong Lewis acids. Salts with the tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate and &#8208;indate, [M(C2F5)4]&#8211; (M=Ga, In), have recently been studied in detail. In contrast to this, work on the syntheses of the free Lewis superacids M(C2F5)3 (M= Ga, In) is scarce and underdeveloped. The hydrates [M(C2F5)3(OH2)2] proved to be suitable starting materials, particularly due to their thermal stability. Herein we report on synthesis and characterization of reactive adducts, [M(C2F5)3D], with the weak donor molecules (D) SOCl2 and Me3SiF. The effective Lewis acidities of Ga(C2F5)3 and In(C2F5)3 were experimentally deter&#173;mined by the (modified) Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and their catalytic potential is showcased.</dc:description>

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Anti&#8208;Ohmic Behaviour in Diradicaloid Molecular Wires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Open&#8208;shell materials bearing multiple spin centres provide a key route to efficient charge transport in single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. They have narrow energy gaps, and their molecular orbitals align closely to the Fermi level of the metallic electrodes, thus allowing efficient electronic transport and higher conductance. Maintaining and stabilising multiple open&#8208;shell states &#8211; especially in contact with metallic electrodes &#8211; is however very challenging, generally requiring a continuous chemical or electrochemical potential to avoid self&#8208;immolation of the open&#8208;shell character. To overcome this issue, we designed, synthesised, and measured the conductance of a series of bis(indeno) fused acenes, where stability is imparted by a close&#8208;shell quinoidal conformation in resonance with the diradical electronic configuration. We show here that these compounds have anti&#8208;ohmic behaviour, with conductance increasing with increasing molecular length, at an unprecedented rate and across the entire bias window ([[EQUATION]]). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations support our findings, showing the rapidly narrowing HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, unique to these diradicaloid structures, is responsible for the observed behaviour. Our results provide a framework for achieving efficient transport in neutral compounds and demonstrate the promise that diradicaloid materials have in single&#8208;molecule electronics, owing to their great stability and unique electronic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Unlocking Reactivity of Fragments for Fast Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We showcase the successful combination of photochemistry and kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) for rapidly pinpointing enzyme inhibitors. KTGS is a fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) methodology in which the biological target (BT) orchestrates the construction of its own ligand from fragments featuring complementary reactive functionalities. Notably, fragments interacting with the protein binding sites leverage their spatial proximity, facilitating a preferential reaction. Consequently, the resulting bivalent ligand exhibits heightened affinity. Within the realm of KTGS strategies, in situ click chemistry stands out as the most widely used to identify potent protein binders. This approach requires significant protein contributions, such as binding interactions and appropriate orientations of fragments, to overcome high activation barriers. This leads to prolonged incubation times and the potential for generating false negatives, thereby limiting this strategy to proteins that are stable enough in buffer. We herein unveil the possibility to integrate photochemistry into the realm of KTGS, accelerating the ligation reaction between fragments to a time scale of minutes. This approach should significantly expand the narrow reactivity window of traditional KTGS reactions, paving the way for the exploration and development of novel photo&#8208;KTGS reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;isocyanate Synthesis of Covalent Adaptable Networks Based on Dynamic Hindered Urea Bonds: Sequential Polymerization and Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of environmentally sustainable processes for polymer recycling is of paramount importance in the polymer industry. In particular, the implementation of chemical recycling for thermoset polymers via covalent adaptable networks (CANs), particularly those based on the dynamic hindered urea bond (HUB), has garnered intensive attention from both the academic and industrial sectors. This interest stems from its straightforward chemical structure and reaction mechanism, which are well&#8208;suited for commercial polyurethane and polyurea applications. However, a substantial drawback of these CANs is the requisite use of toxic isocyanate curing agents for their synthesis. Herein, we propose a new HUB synthesis pathway involving thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one and a hindered amine. This ring&#8208;opening reaction facilitates the isocyanate&#8208;free formation of a HUB and enables sequential reactions with acrylate and epoxide monomers via thiol&#8211;Michael and thiol&#8211;epoxy click chemistry. The CANs synthesized using this methodology exhibit superior reprocessability, chemical recyclability, and reutilizability, facilitated by specific catalytic and solvent conditions, through the reversible HUB, thiol&#8211;Michael addition, and transesterification processes.</dc:description>

         <title>2,3:6,7&#8210;Naphthalene bis(dicarboximide) Cyclophane: A Photo&#8210;functional Host for Ambient Delayed Fluorescence in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harvesting triplet excitons of heavy atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under aerated conditions is challenging due to the quenching of long&#8208;lived triplet states by molecular oxygen and vibrational dissipation. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach of triplet harvesting via mitigating quenching pathways of a triplet harvester. Specifically, we used a host&#8211;guest system based on  2,3:6,7&#8210;naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;derived cyclophane (NBICy) and carbazole derivative (EtCz). Complexation studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis showed the formation of a rigid host&#8211;guest complex (K&#160;= ~104 M&#8208;1 in CCl4), resulting in triplet&#8208;exciton stabilization under aerated conditions via mitigating vibrational interference and oxygen quenching. Photophysical studies elucidate the delayed fluorescence emission from the charge&#8208;transfer state (1CT) with a quantum yield (QY) of 6&#8208;8% under ambient conditions which increased up to 36 % in an inert atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Donor Acceptor Complex&#8208;Enabled &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Alkenylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic amines are prevalent and vital structural components present in many bioactive compounds and natural products. Additionally, they serve as valuable intermediates and building blocks, with wide&#8208;ranging applications in organic synthesis. However, direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H alkenylation of feedstock amines, particularly for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;alkenylated cyclic amines, has posed a longstanding challenge. Herein, we present a general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of various readily available amines with alkenylborate esters in excellent E/Z &#8208; and diastereoselectivities. This method features good compatibility with water and oxygen, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance, thereby enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of various complex molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion, which subsequently undergoes photoinduced single electron transfer and intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to generate the crucial &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, is the key to success of this chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and stable NIR&#8208;II phosphorescence of metallophilicmolecular oligomers for in vivo single&#8208;cell tracking and time&#8208;resolved imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular phosphorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) holds promise for deep&#8208;tissue optical imaging with high contrast by overcoming background fluorescence interference. However, achieving bright and stable NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence suitable for biological applications remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a new series of symmetric isocyanorhodium(I) complexes that could form oligomers and exhibit bright, long&#8208;lived (7&#8208;8 &#956;s) phosphorescence in aqueous solution via metallophilic interaction. Ligand substituents with enhanced dispersion attraction and electron&#8208;donating properties were explored to extend excitation/emission wavelengths and enhanced stability. Further binding the oligomers with fetal bovine serum (FBS) resulted in NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 3.93%) and long&#8208;term stability in biological environments, enabling in vivo tracking of single&#8208;macrophage dynamics and high&#8208;contrast time&#8208;resolved imaging.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Hybridization Activates Lattice&#8208;Hydroxyl&#8208;Groups of NiCo(OH) x  Nanowires for Efficient Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical dehydrogenation of hydroxides plays a crucial role in the formation of high&#8208;valence metal active sites toward 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to produce the value&#8208;added chemical of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic (FDCA). Herein, we construct benzoic acid ligand&#8208;hybridized NiCo(OH)x nanowires (BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x) with ample electron&#8208;deficient Ni/Co sites for HMFOR. The robust electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of benzoic acid ligands in BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x speeds up the electrochemical activation and dehydrogenation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups (M2+&#8208;O&#8208;H &#8652; M3+&#8208;O), boosting the formation of abundant electron&#8208;deficient and high&#8208;valence Ni/Co sites. DFT calculation reveals that the deintercalation proton is prone to establishing a hydrogen bridge with the carbonyl group in benzoic acid, facilitating the proton transfer. Coupled with the synergistic oxidation of Ni/Co sites on hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x delivers a remarkable current density of 111.20 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4 V for HMFOR, exceeding that of NiCo(OH)x by approximately fourfold. And the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency are as high as 95.24% and 95.39%, respectively. The ligand&#8208;hybridized strategy in this work introduces a novel perspective for designing high&#8208;performance transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for biomass conversion.</dc:description>

DFT calculation reveals that the deintercalation proton is prone to establishing a hydrogen bridge with the carbonyl group in benzoic acid, facilitating the proton transfer. Coupled with the synergistic oxidation of Ni/Co sites on hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, BZ-NiCo(OH)x delivers a remarkable current density of 111.20 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4 V for HMFOR, exceeding that of NiCo(OH)x by approximately fourfold. And the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency are as high as 95.24% and 95.39%, respectively. The ligand-hybridized strategy in this work introduces a novel perspective for designing high-performance transition metal-based electrocatalysts for biomass conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indazole to 2&#8208;cyanoindole scaffold progression for mycobacterial lipoamide dehydrogenase inhibitors achieves extended target residence time and improved antibacterial activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death from a single infection worldwide. Drug resistance to existing and even new antimycobacterials calls for research into novel targets and unexplored mechanisms of action. Recently we reported on the development of tight&#8208;binding inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), which selectively inhibit the bacterial but not the human enzyme based on a differential modality of inhibitor interaction with these targets. Here we report on the striking improvement in inhibitor residence time on the Mtb enzyme associated with scaffold progression from an indazole to 2&#8208;cyanoindole. Cryo&#8208;EM of Lpd with the bound 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitor 19 confirmed displacement of the buried water molecule deep in the binding channel with a cyano group. The ensuing hours&#8208;long &#160;improvement in on&#8208;target residence time is associated with enhanced antibacterial activity in axenic culture and in primary mouse macrophages. Resistance to 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitors involves mutations within the inhibitor binding site that have little effect on inhibitor affinity but change the modality of inhibitor&#8208;target interaction, resulting in fast dissociation from Lpd. These findings underscore that on&#8208;target residence time is a major determinant of antibacterial activity and in vivo efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Metabolic Response to Small Molecule Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Tracked with Raman Spectroscopy and Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite numerous screening tools for colorectal cancer (CRC), 25% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. &#160;Novel diagnostic technologies that are early, accurate, and rapid are imperative to assess the therapeutic efficacy of clinical drugs and identify new biomarkers of treatment response. Here Raman spectroscopy (RS) was used to track metabolic reprogramming in KRAS&#8208;mutant HCT116 and SW837 cells, and KRAS wild&#8208;type CC cells. RS combined with multivariate analysis methods distinguished nonresponsive, partially responsive, and responsive cells treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR inhibition, sotorasib, a clinically approved KRAS inhibitor, and various doses of trametinib, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Cells treated with a combination of subtoxic doses of trametinib and BKM120, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, showed a synergistic response between the two pathways. Using a supervised machine learning regression model, we established a scoring methodology trained to a priori predict therapeutic response to new treatment combinations. RS metabolites were verified with mass spectrometry, and enrichment pathways were identified, including amino acid, purine, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism that differentiated monotherapy from combination therapy. Our approach may ultimately be applicable to patient&#8208;derived primary cells and cultures of patient tumors to predict effective drugs for individualized care.</dc:description>

         <title>Unconventional Electrocatalytic CO Conversion to C2 Products on Single&#8208;Atomic Pd&#8208;Agn Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO or CO2 into C2+ products has mostly been focused on Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Although Ag has also been predicted as a possible catalyst for the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion from the thermodynamic point of view, however, due to its weak CO binding strength, CO rapidly desorbs from the Ag surface rather than participates in deep reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that single&#8208;atomic Pd sites doped in Ag lattice can tune the CO adsorption behavior and promote the deep reduction of CO toward C2 products. The monodispersed Pd&#8208;Agn sites enable the CO adsorption with both Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and Pd&#8208;Ag bridge (PdAgB) configurations, which can increase the CO coverage and reduce the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Under room temperature and ambient pressure, the Pd1Ag10 alloy catalyst exhibited a total CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Faradaic efficiency of ~37% at &#8210;0.83 V, with appreciable current densities and electrochemical stability, thus featuring unconventional non&#8208;Cu electrocatalytic CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Molecular Rotation in Crystal Changes the Course of a Topochemical Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction from a Predicted Polymerization to an Unexpected Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A designed anthracene&#8208;based monomer for topochemical Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition polymerization crystallized with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement of molecules, as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The diene and dienophile units of adjacent monomer molecules are aligned at an average distance of 4.6 &#197;, suggesting a favorable crystalline arrangement for their intermolecular Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction to form a linear polymer . Surprisingly, heating the monomer crystals at a temperature above 125 &#176;C resulted in the formation of intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadduct, which could be characterized by various spectroscopy and SCXRD analysis. Various time&#8208;dependent studies such as NMR, PXRD, and DSC, studies established that the reaction followed topochemical pathway. Schmidt&#8217;s topochemical postulates are generally used to predict the topochemical reactivity and product, by analyzing the crystal structure of the reactant. Though the crystal arrangement predicted polymerization, upon heating the molecule avoided this pathway by undergoing a large rotation to form an intramolecular cycloadduct.&#160;Theoretical calculations supported the feasibility of the rotation, exploiting the flexibility of the molecule and voids present. These findings caution that the reliance on Schmidt&#8217;s criteria for topochemical reactions may sometimes be misleading, especially in heat&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Highly Specific Fluorescent Probe based on Thiol&#8208;ene Click Nucleophilic Cascade Reactions for Delving into the Action Mechanism of Serotonin in Depression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intrinsic correlation between depression and serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is a highly debated topic, with significant implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and advancement of drugs targeting neurological disorders. To address this important question, it is of utmost priority to understand the action mechanism of serotonin in depression through fluorescence imaging studies. However, the development of efficient molecular probes for serotonin is hindered by the lack of responsive sites with high selectivity for serotonin at the present time. Herein, we developed the first highly selective serotonin responsive site, 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate, utilizing thiol&#8208;ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions. The novel responsive site was then employed to construct the powerful molecular probe SJ&#8208;5&#8208;HT for imaging the serotonin level changes in the depression cells and brain tissues. Importantly, the imaging studies reveal that the level of serotonin in patients with depression may not be the primary factor, while the ability of neurons in patients with depression to release serotonin appears to be more critical. Additionally, this serotonin release capability correlates strongly with the levels of mTOR (intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin). These discoveries could offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning depression and furnish mTOR as a novel direction for the advancement of antidepressant therapies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delocalized organic &#960;&#8208;radicals are intrinsically amphoteric redox systems; however, achieving their multistage redox capability presents a challenge. In addition, their instability often hampers their synthesis, isolation, and characterization. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable &#960;&#8208;extended nanographene &#960;&#8208;radical (NR1) and its isolation in the crystalline form. NR1 exhibits an unusual four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, as revealed by cyclic voltammetry measurements. The stable charged species, including a cation and a radical dication, are characterized using spectroscopic methods. This study demonstrates that &#960;&#8208;extension could serve as a viable approach to unlock the multistage redox ability of delocalized organic radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperpolarization of 15N&#8208;Pyridinium by Using Parahydrogen Enables Access to Reactive Oxygen Sensors and Pilot In Vivo Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 15N&#8208;labelled tracer for magnetic resonance is introduced that is signal enhanced using parahydrogen and the feasibility for first pilot 15N in vivo studies is demonstrated.







Abstract
Magnetic resonance with hyperpolarized contrast agents is one of the most powerful and noninvasive imaging platforms capable for investigating in vivo metabolism. While most of the utilized hyperpolarized agents are based on 13C nuclei, a milestone advance in this area is the emergence of 15N hyperpolarized contrast agents. Currently, the reported 15N hyperpolarized agents mainly utilize the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d&#8208;DNP) protocol. The parahydrogen enhanced 15N probes have proven to be elusive and have been tested almost exclusively in organic solvents. Herein, we designed a reaction based reactive oxygen sensor 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) which can be hyperpolarized with para&#8208;hydrogen. Reactive oxygen species plays a vital role as one of the essential intracellular signalling molecules. Disturbance of the H2O2 level usually represents a hallmark of pathophysiological conditions. This H2O2 probe exhibited rapid responsiveness toward H2O2 and offered spectrally resolvable chemical shifts. We also provide strategies to bring the newly developed probe from the organic reaction solution into a biocompatible injection buffer and demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo 15N signal detection. The present work manifests its great potential not only for reaction based reactive sensing probes but also promises to serve as a platform to develop other contrast agents.

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Quality&#8208;Factor Wireless Masing Magnetic Resonance Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. RASER is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive NMR detectors. We show wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced from 75 up to 1,000,000 via parametric pumping via active&#8208;feedback technique for RASER applications at 300&#8197;MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional MR detector.







Abstract
It has recently been shown that a bolus of hyperpolarized nuclear spins can yield stimulated emission signals similar in nature to maser signals, potentially enabling new ways of sensing hyperpolarized contrast media, including most notably [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate that is under evaluation in over 50&#8197;clinical trials for metabolic imaging of cancer. The stimulated NMR signal emissions lasting for minutes do not require radio&#8208;frequency excitation, offering unprecedented advantages compared to conventional MR sensing. However, creating nuclear spin maser emission is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive MR detectors. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced 22&#8208;fold (to 1,670) via parametric pumping. This active&#8208;feedback technique breaks the intrinsic fundamental limit of NMR detector circuit quality factor. We show the use of parametric pumping to reduce the threshold requirement for inducing nuclear spin masing at 300&#8197;MHz resonance frequency in a preclinical MRI scanner. Indeed, stimulated emission from hyperpolarized protons was obtained under highly unfavorable conditions of low magnetic field homogeneity (T2* of 3&#8197;ms). Greater gains of the quality factor of the MR detector (up to 1&#8197;million) were also demonstrated.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Frameworks (SAFs): Shaping the Future of Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) emerge as a novel class of porous structures distinguished by their strategic use of non&#8208;covalent interactions. SAFs not only exhibit exceptional porosity, crystallinity, and structural stability, but also offer a solution to the limitations of MOFs and COFs caused by their dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics. This development represents a significant advance in porous material chemistry, opening avenues for new applications and research.







Abstract
Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) represent a new category of porous materials, utilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions, setting them apart from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This category includes but is not restricted to hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks and supramolecular organic frameworks. SAFs stand out for their outstanding porosity, crystallinity, and stability, alongside unique dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics that enable significant structural and functional modifications. Crucially, their non&#8208;covalent assembly strategies allow for a balanced manipulation of porosity, symmetry, crystallinity, and dimensions, facilitating the creation of advanced crystalline porous materials unattainable through conventional covalent or coordination bond synthesis. Despite their considerable promise in overcoming several limitations inherent to MOFs and COFs, particularly in terms of solution&#8208;processability, SAFs have received relatively little attention in recent literature. This Minireview aims to shed light on standout SAFs, exploring their design principles, synthesis strategies, and characterization methods. It emphasizes their distinctive features and the broad spectrum of potential applications across various domains, aiming to catalyze further development and practical application within the scientific community.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Structures of Anchor Sites to Achieve Zero&#8208;Valence Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Advanced Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping boron atoms with lower electronegativity into g&#8208;C3N4 can substantially change the local electronic structures at metal anchor sites to achieve zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high hydrogenation activity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have recently become highly attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions owing to their remarkably high selectivity. However, compared to their nanoparticle counterparts, atomically dispersed metal atoms in SACs often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. Here, by theoretical calculations, we show that tuning the local electronic structures of metal anchor sites on g&#8208;C3N4 by doping B atoms (BCN) with relatively lower electronegativity allows achieving zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high activity in H2 activation. The precise synthesis of Pd SACs on BCN supports with varied B contents substantiated the theoretical prediction. A zero&#8208;valence Pd1/BCN SAC was achieved on a BCN support with a relatively low B content. It exhibited much higher stability in a H2 reducing environment, and more strikingly, a hydrogenation activity, approximately 10 and 34&#8197;times greater than those high&#8208;valence Pd1/g&#8208;C3N4 and Pd1/BCN with a high B content, respectively.

         <title>Desymmetrization of Cyclic Sulfonimidamides by Asymmetric Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the desymmetrization of cyclic sulfonimidamides via a palladium catalyzed asymmetric allylation. The products are further elaborated to novel tricyclic ring systems containing a stereogenic sulfur center. Mechanistic insights to the origin of selectivity are highlighted through computational studies.







Abstract
Herein we report the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed approach to the enantioenriched synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides relying on commercially available palladium catalysts and ligands. High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was employed to identify the optimal catalyst system and solvent. The method is applied to a variety of saturated and unsaturated rings and exhibits the highest selectivity for 2&#8208;substituted allyl electrophiles. The products are further elaborated to complex, tricyclic scaffolds. DFT experiments presented herein highlight the key ligand substrate interactions leading to the high levels of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Selective Increase in CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Activity at Nanograin&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich Mixed Cu(I)/Cu(0) Sites via Enriching Co&#8208;Adsorbed CO and Hydroxyl Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ethylene generation pathway is usually thermodynamically preferred due to its lower activation energy barrier relative to ethanol product. Herein, we showed a method to high&#8208;efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion by enhancing the co&#8208;adsorption of *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species over a Cu2O&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment&#8208;like&#8221; structured boundaries.







Abstract
Selective producing ethanol from CO2 electroreduction is highly demanded, yet the competing ethylene generation route is commonly more thermodynamically preferred. Herein, we reported an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion (53.5&#8201;% faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) over an oxide&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment&#8208;like&#8221; structured grain&#8208;boundaries. The catalyst also attains a 23.2&#8201;% energy efficiency to ethanol within a flow cell reactor. In situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis identified that these dualphase Cu(I) and Cu(0) sites stabilized by grain&#8208;boundaries are very robust over the operating potential window, which maintains a high concentration of co&#8208;adsorbed *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species. Theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of *OHad not only promote the easier dimerization of *CO to form *OCCO (&#916;G~0.20&#8197;eV) at low overpotentials but also preferentially favor the key *CHCOH intermediate hydrogenation to *CHCHOH (ethanol pathway) while suppressing its dehydration to *CCH (ethylene pathway), which is believed to determine the remarkable ethanol selectivity. Such imperative intermediates associated with the bifurcation pathway were directly distinguished by isotope labelling in situ infrared spectroscopy. Our work promotes the understanding of bifurcating mechanism of CO2ER&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons more deeply, providing a feasible strategy for the design of efficient ethanol&#8208;targeted catalysts.

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photocatalyst for Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Couplings via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation using a metallaphotoredox approach is a key method for rapidly building molecular complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that graphitic carbon nitride, a heterogeneous semiconductor, can act as a suitable photocatalyst to induce decarboxylative bond formation. A broad scope of coupling partners is presented, in addition to photocatalyst recycling, analysis, and mechanistic investigations.







Abstract
The development of robust and reliable methods for the construction of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds is vital for accessing an increased array of structurally diverse scaffolds in drug discovery and development campaigns. While significant advances towards this goal have been achieved using metallaphotoredox chemistry, many of these methods utilise photocatalysts based on precious&#8208;metals due to their efficient redox processes and tuneable properties. However, due to the cost, scarcity, and toxicity of these metals, the search for suitable replacements should be a priority. Here, we show the use of commercially available heterogeneous semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as a photocatalyst, combined with nickel catalysis, for the cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halide and carboxylic acid coupling partners. gCN has been shown to engage in single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) and energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) processes for the formation of C&#8722;X bonds, and in this manuscript we overcome previous limitations to furnish C&#8722;C over C&#8722;O bonds using carboxylic acids. A broad scope of both aryl halides and carboxylic acids is presented, and recycling of the photocatalyst demonstrated. The mechanism of the reaction is also investigated.

         <title>Antigen Delivery Controlled by an On&#8208;Demand Photorelease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) shuttles peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for the loading of Major Histocompatibility Complex class&#8197;I (MHC&#8197;I) molecules. Here, we established an approach to precisely control antigen transport by light. Upon a photochemically induced &#8216;burst&#8217; of antigens, we investigated peptide translocation by single&#8208;organelle recordings within the native peptide loading complex (PLC) containing TAP.







Abstract
To eliminate infected and cancerous cells, antigen processing and presentation play a pivotal role through the recognition of antigenic peptides displayed on Major Histocompatibility Complex class&#8197;I (MHC&#8197;I) molecules. Here, we developed a photostimulated antigen release system that enables the temporal inception of antigen flux. Simple and effective photocaging of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#8208;Nef73&#8208;derived epitope, a representative high&#8208;affinity MHC&#8197;I ligand, was provided by steric hindrance to block the recognition by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) in the peptide loading complex (PLC). In response to light, a heteronomous release of antigens and subsequent translocation in various scenarios is demonstrated, including a TAP&#8208;related ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporter reconstituted in liposomes and the native PLC in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of human cells. The photochemically induced &#8216;burst&#8217; of antigens opens new opportunities for a mechanistic analysis of the antigen translocation machinery and will help to provide insights into antigen processing pathways via an on&#8208;demand, subcellular pulse&#8208;chase release of antigens.

         <title>Third Metal Ion Dictates the Catalytic Activity of the Two&#8208;Metal&#8208;Ion Pre&#8208;Ribosomal RNA&#8208;Processing Machinery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acid processing enzymes use a two&#8208;Mg2+&#8208;ion motif to promote the formation and cleavage of phosphodiester bonds. Yet, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of spatially conserved second&#8208;shell cations surrounding the catalytic architecture of proteinaceous and RNA&#8208;dependent enzymes. The RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) complex, which cleaves the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor at the A3 cleavage site to yield mature 5'&#8208;end of 5.8S rRNA, hosts in the catalytic core one atypically&#8208;located Mg2+ ion, in addition to the ions forming the canonical catalytic motif. Here, we employ biased quantum classical molecular dynamics simulations of RNase MRP to discover that the third Mg2+ ion inhibits the catalytic process. Instead, its displacement in favour of a second&#8208;shell monovalent K+ ion propels phosphodiester bond cleavage by enabling the formation of a specific hydrogen bonding network that mediates the essential proton transfer step. This study points to a direct involvement of a transient K+ ion in the catalytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond and implicates cation trafficking as a general mechanism in nucleic acid processing enzymes and ribozymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;Based Organic Semiconductor&#160;with Small Exciton Binding Energy via Molecular Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exciton binding energy (Eb) is understood as the energy required to dissociate an exciton in free&#8208;charge carriers, and is known to be an important parameter in determining the performance of organic opto&#8208;electronic devices. However, the development of a molecular design to achieve a small level of Eb in the solid state continues to lag behind. Here, to investigate the relationship between aggregation and Eb, star&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds DBC&#8208;RD and TPE&#8208;RD were developed using dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) and tetraphenylethylene (TPE). Theoretical calculations and physical measurements in solution showed no apparent differences between DBC&#8208;RD and TPE&#8208;RD, indicating that these molecules possess similar properties on a single&#8208;molecule level.&#160; By contrast, pristine films incorporating these molecules showed significantly different levels of electron affinity, ionization potential, and optical gap. Also, DBC&#8208;RD had a smaller Eb value of 0.24 eV compared with that of TPE&#8208;RD (0.42 eV). However, these molecules showed similar Eb values under dispersed conditions, which suggested that the decreased Eb of DBC&#8208;RD in pristine film is induced by molecular aggregation. By comparison with TPE&#8208;RD, DBC&#8208;RD showed superior performances in single&#8208;component organic solar cells and organic photocatalysts. These results indicate that a molecular design suitable for aggregation is important to decrease the Eb in films.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Baphicacanthcusine A Enabled by Sequential Ring Contractions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is the first total synthesis of the poly&#8208;pseudoindoxyl natural product baphicacanthcusine A. The synthesis leverages the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to pseudoindoxyls to install vicinal pseudoindoxyl heterocycles in a diastereoselective manner. Key steps include an acid&#8208;mediated cyclization/indole transposition, two diastereoselective oxidative ring contractions, and a site&#8208;selective C&#173;&#8211;H oxygenation. The synthesis of the oxidation precursors was guided by recognition of an element of hidden symmetry. This work provides a foundation for the chemical synthesis of other poly&#8208;pseudoindoxyl alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Flexible Phase Change Fibers for Intelligent Thermal Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the significant latent heat generated at constant temperatures, phase change fibers (PCFs) have recently received much attention in the field of wearable thermal management. However, the phase change materials involved in the existing PCFs still experience a solid&#8208;liquid transition process, severely restricting their practicality as wearable thermal management materials. Herein, we, for the first time, developed intrinsically flexible PCFs (polyethylene glycol/4,4'&#8208;methylenebis(cyclohexyl isocyanate) fibers, PMFs) through polycondensation and wet&#8208;spinning process, exhibiting an inherent solid&#8208;solid phase transition property, adjustable phase transition behaviors, and outstanding knittability. The PMFs also present superior mechanical strength (28 MPa), washability (&gt; 100 cycles), thermal cycling stability (&gt; 2000 cycles), facile dyeability, and heat&#8208;induced recoverability, all of which are highly significant for practical wearable applications. Additionally, the PMFs can be easily recycled by directly dissolving them in solvents for reprocessing, revealing promising applications as sustainable materials for thermal management. Most importantly, the applicability of the PMFs was demonstrated by knitting them into permeable fabrics, which exhibit considerably improved thermal management performance compared with the cotton fabric. The PMFs offer great potential for intelligent thermal regulation in smart textiles and wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>The Reconstruction of Bi 2 Te 4 O 11 &#160;Nanorods for Efficient and pH&#8208;universal Electrochemical CO 2 &#160;Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;practical application&#160;of electrochemical CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR) is hindered by the competing CO production, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and&#160;the lack of pH&#8208;universal catalysts. Here, Te&#8208;modified Bi nanorods (Te&#8208;Bi NRs) were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11&#160;NRs&#160;under the CO2RR condition. Our study illustrates that the complex reconstruction process of Bi2Te4O11&#160;NRs during CO2RR could be decoupled into three distinct steps, i.e., the destruction of Bi2Te4O11, the formation of Te/Bi phases, and the dissolution of Te. The thus&#8208;obtained Te&#8208;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate production, showing high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline).&#160;In a flow cell reactor under neutral, alkaline, or acidic conditions, the catalysts achieved HCOOH Faradaic efficiencies of up to 94.3%, 96.4%, and 91.0%, respectively, at a high current density of&#160;300 mA cm&#8208;2. DFT calculations, along with operando spectral measurements, reveal that Te manipulates the Bi sites to an electron&#8208;deficient state, enhancing the adsorption strength of the *OCHO intermediate,&#160;and significantly suppressing the competing HER and CO production. This study highlights the substantial influence of catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions and offers insights into designing highly active and stable electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption by Unconventional p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization over Porous High&#8208;entropy Alloy Metallene for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renewable electricity driven electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (C6H11NO) from cyclohexanone (C6H10O) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) is a promising alternative to traditional environment&#8208;unfriendly industrial technologies for green synthesis of C6H11NO. Precisely controlling the reaction pathway of the C6H10O/NOx&#8208;involved electrochemical reductive coupling reaction is crucial for selectively producing C6H11NO, which is yet still challenging. Herein, we report a porous high&#8208;entropy alloy PdCuAgBiIn metallene (HEA&#8208;PdCuAgBiInene) to boost the electrosynthesis of C6H11NO from C6H10O and nitrite, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (47.6%) and almost 100% yield under ambient conditions. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that unconventional orbital hybridization between d&#8208;block metals and p&#8208;block metals could regulate the local electronic structure of active sites and induce electron localization of electron&#8208;rich Pd sites, which tunes the active hydrogen supply and facilitates the generation and enrichment of key intermediates NH2OH* and C6H10O*, and efficiently promotes their C&#8722;N coupling to selectively produce C6H11NO.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Charge&#8208;carrier Dynamics and Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia Conversion on Antimony Sulfide&#8208;based Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoelectrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (PEC NO3RR) has emerged as a promising pathway for facilitating the natural nitrogen cycle. The PEC NO3RR can lower the reduction potential needed for ammonia synthesis through photogenerated voltage, showcasing the significant potential for merging abundant solar energy with sustainable nitrogen fixation. However, it is influenced by the selective photocathodes with poor carrier kinetics, low catalytic selectivity, and ammonia yields. There are few reports on suitable photoelectrodes owning efficient charge transport on PEC NO3RR at low overpotentials. Herein, we rationally constructed the CuSn alloy co&#8208;catalysts on the antimony sulfides with a highly selective PEC ammonia and an ultra&#8208;low onset potential (0.62 VRHE). CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3&#160;achieved an ammonia faradic efficiency of 97.82% at a low applied potential of 0.4 VRHE, and an ammonia yield of 16.96 &#181;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at 0 VRHE under one sun illumination. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 has an enhanced charge separation and transfer efficiency, facilitating photogenerated electrons to participate in PEC NO3RR quickly. Meanwhile, moderate NO2* adsorption on this photocathode optimizes the catalytic activity and increases the NH4+ yield. This work opens an avenue for designing sulfide&#8208;based photocathodes for the efficient route of solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Solid Electrolyte Interface via Dual Reaction Strategy for Highly Reversible Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ construction of solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) is an effective strategy to enhance the reversibility of zinc (Zn) anodes. However, in&#8208;situ SEI to afford high reversibility under high current density conditions (&#8805; 20 mA cm&#8722;2) is highly desired yet extremely challenging. Herein, we propose a dual reaction strategy of spontaneous electrostatic reaction and electrochemical decomposition for the in&#8208;situ construction of SEI, which is composed of organic&#8208;rich upper layer and inorganic&#8208;rich inner layer. Particularly, in&#8208;situ SEI performs as &#8220;growth binder" at small current density and &#8220;orientation regulator&#8221; at high current density, which significantly suppresses side reactions and dendrite growth. The in&#8208;situ SEI affords the record&#8208;breaking reversibility of Zn anode under practical conditions, Zn//Zn symmetric cells can stably cycle for over 1300 h and 400 h at current densities of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, showcasing an exceptional cumulative capacity of 67.5 Ah cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the practicality of this in&#8208;situ SEI is verified in Zn//PANI pouch cells with high mass loading of 25.48 mg cm&#8722;2. This work provides a universal strategy to design advanced SEI for practical Zn&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials: Transition from Carbonyl to Amide&#8208;Based Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzophenone skeletons containing a carbonyl unit (O=C) have been widely used as electron acceptors in the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Herein, we present a novel molecular design concept for TADF materials by transitioning from a carbonyl to an amide (O=C&#8211;N) skeleton as the acceptor. The amide unit, compared to its carbonyl counterpart, offers a more stable electronic configuration. Leveraging this insight, we have developed a series of high&#8208;performance TADF molecules based on benzoyl carbazole and carbazoline acceptors. These molecules exhibit exceptionally small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps and pronounced aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission properties, achieving photoluminescence quantum yields in neat films as high as 99%. Consequently, these materials serve as efficient emitters in non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;eimtting diodes (OLEDs), reaching a maximum quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of up to 26.0%, significantly higher than the 17.0% obtained with benzophenone acceptor&#8208;based TADF molecules. Additionally, they have been used as TADF hosts in narrowband red fluorescent OLEDs, setting a record&#8208;high EQEmax of 22.4%.</dc:description>

         <title>Mutualistic Synthesis from Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mutualisms are interactions that benefit all species involved. It has been widely investigated in neighbouring subjects, such as biology, ecology, sociology, and economics. However, such a reciprocal relationship in synthetic chemical systems has rarely been studied. Here, we demonstrate a mutualistic synthesis where byproducts from two orthogonal chemical reactions aid each other's production. Disulfide exchange and hydrazone exchange were chosen to generate two dynamic combinatorial libraries. A minor tetrameric macrocycle from the active disulfide library was quantitatively amplified in the presence of the hydrazone library. This incorporation also turned on the previously inert hydrazone reaction, producing a linear species that formed a &#8220;handcuffs&#8221; catenane with the disulfide tetramer. These findings not only lend robust support to the hypothesis of &#8220;RNA&#8208;peptide coevolution&#8221; for the origin of life but also broaden the scope of synthetic chemistry, highlighting the untapped potential of minor products from different reactions. Additionally, the co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly of these mutualistic entities to form supramolecular structures opens new avenues for future development of composite nanosystems with synergistic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Supramolecular Interactions in Host&#8208;Guest Complexation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest complexation offers a promising approach for mitigating surface defects in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Crown ethers are the most widely used macrocyclic hosts for complexing perovskite surfaces, yet their supramolecular interactions and functional implications require further understanding. Here we show that the dipole moment of crown ethers serves as an indicator of supramolecular interactions with both perovskites and precursor salts. A larger dipole moment, achieved through the substitution of heteroatoms, correlates with enhanced coordination with lead cations. Perovskite films incorporating aza&#8208;crown ethers as additives exhibited improved morphology, reduced defect densities, and better energy&#8208;level alignment compared to those using native crown ethers. We report power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25% for PSCs, which show enhanced long&#8208;term stability, and a record PCE of 21.5% for host&#8208;guest complexation&#8208;based perovskite solar modules with an active area of 14.0 cm2.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Highly Chiral 1T Molybdenum Disulfide Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality in inorganic nanostructures has recently stimulated the attention of many researchers, both to unravel fundamental questions on the origin of chirality in inorganic and hybrid materials, as well as to introduce novel promising properties that are originated by the symmetry breaking. MoS2 is one of the most investigated among the large family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. In particular, the metastable metallic 1T&#8208;MoS2 phase is of large interest for potential applications. However, due to thermodynamic reasons, the synthesis of 1T&#8208;MoS2 phase is quite challenging. Herein, we present the first synthesis of chiral 1T&#8208;MoS2 phase which shows remarkably high chiroptical activity with a g&#8208;factor up to 0.01. Chiral 1T&#8208;MoS2 was produced using tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to induce symmetry breaking during the material&#8217;s growth under hydrothermal conditions, leading to the formation of distorted hierarchical nanosheet assemblies exhibiting chiral morphology. Thorough optimization of the synthetic conditions was carried out to maximize chiroptical activity, which is strongly related to the nanostructures&#8217; morphology. Finally, the formation mechanism of the chiral 1T&#8208;MoS2 nanosheet assemblies was investigated, focusing on the role of molecular intermediates in the growth of the nanosheets and the transfer of chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Heterobenzylic Amines via Carbonyl Azinylative Amination</title>

         <dc:description>Transformations enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8217;&#8208;2&#8208;azinyl amines by addition of 2&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;based nucleophiles to in situ&#8208;generated and non&#8208;activated alkyl&#8208;substituted iminium ions are extremely rare. Approaches involving classical 2&#8208;azinyl organometallics, such as the corresponding Grignard reagents, often fail to produce the desired products. Here, we report an operationally straightforward solution to this problem through the development of a multicomponent coupling process wherein a soft 2&#8208;azinyl indium nucleophile, generated in situ from the corresponding 2&#8208;iodo heteroarene and indium powder, adds to an iminium ion that is also formed directly in the reaction. This modular carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2&#8208;azinyl nucleophile. Beyond the addition to iminium ions, the 2&#8208;azinyl addition to polyfluoromethyl ketones forms the corresponding tertiary alcohols. Together, the products of these reactions possess a high degree of functionality, are typically challenging to synthesize by other methods, and contain motifs recognized as privileged in the context of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Reproducing Reaction Mechanisms with Machine Learning Models Trained on a Large&#8208;Scale Mechanistic Dataset</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic understanding of organic reactions can facilitate reaction development, impurity prediction, and in principle, reaction discovery. While several machine learning models have sought to address the task of predicting reaction products, their extension to predicting reaction mechanisms has been impeded by the lack of a corresponding mechanistic dataset. In this study, we construct such a dataset by imputing intermediates between experimentally reported reactants and products using expert reaction templates and train several machine learning models on the resulting dataset of 5,184,184 elementary steps. We explore the performance and capabilities of these models, focusing on their ability to predict reaction pathways and recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of mechanistic models in predicting impurities, often overlooked by conventional models. We conclude by evaluating the generalizability of mechanistic models to new reaction types, revealing challenges related to dataset diversity, consecutive predictions, and violations of atom conservation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mechanistic understanding of organic reactions can facilitate reaction development, impurity prediction, and in principle, reaction discovery. While several machine learning models have sought to address the task of predicting reaction products, their extension to predicting reaction mechanisms has been impeded by the lack of a corresponding mechanistic dataset. In this study, we construct such a dataset by imputing intermediates between experimentally reported reactants and products using expert reaction templates and train several machine learning models on the resulting dataset of 5,184,184 elementary steps. We explore the performance and capabilities of these models, focusing on their ability to predict reaction pathways and recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of mechanistic models in predicting impurities, often overlooked by conventional models. We conclude by evaluating the generalizability of mechanistic models to new reaction types, revealing challenges related to dataset diversity, consecutive predictions, and violations of atom conservation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Cyclopropene to Housane Derivatives Via Intramolecular Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of housanes derivatives from cyclopropenes is described. Under rhodium(II) catalysis, cyclopropenylvinyl carbinols can regioselectively generate a carbene intermediate which undergo an intramolecular cyclopropanation to form a housane, a skeleton with similar ring strain as the cyclopropene precursor. The procedure shows a remarkable broad scope and efficiency. Moreover, the method served to prepare man&#8208;made housane&#8208;containing terpene derivatives, which are not accessible by Nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd&#8208;CeOx Nanoparticles in Zeolite Nanosheets for Efficient CO2&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Storage and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation to FA/formate represent promising methodologies for the efficient and clean storage and release of hydrogen, forming a CO2&#8208;neutral energy cycle. Here, we report the synthesis of highly dispersed and stable bimetallic Pd&#8208;based nanoparticles, immobilized on self&#8208;pillared silicalite&#8208;1 (SP&#8208;S&#8208;1) zeolite nanosheets using an incipient wetness co&#8208;impregnation technique. Owing to the highly accessible active sites, effective mass transfer, exceptional hydrophilicity, and the synergistic effect of the bimetallic species, the optimized PdCe0.2/SP&#8208;S&#8208;1 catalyst demonstrated unparalleled catalytic performance in both FA dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation to formate. Remarkably, it achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 5974 molH2 molPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a formate production rate of 536 molformate molPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at 50 &#176;C, surpassing most previously reported heterogeneous catalysts under similar conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the interfacial effect between Pd and cerium oxide clusters substantially reduces the activation barriers for both reactions, thereby increasing the catalytic performance. Our research not only showcases a compelling application of zeolite nanosheet&#8208;supported bimetallic nanocatalysts in CO2&#8208;mediated hydrogen storage and release but also contributes valuable insights towards the development of safe, efficient, and sustainable hydrogen technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;Membered Ring&#8208;Embedded Cycloarene Enabling Anti&#8208;Aromaticity and Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of fully fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated cycloarenes embedded nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene (MF2) was designed and synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond&#8208;linked chiral macrocycle MS2 without two fused four&#8208;membered rings and its linear&#8208;shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer L1 were also synthesized. The pronounced anti&#8208;aromaticity of four&#8208;membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66% and 10.74% for L1 and MS2, respectively, to 54.05% for MF2, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded four&#8208;membered rings that reduce structural displacements, MF2 exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 7 nm (0.038 eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra&#8208;narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks Consisting of Tetraborate Nodes and Flexible Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials with many applications, such as carbon capture, molecular separation, catalysis, and energy storage. Traditionally, flexible building blocks have been avoided due to their potential to disrupt ordered structures. Recent studies have demonstrated intriguing properties and enhanced structural diversity achievable with flexible components by judicious selection of building blocks. This study presents a novel series of ionic COFs (ICOFs) consisting of tetraborate nodes and flexible linkers. These ICOFs use borohydrides to irreversibly deprotonate the alcohol monomers to achieve a high polymerization degree. Structural analysis confirms the dia topologies. Reticulation is explored using various monomers and metal counter&#8208;ions. Also, these frameworks exhibit excellent stability in alcohols and coordinating solvents. The materials are tested as single&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;state electrolytes. ICOF&#8208;203&#8208;Li displays one of the lowest activation energies reported for ion conduction. This tetraborate chemistry is anticipated to facilitate further structural diversity and functionality in crystalline polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Steam&#8208;Assisted Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol over Ru&#8208;In Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent catalysts can be designed to synergistically combine reaction intermediates at interfacial active sites, but restructuring makes systematic control and understanding of such dynamics challenging. We here unveil how reducibility and mobility of indium oxide species in Ru&#8208;based catalysts crucially control the direct, selective conversion of CO2 to ethanol. When uncontrolled, reduced indium oxide species occupy the Ru surface, leading to deactivation. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8208;In2O3 interface sites are stabilized, and ethanol can be produced with superior overall selectivity (70%, rest CO). Our work highlights how engineering of bifunctional active ensembles enables cooperativity and synergy at tailored interfaces, which unlocks unprecedented performance in heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonate Ester&#8208;Based Sodium Metal Battery with High&#8208;Capacity Retention at &#8722;50&#176;C Enabled by Weak Solvents and Electrodeposited Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have received increasing attention due to the abundant sodium resources and high energy density, but suffered from the sluggish interfacial kinetic and unstable plating/stripping of sodium anode at low temperature, especially when matched with ester electrolytes. Here, we develop a stable ultra&#8208;low&#8208;temperature SMBs with high&#8208;capacity retention at &#8722;50&#176;C in a weak solvated carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolyte, combined with an electrodeposited Na (Cu/Na) anode. The Cu/Na anode with electrochemically activated &#8220;deposited sodium&#8221; and stable inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was favor for the fast Na+ migration, therefore accelerating the interfacial kinetic process. As a result, the Cu/Na || NaCrO2 battery exhibited the highest capacity retention (compared to room&#8208;temperature capacity) in carbonate ester&#8208;based SMBs (98.05% at &#8722;25&#176;C, 91.3% at &#8722;40&#176;C, 87.9% at &#8722;50&#176;C, respectively). The cyclic stability of 350 cycles at &#8722;25&#176;C with a high energy efficiency of 96.15% and 70 cycles at &#8722;50&#176;C can be achieved. Even in chill atmospheric environment with the fluctuant temperature, the battery can still operate over one month. This work provides a new opportunity for the development of low&#8208;temperature carbonate ester&#8208;based SMBs.</dc:description>

Abstract
Xanthene&#8208;backbone FLPs featuring secondary borane functions &#8722;B(ArX)H (where ArX=C6F5 (ArF) or C6Cl5 (ArCl)) have been targeted through reactions of the dihydroboranes Me2S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BArXH2 with [4,5&#8208;xanth(PR2)Li]2 (R=Ph, iPr), and investigated in the synthesis of related cationic systems via hydride abstraction. The reactivity of these systems (both cationic and charge neutral) with ammonia have been probed, with a view to probing the potential for proton shuttling via N&#8722;H bond &#8216;activation.&#8217; We find that in the case of four&#8208;coordinate boron systems (cationic or change neutral), the N&#8722;H linkage remains intact, supported by a NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P hydrogen bond which is worth up to 17&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 thermodynamically, and enabled by planarization of the flexible xanthene scaffold. For cationic three coordinate systems, N&#8208;to&#8208;P proton transfer is viable, driven by the ability of the boron centre to stabilise the [NH2]&#8722; conjugate base through N&#8208;to&#8208;B &#960; bonding. This proton transfer can be shown to be reversible in the presence of excess ammonia, depending on the nature of the B&#8208;bound ArX group. It is viable in the case of C6F5 substituents, but is prevented by the more sterically encumbering and secondary donor&#8208;stabilising capabilities of the C6Cl5 substituent.

         <title>Interfacial Domino Effect Triggered by &#946;&#8208;Alanine Cations Realized Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;ionized Ala+ cations trigger a domino effect after electrostatic adsorption at IHP. The electrostatic shielding regulates crystal energetic preference and realizes crystallographic optimization. The moderative electro&#8208;reduction kinetics caused by the adsorbed Ala+ realize the balance between interfacial consumption rate of Zn2+ ions and mass transfer rate, restrains the formation of concentration polarization and anion&#8208;depleted boundary.







Abstract
Realizing durative dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and no by&#8208;product deposition configuration on Zn anodes is crucial to solving the short circuit and premature failure of batteries, which is simultaneously determined by the Zn interface chemistry, electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, mass transfer process, and their interaction. Herein, this work unmasks a domino effect of the &#946;&#8208;alanine cations (Ala+) within the hydrogel matrix, which effectively triggers the subsequent electrostatic shielding and beneficial knock&#8208;on effects via the specifical adsorption earliest event on the Zn anode surface. The electrostatic shielding effect regulates the crystallographic energetic preference of Zn deposits and retards fast electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, thereby steering stacked stockier block morphology and realizing crystallographic optimization. Meanwhile, the mass transfer rate of Zn2+ ions was accelerated via the SO42&#8722; anion immobilized caused by Ala+ in bulk electrolyte, finally bringing the balance between electroreduction kinetics and mass transfer process, which enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition behavior. Concomitantly, the interfacial adsorbed Ala+ cations facilitate the electrochemical reduction of interfacial SO42&#8722; anions to form the inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase layer. The above domino effects immensely improve the utilization efficiency of Zn anodes and long&#8208;term stability, as demonstrated by the 12&#8197;times longer life of Zn||Zn cells (3650&#8197;h) and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (99.4&#8201;%).

         <title>SERS Detection of Trace Carcinogenic Aromatic Amines Based on Amorphous MoO3 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers exhibit high SERS performance due to the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic effect. It is capable of trace detection and identification of carcinogenic aromatic amines with good uniformity, acid resistance and thermal stability, which is of great significance for reducing cancer risk.







Abstract
Aromatic amines are important commercial chemicals, but their carcinogenicity poses a threat to humans and other organisms, making their rapid quantitative detection increasingly urgent. Here, amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in the visible region are designed for the trace detection of carcinogenic aromatic amine molecules. The hot&#8208;electron fast decay component of a&#8208;MoO3 decreases from 301&#8197;fs to 150&#8197;fs after absorption with methyl orange (MO) molecules, indicating the plasmon&#8208;induced hot&#8208;electron transfer (PIHET) process from a&#8208;MoO3 to MO. Therefore, a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers present high SERS performance due to the synergistic effect of electromagnetic enhancement (EM) and PIHET, proposing the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic mechanism in a&#8208;MoO3. In addition, a&#8208;MoO3 possesses higher electron delocalization and electronic state density than crystal MoO3 (c&#8208;MoO3), which is conducive to the PIHET. The limit of detection (LOD) for o&#8208;aminoazotoluene (o&#8208;AAT) is 10&#8722;9&#8197;M with good uniformity, acid resistance, and thermal stability. In this work, trace detection and identification of various carcinogenic aromatic amines based on a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers is realized, which is of great significance for reducing cancer infection rates.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal comb cells of honeybees can be mimicked by assembling nanoscale molecular cylinders as reported by Hiroyuki Isobe et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406502). The molecular honeycomb encapsulated various guests with 32 different structures, which were further diversified by 6 substituents, 3 stereochemistries and 2 intercalants. Although weak CH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds were used to assemble the cylinders, the 2D crystal was grown up to the centimeter scale, allowing for mechanical exfoliation.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Chiral Tetrakis Eu(III) Complexes with Ammonium Cations for Improved Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations, as reported by Yasuchika Hasegawa et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202405584). The maximum gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. The CPL brightness of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of previous chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs+.

&lt;p&gt;A large dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations, as reported by Yasuchika Hasegawa et&#8197;al in their Communication (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202405584"&gt;e202405584&lt;/a&gt;). The maximum gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. The CPL brightness of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of previous chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Plastic and Biomass&#8208;Derived Polyols to Formamide under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an electrocatalytic strategy to upgrade plastic and biomass to formamide in the presence of NH3 over a WO3 catalyst under ambient conditions. Facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, the C&#8722;C bond in PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol and biomass&#8208;derived polyols were effectively cleaved with C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic upgrading of wasted plastic and renewable biomass represents a sustainable method to produce chemicals but is limited to carbohydrates, leaving other value&#8208;added chemicals, such as organonitrogen compounds, being scarcely explored. Herein, we reported an electrocatalytic oxidation strategy to transform polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) and biomass&#8208;derived polyols into formamide, in the presence of ammonia (NH3) over a tungsten oxide (WO3) catalyst. Taking EG&#8208;to&#8208;formamide as an example, we achieved a high formamide productivity of 537.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with FE of 43.2&#8201;% at a constant current of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow electrolyzer with 12&#8208;h test, representing a more advantageous performance compared with previous reports for formamide electrosynthesis. Mechanistic understanding revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond in the EG was facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, with resultant C&#8722;N bond construction and eventually formamide production. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to transformation of PET bottle and a series of biomass&#8208;derived polyols with carbon number from three (glycerol) to six (glucose), producing formamide with high efficiencies. This work demonstrates a sustainable upgrading strategy of plastic and biomass that may have implications to more value&#8208;added chemicals production beyond carbohydrates.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase&#8208;Supported Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Analysis of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic synthesis has been successfully performed producing the longest homogeneous chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycopeptides to date. Compared to more traditional chemical synthesis, this new strategy was much more efficient, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80&#8201;%. The availability of well&#8208;defined CS glycopeptides enabled the study of the impacts of sulfation on glycopeptide structures and functions.







Abstract
Proteoglycans (PGs), consisting of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked with the core protein through a tetrasaccharide linkage region, play roles in many important biological events. The chemical synthesis of PG glycopeptides is extremely challenging. In this work, the enzymes required for synthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS) PG (CSPG) have been expressed and the suitable sequence of enzymatic reactions has been established. To expedite CSPG synthesis, the peptide acceptor was immobilized on solid phase and the glycan units were directly installed enzymatically onto the peptide. Subsequent enzymatic chain elongation and sulfation led to the successful synthesis of CSPG glycopeptides. The CS dodecasaccharide glycopeptide was the longest homogeneous CS glycopeptide synthesized to date. The enzymatic synthesis was much more efficient than the chemical synthesis of the corresponding CS glycopeptides, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80&#8201;%. The structures of the CS glycopeptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis and NMR studies. In addition, the interactions between the CS glycopeptides and cathepsin G were studied. The sulfation of glycan chain was found to be important for binding with cathepsin G. This efficient chemoenzymatic strategy opens new avenues to investigate the structures and functions of PGs.

         <title>Biocatalytic Nucleobase Diversification of 4&#8242;&#8208;Thionucleosides and Application of Derived 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine for RNA Synthesis Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
A synergistic platform towards 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides is presented that enables both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This approach delivers entry to pyrimidine and purine 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides, and chemoenzymatic synthesis provided 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine as a novel nucleoside probe to monitor RNA synthesis.







Abstract
Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have proven to be transformative in the treatment of viral infections and cancer. One branch of structural modification to deliver new nucleoside analogue classes explores replacement of canonical ribose oxygen with a sulfur atom. Whilst biological activity of such analogues has been shown in some cases, widespread exploration of this compound class is hitherto hampered by the lack of a straightforward and universal nucleobase diversification strategy. Herein, we present a synergistic platform enabling both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process, and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This methodology delivers entry across pyrimidine and purine 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides, paving a way for wider synthetic and biological exploration. We exemplify our approach by enzymatic synthesis of 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine on multi&#8208;milligram scale and from here switch to complete chemical synthesis of a novel nucleoside analogue probe, 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this probe to monitor RNA synthesis in proliferating HeLa cells, validating its capability as a new metabolic RNA labelling tool.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monitoring nutrient uptake in cells has been very difficult to date due to fluorophore artefacts. In their Research Article (e202401733), Sander&#8197;I. van&#8197;Kasteren et&#8197;al. report a new way of monitoring nutrient uptake. They developed a CFSE&#8208;based dual&#8208;quenched probe that becomes fluorogenic in the cytosol, and fluorescent when it reacts with incumbent nutrients labelled with click&#8208;reactive nutrients. The cover image was made by Dr. Kim Wals of KW Science Art using glass beads, embroidery silks and felt, with each individually knotted bead representative of a cellular component or molecular mechanism from the highlighted paper.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Amino Acid Building Blocks for Bioorthogonal Peptide Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids (NPAAs) containing hypervalent iodine reagents &#8208;ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs)&#8208; is described. These NPAAs were compatible with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution peptide synthesis (SPS), allowing the introduction of reactive handles on specific sites in the presence of multiple identical residues. The obtained peptide&#8208;EBXs can be applied to the synthesis of cyclic peptides with unique topological properties.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EB(X)xs) reagents have emerged as useful reagents for peptide/protein modification due to their versatile reactivity and high selectivity. Herein, we report the successful introduction of ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs) on different amino acid building blocks (Lys/Orn/Dap), and show their compatibility with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution phase peptide synthesis (SPS). The selective incorporation of the EBx core into peptide sequences enable efficient macrocyclizations under mild conditions for the synthesis of topologically unique cyclic and bicyclic peptides.

&lt;p&gt;The development of non-proteogenic amino acids (NPAAs) containing hypervalent iodine reagents -ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs)- is described. These NPAAs were compatible with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution peptide synthesis (SPS), allowing the introduction of reactive handles on specific sites in the presence of multiple identical residues. The obtained peptide-EBXs can be applied to the synthesis of cyclic peptides with unique topological properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EB(X)xs) reagents have emerged as useful reagents for peptide/protein modification due to their versatile reactivity and high selectivity. Herein, we report the successful introduction of ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs) on different amino acid building blocks (Lys/Orn/Dap), and show their compatibility with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution phase peptide synthesis (SPS). The selective incorporation of the EBx core into peptide sequences enable efficient macrocyclizations under mild conditions for the synthesis of topologically unique cyclic and bicyclic peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atom Sites with the Irving&#8211;Williams Series for the Simultaneous Co&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and CH3CHO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to engineer single&#8208;atom sites from d5 to d10, the Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the highest stability and fastest charge&#8208;transfer efficiency. As predicted, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits a higher activity towards the photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs.







Abstract
The bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal single sites and supports originate from crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE). The 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms of the spontaneous geometrical distortions, that is the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, can alter CFSE, thereby leading to the Irving&#8211;Williams series. However, engineering single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) using the Irving&#8211;Williams series as an ideal guideline has not been reported to date. Herein, alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline frameworks (CPFs) with phenanthroline units are developed to anchor the desired 3d single metal ions from d5 to d10 (Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+). The Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms and phenanthroline units. To verify this, theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits higher stability and faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs. As expected, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs demonstrates a high photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity (~30.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and an exceptional photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH activity (~24.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1). Interestingly, the generated *O2&#8722; is derived from the process of CO2 reduction, thereby triggering a CH3CHO oxidation reaction. This work provides a novel design concept for designing SASs by the Irving&#8211;Williams to regulate the catalytic performances.

         <title>Lithium Borate Polycarbonates for High&#8208;Capacity Solid&#8208;State Composite Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More elastic, softer, lithium borate substituted polycarbonates show higher ionic conductivity than counterparts with more rigid structures. These leading polymers are used as binders in composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich cathode, sulfide solid electrolyte and carbon. The cells show higher capacity and excellent retention of capacity over 300&#8197;charge/discharge cycles at a commercially realistic 1&#8197;MPa applied pressure.







Abstract
Improving composite cathode function is key to the success of the solid&#8208;state battery. Maximizing attainable cathode capacity and retention requires integrating suitable polymeric binders that retain a sufficiently high ionic conductivity and long&#8208;term chemo&#8208;mechanical stability of the cathode active material&#8208;solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;carbon mixture. Herein, we report block copolymer networks composed of lithium borate polycarbonates and poly(ethylene oxide) that improved the capacity (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and capacity retention (94&#8201;% over 300&#8197;cycles) of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode active material, Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte, and carbon. Tetrahedral B(OR)2(OH)2&#8722; anions immobilized on the polycarbonate segments provide hydrogen&#8208;bonding chain crosslinking and selective Li&#8208;counterion conductivity, parameterized by Li&#8208;ion transference numbers close to unity (tLi+~0.94). With 90&#8197;wt&#8201;% polycarbonate content and a flexible low glass transition temperature backbone, the single&#8208;ion conductors achieved high Li&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The work should inform future binder design for improving the processability of cathode composites towards commercializing solid&#8208;state batteries, and allow use in other cell configurations, such as lithium&#8208;sulphur cathode designs.

         <title>Force Transduction Through Distant Force&#8208;Bearing Regioisomeric Linkages Affects the Mechanochemical Reactivity of Cyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of mechanochemical reactivity is important for designing new mechanophores. Besides the core structure of mechanophores, substituents on a mechanophore can affect its mechanochemical reactivity through electronic stabilization of the intermediate or effectiveness of force transduction from the polymer backbone to the mechanophore. The latter factor represents a unique mechanical effect in considering polymer mechanochemistry. Here, we show that regioisomeric linkage that is not directly adjacent to the first cleaving bond in cyclobutane can still significantly affect the mechanochemical reactivity of the mechanophore. We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers. The observed difference in reactivity can be rationalized as the much more effective force transduction to the scissile bond through the p&#8208;position than the other two substitution positions. These findings point to the importance of considering force&#8208;bearing linkages that are more distant from the bond to be cleaved when incorporating mechanophores into polymer backbones.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced dynamic metal nanocrystal/semiconductor interfaces during carbon dioxide electroreduction were investigated by utilizing synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, as reported by Hao Ming Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202403333). The dynamic structural transformations of metal/semiconductor junction under illumination result in an intriguing selectivity switch and realize an improvement of at least 16&#8208;fold in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Oxidation of Alcohols in Gold&#8208;Coated Milling Vessels via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovating in selective alcohol oxidation, our study unveils a gold&#8208;catalyzed direct mechanocatalytic approach, boasting &gt;95&#8201;% aldehyde conversion with &lt;0.3&#8201;% overoxidation and minimal gold abrasion. Optimized parameters ensure efficiency and sustainability across alcohols, with high catalyst reusability. XPS surface analysis of the gold milling balls highlight the oxidation mechanism and its potential in green chemistry.







Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for the selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes through direct mechanocatalysis, employing a gold&#8208;coated milling vessel as catalyst and air as the oxidation agent. By adjusting milling frequency, media, and duration, high catalytic efficiencies and selectivities are achieved. Remarkably, yields of up to 99&#8201;% are obtained for specific substrates, with a turnover number (TON) of 8200 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.77&#8197;s&#8722;1, surpassing existing alternatives. Confirmation of the catalytic reaction indeed occurring on the milling tool surface was achieved through X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic cyclopropanation reactions are demonstrated in the Research Article (e202403485) by Koji Oohora, Takashi Hayashi et&#8197;al. using myoglobins reconstituted with artificial cofactors with various redox potentials. The cover image illustrates this catalysis by showing two types of protein&#8208;based trucks carrying rice ears (starting material) to produce rice sacks (product). The elevation profiles of the routes represent the differences in the reaction energy at the active center for each cofactor. Representative artificial cofactors are shown as stick&#8208;and&#8208;ball models.

         <title>Catalytic Nitrogen Fixation Using Well&#8208;Defined Molecular Catalysts under Ambient or Mild Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalysts to convert N2 into NH3 under ambient reaction conditions, where involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer has been effective for high catalytic activity. Direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic NH3 formation, selective catalytic hydrazine formation, and catalytic C&#8722;Si or C&#8722;N bond formation have been also established.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is industrially produced from dinitrogen (N2) and dihydrogen (H2) by the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, although H2 is prepared from fossil fuels, and the reaction requires harsh conditions. On the other hand, microorganisms have fixed nitrogen under ambient reaction conditions. Recently, well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalyst to convert N2 into NH3 by reactions with chemical reductants and proton sources under ambient reaction conditions. Among them, involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer is found to be very effective for high catalytic activity. Furthermore, direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conversions of N2 into NH3 have been recently achieved. In addition to catalytic formation of NH3, selective catalytic conversion of N2 into hydrazine (NH2NH2) and catalytic silylation of N2 into silylamines have been reported. Catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation has been more recently established to afford cyanate anion (NCO&#8722;) under ambient reaction conditions. Further development of direct conversion of N2 into nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds as well as green ammonia synthesis leading to the use of ammonia as an energy carrier is expected.

         <title>Amorphous MnRuOx Containing Microcrystalline for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimal amorphous MnRuOx and RuO2 crystalline heterostructures are critical in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the acidic OER. The microcrystalline regions in the catalyst serve as a supporting framework, while the amorphous phase fills the microcrystalline interstices, thus providing substantial defects and active sites at the interfaces to facilitate efficient adsorption/conversion of OH&#8722; and charge transfer.







Abstract
Compared to Ir, Ru&#8208;based catalysts often exhibited higher activity but suffered significant and rapid activity loss during the challenging oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a corrosive acidic environment. Herein, we developed a hybrid MnRuOx catalyst in which the RuO2 microcrystalline regions serve as a supporting framework, and the amorphous MnRuOx phase fills the microcrystalline interstices. In particular, the MnRuOx&#8208;300 catalyst from an annealing temperature of 300&#8201;&#176;C contains an optimal amorphous/crystalline heterostructure, providing substantial defects and active sites, facilitating efficient adsorption and conversion of OH&#8722;. In addition, the heterostructure leads to a relative increase of the d&#8208;band center close to the Fermin level, thus accelerating electron transfer with reduced charge transfer resistance at the active interface between crystalline and amorphous phases during the OER. The catalyst was further thoroughly evaluated under various operating conditions and demonstrated exceptional activity and stability for the OER, representing a promising solution to replace Ir in water electrolyzers.

         <title>LiF&#8208;Rich Alloy&#8208;Doped SEI Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and High&#8208;Rate Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;donating feature of the spontaneously formed Li&#8722;Au alloy promotes the directional decomposition of LiTFSI to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped composite functional SEI layer, which is more conducive to the rapid and uniform transport of Li ions, and a high&#8208;rate dendrite&#8208;free stable anode interface was obtained.







Abstract
Li metal is regarded as the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; in the next generation of anode materials due to its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, sluggish Li ions interfacial transport kinetics and uncontrollable Li dendrites growth limit practical application of the energy storage system in high&#8208;power device. Herein, separators are modified by the addition of a coating, which spontaneously grafts onto the Li anode interface for in situ lithiation. The resultant alloy possessing of strong electron&#8208;donating property promotes the decomposition of lithium bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide in the electrolyte to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. High ionic alloy solid solution diffusivity and electric field dispersion modulation accelerate Li ions transport and uniform stripping/plating, resulting in a high&#8208;power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode interface. Surprisingly, the formulated SEI layer achieves an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 8000&#8197;h (20,000&#8197;cycles) for symmetric cells at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It also ensures that the NCM(811)//PP@Au//Li full cell at ultra&#8208;high currents (40&#8197;C) completes the charging/discharging process in only 68&#8197;s to provide high capacity of 151&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The results confirm that this scalable strategy has great development potential in realizing high power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode.

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate with high permanent dipole moments effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, forming a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+ and improved interfacial characteristics of electrodes, thus improving the Zn plating/stripping reversibility.







Abstract
The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor primary solvation sheath and inner&#8208;Helmholtz configurations for robust zinc anode. Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Thus, interfacial side reactions can be suppressed through a shielding effect. Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10 cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.

         <title>Re&#8208;Engineering Fungal Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases by Module Dissection and Duplicated Thiolation Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is presented to dissect fungal nonribosomal peptide synthetases into &#8220;splitting unit&#8221; pairs (SUPs). Collaboration in SUPs is facilitated by artificial duplication of the thiolation domain and its linkers, and an optimized split site. The productivities of SUPs match or exceed those of the corresponding single&#8208;subunit chimeras or even those of native fungal enzymes, boding well for generating novel peptide natural product analogues.







Abstract
Unnatural product (uNP) nonribosomal peptides promise to be a valuable source of pharmacophores for drug discovery. However, the extremely large size and complexity of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes pose formidable challenges to the production of such uNPs by combinatorial biosynthesis and synthetic biology. Here we report a new NRPS dissection strategy that facilitates the engineering and heterologous production of these NRPSs. This strategy divides NRPSs into &#8220;splitting units&#8221;, each forming an enzyme subunit that contains catalytically independent modules. Functional collaboration between the subunits is then facilitated by artificially duplicating, at the N&#8208;terminus of the downstream subunit, the linker &#8208; thiolation domain &#8208; linker fragment that is resident at the C&#8208;terminus of the upstream subunit. Using the suggested split site that follows a conserved motif in the linker connecting the adenylation and the thiolation domains allows cognate or chimeric splitting unit pairs to achieve productivities that match, and in many cases surpass those of hybrid chimeric enzymes, and even those of intact NRPSs, upon production in a heterologous chassis. Our strategy provides facile options for the rational engineering of fungal NRPSs and for the combinatorial reprogramming of nonribosomal peptide production.

         <title>Glycol Monomethyl Ether&#8208;Substituted Carbazolyl Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency of 25.52&#8201;%</title>

A novel hole&#8208;transporting material [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) is synthesized by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) at carbazolyl unit, which facilitates the spreading of perovskite, has well matching energy band with perovskite, suppresses defects and releases residual stress at buried interface of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Consequently, GM&#8208;4PACz&#8208;based IPSCs engender a high efficiency of 25.52&#8201;% and an excellent operational stability.







Abstract
Organic self&#8208;assembled molecules (OSAMs) based hole&#8208;transporting materials play a pivotal role in achieving highly efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, the reported carbazol&#8208;based OSAMs have serious drawbacks, such as poor wettability for perovskite solution spreading due to the nonpolar surface, worse matched energy arrangement with perovskite, and limited molecular species, which greatly limit the device performance. To address above problems, a novel OSAM [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) was synthesized as hole&#8208;transporting material by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) side chains at carbazolyl unit. GM groups enhance the surface energy of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/SAM substrate to facilitate the nucleation and growth of up perovskite film, suppress cation defects, release the residual stress at SAM/perovskite interface, and evaluate energy level for matching with perovskite. Consequently, the GM&#8208;4PACz based IPSC achieves a champion PCE of 25.52&#8201;%, a respectable open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.21&#8197;V, a high stability, possessing 93.29&#8201;% and 91.75&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after aging in air for 2000&#8197;h or tracking at maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h, respectively.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neighbouring synergy in high&#8208;density Ir single atoms for alkaline electrocatalytic oxygen evolution is described by Chuanyi Jia, Zhirong Zhang, and Jun Bao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404418). The neighbouring Ir single atoms stabilize the *OOH intermediates via additional hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thus significantly reducing the reaction energy barriers compared to isolated Ir single atoms. The discovery of the synergetic interaction in neighbouring Ir single atoms offers guidance for developing efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>One&#8208;Handed Covalent Helical Ladder Polymers: The Dawn of a Tailorable Class of Chiral Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent, one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers can be programmably obtained through chirality&#8208;assisted&#8208;synthesis (CAS) using synergically non&#8208;planar chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated synthons and ladder polymer chemistry.







Abstract
In the last decades, chemists have developed methods to synthesize helical molecular architectures using a combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. Very recently, the new class of completely covalent, one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers has vigorously emerged. Such polymers can be rationally and programmably obtained through an approach guided by the principles of chirality&#8208;assisted&#8208;synthesis (CAS) and making use synergically of two disciplines that have so far rarely interacted: non&#8208;planar chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated synthons and ladder polymer chemistry. The precise programmability of the 3D structure and new mechanical and chiroptical properties will lead to potential applications in areas such as enantiorecognition, catalysis, spintronics and chiral&#8208;related optoelectronics. This minireview examines the emerging field of one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers, analyzing their synthesis, applications, and limitations.

&lt;p&gt;In the last decades, chemists have developed methods to synthesize helical molecular architectures using a combination of covalent and non-covalent interactions. Very recently, the new class of completely covalent, one-handed helical ladder polymers has vigorously emerged. Such polymers can be rationally and programmably obtained through an approach guided by the principles of &lt;i&gt;chirality-assisted-synthesis&lt;/i&gt; (CAS) and making use synergically of two disciplines that have so far rarely interacted: non-planar chiral &#960;-conjugated synthons and ladder polymer chemistry. The precise programmability of the 3D structure &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; new mechanical and chiroptical properties will lead to potential applications in areas such as enantiorecognition, catalysis, spintronics and chiral-related optoelectronics. This minireview examines the emerging field of one-handed helical ladder polymers, analyzing their synthesis, applications, and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation, Structure and Reactivity of a Beryllium(0) Complex with Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722; Bond Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging low&#8208;valent MgI and BeI chemistry, a unique complex with a Mg&#8722;Be bond was isolated and structurally characterized. Formally a MgII&#8722;Be0 complex, the bond is significantly polarized Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722;. Despite this polarity, the complex is thermally stable and only reacts with polar unsaturated C=O, C=S or N=N bonds.







Abstract
Attempts to create a novel Mg&#8722;Be bond by reaction of [(DIPePBDI*)MgNa]2 with Be[N(SiMe3)2]2 failed; DIPePBDI*=HC[(tBu)C=N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP=2,6&#8208;Et2C&#8208;phenyl. Even at elevated temperatures, no conversion was observed. This is likely caused by strong steric shielding of the Be center. A similar reaction with the more open Cp*BeCl gave in quantitative yield (DIPePBDI*)MgBeCp* (1). The crystal structure shows a Mg&#8722;Be bond of 2.469(4)&#8197;&#197;. Homolytic cleavage of the Mg&#8722;Be bond requires &#916;H=69.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (cf. CpBe&#8722;BeCp 69.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and (DIPPBDI)Mg&#8722;Mg(DIPPBDI) 55.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Natural&#8208;Population&#8208;Analysis (NPA) shows fragment charges: (DIPePBDI*)Mg +0.27/BeCp* &#8722;0.27. The very low NPA charge on Be (+0.62) compared to Mg (+1.21) and the strongly upfield 9Be NMR signal at &#8722;23.7&#8197;ppm are in line with considerable electron density on Be and the formal oxidation state assignment of MgII&#8722;Be0. Despite this Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722; polarity, 1 is extremely thermally stable and unreactive towards H2, CO, N2, cyclohexene and carbodiimide. It reacted with benzophenone, azobenzene, phenyl acetylene, CO2 and CS2. Reaction with 1&#8208;adamantyl azide led to reductive coupling and formation of an N6&#8208;chain. The azide reagent also inserted in the Cp*&#8722;Be bond. The inertness of 1 is likely due to bulky ligands protecting the Mg&#8722;Be unit.

         <title>Inside Cover Picture: Are Redox&#8208;active Centers Bridged by Saturated Flexible Linkers Systematically Electrochemically Independent?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the action of London dispersion forces, the fluxional intramolecular medium of redox&#8208;active bipartite molecules reorganizes to promote through&#8208;space orbital overlap between electrophoric subunits, allowing the achievement of prototypical cyclomer reductive formation. Overall, this behavior provides an illustration of electrochemistry &#8220;beyond the covalent bond&#8221;, just beyond! Details of this study are reported in the Research Article by &#201;ric Br&#233;mond, Magdal&#233;na Hromadov&#225;, Philippe&#8197;P. Lain&#233; et&#8197;al. (e202406299).

         <title>Switchable Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Pseudo&#8208;Stereodivergence in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a strategy enabling triple switchable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereodivergence in newly developed palladium&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of allenes. An asymmetric pseudo&#8208;stereodivergent cycloaddition of allenes bearing a primary leaving group at the &#945;&#8208;position, where a dynamic kinetic asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of racemic unactivated allenes was the enantio&#8208;determining step, is realized, providing four stereoisomers [(Z,R), (Z,S), (E,S), and (E,R)] containing a di&#8208;substituted alkene scaffold and a stereogenic center. By tuning reaction conditions, a mechanistically distinctive cycloaddition is uncovered selectively with the same set of substrates. By switching the position of the leaving group of allenes, a cycloaddition involving an intermolecular O&#8208;attack is disclosed. Diverse mechanisms of the cycloaddition reactions of allenes enable rapid access to structurally and stereochemically diverse 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high efficiency and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous molecular bromine production in sea salt aerosols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromine chemistry is responsible for the catalytic ozone destruction in the atmosphere. The heterogeneous reactions of sea&#8208;salt aerosols are the main abiotic sources of reactive bromine in the atmosphere. Here, we present a novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8208;) by O2 and H2O in the absence of additional oxidants. The laboratory and theoretical calculation results demonstrated that under dark conditions, Br&#8208;, O2 and H3O+ could spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8208;electron transfer process at the air&#8210;water interface and in the liquid phase. Our results also showed that light and acidity could significantly promote the activation of Br&#8208; and the production of Br2. The estimated gaseous Br2 production rate under light conditions was up to 1.55&#215;1010 molecules&#183;cm&#8208;2&#183;s&#8208;1 under light and acidic conditions; these results showed a significant contribution to the atmospheric reactive bromine budget. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during Br&#8208; activation could promote the multiphase oxidation of SO2 to produce sulfuric acid, while the increase in acidity had a positive feedback effect on Br&#8208; activation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the proton&#8208;electron transfer process in Br2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>In vivo synthetic anticancer approach by resourcing mouse blood albumin as a biocompatible artificial metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for producing drugs directly at the cancer site, particularly using bioorthogonal metal catalysts, are being explored to mitigate the side effects of therapy. Albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyze reactions in living mice while protecting the catalyst in the hydrophobic pocket. Here, we describe the in situ preparation and application of biocompatible tumor&#8208;targeting ArMs using circulating albumin, which is abundant in the bloodstream. The ArM was formed using blood albumin through the intravenous injection of ruthenium conjugated with an albumin&#8208;binding ligand; the tumor&#8208;targeting unit was conjugated to the ArM using its catalytic activity, and the ArM was transported to the cancer site. The delivered ArM catalyzed a second tagging reaction of the proapoptotic peptide on the cancer surface, successfully suppressing cancer proliferation. This approach, which efficiently leveraged the persisting reactivity twice in vivo, holds promise for future in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis utilizing endogenous albumin.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Modular Synthesis of Oxetane&#8208;Based Amide Bioisosteres: Concise, Robust and Scalable Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide bioisoterism is a widely used strategy in drug development to fine&#8208;tune physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and metabolic properties, eliminate toxicity and gain intellectual property rights in uncharted chemical space. Of these, oxetane&#8208;amines offer particularly exciting possibilities as bioisosteres, although they are less frequently investigated than warranted due to the lack of simple and widely applicable synthetic methods. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step, practical, modular, robust, and scalable method for the construction of oxetane&#8208;containing amide bioisosteres that relies on the readily available oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one. This operationally simple procedure exploits the enhanced reactivity of the keto group of the commercially available oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one to form amine&#8208;benzotriazole intermediates, which springloaded adducts are then reacted with various aliphatic and aromatic organometallic reagents under mild conditions to afford various amino&#8208;oxetanes in good to high yields.&#160;The simplicity and broad applicability of the method greatly facilitates the synthesis of derivatives that were previously difficult or impossible to produce.&#160;The usefulness of this method in the field medicinal chemistry was also demonstrated by eliminating the well&#8208;known metabolic problem of ketoconazole.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of a Fluorescent Probe for Selectively Sensing Human Cytochrome P450 2D6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme that mediates the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous substances in humans. However, its biological role in drug&#8208;drug interactions especially mechanism&#8208;based inactivation (MBI), and various diseases remains poorly understood, owing to the lack of molecular tools suitable for selectively monitoring CYP2D6 in complex biological systems. Herein, using a tailored molecular strategy, we developed a fluorescent probe BDPM for CYP2D6. BDPM exhibits excellent specificity and imaging capability for CYP2D6, making it suitable for the real&#8208;time monitoring of endogenous CYP2D6 activity in living bio&#8208;samples. Therefore, our tailored strategy proved useful for constructing the highly selective and enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes. BDPM as a molecular tool to explore the critical roles of CYP2D6 in the pathogenesis of diseases, high&#8208;throughput screening of inhibitors and intensive investigation of CYP2D6&#8208;induced MBI in natural systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Confined Engineering Toward Deep Eutectic Electrolyte in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncontrollable interfacial side reactions generated from common aqueous electrolytes, just like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth, have severely prevented the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Solid&#8208;state ZIBs are considered to be an efficient strategy by adopting high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, by confining the deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) into the nanochannels of the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8212;PCN&#8208;222, a stable DEE@PCN&#8208;222 SSE with internal Zn2+ transport channels was obtained. A distinctive ion&#8208;transport network composed of DEE and PCN&#8208;222 in the interior of DEE@PCN&#8208;222 realizes the efficient Zn2+ conduction, contributing to a high ionic conductivity of 3.13 &#215; 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at room temperature, a low activation energy of 0.12 eV, and a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.76. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that DEE@PCN&#8208;222 with its unique channel structure could homogeneously regulate the Zn2+ distribution and effectively alleviate the side reactions. Highly reversible Zn plating/stripping performance of 2476 h can be realized by the SSE. The solid&#8208;state ZIBs show a specific capacity of 306 mAh g&#8208;1 and display cycling stability of 517 cycles. This unique design concept provides a new perspective in realizing the high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;performance ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth as a Z&#8208;Type Ligand: an Unsupported Pt&#8211;Bi Donor&#8208;Acceptor Interaction and its Umpolung by Reaction with H2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Establishing unprecedented types of bonding interactions is one of the fundamental challenges in synthetic chemistry, paving the way to new (electronic) structures, physicochemical properties, and reactivity. In this context, unsupported element&#8208;element interactions are particularly noteworthy since they offer pristine scientific information about the newly identified structural motif. Here we report the synthesis, isolation, and full characterization of the heterobimetallic Bi&#160;/&#160;Pt compound [Pt(PCy3)2(BiMe2)(SbF6)] (1), bearing the first unsupported transition&#160;metal&#8594;bismuth donor/acceptor interaction as its key structural motif. 1 is surprisingly robust, its electronic spectra are interpreted in a fully relativistic approach, and it reveals an unprecedented reactivity towards H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;classical Deactivation Mechanism in a Supported Intermetallic Catalyst for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum&#8208;based supported intermetallic alloys (IMAs) demonstrate exceptional performance in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) primarily because of their remarkable resistance to coke formation. However, these IMAs still encounter a significant hurdle in the form of catalyst deactivation. Understanding the complex deactivation mechanism of supported IMAs, which goes beyond conventional coke deposition, requires meticulous microscopic structural elucidation. In this study, we unravel a nonclassical deactivation mechanism over a PtZn/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 PDH catalyst, dictated by the PtZn to Pt3Zn nanophase transformation accompanied with dezincification. The physical origin lies in the metal support interaction (MSI) that enables strong chemical bonding between hydroxyl groups on the support and Zn sites on the PtZn phase to selectively remove Zn species followed by the reconstruction towards Pt3Zn phase. Building on these insights, we have devised a solution to circumvent the deactivation by passivating the MSI through surface modification of &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 support. By exchanging protons of hydroxyl groups with potassium ions (K) on the &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 support, such a strategy significantly minimizes the dezincification of PtZn IMA via diminished metal&#8208;support bonding, which dramatically reduces the deactivation rate from 0.2044 to 0.0587 h&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks are a class of crystalline porous polymers formed by linking organic units into periodically aligned skeletons and pores. Here we report a strategy for wiring these frameworks with conducting polymers via wall engineering and polymerization. We anchored each edge site with one pyrrole unit, which is densely packed along the z direction yet protruded from pore walls. This assembly enables the polymerization of pyrrole units to form polypyrrole and creates a new polypyrrole chain conformation. The resultant framework constitutes six single file polypyrrole chains in each pore and develop spatially segregated yet built&#8208;in single molecular wires with exceptional stable polarons. Hall effect measurements revealed that the materials are p&#8208;type semiconductors, increase conductivity by eight orders of magnitude compared to the pristine frameworks, and achieve a carrier mobility as large as 13.2 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. Our results open an avenue to &#960; electronic frameworks by interlayer molecular wiring with conducting polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Frenkel and Charge&#8208;Transfer Excitonic Couplings Strengthened by Thiophene&#8208;Type Solvent Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.8% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcoming the trade&#8208;off between short&#8208;circuited current (Jsc) and open&#8208;circuited voltage (Voc) is important to achieving high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). Previous works modulated energy gap between Frenkel local exciton (LE) and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) exciton, which is served as driving force of exciton splitting. Differently, our current work focuses on modulation of LE&#8208;CT excitonic coupling (tLE&#8208;CT) via a simple but effective strategy that the 2&#8208;chlorothiophene (2Cl&#8208;Th) solvent is utilized in treatment of OSC active&#8208;layer films. The results of our experimental measurements and theoretical simulations demonstrated that 2Cl&#8208;Th solvent initiates the tighter intermolecular interactions with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor in comparison with that of traditional chlorobenzene solvent, thus suppressing the acceptor&#8217;s over&#8208;aggregation and retarding the acceptor crystallization with reduced trap. Importantly, the resulted shorter distances between donor and acceptor molecules in the 2Cl&#8208;Th treated blend efficiently strengthen tLE&#8208;CT, which not only promotes the exciton splitting but also reduces non&#8208;radiative recombination. The champion efficiencies of 19.8% (small&#8208;area) with a superior operational reliability (T80: 586 hours) and 17.0% (large&#8208;area) were yielded in 2Cl&#8208;Th treated cells. This work provided a new insight into modulating the exciton dynamics to overcome the trade&#8208;off between Jsc and Voc, which can productively promote the development of OSC field.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence Energy Transfer Combined with Chirality&#8208;Selective Absorption for Modulating Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized long afterglow (CPLA) attracts great interests in multi&#8208;disciplinary fields with significant potentials in optical multiplexing applications, but achieving full&#8208;color and white CPLA is still challenging. The present contribution reports the first success in utilizing circularly polarized phosphorescence energy transfer (CPP&#8208;ET) combined with chirality&#8208;selective absorption (CSA) to construct full&#8208;color and white CPLA materials. Blue CPLA with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 3&#215;10&#8208;2 is firstly obtained via the CSA effect of chiral helical polyacetylene and blue ultralong afterglow of inorganic phosphor BP. Significantly, full&#8208;color and white CPLA films are prepared by simply blending different fluorophores into the blue&#8208;CPLA films via CPP&#8208;ET. Benefited from the persistent luminescence of BP, the lifetimes of the fluorophores increase from nanoseconds to minutes, and ultralong full&#8208;color CPLA emissions lasting for more than 20 min are realized with glum of 10&#8208;3. Also noticeably, chiral optoelectronic devices, multi&#8208;dimension information encryption and chiral logic gate are developed based on the full&#8208;color tunable CPLA&#8208;active materials. The established strategy provides a universal platform for future development of CPLA&#8208;active materials with great applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8722;Organic Framework&#8208;Induced  Rh Monocoodination on Diphosphine Ligand Enables Catalytic Hydroformylation of Aliphatic Olefins at Room Temperature and Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. &#160;We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8722;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr&#8208;MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh&#8208;MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99:1. Due to the framework's capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8208;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal&#8208;based catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Living Hybrid Exciton Materials: Enhanced Fluorescence and Chiroptical Properties in Living Supramolecular Polymers with Strong Frenkel/Charge&#8208;Transfer Exciton Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) was newly developed as excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They are asymmetrically derivatized with a double&#8208;alkyl&#8208;chained L&#8208; or D&#8208;glutamate unit and a linear or branched alkyl chain. When water is added to the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of glutamate&#8208;PDI&#8208;linear&#8208;alkyl chain compounds, kinetically formed H&#8208;aggregates are formed in globular nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs undergo spontaneous transformation into thermodynamically stable nanotubes via helical nanostructures, which showed structured broad spectra originating from the strong coupling of delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge transfer excitations (CTE). Significant enhancement of circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence quantum yield, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) are observed during the transformation of NPs to the FE/CTE&#8208;coupled helical and tubular structures. This transformation process is significantly accelerated by applying physical stimuli, i.e., ultrasonication or adding helical aggregates as seed crystals, a feature unique to living supramolecular polymerization. Meanwhile, the branched chain&#8208;containing PDIs only form H&#8208;aggregates and did not show FE/CTE hybrid exciton states with living supramolecular polymerization properties. This study unveils that suitably designed chiral PDI derivatives show FE/CTE coupling accompanied by high fluorescence quantum yields, enhanced chiroptical properties, and supramolecular living polymerization characteristics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of all kinds of covalent drugs had a major impact on the improvement of the human health system. Covalent binding to target proteins is achieved by so&#8208;called electrophilic warheads, which are incorporated in the respective drug molecule.

Herein, a straightforward palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of acetylene has been developed, allowing a modular and diverse synthesis of bio&#8208;active acrylamides. This general protocol features high atom efficiency, wide functional group compatibility, high chemoselectivity and proceeds additive free under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production by MOF&#8208;derived Metal Oxide Heterojunctions with&#160;a 10.0% Apparent Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen production offers an alternative pathway to establish a sustainable energy economy. While numerous photoactive materials exhibit potential for generating hydrogen from water, the synergy achieved by combining two different materials with complementary properties in the form of heterojunctions can significantly their photocatalytic activity. Our study describes the design and generation of the metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived (MOF) metal oxide heterojunction composed of RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2. The RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2 is generated through the pyrolysis of MOFs, Ru&#8208; HKUST&#8208;1, and the amino&#8208;functionalized MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2. Among the various RuO2/N,S&#8208; TiO2 materials tested, the material characterized by the lowest RuO2 content, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate, producing 10,761 &#956;mol&#183;hr&#8208;1&#183;g&#8208;1 of hydrogen with an apparent quantum&#8208;yield of 10.0% in pure water. In addition to RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2, we generated two other MOF&#8208;derived metal&#8208;oxide heterojunctions, ZnO/N,S&#8208;TiO2 and In2O3/N,S&#8208;TiO2, leading to apparent quantum yields of 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. The remarkable photocatalytic activity observed in RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2 is thought to be attributed to the synergistic effects arising from the combination of metallic properties inherent in the metal oxides, their band alignment, porosity, and surface properties inherited from the parent MOFs. The photocatalytic efficiency of RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2 was further demonstrated in actual water samples, producing hydrogen with a rate of 8,190 &#956;mol&#183;hr&#8208;1&#183;g&#8208;1 in tap water.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic hydrogen production offers an alternative pathway to establish a sustainable energy economy. While numerous photoactive materials exhibit potential for generating hydrogen from water, the synergy achieved by combining two different materials with complementary properties in the form of heterojunctions can significantly their photocatalytic activity. Our study describes the design and generation of the metal-organic framework-derived (MOF) metal oxide heterojunction composed of RuO2/N,S-TiO2. The RuO2/N,S-TiO2 is generated through the pyrolysis of MOFs, Ru- HKUST-1, and the amino-functionalized MIL-125-NH2. Among the various RuO2/N,S- TiO2 materials tested, the material characterized by the lowest RuO2 content, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate, producing 10,761 &#956;mol&#183;hr-1&#183;g-1 of hydrogen with an apparent quantum-yield of 10.0% in pure water. In addition to RuO2/N,S-TiO2, we generated two other MOF-derived metal-oxide heterojunctions, ZnO/N,S-TiO2 and In2O3/N,S-TiO2, leading to apparent quantum yields of 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively.

         <title>Halogen Bond Unlocks Ultra&#8208;High Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anisotropy is crucial for birefringence (&#916;n) in optical materials, but optimizing it remains a formidable challenge (&#916;n &gt; 0.3). Supramolecular frameworks incorporating &#960;&#8208;conjugated components are promising for achieving enhanced birefringence since their structural diversity and inherent anisotropy. Herein, we first synthesized (C6H6NO2)+Cl&#8722; (NAC). And then constructed a halogen bonded supramolecular framework I+(C6H4NO2)&#8722; (INA) by halogen aliovalent substitution of Cl&#8722; with I+. The organic moieties are protonated and deprotonated nicotinic acid (NA), respectively. The antiparallel arrangement of birefringent&#8208;active units in NAC and INA leads to significant differences in bonding characteristics between interlayer and intralayer domains. Moreover, [O&#183;&#183;&#183;I+&#183;&#183;&#183;N] halogen bond in 1D [I+(C6H4NO2)&#8722;] chain exhibits stronger interactions and stricter directionality, resulting in a more pronounced in&#8208;plane anisotropy between the intrachain and interchain directions. Consequently, INA exhibits exceptional birefringent performance, with a value of 0.778 at 550 nm, twice that of NAC (0.363 at 550 nm). This value significantly exceeds those of commercial birefringent crystals, such as CaCO3 (0.172 at 546 nm), and is the highest reported value among ultraviolet birefringent crystals. This work presents a novel design strategy that employs halogen bonds as connection sites and modes for birefringent&#8208;active units, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;performance birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Dilute Electrolytes with Fluorine&#8208;free Ether Solvents for 4.5 V Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited oxidation stability of ether solvents has posed significant challenges for their applications in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To tackle this issue, the prevailing strategy either adopts a high concentration of fluorinated salts or relies on highly fluorinated solvents, which will significantly increase the manufacturing cost and create severe environmental hazards. Herein, an alternative and sustainable salt engineering approach is proposed to enable the utilization of dilute electrolytes consisting of fluorine (F)&#8208;free ethers in high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The proposed 0.8 M electrolyte supports stable lithium plating&#8208;stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.47% and effectively mitigates the metal dissolution, phase transition, and gas release issues of the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode upon charging to high voltages. Consequently, the 4.5 V high&#8208;loading Li||NCM 811 cell shows a capacity retention of 75.2% after 300 cycles. Multimodal experimental characterizations coupled with theoretical investigations demonstrate that the boron&#8208;containing salt plays a pivotal role in forming the passivation layers on both anode and cathode. The present simple and cost&#8208;effective electrolyte design strategy offers a promising and alternative avenue for using commercially mature, environmentally benign, and low&#8208;cost F&#8208;free ethers in high&#8208;voltage LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate over a Cu2O Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient PEC strategy is developed to produce urea from CO2 and NO3&#8722; over a cubic Cu2O photocathode, achieving high formation rate (29.71&#177;2.20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Faraday efficiency (12.90&#177;1.15&#8201;%) of urea. Experimental and theoretical data demonstrate the reaction mechanism, showing the key intermediates and details of C&#8722;N couplings.







Abstract
Transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrate ions into urea offers an attractive route for both nitrogen fertilizer production and environmental remediation. However, achieving this transformation under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient photoelectrochemical method for urea synthesis by co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate ion over a Cu2O photocathode, delivering urea formation rate of 29.71&#177;2.20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.90&#177;1.15&#8201;% at low external potential (&#8722;0.017&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Experimental data combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the adsorbed CO* and NO2* species are the key intermediates, and associated C&#8722;N coupling is the rate&#8208;determining step. This work demonstrates that Cu2O is an efficient catalyst to drive co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to urea under light irradiation with low external potential, showing great opportunity of photoelectrocatalysis as a sustainable tool for value&#8208;added chemical synthesis.

         <title>Efficient Hydrogen Generation from Ammonia Borane Hydrolysis on a Tandem Ruthenium&#8211;Platinum&#8211;Titanium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site is utilized to investigate the activation pathways of hydrogen atoms during AB hydrolysis. RuPt&#8722;Ti exhibit a remarkable catalytic activity with a high TOF of 1293&#8197;min&#8722;1, outperforming most noble metals.







Abstract
Hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) involves multiple undefined steps and complex adsorption and activation, so single or dual sites are not enough to rapidly achieve the multi&#8208;step catalytic processes. Designing multi&#8208;site catalysts is necessary to enhance the catalytic performance of AB hydrolysis reactions but revealing the matching reaction mechanisms of AB hydrolysis is a great challenge. In this work, we propose to construct RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts to clarify the multi&#8208;site tandem activation mechanism of AB hydrolysis. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the multi&#8208;site tandem mode can respectively promote the activation of NH3BH3 and H2O molecules on the Ru and Pt sites as well as facilitate the fast transfer of *H and the desorption of H2 on Ti sites at the same time. RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts exhibit the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 1293&#8197;min&#8722;1 for AB hydrolysis reaction, outperforming the single&#8208;site Ru, dual&#8208;site RuPt and Ru&#8722;Ti catalysts. This study proposes a multi&#8208;site tandem concept for accelerating the dehydrogenation of hydrogen storage material, aiming to contribute to the development of cleaner, low&#8208;carbon, and high&#8208;performance hydrogen production systems.

A new approach to control the n&#8208;doping reaction of organic semiconductors is introduced by using surface&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles with alkylthiolated species (f&#8208;AuNPs) as a catalyst, which is activated at temperatures~70&#8201;&#176;C. This method ensures stables semiconductor+dopant+catalyst formulations and films but enables, upon mild heating, rapid and efficient n&#8208;doping as well as high electrical conductivity.







Abstract
A new approach to control the n&#8208;doping reaction of organic semiconductors is reported using surface&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles (f&#8208;AuNPs) with alkylthiols acting as the catalyst only upon mild thermal activation. To demonstrate the versatility of this methodology, the reaction of the n&#8208;type dopant precursor N&#8208;DMBI&#8208;H with several molecular and polymeric semiconductors at different temperatures with/without f&#8208;AuNPs, vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the unfunctionalized catalyst AuNPs, was investigated by spectroscopic, morphological, charge transport, and kinetic measurements as well as, computationally, the thermodynamic of catalyst activation. The combined experimental and theoretical data demonstrate that while f&#8208;AuNPs is inactive at room temperature both in solution and in the solid state, catalyst activation occurs rapidly at mild temperatures (~70&#8201;&#176;C) and the doping reaction completes in few seconds affording large electrical conductivities (~10&#8211;140&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The implementation of this methodology enables the use of semiconductor+dopant+catalyst solutions and will broaden the use of the corresponding n&#8208;doped films in opto&#8208;electronic devices such as thin&#8208;film transistors, electrochemical transistors, solar cells, and thermoelectrics well as guide the design of new catalysts.

         <title>A Merger of Relay Catalysis with Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enables Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective arylation of unactivated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bond of primary alcohols was achieved under mild conditions by constructing a cooperative system merging relay catalysis with dynamic kinetic resolution of transient aryl aldehyde intermediates, demonstrating new opportunities in multicatalysis to execute otherwise challenging transformations.







Abstract
The conceptual merger of relay catalysis with dynamic kinetic resolution strategy is reported to enable regio&#8208; and enantioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H bond arylation of aliphatic alcohols, forming enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols typically with &gt;90&#8201;:&#8201;10 enantiomeric ratios (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er) and 36&#8211;74&#8201;% yields. The starting materials bearing neighbouring stereogenic centres can be converted to either diastereomer of the &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohol products, with &gt;85&#8201;:&#8201;15 diastereomeric ratios determined by the catalysts. The reactions occur under mild conditions, ensuring broad compatibility, and involve readily available aryl bromides, an inorganic base, and commercial Ru&#8208; and Pd&#8208;complexes. Mechanistic experiments support the envisioned mechanism of the transformation occurring through a network of regio&#8208; and stereoselective processes operated by a coherent Ru/Pd&#8208;dual catalytic system.

         <title>Dearomative Construction of 2D/3D Frameworks from Quinolines via Nucleophilic Addition/Borate&#8208;Mediated Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative construction of triply&#8208;fused 2D/3D frameworks was achieved from quinolines via nucleophilic addition and borate&#8208;mediated photocycloaddition in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective manner. The borate complex accelerates the photocycloaddition and suppresses rearomatization in the excited state. Based on mechanistic analysis, further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene are also developed.







Abstract
Dearomative construction of multiply&#8208;fused 2D/3D frameworks, composed of aromatic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rings and saturated three&#8208;dimensional (3D) rings, from readily available quinolines has greatly contributed to drug discovery. However, dearomative cycloadditions of quinolines in the presence of photocatalysts usually afford 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline (THQ)&#8208;based polycycles, and dearomative access to 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based structures remains limited. Herein, we present a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective dearomative transformation of quinolines into 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based 6&#8211;6&#8211;4&#8208;membered rings without any catalyst, through a combination of nucleophilic addition and borate&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the photoexcited borate complex, generated from quinoline, organolithium, and HB(pin), accelerates the cycloaddition and suppresses the rearomatization that usually occurs in conventional photocycloaddition. Based on our mechanistic analysis, we also developed further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene.

         <title>Efficient Neutral H2O2 Electrosynthesis from Favorable Reaction Microenvironments via Porous Carbon Carrier Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mesoporous carbon sphere carriers were optimized to enhance O2 enrichment and localized pH elevation, establishing a favorable microenvironment for 2e&#8722; ORR in neutral media to generate H2O2 with an exceptional production rate of 15.77&#8197;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, yielding a neutral H2O2 solution suitable for medical disinfection.







Abstract
The efficient electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) in neutral media is undoubtedly a practical route, but the limited comprehension of electrocatalysts has hindered the system advancement. Herein, we present the design of model catalysts comprising mesoporous carbon spheres&#8208;supported Pd nanoparticles for H2O2 electrosynthesis at near&#8208;zero overpotential with approximately 95&#8201;% selectivity in a neutral electrolyte. Impressively, the optimized Pd/MCS&#8208;8 electrocatalyst in a flow cell device achieves an exceptional H2O2 yield of 15.77&#8197;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, generating a neutral H2O2 solution with an accumulated concentration of 6.43&#8197;wt&#8201;%, a level sufficiently high for medical disinfection. Finite element simulation and experimental results suggest that mesoporous carbon carriers promote O2 enrichment and localized pH elevation, establishing a favorable microenvironment for 2e&#8722; ORR in neutral media. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the robust interaction between Pd nanoparticles and the carbon carriers optimized the adsorption of OOH* at the carbon edge, ensuring high active 2e&#8722; process. These findings offer new insights into carbon&#8208;loaded electrocatalysts for efficient 2e&#8722; ORR in neutral media, emphasizing the role of carrier engineering in constructing favorable microenvironments and synergizing active sites.

         <title>Inhibiting Dissolution of Active Sites in 80&#8201;&#176;C Alkaline Water Electrolysis by Oxyanion Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline water electrolysers typically operate at 80&#8201;&#176;C to minimize power consumption. But NiFe&#8208;based catalysts encounter the bottleneck of high solubility at such temperatures. In this work, we employed oxyanions as inhibitors in electrolytes. At industrial required 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 80&#8201;&#176;C, the oxyanion engineering inhibit the loss of NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides active sites to 1/3 of the original amount, thus reducing the degradation rate by 25&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Commercial alkaline water electrolysers typically operate at 80&#8201;&#176;C to minimize energy consumption. However, NiFe&#8208;based catalysts, considered as one of the most promising candidates for anode, encounter the bottleneck of high solubility at such temperatures. Herein, we discover that the dissolution of NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) during operation not only leads to degradation of anode itself, but also deactivates cathode for water splitting, resulting in decay of overall electrocatalytic performance. Aiming to suppress the dissolution, we employed oxyanions as inhibitors in electrolyte. The added phosphates to the electrolyte inhibit the loss of NiFe&#8208;LDH active sites at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 1/3 of the original amount, thus reducing the rate of performance decay by 25&#8208;fold. Furthermore, the usage of borates, sulfates, and carbonates yields similar results, demonstrating the reliability and universality of the active site dissolution inhibitor, and its role in elevated water electrolysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial alkaline water electrolysers typically operate at 80&#8201;&#176;C to minimize energy consumption. However, NiFe-based catalysts, considered as one of the most promising candidates for anode, encounter the bottleneck of high solubility at such temperatures. Herein, we discover that the dissolution of NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) during operation not only leads to degradation of anode itself, but also deactivates cathode for water splitting, resulting in decay of overall electrocatalytic performance. Aiming to suppress the dissolution, we employed oxyanions as inhibitors in electrolyte. The added phosphates to the electrolyte inhibit the loss of NiFe-LDH active sites at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 1/3 of the original amount, thus reducing the rate of performance decay by 25-fold. Furthermore, the usage of borates, sulfates, and carbonates yields similar results, demonstrating the reliability and universality of the active site dissolution inhibitor, and its role in elevated water electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Functionalization of Cyclopropenes via Cyclopropenium Cation Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a photocatalytic decarboxylative functionalization of cyclopropenes. Starting from cyclopropenyl redox&#8208;active esters, easily accessible through the rhodium&#8208; or silver&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropenation of alkynes, we could access a wide range of diverse cyclopropenes under mild photoredox conditions. The transformation displayed a broad scope and a remarkable functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies supported aromatic cyclopropenium cations as reaction intermediates.







Abstract
A photocatalytic decarboxylative functionalization of cyclopropenes is reported. Starting from a broad range of redox&#8208;active ester&#8208;substituted cyclopropenes, cyclopropenylphthalimides can be synthesized in the absence of a nucleophile. Alternatively, different carbon and heteroatom nucleophiles can be introduced. The transformation proceeds most probably through the formation of an aromatic cyclopropenium cation, followed by trapping with the nucleophiles.

         <title>Investigation of the Odilorhabdin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Using NRPS Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the odilorhabdin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was elucidated by engineering of the central non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Therefore, specific modules of the odilorhabdin synthetase were assembled to well&#8208;studied NRPS systems, which resulted in small and non&#8208;toxic NRPS test systems. This method enabled an in vivo investigation of the biosynthesis of targeted NRPS modules and accessory genes of the BGC in E.&#8197;coli.







Abstract
The recently identified natural product NOSO&#8208;95A from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus bacteria, derived from a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), was the first member of the odilorhabdin class of antibiotics. This class exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic activity and inspired the development of the synthetic derivative NOSO&#8208;502, which holds potential as a new clinical drug by breaking antibiotic resistance. While the mode of action of odilorhabdins was broadly investigated, their biosynthesis pathway remained poorly understood. Here we describe the heterologous production of NOSO&#8208;95A in Escherichia coli after refactoring the complete BGC. Since the production titer was low, NRPS engineering was applied to uncover the underlying biosynthetic principles. For this, modules of the odilorhabdin NRPS fused to other synthetases were co&#8208;expressed with candidate hydroxylases encoded in the BGC allowing the characterization of the biosynthesis of three unusual amino acids and leading to the identification of a prodrug&#8208;activation mechanism by deacylation. Our work demonstrates the application of NRPS engineering as a blueprint to mechanistically elucidate large or toxic NRPS and provides the basis to generate novel odilorhabdin analogues with improved properties in the future.

         <title>Aqueous Developable and CO2&#8208;Sourced Chemical Amplification Photoresist with High Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a set of CO2&#8208;sourced polycarbonates containing acid&#8208;labile cyclic acetal structures were explored as chemical amplification photoresist in deep ultraviolet lithography, and these materials exhibit a superior lithography performance than commercial KrF and ArF resists, demonstrating a promising application prospect in integrated circuit manufacture.







Abstract
Seeking high&#8208;performance photoresists is an important item for semiconductor industry due to the continuous miniaturization and intelligentization of integrated circuits. Polymer resin containing carbonate group has many desirable properties, such as high transmittance, acid sensitivity and chemical formulation, thus serving as promising photoresist material. In this work, a series of aqueous developable CO2&#8208;sourced polycarbonates (CO2&#8208;PCs) were produced via alternating copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides bearing acid&#8208;cleavable cyclic acetal groups in the presence of tetranuclear organoborane catalyst. The produced CO2&#8208;PCs were investigated as chemical amplification resists in deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. Under the catalysis of photogenerated acid, the acetal (ketal) groups in CO2&#8208;PC were hydrolysed into two equivalents of hydroxyl groups, which change the exposed area from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity, thus enabling the exposed area to be developed with water. Through normalized remaining thickness analysis, the optimal CO2&#8208;derived resist achieved a remarkable sensitivity of 1.9&#8197;mJ/cm2, a contrast of 7.9, a favorable resolution (750&#8197;nm, half pitch), and a good etch resistance (38&#8201;% higher than poly(tert&#8208;butyl acrylate)). Such performances outperform commercial KrF and ArF chemical amplification resists (i.e., polyhydroxystyrene&#8208;derived and polymethacrylate&#8208;based resists), which endows broad application prospects in the field of DUV (KrF and ArF) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for nanomanufacturing.

         <title>Oxidative Upcycling of Polyethylene to Long Chain Diacid over Co&#8208;MCM&#8208;41 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long chain diacid was prepared by controllable oxidation of polyethylene with cobalt&#8208;doped MCM&#8208;41 under mild conditions.







Abstract
Plastic pollution is an emerging global threat due to lack of effective methods for transforming waste plastics into useful resources. Here, we demonstrate a direct oxidative upcycling of polyethylene into high&#8208;value and high&#8208;volume saturated dicarboxylic acids in high carbon yield of 85.9&#8201;% in which the carbon yield of long chain dicarboxylic (C10&#8208;C20) acids can reach 58.9% over cobalt&#8208;doped MCM&#8208;41 molecular sieves, in the absence of any solvent or precious metal catalyst. The distribution of the dicarboxylic acids can be controllably adjusted from short&#8208;chain (C4&#8208;C10) to long&#8208;chain ones (C10&#8208;C20) through changing cobalt loading of MCM&#8208;41 under nanoconfinement. Highly and sparsely dispersed cobalt along with confined space of mesoporous structure enables complete degradation of polyethylene and high selectivity of dicarboxylic acid in mild condition. So far, this is the first report on highly selective one&#8208;step preparation of long chain dicarboxylic acids. The approach provides an attractive solution to tackle plastic pollution and a promising alternative route to long chain diacids.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;solvent coordination enables comprehensive trap passivation for efficient quantum dot near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LEDs) based on perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have produced external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~15%. However, these high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;QLEDs suffer from immediate carrier quenching because of the accumulation of migratable ions at the surface of the QDs. These uncoordinated ions and carriers &#8211; if not bound to the nanocrystal surface &#8211; serve as centers for exciton quenching and device degradation. In this work, we overcome this issue and fabricate high&#8208;performance NIR QLEDs by devising a ligand anchoring strategy, which entails dissolving the strong&#8208;binding ligand (Guanidine Hydroiodide, GAI) in the mediate&#8208;polar solvent. By employing the dye&#8208;sensitized device structure (phosphorescent indicator), we demonstrate the elimination of the interface defects. The treated QDs films exhibit an exciton binding energy of 117 meV: this represents a 1.5&#8208;fold increase compared to that of the control (74 meV). We report, as a result, the NIR QLEDs with an EQE of 21% which is a record among NIR perovskite QLEDs. These QLEDs also exhibit a 7&#8208;fold higher operational stability than that of the best previously reported NIR QLEDs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the QDs are compatible with large&#8208;area QLEDs: we showcase 900 mm2 QLEDs with EQE approaching 20%.</dc:description>

In this work, we overcome this issue and fabricate high-performance NIR QLEDs by devising a ligand anchoring strategy, which entails dissolving the strong-binding ligand (Guanidine Hydroiodide, GAI) in the mediate-polar solvent. By employing the dye-sensitized device structure (phosphorescent indicator), we demonstrate the elimination of the interface defects. The treated QDs films exhibit an exciton binding energy of 117 meV: this represents a 1.5-fold increase compared to that of the control (74 meV). We report, as a result, the NIR QLEDs with an EQE of 21% which is a record among NIR perovskite QLEDs. These QLEDs also exhibit a 7-fold higher operational stability than that of the best previously reported NIR QLEDs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the QDs are compatible with large-area QLEDs: we showcase 900 mm2 QLEDs with EQE approaching 20%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A soft, fatigue&#8208;free, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer via the synergy of skin&#8208;like assembly and Bouligand structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft ionic elastomers that are self&#8208;healable, fatigue&#8208;free, and environment&#8208;tolerant are ideal structural and sensing materials for artificial prosthetics, soft electronics, and robotics to survive unpredictable service conditions. However, most synthetic strategies failed to unite rapid healing, fatigue resistance, and environmental robustness, limited by their singular compositional/structural designs. Here, we present a soft, tough, fatigue&#8208;resistant, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer (STFSI elastomer), which fuses skin&#8208;like binary assembly and Bouligand helicoidal structure into a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers and a supramolecular ionic biopolymer. The interlocked binary assembly enables skin&#8208;like softness, high stretchability, and strain&#8208;adaptive stiffening through a matrix&#8208;to&#8208;scaffold stress transfer. The Bouligand structure contributes to superhigh fracture toughness (101.6 kJ m&#8208;2) and fatigue resistance (4937 J m&#8208;2) via mechanical toughening by interlayer slipping and twisted crack propagation path. Besides, the STFSI elastomer is self&#8208;healable through a &#8220;bridging&#8221; method and environment&#8208;tolerant (&#8208;20 &#730;C ~ 60 &#730;C, strong acid/alkali, saltwater). To demonstrate the versatile structural and sensing applications, we showcase a safety cushion with efficient damping and suppressed rebounding, and a robotic sensor with excellent fatigue crack tolerance and instant sensation recovery upon cutting&#8208;off damage. Our presented synthetic strategy is generalizable to other fiber&#8208;reinforced tough polymers for applications involving demanding mechanical/environmental conditions.</dc:description>

A biomimetic charge&#8208;neutral anion receptor for reversible binding and release of highly hydrated phosphate in water







Abstract
Control of phosphate capture and release is vital in environmental, biological, and pharmaceutical contexts. However, the binding of trivalent phosphate (PO43&#8722;) in water is exceptionally difficult due to its high hydration energy. Based on the anion coordination chemistry of phosphate, in this study, four charge&#8208;neutral tripodal hexaurea receptors (L1&#8211;L4), which were equipped with morpholine and polyethylene glycol terminal groups to enhance their solubility in water, were synthesized to enable the pH&#8208;triggered phosphate binding and release in aqueous solutions. Encouragingly, the receptors were found to bind PO43&#8722; anion in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio via hydrogen bonds in 100&#8201;% water solutions, with L1 exhibiting the highest binding constant (1.2&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1). These represent the first neutral anion ligands to bind phosphate in 100&#8201;% water and demonstrate the potential for phosphate capture and release in water through pH&#8208;triggered mechanisms, mimicking native phosphate binding proteins. Furthermore, L1 can also bind multiple bioavailable phosphate species, which may serve as model systems for probing and modulating phosphate homeostasis in biological and biomedical researches.

A high voltage stable uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) is synthesized via a controllable gas&#8208;solid reaction. Compared with conventional coating, this oxyhalide coating exhibits high ionic conductivity and excellent high voltage stability. Therefore, the interfacial side reactions between NCM811 and sulfide solid electrolytes can be effectively suppressed even at high voltage, thus the interfacial products can be well abridged. Hence, ASSBs with this oxyhalide coating delivers remarkable improvement in kinetic performance and cycling stability, the constructed ASSBs with all sulfide solid electrolyte exhibited an excellent cycling retention of 94&#8201;% over 500&#8201;cycles under 4.5&#8197;V, and 80.4&#8201;% over 200&#8201;cycles under 4.8&#8197;V. Besides, due to improved kinetic dynamic, excellent rate performance (166.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) is achieved even at 0&#8201;&#176;C.Our finding proposes a simple but effective paradigm of oxyhalide coating with high voltage stability as well as high ionic conductivity to further enhance the development of high energy density ASSBs.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs) have received increasing attentions as one promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices. Among various solid electrolytes, sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs combined with layered oxide cathodes have emerged due to the high energy density and safety performance, even at high&#8208;voltage conditions. However, the interface compatibility issues remain to be solved at the interface between the oxide cathode and sulfide electrolyte. To circumvent this issue, we propose a simple but effective approach to magic the adverse surface alkali into a uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) via a controllable gas&#8208;solid reaction. Due to the enhancement of the close contact at interface, the ASSBs exhibit improved kinetic performance across a broad temperature range, especially at the freezing point. Besides, owing to the high&#8208;voltage tolerance of the protective layer, ASSBs demonstrate excellent cyclic stability under high cutoff voltages (500&#8197;cycles~94.0&#8201;% at 4.5&#8197;V, 200&#8197;cycles~80.4&#8201;% at 4.8&#8197;V). This work provides insights into using a high voltage stable oxyhalide coating strategy to enhance the development of high energy density ASSBs.

This work provides insights into using a high voltage stable oxyhalide coating strategy to enhance the development of high energy density ASSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Helium Sieving from Hydrogen Using Fluorine&#8208;Decorated Carbon Hollow Fiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fiber membranes enables the tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H2 molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H2 diffusivity and solubility selectivities.







Abstract
Separating helium (He) and hydrogen (H2), two gases that are extremely similar in molecular size and condensation properties, presents a formidable challenge in the helium industry. The development of membranes capable of precisely differentiating between these gases is crucial for achieving large&#8208;scale, energy&#8208;efficient He/H2 separation. However, the limited selectivity of current membranes has hindered their practical application. In this study, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by engineering submicroporous membranes through the fluorination of partially carbonized hollow fibers. We demonstrate that the fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fibers enables tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H2 molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H2 diffusivity and solubility selectivities. The fluorinated HFM&#8208;550&#8208;F&#8208;1&#8197;min membrane exhibits exceptional mixed&#8208;gas separation performance, with a binary mixed&#8208;gas He/H2 selectivity of 10.5 and a ternary mixed&#8208;gas He/(H2+CO2) selectivity of 20.8, at 40&#8197;bar feed pressure and 35&#8201;&#176;C, surpassing all previously reported polymer&#8208;based gas separation membranes, and remarkable plasticization resistance and long&#8208;term continuous stability over 30&#8197;days.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Three&#8208;Component Radical 1,2&#8208;Azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric three&#8208;component radical 1,2&#8208;azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with readily available azidobenziodazolone reagent and carboxylic acids is reported. This process is notable for using chiral copper&#8208;based complex as a bifunctional catalyst for photoinduced azidyl radical generation and C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling, providing access to diverse valuable azidated chiral allylic esters.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved multicomponent difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has recently emerged as a promising strategy for rapid synthesis of valuable allylic compounds in one&#8208;pot operation. However, the expansion of radical scope and enantiocontrol remain two major challenges. Herein, we describe an unprecedented photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective three&#8208;component radical 1,2&#8208;azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with readily available azidobenziodazolone reagent and carboxylic acids. This mild protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and exceptional control over chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, providing practical access to diverse valuable azidated chiral allylic esters. Mechanistic studies imply that the chiral copper complex is implicated as a bifunctional catalyst in both the photoredox catalyzed azidyl radical generation and enantioselective radical C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Phosphonoalamides Reveal the Biosynthetic Origin of Phosphonoalanine Natural Products and a Convergent Pathway for Their Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Streptomyces phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of phosphonoalanine (PnAla) biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. The transamination of phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) to PnAla drives unfavorable C&#8722;P bond formation despite its reversibility, establishing this early branch of phosphonate biosynthesis, while the promiscuity of the dipeptide and tripeptide ligases result in a dramatic expansion of observed di&#8208; and tripeptide products.







Abstract
Phosphonate natural products, with their potent inhibitory activity, have found widespread use across multiple industries. Their success has inspired development of genome mining approaches that continue to reveal previously unknown bioactive scaffolds and biosynthetic insights. However, a greater understanding of phosphonate metabolism is required to enable prediction of compounds and their bioactivities from sequence information alone. Here, we expand our knowledge of this natural product class by reporting the complete biosynthesis of the phosphonoalamides, antimicrobial tripeptides with a conserved N&#8208;terminal l&#8208;phosphonoalanine (PnAla) residue produced by Streptomyces. The phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of PnAla biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. We elucidate the biochemistry underlying the transamination of phosphonopyruvate to PnAla, a new early branchpoint in phosphonate biosynthesis catalyzed by an aminotransferase with evolved specificity for phosphonate metabolism. Peptide formation is catalyzed by two ATP&#8208;grasp ligases, the first of which produces dipeptides, and a second which ligates dipeptides to PnAla to produce phosphonoalamides. Substrate specificity profiling revealed a dramatic expansion of dipeptide and tripeptide products, while finding PnaC to be the most promiscuous dipeptide ligase reported thus far. Our findings highlight previously unknown transformations in natural product biosynthesis, promising enzyme biocatalysts, and unveil insights into the diversity of phosphonopeptide natural products.

         <title>Size Control of Chiral Nanospheres Obtained via Nanoprecipitation of Helical Poly(phenylacetylene)s in the Absence of Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable chiral nanospheres with controlled size and density can be obtained from nanoprecipitation of helical poly(phenylacetylenes). These polymer nanoparticles are stable in water in the absence of surfactants and have the ability of encapsulating metal nanoparticles or fluorescent dyes which can be further released by light irradiation.







Abstract
Nanostructuration of dynamic helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) depends on the secondary structure adopted by the polymer and the functional group used to connect the chiral pendant to the PPA backbone. Thus, while PPAs with dynamic and flexible scaffolds (para&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted, &#969;1&lt;165&#176;) generate by nanoprecipitation low polydisperse nanospheres with controllable size at different acetone/water mixtures, those with a quasi&#8208;static behavior and the presence of an extended, almost planar structure (ortho&#8208;substituted, &#969;1&gt;165&#176;), aggregate into a mixture of spherical and oval nanostructures whose size is not controlled. Photostability studies show that poly(phenylacetylene) particles are more stable to light irradiation than when dissolved macromolecularly. Moreover, the photostability of the particle depends on the secondary structure of the PPA and its screw sense excess. This fact, in combination with the encapsulation ability of these polymer particles, allows the creation of light stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers, whose cargo can be delivered by light irradiation.

         <title>Chiral Tetrakis Eu(III) Complexes with Ammonium Cations for Improved Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations exhibited large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL=&#8722;1.54), which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.







Abstract
Large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in ligand and coordination tuned chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations. The gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Through photophysical measurements, single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses and quantum chemical calculations, changes in the geometric and electronic structures were observed for a series of chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes which enhanced the gCPL value. The emission quantum yield and photosensitized energy transfer efficiencies of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs+. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.

&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;1.54), which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt;) was observed in ligand and coordination tuned chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations. The &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt; value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Through photophysical measurements, single crystal X-ray structural analyses and quantum chemical calculations, changes in the geometric and electronic structures were observed for a series of chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes which enhanced the &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt; value. The emission quantum yield and photosensitized energy transfer efficiencies of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Coppoborylene Stabilized by Multicenter Covalent Bonding and Its Amphoteric Reactivity to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene that was mass&#8208;isolated and spectroscopically characterized in the gas phase has a pseudo T&#8208;shaped structure and features classical borylene reactivity to CO. It evidences the potential feasibility of stabilizing amphoteric borylenes by an unprecedented multicenter covalent bond rather than the well&#8208;documented coordination tactics.







Abstract
A cationic copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene was prepared and structurally characterized via infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This structure exemplifies a new class of borylenes stabilized by three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron metal&#8208;boron&#8208;metal covalent bonding interaction, displaying exceptional &#963;&#8208;acidity and unparalleled &#960;&#8208;donor capability for CO activation that outperforms all of the known transition metal cations and is comparable or even superior to the documented base&#8208;trapped borylenes. Its neutral form represents a monovalent boron compound with a strongly reactive amphoteric boron center built on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;boron bonds, which inspires the design and synthesis of new members of the borylene family.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Powered Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Molecular Motor with Colour&#8208;Selective Single&#8208;Step Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motors access small length scale and have potential for precision technology. But the top&#8208;down control of these motors is a challenge as they are molecular objects subject to stochastic fluctuations. Now a rationally designed single&#8208;stranded DNA molecular motor demonstrates a novel nano&#8208;optomechanical driving mechanism that pushes the top&#8208;down control of molecular motors down to every single step.







Abstract
Top&#8208;down control of small motion is possible through top&#8208;down controlled molecular motors in replacement of larger actuators like MEMS or NEMS (micro&#8208; or nano&#8208;electromechanical systems) in the current precision technology. Improving top&#8208;down control of molecular motors to every single step is desirable for this purpose, and also for synchronization of motor actions for amplified effects. Here we report a designed single&#8208;stranded DNA molecular motor powered by alternated ultraviolet and visible light for processive track&#8208;walking, with the two light colours each locking the motor in a full directional step to allow saturated driving but no overstepping. This novel nano&#8208;optomechanical driving mechanism pushes the top&#8208;down control of molecular motors down to every single step, thus providing a key technical capability to advance the molecular motor&#8208;based precision technology and also motor synchronization for amplified effects.

         <title>Design and Evolution of an Enzyme for the Asymmetric Michael Addition of Cyclic Ketones to Nitroolefins by Enamine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stereoselective Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins was promoted by a designer artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue through enamine catalysis. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitroketones were prepared by this efficient biocatalytic strategy for ketone functionalization in a study highlighting the utility of artificial enzymes for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions.







Abstract
Consistent introduction of novel enzymes is required for developing efficient biocatalysts for challenging biotransformations. Absorbing catalytic modes from organocatalysis may be fruitful for designing new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes with novel functions. Herein we report a newly designed artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue that catalyzes the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins through enamine activation with high efficiency. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro cyclic ketones with two stereocenters were efficiently prepared with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% e.e., &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.) and good yield (up to 86&#8201;%). This work provides an efficient biocatalytic strategy for cyclic ketone functionalization, and highlights the usefulness of artificial enzymes for extending biocatalysis to further non&#8208;natural reactions.

         <title>Reactivity and Steric Parameters from 2D to 3D Bulky Pyridines: Increasing Steric Demand at Nitrogen with Chiral Azatriptycenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sterically hindered chiral pyridines were synthesized and resolved by HPLC. Their Br&#248;nsted/Lewis basicity were evaluated, and their reactivity was studied through their combination with Pd and B(C6F5)3 to generate new types of ligands/frustrated Lewis pairs. The study involved the first parameterization of the steric hindrance for a large set of pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
Sterically hindered pyridines embedded in a three&#8208;dimensional triptycene framework have been synthesized, and their resolution by chiral HPLC enabled access to unprecedented enantiopure pyridines exceeding the known steric limits. The design principles for new axially chiral pyridine derivatives are then described. To rationalize their associations with Lewis acids and transition metals, a comprehensive determination of the steric and electronic parameters for this new class of pyridines was performed. This led to the general parameterization of the steric parameters (percent buried volume %VBur, Tolman cone angle &#952;, and He8_steric descriptor) for a large set of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional pyridine derivatives. These parameters are shown to describe quantitatively their interactions with carbon&#8208; and boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids and were used to predict the &#916;G&#176; of association with the prototypical B(C6F5)3 Lewis acid widely used in frustrated Lewis pair catalysis. This first parameterization of pyridine sterics is a fundamental basis for the future development of predictive reactivity models and for guiding new applications of bulky and chiral pyridines in organocatalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs, and transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Approach to Promoting Photocatalysis Based on Consecutive Photo&#8208;Induced Electron&#8208;Transfer Processes via Efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the host&#8211;guest approach to promoting photoactivation of aryl halides based on the conPET process via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from host to encapsulated rhodamine 6G (Rh&#8208;6G). Highly efficient FRET makes the supramolecular system an efficient catalyst for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides under mild conditions within a short time (1&#8211;4&#8197;h), even in an air atmosphere.







Abstract
Supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8211;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal&#8208;organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8211;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8211;guest complex renders the cage&#8208;based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.

By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal-organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8211;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single-wavelength light-driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8211;guest complex renders the cage-based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea over Single&#8208;Atom Alloy with Electronic Metal Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy on CeO2 nanorods are designed for efficient electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2. Cu single atoms modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Alloy sites accelerate the formation of C&#8722;N bond through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO. Electronic metal support interaction further modulates the interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability.







Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) is an alternative approach to traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. Herein, we report a CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) with electronic metal support interaction (EMSI), achieving a high urea yield rate of 813.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.94&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 45.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.74&#8197;V vs. RHE. In situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that single&#8208;atom Cu sites modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Bimetallic sites synergistically accelerate C&#8722;N bond formation through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO to form *ONCO as key intermediates. More importantly, electronic metal support interaction between CuAu SAA and CeO2 carrier further modulates electron structure and interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability. This work constructs SAA electrocatalysts with EMSI effect to tailor C&#8722;N coupling at the atomic level, which can provide guidance for the development of C&#8722;N coupling systems.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategy for the Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Fluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first enantioselective method for the cyclopropanation of difluorinated olefins is presented. Using engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts in combination with diazoacetonitrile as the carbene precursor, the present method enables the production of different fluorinated cyclopropanes with high yields and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Fluorinated cyclopropanes are highly desired pharmacophores in drug discovery owing to the rigid nature of the cyclopropane ring and the beneficial effects of C&#8722;F bonds on the pharmacokinetic properties, cell permeability, and metabolic stability of drug molecules. Herein a biocatalytic strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of mono&#8208;fluorinated and gem&#8208;difluoro cyclopropanes is reported though the use of engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts. In particular, this system allows for a broad range of gem&#8208;difluoro alkenes to be cyclopropanated in the presence of diazoacetonitrile with excellent diastereo and enantiocontrol (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8201;e.e.), thereby enabling a transformation not currently accessible with chemocatalytic methods. The synthetic utility of the present approach is further exemplified through the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a key gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropane intermediate useful for the preparation of fluorinated bioactive molecules.
