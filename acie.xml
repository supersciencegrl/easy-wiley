         <title>A Surface Coordination Interphase Stabilizes a Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of a nitrile group on the surface of a garnet solid electrolyte is demonstrated in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108050) by Tao Zhang and co&#8208;workers. A firm and stable electrode/electrolyte interphase was constructed by using the confirmed surface coordination, enabling the long&#8208;term stable cycling of a lithium metal solid state battery.

         <title>Standardization and Control of Grignard Reactions in a Universal Chemical Synthesis Machine using Online NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The digitization of chemistry requires that synthesis procedures can be written and optimized in a chemical programming language to perform reliable &#8220;chemputation&#8221; for the synthesis on the &#8220;chemputer&#8221; robot, a universal synthesis machine. The cover image shows how a universal chemical synthesis engine equipped with an NMR sensor can be used to optimize reactions producing the automated synthesis procedure as an optimized process code ensuring that the chemputation can be improved and is reliable. Details are reported by Leroy Cronin, Franziska Emmerling et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106323).

Lanterns on water resemble aqueous dispersible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) structures composed of an alternating arrangement of donor and&#160;acceptor molecules. This &#8220;lantern&#8221;&#8208;type network stabilizes&#160;the charge&#8211;transfer interactions. Under light irritation, the &#8220;lanterns&#8221; light up, representing an enhanced photothermal effect, as reported by Chunying Duan, Gang Han et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108076).

         <title>Proton Traffic Jam: Effect of Nanoconfinement and Acid Concentration on Proton Hopping Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protons confined within nonionic reverse micelles experience a &#8220;traffic jam&#8221; in which forward proton hopping, or the Grotthuss mechanism, is restricted. This effect is size and concentration dependent: Protons in small micelles or at lower concentrations diffuse freely via forward hopping. For larger sizes or concentrations, ions accumulate at the interfacial region of the micelle, causing a gridlock that decreases available pathways for movement of protons to the water interior, as reported by Martina Havenith, Teresa Head&#8208;Gordon et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108766).

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Oxidative Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions of Palladium&#8211;TiO2 Determined by In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) of well&#8208;defined Pd&#8208;TiO2 catalysts under high&#8208;temperature oxidation was studied via in&#8197;situ atmospheric pressure TEM. On the different facets of TiO2 supports there were significant differences in the encapsulation behaviors with a facet&#8208;dependent SMSI. Obvious cover layers were observed on Pd&#8197;NPs supported on TiO2 (101) and (100) facets, while no such phenomenon appeared on TiO2 (001) facets.







Abstract
The strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is widely used in supported metal catalysts and extensive studies have been performed to understand it. Although considerable progress has been achieved, the surface structure of the support, as an important influencing factor, is usually ignored. We report a facet&#8208;dependent SMSI of Pd&#8208;TiO2 in oxygen by using in&#8197;situ atmospheric pressure TEM. Pd NPs supported on TiO2 (101) and (100) surfaces showed encapsulation. In contrast, no such cover layer was observed in Pd&#8208;TiO2 (001) catalyst under the same conditions. This facet&#8208;dependent SMSI, which originates from the variable surface structure of the support, was demonstrated in a probe reaction of methane combustion catalyzed by Pd&#8208;TiO2. Our discovery of the oxidative facet&#8208;dependent SMSI gives direct evidence of the important role of the support surface structure in SMSI and provides a new way to tune the interaction between metal NPs and the support as well as catalytic activity.

         <dc:description>
Massarinolin A and purpurolides are bioactive bergamotane sesquiterpenes containing a complex tetracyclic skeleton. The reported approach features a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement to build the key bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane and led to the total syntheses of five bergamotane sesquiterpenes and structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109625), Mingji Dai and co&#8208;workers highlights the flow chemistry and the divergent feature of the synthesis using the branched flow channels, light, floating building blocks, and three target molecules.

         <title>Unambiguous Tracking of Protein Phosphorylation by Fast High&#8208;Resolution FOSY NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new suite of 2D FOSY experiments focuses onto one coupled nuclear spin system at a time, i.e. a post&#8208;translational modification or a structural hotspot in general, with 3 to 5 known frequencies. With higher sensitivity and versatility than achievable by traditional experiments, FOSY solves the spectral dispersion problem and obtains only the relevant local NMR signal assignment in a few hours as demonstrated by Vladislav&#8197;Y. Orekhov et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102758) for two phosphorylation sites in the 441&#8208;residue IDP Tau.

         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;to&#8208;PVC: In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202105851), Guido Zichittella and Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez show the outstanding performance of rare earth oxychloride catalysts for the selective conversion of ethane into 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane, a precursor of vinyl chloride monomer. The potential use of natural gas as feedstock instead of coal or oil represents a long sought&#8208;after advancement to bring significant cost and environmental benefits to the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, whose numerous applications are an essential part of the world we live in.

         <title>Four&#8208;Step Domino Reaction Enables Fully Controlled Non&#8208;Statistical Synthesis of Hexaarylbenzene with Six Different Aryl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexaarylbenzene (HAB) scaffolds, containing six different aromatic rings around central benzene core, are a synthetic challenge.&#160;In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202104437),&#160;Svetlana&#8197;B. Tsogoeva and co&#8208;workers&#160;report a process which allows to generate such HAB simply and straightforwardly. In an efficient, two&#8208;component four&#8208;step domino reaction, a functionalized triarylbenzene is formed and used as a key intermediate to furnish asymmetrically substituted HAB in high overall yield and without involvement of statistical steps.

         <title>Photoinduced radical emission in a coassembly system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing radical emission at ambient conditions is a challenging task since radical species are unstable in air. In the present work, we overcome this challenge by coassembling a series of tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The strong hydrogen bonds between the guest dopants and the PVA host matrix protect the free radicals of carbonyl compounds after light irradiation, leading to strong solid state free radical emission. Changing temperature and peripheral functional groups of the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes can influence the intensity of the radical emission. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations predict that such free radical fluorescence originates from anti&#8208;Kasha D  2  &#8594;D  0  vertical emission by the anion radicals. The photoinduced radical emission by the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes was successfully utilized for information encryption application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cooperative OSDA Blueprint for Highly Siliceous Faujasite Zeolite Catalysts with Enhanced Acidity Accessibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cooperative OSDA strategy is demonstrated, leading to novel high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites with a large potential for disruptive acid catalysis. In bottom&#8208;up synthesis, the symbiosis of choline ion (Ch  +  ) and 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (CE) was evidenced, in a form of full occupation of the sodalite (  sod  ) cages with the  trans  Ch  +  conformer, induced by the CE presence. CE itself occupied the supercages along with additional  gauche  Ch  +  , but in synthesis without CE, no  trans  was found. The cooperation, and thus the fraction of  trans  Ch  +  , was closely related to the Si/Al ratio, a key measure for FAU stability and acidity. As such, a bottom&#8208;up handle for lowering the Al&#8208;content of FAU and tuning its acid site distribution is shown. A mechanistic study demonstrated that forming  sod  cages with  trans  Ch  +  is key to the nucleation of high&#8208;silica FAU zeolites. The materials showed superior performances to commercial FAU zeolites and those synthesized without cooperation, in the catalytic degradation of polyethylene.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Ionic Liquids for the Fabrication of Ionogel Films and Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Film deposition and high&#8208;resolution patterning of ionic liquids (ILs) remain a challenge, despite a broad range of applications that would benefit from this type of processing. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ILs. The IL&#8208;CVD method is based on the formation of a non&#8208;volatile IL through the reaction of two vaporized precursors. Ionogel micropatterns can be easily obtained via the combination of IL&#8208;CVD and standard photolithography, and the resulting microdrop arrays can be used as microreactors. The IL&#8208;CVD approach will facilitate leveraging the properties of ILs in a range of applications and microfabricated devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant 2&#8208;aminotetralin and&#160;3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives via enzymatic reductive amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Aminotetralin and 3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives are key structural motifs present in a wide range of pharmaceutically important molecules. Herein, we report an effective biocatalytic approach towards these molecules through the enantioselective reductive coupling of 2&#8208;tetralones and 3&#8208;chromanones with a diverse range of primary amine partners. Metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs) were employed as the biocatalysts, obtaining high yields and enantiocomplementary selectivity for &gt;15 examples at preparative scale, including the precursors to Ebalzotan, Robalzotan, Alnespirone and 5&#8208;OH&#8208;DPAT. We also present a convergent chemo&#8208;enzymatic total synthesis of the Parkinson&#8217;s disease therapy Rotigotine in 63% overall yield and 92%  ee.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfaces and Interface Layers in Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the superior thermal stability, metal halide inorganic perovskite materials have been continuously attracting interests in the application of photovoltaics. The highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on inorganic perovskites is over 20%. As this PCE corresponds to 70% of the theoretical limit, there remains a larger space for further improving the device PCEs compared to organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid PSCs. The main loss is in the photovoltage, which is limited by interfaces in terms of non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by traps and energy&#8208;level mismatch. Furthermore, inefficient charge extraction at interfacial contacts reduces the photocurrent and fill factor. This Minireview summarizes the recent developments in the fundamental understanding of how the interfaces influence the performance of solar cells based on inorganic perovskite absorbers. An outlook for the development of highly efficient and stable inorganic PSCs from the interface point of view is also given.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermoneutral N&#8211;H bond activation of ammonia by a geometrically constrained phosphine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A geometrically constrained phosphine bearing a tridentate NNS pincer ligand is reported. The effect of the geometric constraint on the electronic structure was probed by theoretical calculations and derivatization reactions. Reactions with N&#8211;H bonds result in formation of cooperative addition products. The thermochemistry of these transformations is strongly dependent on the substrate, with ammonia activation being thermoneutral. This represents the first example of a molecular compound that  reversibly  activates ammonia  via  N&#8211;H bond scission in solution upon mild heating.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;Dipnictadialanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Being potential precursors for semiconducting materials, cyclic heteroatomic group 13/15 compounds have received considerable attention. In most cases, the group 13 and 15 elements are four&#8208;coordinate, and base&#8208;free variants of the type [RAl(&#956;&#8208;PR&#8217;)]  2  have not been reported to date. Using the Al(I) precursor Cp  3t  Al in conjunction with triphosphiranes (PAr)  3  (Ar = Mes, Dip, Tip) we have now succeeded in preparing Lewis base&#8208;free cyclic diphosphadialanes with both the Al and P bearing three substituents. Using the sterically more demanding Dip&#8208; and Tipsubstituents the first 1,2&#8208;diphospha&#8208;3,4&#8208;dialuminacyclobutanes were obtained, whereas with Mes&#8208;substituents [Cp  3t  Al(&#956;&#8208;PMes)]  2  is formed. This divergent reactivity was corroborated by DFT studies, which indicated the thermodynamic preference for the 1,2&#8208;diphospha&#8208;3,4dialuminacyclobutane form for sterically more demanding groups on phosphorus. Using Cp*Al we could extend this concept to the corresponding cyclic diarsadialanes [Cp*Al(&#956;&#8208;AsAr)]  2  (Ar = Dip, Tip) and additionally add the phosphorus variants [Cp*Al(&#956;&#8208;PAr)]  2  (P = Mes, Dip, Tip). The reactivity of one variant [Cp  3t  Al(&#956;&#8208;PPh)]  2  towards NHCs was tested and resulted in double NHC&#8208;stabilised</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Trifluoromethylation of Arenes and Heteroarenes Catalyzed by High&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a series of air&#8208;stable Ni  III  complexes supported by a simple, robust naphthyridine&#8208;based ligand. Access to the high valent oxidation state is enabled by the CF  3  ligands on the nickel, while the naphthyridine exhibits either a monodentate or bidentate coordination mode that depends on the oxidation state and sterics, and enables facile aerobic oxidation of Ni  II  to Ni  III  . These Ni  III  complexes act as efficient photoredox catalysts for C(sp  2  )&#8211;H bond trifluoromethylation reactions of (hetero)arenes using versatile synthetic protocols. This blue LED light&#8208;mediated catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical pathway and demonstrates potential in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug analogs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthetic Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is receiving increasing attention as a new frontier for the generation and handling of reactive intermediates. PEC permits selective single electron transfer (SET) reactions in a much greener way and broadens the redox window of possible transformations.

Namely, combination of PEC with other reactivity paradigms (hydrogen atom transfer, radical polar crossover, energy transfer sensitization), scalability up to multigram scale, novel selectivities in SET super&#8208;oxidations/reductions and the importance of precomplexation to temporally enable excited radical ion catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Function&#8208;Orientated Core&#8208;Shell Nanostructure in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Near&#8208;infrared Responsive Bacterial Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of effective ways to integrate various functional species into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is critically important for their applications but highly challenging. In this study, according to the &#8220;bottle&#8208;around&#8208;ship&#8221; strategy, core&#8208;shell heterostructure of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and HOFs was first time fabricated  via  a ligand&#8208;grafting stepwise method. UCNPs &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation (980 nm) into visible light (540 nm and 653 nm), which further excites the perylenediimide&#8208;based HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; through resonance energy transfer. In this way, the nanocomposite inherits the high porosity, excellent photothermal and photodynamic efficiency, NIR photoresponse from two parent materials, achieving intriguing NIR&#8208;responsive bacterial inhibition toward  Escherichia coli  . This study may shed light on the design of functional HOF&#8208;based composite materials, not only enriching the HOF library but also broadening the horizon of their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy migration  control of multi&#8208;modal emissions in an Er3+ doped nanostructure toward information encryption and deep learning decoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the emission wavelengths of materials has always been a primary focus of fluorescence technology. Nanocrystals (NCs) doped with lanthanide ions with rich energy levels can produce a variety of emissions at different excitation wavelengths. However, the control of multi&#8208;modal emissions of these ions has remained a challenge. Herein, we present a new composition of Er  3+  &#8208;based lanthanide NCs with color&#8208;switchable output under irradiation with 980, 808, or 1535 nm light for information security. The variation of excitation wavelengths changes the intensity ratio of visible (Vis)/near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emissions. Taking advantage of the Vis/NIR&#8208;II multi&#8208;modal emissions of NCs and deep learning, we successfully demonstrated the storage and decoding of visible light information in pork tissue.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore bound water at the key residue histidine&#160;37 in Influenza A M2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomic details of structured water molecules are indispensable to understand the thermodynamics of important biological processes including the proton conduction mechanism of the M2 protein. Despite the expectation of structured water molecules based on crystal structures of Influenza A M2, only two water populations have been observed by NMR in reconstituted lipid bilayer samples. These are the bulk and lipid associated water populations typically seen in membrane samples. Here, we detect a bound water molecule at a chemical shift of 11 ppm, located near the functional histidine 37 residue in the M2 conductance domain, which comprises residues 18 to 60. Combining 100 kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization and density functional theory calculations, we show that the bound water forms a hydrogen bond to the &#948;1 nitrogen of histidine&#8208;37.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of surfactants on the molecular structure of the buried oil/water interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oil/water interface, for instance in emulsions, is often stabilized by surfactants. Hence, the co&#8208;existence of oil, water, and surfactant molecules at the buried oil/water interface determines macroscopic properties such as surface tension or emulsion stability. Utilizing an inherently surface sensitive spectroscopic method, sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, we show that adsorption of an anionic surfactant to the buried oil/water interface increases the magnitude of the interfacial electric field. Meanwhile, the degree of ordering of the interfacial oil molecules increases with the surfactant concentration due to the intercalation of aliphatic chains of interfacial oil and surfactant molecules. At sufficiently high surfactant concentrations, the interfacial charge reaches a maximum value and the interfacial oil molecules arrange in a fully ordered conformation, a state which coincides with the significant decrease in interfacial tension and increased emulsion stability.</dc:description>

         <title>General, metal&#8208;free synthesis of carbon nanofiber assemblies from plant oils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of carbon nanofibers suffers in classical approaches from either costs or the introduction of metallic impurities, and a more simple method of synthesis based on affordable and accessible educts would be highly welcomed. For that, we rationally designed a metal&#8208;free approach based on ketene chemistry using phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and vegetable oil. Based on the characterization of intermediates, P2O5&#8208;oil reaction yielded most possibly alkylketenes, which polymerized into poly(ketene) with abundant enol groups. The enol groups further reacted with P2O5, forcing the poly(ketene) to assemble into a nano&#8208;sized preassembly structure. Moderate heating transforms these soft assembly structures into carbonaceaus nanofibers. Moreover, this approach is applicable to other chemicals with similar structure to vegetable oil, which demonstrates the generality of methodology. The carbon nanofibers with P&#8208;O&#8208;C functionalization show relatively high graphitization degree and promising textural properties (e.g., well&#8208;developed porosity, negatively&#8208;charged surface). The C&#8208;O&#8208;P environment accounts for 66 at% of the total P and create a superior thermal stability of carbon nanofibers as compared with unfunctionalized all&#8208;carbon nanotubes. As a model application, a CDI system built of a carbon nanofibers&#8208;based electrode countered by an activated carbon&#8208;based electrode exhibited exceptional performance: a NaCl adsorption capacity ~30 mg g&#8208;1 at applied voltage of 1.2 V was reached, with very stable adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. This research opens a promising path to large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost synthesis of 1&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofibers from sustainable carbon sources without using metal catalysts or expensive equipment.</dc:description>

         <title>Forrestiacids&#8197;A and&#8197;B, Pentaterpene Inhibitors of ACL and Lipogenesis: Extending the Limits of Computational NMR Methods in the Structure Assignment of Complex Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forrestiacids A (1) and B (2), comprising a rearranged spiro&#8208;lanostane unit fused with an abietene by a Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition, represent a novel class of pentaterpenoids obtained from Pseudotsuga forrestii. Chemical computations demonstrate to be an effective strategy in the structure elucidation of complex molecules. Both 1 and 2 showed potent ACL inhibitory effects, and 1 even significantly attenuated the de novo lipogenesis in HepG2 cells.







Abstract
Forrestiacids&#8197;A (1) and B (2) are a novel class of [4+2] type pentaterpenoids derived from a rearranged lanostane moiety (dienophile) and an abietane unit (diene). These unprecedented molecules were isolated using guidance by molecular ion networking (MoIN) from Pseudotsuga&#8197;forrestii, an endangered member of the Asian Douglas Fir Family. The intermolecular hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder adducts feature an unusual bicyclo[2.2.2]octene ring system. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, GIAO NMR calculations and DP4+ probability analyses, electronic circular dichroism calculations, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This unique addition to the pentaterpene family represents the largest and the most complex molecule successfully assigned using computational approaches to predict accurately chemical shift values. Compounds&#8197;1 and 2 exhibited potent inhibitory activities (IC50s &lt;5&#8197;&#956;M) of ATP&#8208;citrate lyase (ACL), a new drug target for the treatment of glycolipid metabolic disorders including hyperlipidemia. Validating this activity 1 effectively attenuated the de novo lipogenesis in HepG2 cells. These findings provide a new chemical class for developing potential therapeutic agents for ACL&#8208;related diseases with strong links to traditional medicines.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Encapsulation of Protein into Nanoscale Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Intracellular Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ encapsulation of protein by self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) enables the formation of nanoscale protein@TA&#8208;HOFs under mild conditions. Moreover, this strategy is generally applicable to proteins with different surface charge and molecular weight, facilitating the cellular internalization of proteins for efficient enzyme catalysis inside living cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous materials with great potential for biological applications. The self&#8208;assembly of HOFs and biomacromolecules, however, is challenging. We report herein the self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale HOFs (nHOFs) to encapsulate protein for intracellular biocatalysis. The self&#8208;assembly of tetrakis(4&#8208;amidiniumphenyl)methane and azobenzenedicarboxylate can encapsulate protein in situ to form protein@nHOFs under mild conditions. This strategy is applicable to proteins with different surface charge and molecular weight, showing a high protein encapsulation efficiency and minimal effect on protein activity. A cellular delivery study shows that the protein@TA&#8208;HOFs can efficiently enter cells and retain enzyme activity for biochemical catalysis in living cells for neuroprotection. Our strategy paves new avenues for interfacing nHOFs with biological settings and sheds light on expanding nHOFs as a platform for biomacromolecule delivery and disease treatment.

         <title>Visualization of Vaccine Dynamics with Quantum Dots for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct visualization of vaccine fate is important to investigate its immunoactivation process in order to elucidate the detailed molecular reaction process at single&#8208;molecular level. Yet, visualization of the spatiotemporal trafficking of vaccines remains poorly explored. Here, we show that quantum dot (QD) nanomaterials allow for monitoring vaccine dynamics and for amplified immune response. Synthetic QDs enable efficient conjugation of antigen and adjuvants to target tissues and cells, and non&#8208;invasive imaging the trafficking dynamics to lymph nodes and cellular compartments. The nanoparticle vaccine elicits potent immune responses and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy alone or in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 blockade. The synthetic QDs showed high fluorescence quantum yield and superior photostability, and the reliable and long&#8208;term spatiotemporal tracking of vaccine dynamics was realized for the first time by using the synthetic QDs, providing a powerful strategy for studying the immune response and for evaluating the vaccine efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Dirhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective B&#8211;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;Diaryl Carbenes: Efficient Access to gem&#8208;Diarylmethine Boranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral  gem  &#8208;diarylmethine boron compounds are important synthetic building blocks that can be transformed into chiral  gem  &#8208;diaryl methanes or triaryl methanes, which are common scaffolds in bioactive molecules. However, the scarcity of reliable methods for synthesizing chiral  gem  &#8208;diarylmethine borons limits their applications. Herein, we report a method for highly enantioselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed B&#8211;H bond insertion reactions with diaryl diazomethanes as carbene precursors. These reactions afforded chiral  gem  &#8208;diarylmethine borane compounds in high yield (up to 99% yield), high activity (turnover numbers up to 14,300), high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee) and showed unprecedented broad functional group tolerance. Moreover, the borane compounds synthesized by this method could be efficiently transformed into diaryl methanol, diaryl methyl amine, and triaryl methane derivatives with good stereospecificity. Mechanistic studies suggested that the borane adduct coordinated to the rhodium catalyst and thus interfered with decomposition of the diazomethane, and that insertion of a rhodium carbene (generated from the diazomethane) into the B&#8211;H bond was most likely the rate&#8208;determining step. Hammett analysis indicated that the enantioselectivity depended strongly on electronic differences between the two aryl groups of the diazomethane.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control over Chemical Assembly in Living Cells by Integration of Acid Catalyzed Hydrolysis and Enzymatic Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal control of chemical assembly in living cell remains challenging. Here we developed an efficient and general platform to precisely control the formation of assemblies in living cells that is broadly accessible. We introduced o&#8208;[bis(dimethylamino)phosphono] tyrosine protection strategy in the self&#8208;assembly motif as the Trojan horse, the programmed precursors thus resist hydrolysis by phosphatases on and inside cells, because the unmasking of enzymatic cleavage site selectively occurs in the acidic environment of lysosomes. After demonstrating the multi&#8208;stage self&#8208;assembly processes in vitro by liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS), cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM), and circular dichroism (CD), we investigated the formation of site&#8208;specific self&#8208;assembly in living cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), LC&#8208;MS, and biological electron microscopy (Bio&#8208;EM). Controlling chemical assembly in living systems spatiotemporally may have applications in supramolecular chemistry, materials science, synthetic biology, and chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahedral [Sb(AuMe)4]3&#8722; Occurring in Multimetallic Cluster Syntheses: About the Structure&#8208;Directing Role of Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anion of [K(crypt&#8208;222)]3[Sb(AuMe)4]&#183;py (1; crypt&#8208;222 = 4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane; py = pyridine) represents a rare example of a homoleptic heavy p&#8208;block metal atom being surrounded by four free&#8208;standing transition metal complex fragments, and the third example for a corresponding Sb compound. In contrast to all reported complexes of this type, the transition metal atoms possess twofold coordination only, hence the complex as a whole does not exhibit significant steric shielding or further linkage of the metal atoms. This is reflected in a high flexibility, as confirmed by slight deviations from a tetrahedral coordination of the Sb atom in the crystal and soft vibrational modes. An alternative pyramidal conformer, observed for a related arsenic compound with terminal phosphine ligands, is apparently disfavored owing to electron correlation effects. The compound is formed in a reaction that in another solvent or at other reactant concentrations yields salts of ternary cluster anions. By a combined experimental and theoretical study of different reaction conditions and previously unidentified side&#8208;products, we provide insight into multimetallic cluster synthesis reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Arylation of P4 and PH3: Reaction Development Through Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detailed  31  P{  1  H} NMR spectroscopic investigations provide deeper insight into the complex, multi&#8208;step mechanisms involved in the recently reported photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P  4  ). Specifically, these studies have identified a number of previously unrecognized side products, which arise from an unexpected non&#8208;innocent behavior of the commonly employed terminal reductant Et  3  N. The different rate of formation of these products explains discrepancies in the performance of the two most effective catalysts, [Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)  2  ][PF  6  ] (dtbbpy = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) and 3DPAFIPN. Inspired by the observation of PH  3  as a minor intermediate, we have developed the first catalytic procedure for the arylation of this key industrial compound. Similar to P  4  arylation, this method affords valuable triarylphosphines or tetraarylphosphonium salts depending on the steric profile of the aryl substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>The Complex Crystal Structure and Abundant Local Defects of Zeolite EMM&#8208;17 Unraveled by Combined Electron Crystallography and Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structure determination of zeolites is of great significance for understanding their fascinating properties. In this study, we successfully solve one of polymorphic structures (polymorph A) of zeolite EMM&#8208;17, which can only crystallize in sub&#8208;micron&#8208;sized crystals while containing complex stacking disorders, from the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electron diffraction (ED) data. This is the first time that the atomic structure of this polymorph has been ab initio solved, and the result reveals a unique 10(12) X 10(12) X 11&#8208;ring channel system. Moreover, we acquire the first atomic&#8208;resolution images of EMM&#8208;17 using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy. The images allow us to directly observe polymorphs B and C and discover a large number of local structural defects. Based on structural features unraveled from the reciprocal&#8208;space 3D ED data and real&#8208;space images, we propose a series of energetically feasible local structures in EMM&#8208;17. In addition, we demonstrate that the unique porous structure of EMM&#8208;17 enables efficient kinetic separation of C6 alkane isomers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Due to the omnipresence of chiral organofluorine compounds in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and material chemistry, the development of enantioselective methods for their preparation is highly desirable. In the present study, the enantioselective organocatalyzed acylation of&#160; &#945; , &#945; &#8208;difluorohydrins using a commercially available chiral isothiourea is reported through a kinetic resolution (KR) process. It reveals that the difluoromethylene moiety (sp  3  CF  2  ) can play the role of directing group through electrostatic fluorine&#8208;cation interaction, greatly improving the enantioselectivity of the KR. In this context, a broad range of fluorinated alcohols such as valuable 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols could be synthesized with exquisite enantiocontrol (typically &gt; 99:1 er).&#160; Turning to 2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols, we also demonstrated that aromatic and fluorinated groups were mutually compatible to provide the expected enantioenriched adducts with &gt; 99:1 er.&#160; Relying on experimental and theoretical studies, this report considerably enriches the network of potential non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI) for enantioselective acylation by chiral isothioureas.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Propargyl Ethers with Grignard Reagents for the Synthesis of Functionalized Allenes and Allenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for facile synthesis of highly substituted allenols and fluoroalkyl allenes via iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of propargyl ethers with Grignard reagents is disclosed. Various tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted fluoroalkyl allenes and &#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;allenols were obtained in good to excellent yields. The reaction was demonstrated to be stereospecific occurring with syn&#8208;SN2&#8242; displacement of the methoxy group by the Grignard reagent.







Abstract
Herein we disclose an iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of propargyl ethers with Grignard reagents. The reaction was demonstrated to be stereospecific and allows for a facile preparation of optically active allenes via efficient chirality transfer. Various tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted fluoroalkyl allenes can be obtained in good to excellent yields. In addition, an iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of Grignard reagents with &#945;&#8208;alkynyl oxetanes and tetrahydrofurans is disclosed herein, which constitutes a straightforward approach towards fully substituted &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;allenols, respectively.

         <title>Photoresponsive Palladium and Nickel Catalysts for Ethylene Polymerization and Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photoresponsive olefin polymerization systems were rationally designed. Light can be used to tune their properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar comonomers, enabling light&#8208;induced control of the polymerization processes, polymer microstructures and polymer properties.







Abstract
In this contribution, we install an azobenzene functionality in olefin polymerization catalysts and use light to modulate their properties via photoinduced trans&#8211;cis isomerization of the azobenzene moiety. The initially targeted azobenzene&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium and nickel catalysts are not photoresponsive. To address this issue, an imine&#8211;amine system bearing interrupted conjugation with the metal center, and a sandwich&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diimine system bearing an azobenzene unit at a position covalently far from the metal center were prepared and studied. We demonstrate that light can be used to tune their properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar comonomers, enabling light&#8208;induced control of the polymerization processes, polymer microstructures and polymer properties. More interestingly, the light&#8208;mediated property changes were attributed to ligand electronic effects in one system and ligand steric effects in the other.

         <title>Monitoring Dynamics, Structure, and Magnetism of Switchable Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via 1H&#8208;Detected MAS&#8197;NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paramagnetic DUT&#8208;8(Ni) metal&#8211;organic frameworks were characterised over an extended temperature range with 1H&#8208;detected NMR techniques under fast magic&#8208;angle spinning. The sensitivity of the approach allows rapid access to structure and dynamics of the organic linkers as well as the electronic properties of the metal centres in these materials.







Abstract
We present a toolbox for the rapid characterisation of powdered samples of paramagnetic metal&#8211;organic frameworks at natural abundance by 1H&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR. Very fast MAS rates at room and cryogenic temperatures and a set of tailored radiofrequency irradiation schemes help overcome the sensitivity and resolution limits often associated with the characterisation of MOF materials. We demonstrate the approach on DUT&#8208;8(Ni), a framework containing Ni2+ paddle&#8208;wheel units which can exist in two markedly different architectures. Resolved 1H and 13C&#8197;resonances of organic linkers are detected and assigned in few hours with only 1&#8211;2&#8197;mg of sample at natural isotopic abundance, and used to rapidly extract information on structure and local internal dynamics of the assemblies, as well as to elucidate the metal electronic properties over an extended temperature range. The experiments disclose new possibilities for describing local and global structural changes and correlating them to electronic and magnetic properties of the assemblies.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ultraviolet Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Enabled by High&#8208;Lying Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the proposed long&#8208;short axis molecular design, an HLCT&#8208;type ultraviolet emitter is reported. Benefiting from the features of the low&#8208;lying LE emissive state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process, the ultraviolet OLED furnishes a record&#8208;high EQE of 10.79&#8201;%, accompanied by a satisfactory color purity and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) organic emitters that can open up applications for future organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are of great value but rarely developed. Here, we report a high&#8208;quality UV emitter with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state and its application in UV OLEDs. The UV emitter, 2BuCz&#8208;CNCz, shows the features of low&#8208;lying locally excited (LE) emissive state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) process, which helps to balance the color purity and exciton utilization of UV OLED. Consequently, the OLED based on 2BuCz&#8208;CNCz exhibits not only a desired narrowband UV electroluminescent (EL) at 396&#8197;nm with satisfactory color purity (CIEx, y=0.161, 0.031), but also a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10.79&#8201;% with small efficiency roll&#8208;off. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance can inspire the design of UV emitters, and pave a way for the further development of high&#8208;performance UV OLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;Through the proposed long-short axis molecular design, an HLCT-type ultraviolet emitter is reported. Benefiting from the features of the low-lying LE emissive state and high-lying reverse intersystem crossing process, the ultraviolet OLED furnishes a record-high EQE of 10.79&#8201;%, accompanied by a satisfactory color purity and a small efficiency roll-off.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultraviolet (UV) organic emitters that can open up applications for future organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are of great value but rarely developed. Here, we report a high-quality UV emitter with hybridized local and charge-transfer (HLCT) excited state and its application in UV OLEDs. The UV emitter, 2BuCz-CNCz, shows the features of low-lying locally excited (LE) emissive state and high-lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) process, which helps to balance the color purity and exciton utilization of UV OLED. Consequently, the OLED based on 2BuCz-CNCz exhibits not only a desired narrowband UV electroluminescent (EL) at 396&#8197;nm with satisfactory color purity (CIE&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;=0.161, 0.031), but also a record-high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10.79&#8201;% with small efficiency roll-off. The state-of-the-art device performance can inspire the design of UV emitters, and pave a way for the further development of high-performance UV OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Redox ladder of Ni3 complexes with closed&#8208;shell, mono&#8208;, and diradical triphenylene units: molecular models for conductive 2D MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the isolation and characterization of a series of trinickel complexes with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaoxotriphenylene (HOTP), [(Me  3  TPANi)  3  (HOTP)](BF  4  )  n  (Me  3  TPA =  N  ,  N  ,  N  &#8208;tris[(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2pyridyl)methyl]amine) (  n  = 2, 3, 4 for complexes  1  ,  2  ,  3  ). These complexes comprise a redox ladder whereby the HOTP core displays increasingly quinoidal character as its formal oxidation state changes from &#8211;4, to &#8211;3, and &#8211;2 in  1  ,  2  , and  3  , respectively. No formal oxidation state changes occur on Ni, allowing the isolation of singlet diradical, monoradical, and closed&#8208;shell configurations for HOTP in  1  ,  2  , and  3  , respectively, with a concomitant decrease in the spin coupling strength upon oxidation. Because the three complexes can be considered models of the smallest building blocks of 2D conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks such as Ni  9  HOTP  4  , these results serve as possible inspiration for the construction of extended materials with targeted electric and magnetic properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semi&#8208;artificial photoelectrochemistry can combine state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photovoltaic light&#8208;absorbers with enzymes evolved for selective fuel&#8208;forming reactions such as CO2  reduction, but the overall performance of such hybrid systems has been limited to date. Here, control of the local environment via the electrolyte solution has been applied to facilitate efficient biocatalysis, which was translated to achieve benchmark enzymatic photoelectrochemistry for CO2  &#8208;to&#8208;formate reduction with a lead halide perovskite&#8208;integrated photoelectrochemical device. Specifically, the electrolyte constituents were first tuned to establish the optimum conditions for an immobilized W&#8208;formate dehydrogenase from  Desulfovibrio vulgaris  Hildenborough. The CO2  reductase was then interfaced with a triple cation lead mixed halide perovskite through a hierarchically structured porous TiO2  scaffold to produce an integrated photocathode achieving a benchmark photocurrent density of &#8722;5 mA cm  &#8211;2  at 0.4 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode during simulated solar light irradiation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe maleic&#8208;acid derivatives as robust cysteine&#8208;selective reagents for protein labelling with comparable kinetics and superior stability relative to predominantly used maleimides. Diamide and amido&#8208;ester derivatives proved to be efficient protein&#8208;labelling species with a common mechanism in which a spontaneous cyclization reaction occurs upon addition to cysteine. Introduction of chlorine atoms in their structures triggers ring hydrolysis or further conjugation with adjacent residues, which results in conjugates that are completely resistant to retro&#8208;Michael reactions in the presence of biological thiols and human plasma. By controlling the microenvironment of the reactive site, we can control selectivity towards the hydrolytic pathway, forming homogeneous conjugates. The method is applicable to several scaffolds and enables conjugation of different payloads. The synthetic accessibility of these reagents and the mild conditions required for fast and complete conjugation together with the superior stability of the conjugates makes this strategy an important alternative to maleimides in the bioconjugation toolbox.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
We report on a first demonstration for a catalyst comprising metal NPs and amorphous MOF in a gas&#8208;phase reaction. Cu/amorphous UiO&#8208;66 exhibited 3&#8208;fold catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation into methanol over Cu/crystalline UiO&#8208;66. Amorphous UiO&#8208;66 coating on Cu&#8208;ZnO nanocomposites showed 1.5&#8208;fold catalytic activity enhancement over that of Cu/amorphous UiO&#8208;66.







Abstract
We report on Cu/amUiO&#8208;66, a composite made of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) and amorphous [Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC)6] (amUiO&#8208;66, BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), and Cu&#8208;ZnO/amUiO&#8208;66 made of Cu&#8208;ZnO nanocomposites and amUiO&#8208;66. Both structures were obtained via a spray&#8208;drying method and characterized using high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectra, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. The catalytic activity of Cu/amUiO&#8208;66 for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol was 3&#8208;fold that of Cu/crystalline UiO&#8208;66. Moreover, Cu&#8208;ZnO/amUiO&#8208;66 enhanced the methanol production rate by 1.5&#8208;fold compared with Cu/amUiO&#8208;66 and 2.5&#8208;fold compared with &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;supported Cu&#8208;ZnO nanocomposites (Cu&#8208;ZnO/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3) as the representative hydrogenation catalyst. The high catalytic performance was investigated using in situ Fourier transform IR spectra. This is a first report of a catalyst comprising metal NPs and an amorphous metal&#8211;organic framework in a gas&#8208;phase reaction.

&lt;p&gt;We report on a first demonstration for a catalyst comprising metal NPs and amorphous MOF in a gas-phase reaction. Cu/amorphous UiO-66 exhibited 3-fold catalytic activity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation into methanol over Cu/crystalline UiO-66. Amorphous UiO-66 coating on Cu-ZnO nanocomposites showed 1.5-fold catalytic activity enhancement over that of Cu/amorphous UiO-66.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report on &lt;b&gt;Cu/amUiO-66&lt;/b&gt;, a composite made of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) and amorphous [Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(BDC)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (amUiO-66, BDC=1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), and &lt;b&gt;Cu-ZnO/amUiO-66&lt;/b&gt; made of Cu-ZnO nanocomposites and &lt;b&gt;amUiO-66&lt;/b&gt;. Both structures were obtained via a spray-drying method and characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectra, powder X-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. The catalytic activity of &lt;b&gt;Cu/amUiO-66&lt;/b&gt; for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to methanol was 3-fold that of Cu/crystalline UiO-66. Moreover, &lt;b&gt;Cu-ZnO/amUiO-66&lt;/b&gt; enhanced the methanol production rate by 1.5-fold compared with &lt;b&gt;Cu/amUiO-66&lt;/b&gt; and 2.5-fold compared with &#947;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-supported Cu-ZnO nanocomposites (&lt;b&gt;Cu-ZnO/&#947;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Triggered by Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)&#8208;initiated Chemiluminescence for Activated Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing endogenous photo&#8208;activated theranostic platform to overcome the limitation of low tissue&#8208;penetration from external photo&#8208;excitation for precise cancer diagnosis and treatment is highly significant but remains huge challenge. Here, as a proof of concept, we report a hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  )&#8208;initiated chemiluminescence triggered nanoparticles aggregation (HICTNA) strategy to activate the theranostic functions of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for specific visualization and effective therapy of tumors. A pair of small AuNPs, namely tAuNP and mAuNP, were rationally designed and fabricated by conjugating 2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazole (Tz) and methacrylic acid (Ma) onto the surface of particles, respectively. The mAuNP nanoparticles were absorbed with luminescent substrate luminol through electrostatic interaction to afford self&#8208;illuminating nanoparticles mAuNP/Lu that could produce strong chemiluminescence (CL) under the catalysis of H  2  O  2  in tumor microenvironment. Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known tetrazole/alkene &#8220;photo&#8208;click&#8221; cycloaddition, significant aggregation of AuNPs was simultaneously triggered by endogenous CL resulting in enhanced tumorous accumulation and retention of AuNPs for activated photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors  in vivo  . We thus believe that this HICTNA concept may offer an attractive and universal tool to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of nanomedicine for achieving precise cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Bending for Better: Flexible Organic Single Crystals with Controllable Curvature and Curvature&#8208;Related Conductivity for Customized Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;bending organic single crystals of coronene with controlled width, length, and curvature are constructed for customized electronic micro&#8208;devices. The bending crystal device presents a huge improvement beyond seven orders of magnitude in the conductivity over the straight one, which benefited from both &#960; electron level changing and carrier mobility enhancement caused by the structural deformation in the bent regions.







Abstract
Electronic microdevices of self&#8208;bending coronene crystals are developed to reveal an unexplored link between mechanical deformation and crystal function. First, a facile approach towards length/width/curvature&#8208;controllable micro&#8208;crystals through bottom&#8208;up solution crystallization was proposed for high processability and stability. The bending crystal devices show a significant increase beyond seven orders of magnitude in conductivity than the straight ones, providing the first example of deformation&#8208;induced function enhancement in crystal materials. Besides, double effects caused by bending, including the change of &#960; electron level as well as the enhancement of carrier mobility, were determined, respectively by the X&#8208;ray photoelectric spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography to coexist, contributing to the conductivity improvement. Our findings will promote future creation of flexible organic crystal systems with deformation&#8208;enhanced functional features towards customized smart devices.

         <title>Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic constitutional frameworks are expressed in the presence of bacteria templating from dynamic covalent libraries made of aromatic cores, PEGylated connectors, and ionic heads. This templated DCFs further translates into the multivalent presentation of cationic heads, subsequently promoting antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.







Abstract
Dynamic constitutional frameworks (DCFs) were synthesized and screened for biofilm inhibition or disruption. They are composed of a trialdehyde core reversibly linked to a diamine PEG connector and to a variety of neutral, anionic, or cationic heads, to generate a library of DCFs to generate multivalent dendritic architectures in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The best DCFs were always polycationic and the nature of the cationic heads significantly impact the antibiofilm activity. The best antibiofilm activity was observed for DCF3B, displaying a polyethyleneimine head. A simple inactive guanidinium functional head strongly inhibited biofilm growth when assayed as a multivalent DCF3C. Using a more advanced in vitro biofilm model of chronic wound infection, DCF3C was found significantly superior than all other DCFs. These results demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of DCFs as low cost and efficient systems for antibiofilm disruption.

         <title>Discrete Heteropolynuclear Yb/Er Assemblies: Switching on Molecular Upconversion Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of discrete heteropolynuclear Yb/Er salts is switched from a Yb/Er doublet to competitive upconversion luminescence exploiting fluoride association. A more than 20&#8208;fold enhancement of the relative quantum yield &#981;UC under low power densities in non&#8208;deuterated solvents at room temperature was recorded.







Abstract
The salts {[Ln2Ln*(Hhmq)3(OAc)3(hfac)2]+ [Ln*(hfac)3(OAc)(MeOH)]&#8722;} (Hhmq=2&#8208;methanolquinolin&#8208;8&#8208;oxide, hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate; Ln, Ln*=Er, Gd, Yb) feature a discrete heteronuclear cation consisting of two types of lanthanide atoms. The quinolinoxy O&#8208;atom serves as a &#956;2&#8208;bridge to two Ln atoms and as a &#956;3&#8208;bridge to all three atoms, with metal&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal distances being around 3.7&#8197;&#197;. For 1 ([Yb2Er]+), near&#8208;infrared downshifted luminescence is switched to competitive upconversion luminescence upon irradiation by a 980&#8197;nm laser under an extremely low excitation power (0.288 W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) through introduction of fluoride ions. The stability of 1 after addition of fluoride was confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and multistage mass spectrometry, associated with the 1H&#8197;NMR of 6 ([La2Eu]+). More importantly, the at least 20&#8208;fold enhancement of the quantum yield in non&#8208;deuterated solvents at room temperature under low power densities (2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) is the highest among the few molecular examples reported.

         <title>Accelerated Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Alkene Hydrosilylation with Humic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Supported Electron Deficient Platinum Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrosilylation reaction is one of the largest&#8208;scale applications of homogeneous catalysis, and Pt homogeneous catalyst has been widely used in this reaction for the commercial manufacture of silicon products. However, homogeneous Pt catalysts results in considerable problems, such as undesired side reactions, unacceptable catalyst residues and disposable platinum consumption. Here, we synthesized electron deficient Pt single atoms supported on humic matter (Pt  1  @AHA_U_400), and the catalyst was used in hydrosilylation reaction, which showed super activity (turnover frequency as high as 3.0 &#215; 10  7  h  &#8208;1  ) and selectivity (&gt;99%). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the high performance of the catalyst results from the atomic dispersion of Pt and the electron deficiency of the Pt  1  atoms, which is different from conventional Pt nanoscale catalysts. Excellent performance is maintained during recycle experiments, indicating the high stability of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalysed Transfer&#8208;Hydrogenation for the Reductive Cyclisation of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Enones towards Trisubstituted Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indium tribromide catalysed the transfer&#8208;hydrogenation from dihydroaromatic compounds, such as the commercially available &#947;&#8208;terpinene, to enones which resulted in the cyclisation to trisubstituted furan derivatives. The reaction was initiated by a Michael addition of a hydride nucleophile to the enone subunit followed by a Lewis&#8208;acid assisted cyclisation and the formation of a furan&#8208;indium intermediate and a Wheland intermediate derived from the dihydroaromatic starting material. The product was formed by protonation from the Wheland complex and replaced the indium tribromide substituent.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Indium tribromide catalysed the transfer-hydrogenation from dihydroaromatic compounds, such as the commercially available &#947;-terpinene, to enones which resulted in the cyclisation to trisubstituted furan derivatives. The reaction was initiated by a Michael addition of a hydride nucleophile to the enone subunit followed by a Lewis-acid assisted cyclisation and the formation of a furan-indium intermediate and a Wheland intermediate derived from the dihydroaromatic starting material. The product was formed by protonation from the Wheland complex and replaced the indium tribromide substituent. In addition, a site specific deuterium labelling of the dihydroaromatic HD surrogates resulted in site specific labelling of the products and gave useful insights into the reaction mechanism by H-D scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Radical Covalent Organic Frameworks as Highly Efficient and Stable Catalysts for Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) decorated with nitroxyl radicals are successfully prepared and employed as mild, efficient, and recyclable catalysts for selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.







Abstract
With excellent designability, large accessible inner surface, and high chemical stability, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates as metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we report two 3D radical&#8208;based COFs (JUC&#8208;565 and JUC&#8208;566) in which radical moieties (TEMPO) are uniformly decorated on the channel walls via a bottom&#8208;up approach. Based on grafted functional groups and suitable regular channels, these materials open up the application of COFs as highly efficient and selective metal&#8208;free redox catalysts in aerobic oxidation of alcohols to relevant aldehydes or ketones with outstanding turn over frequency (TOF) up to 132&#8197;h&#8722;1, which has exceeded other TEMPO&#8208;modified catalytic materials tested under similar conditions. These stable COF&#8208;based catalysts could be easily recovered and reused for multiple runs. This study promotes potential applications of 3D functional COFs anchored with stable radicals in organic synthesis and material science.

         <title>Tertiary Chiral Nanostructures from C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F Directed Assembly of Chiroptical Superatoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tertiary chiral nanostructures have been created by assembling chiroptical superatoms of [Au7Ag6Cu2(S&#8208; or R&#8208;BINAP)3(SCH2Ph)6]+ (BINAP=2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl). Both metal framework (primary structure) and surface ligands (secondary) of the nanocluster display perfect mirror symmetry. C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding between the clusters and SbF6&#8722; counterions direct formation of left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed helices.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and structure of tertiary chiral nanostructures with 100&#8201;% optical purity. A novel synthetic strategy, using chiral reducing agent, R and S&#8208;BINAPCuBH4 (BINAP is 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl), is developed to access to atomically precise, intrinsically chiral [Au7Ag6Cu2(R&#8208; or S&#8208;BINAP)3(SCH2Ph)6]SbF6 nanoclusters in one&#8208;pot synthesis. The clusters represent the first tri&#8208;metallic superatoms with inherent chirality and fair stability. Both metal distribution (primary) and ligand arrangement (secondary) of the enantiomers exhibited perfect mirror images, and unprecedentedly, the self&#8208;assembly driven by the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction between the phenyl groups of the superatom moieties and SbF6&#8722; anions induced the formation of bio&#8208;mimic left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helices, achieving the tertiary chiral nanostructures. DFT calculations revealed the connections between the molecular details and chiral optical activity.

         <title>Ambimodal Transition States in Diels&#8722;Alder Cycloadditions of Tropolone and Tropolonate with N&#8208;Methylmaleimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of tropolone and its conjugate base with N&#8208;methylmaleimide have been explored computationally and experimentally. Previous studies of the [4+2] cycloaddition under basic conditions show that both endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;products are obtained in similar, but variable amounts. Density functional theory (  w  B97X&#8208;D) explorations of potential energy surfaces, and molecular dynamics trajectories show that the reaction involves an ambimodal transition state for the reaction of the ammonium tropolonate with N&#8208;methylmaleimide, and that similar amounts of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;products are obtained. The thermal reaction, studied experimentally in detail here for the first time, is predicted to form the endo&#8208;adduct through an ambimodal transition state. The exo&#8208;adduct can be formed from the same transition state, but requires a hydrogen shift, that hinders this reaction dynamically. Longer reaction times give a small excess of the exo&#8208;product, which is thermodynamically more stable.</dc:description>

         <title>The Anionic Pathway in Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl ethers is a powerful methodology to forge new C&#8208;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. However, the inert C(  sp  2  )&#8208;O bond means that a canonical mechanism relying on oxidative addition of the aryl ether to Ni  0  is thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable, suggesting alternative mechanisms may be involved. Here, we provide spectroscopic and structural insights into the&#160;  anionic pathway  &#160;which relies on the formation of electron&#8208;rich heterobimetallic nickelates from adding organometallic nucleophiles to Ni  0  . By assessing the rich co&#8208;complexation chemistry between Ni(COD)  2  &#160;and PhLi, the structures and solution&#8208;state chemistry of a diverse family of catalytically competent lithium nickelates is unveiled. In addition, we demonstrate dramatic solvent and donor effects which suggests that the cooperative activation of the aryl ether substrate by Ni  0  &#8208;ate complexes play a key role in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling of aliphatic N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters with polyfluoroaryl nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyfluoroarenes are an important class of compounds in medical and material chemistry. The synthesis of alkylated polyfluoroarenes remains challenging. Here we describe a decarboxylative coupling reaction of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids with polyfluoroaryl zinc reagents (Zn&#8208;Ar  F  ) via synergetic photoredox and copper catalysis. This method readily converts primary and secondary alkyl carboxylic acids into the corresponding polyfluoroaryl compounds, which could have a wide range of F&#8208;content (2F &#8208;5F) and variable F&#8208;substitution patterns on the aryl groups. Broad scope and good functional group compatibility were achieved, including on substrates derived from natural products and pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic study revealed that an anionic [Cu&#8208;(Ar  F  )  2  ] species could be responsible for the transfer of polyfluoroaryl groups to the alkyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ganglioside GD2 is an attractive tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigen for anti&#8208;cancer vaccine development.

         <title>Conformational adaptation of &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers for the formation of metal&#8208;peptide frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;coordinated frameworks derived from small peptidic ligands have received much attention thanks to peptides' vast structural and functional diversity. Various peptides with partial conformational preferences have been used to build metal&#8208;peptide frameworks, however, the use of conformationally constrained &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers has not been explored yet. Herein we report the first metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;mediated assembly of &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers with 12&#8208;helical folding propensity. The coordination of Ag+ to the terminal pyridyl moieties afforded a set of metal&#8208;peptide frameworks with unique entangled topologies. Interestingly, formation of the network structures was accompanied by notable conformational distortions of the foldamer ligands. As the first demonstration of new metal&#8208;peptide frameworks built from modular &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers, we anticipate that this work will be an important benchmark for further structural evolution and mechanistic investigation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes exhibit various biological activities and are widely present in eukaryotes. Here, we completely elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of the drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene esters isolated from  Aspergillus calidoustus  and we discovered that it involves a drimenol cyclase having the same catalytic function previously only reported in plants. Moreover, since many fungal drimenol derivatives possess a &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone ring, we clarified the functions of the cluster&#8208;associated cytochrome P450 and FAD&#8208;binding oxidoreductase discovering that these two enzymes are solely responsible for the formation of those structures. Furthermore, swapping of the enoyl&#8208;reductase domain in the identified polyketide synthase led to the production of metabolites containing various polyketide chains with different levels of saturations. These findings have deepened our understanding of how fungi synthesize drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes and the corresponding esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Relaxation Dispersion of Hyperpolarized 13C Spins to Protein&#8208;Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear spin relaxation dispersion parameters are proposed as indicators of the binding mode of a ligand to a protein. Hyperpolarization by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (D&#8208;DNP) provided a  13  C signal enhancement between 3000&#8208;6000 for the ligand 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl) benzene&#8208;1&#8208;carboximidamide binding to trypsin. The measurement of  13  C  R  2  relaxation dispersion was enabled without isotope enrichment, using a series of single&#8208;scan Carr&#8208;Purcell&#8208;Meiboom&#8208;Gill experiments with variable refocusing delays. The magnitude in dispersion for the spins of the ligand is correlated to the position with respect to the salt bridge between protein and the amidine group of the ligand, indicating the ligand binding orientation. Hyperpolarized relaxation dispersion is an alternative to chemical shift or NOE measurements for determining ligand binding modes.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as Molecular Sieve for Highly Selective Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene on Isolated Single Pd Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly selective acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation is realized using a polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework supported single Pd atom catalyst by creating dynamic confinement regions which preferentially adsorb acetylene from acetylene/ethylene gas mixtures and release the produced ethylene. This catalyst combines the advantages of MOFs for gas separation and single atomic sites for catalysis.







Abstract
Achieving highly selective acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation in an ethylene&#8208;rich gas stream is of great industrial importance. Herein, we construct isolated single Pd atom in a polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (POMOF). The unique internal environment allows this POMOF to separate acetylene from acetylene/ethylene gas mixtures and confine it close to the single Pd atom. After semi&#8208;hydrogenation, the resulting ethylene is preferentially discharged from the pores, achieving a selectivity of 92.6&#8201;%. First&#8208;principles simulations reveal that the adsorbed acetylene/ethylene molecules form hydrogen bond networks with oxygen atoms of SiW12O404&#8722; and create dynamic confinement regions, which preferentially release the produced ethylene. Besides, at the Pd site, the over&#8208;hydrogenation of ethylene exhibits a higher reaction energy barrier than the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene. The combined advantages of POMOF and single Pd atom provides an effective approach for the regulation of semi&#8208;hydrogenation selectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here an asymmetric decarboxylative allylation reaction initiated by the hydrocarboxylation reaction of heteroatom&#8208;substituted allene. The reaction works particularly well with heteroatom&#8208;substituted allenes such as alkoxyallenes and amidoallenes. A number of aryl and alkyl &#946;&#8208;keto acids as well as malonic acid mono&#8208;phenyl ester participates in the reaction to generate &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds possessing stereogenic heteroatom substituents at the &#946;&#8208;position.

         <title>Probing the Extremes of Covalency in M&#8722;Al bonds: Lithium and Zinc Aluminyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of the first example of a molecular compound featuring a Li&#8722;Al bond and a systematic analysis of the bonding in this and related Mg and Zn systems through structural, quantum&#8208;chemical, and reactivity probes.







Abstract
Synthetic routes to lithium, magnesium, and zinc aluminyl complexes are reported, allowing for the first structural characterization of an unsupported lithium&#8211;aluminium bond. Crystallographic and quantum&#8208;chemical studies are consistent with the presence of a highly polar Li&#8722;Al interaction, characterized by a low bond order and relatively little charge transfer from Al to Li. Comparison with magnesium and zinc aluminyl systems reveals changes to both the M&#8722;Al bond and the (NON)Al fragment (where NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene), consistent with a more covalent character, with the latter complex being shown to react with CO2 via a pathway that implies that the zinc centre acts as the nucleophilic partner.

     alt="Probing the Extremes of Covalency in M&#8722;Al bonds: Lithium and Zinc Aluminyl Compounds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of the first example of a molecular compound featuring a Li&#8722;Al bond and a systematic analysis of the bonding in this and related Mg and Zn systems through structural, quantum-chemical, and reactivity probes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic routes to lithium, magnesium, and zinc aluminyl complexes are reported, allowing for the first structural characterization of an unsupported lithium&#8211;aluminium bond. Crystallographic and quantum-chemical studies are consistent with the presence of a highly polar Li&#8722;Al interaction, characterized by a low bond order and relatively little charge transfer from Al to Li. Comparison with magnesium and zinc aluminyl systems reveals changes to both the M&#8722;Al bond and the (NON)Al fragment (where NON=4,5-bis(2,6-diisopropylanilido)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethylxanthene), consistent with a more covalent character, with the latter complex being shown to react with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via a pathway that implies that the zinc centre acts as the nucleophilic partner.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Regio&#8208;controllable Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation/Hydroboration of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;controllable sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of alkynes has been developed with complete control of all the possible regioselectivities for the double addition processes (up to &gt;20/1 rr for all the cases). Various silylboronate regioisomers can be efficiently obtained from the same materials, with good functional group tolerance, regioselectivities as well as atom and pot economy.







Abstract
Regiodivergent addition reactions provide straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approaches to access different regioisomers. However, the regio&#8208;chemistry control to access all the possible results is still challenging especially for the reaction involving multiple addition steps. Herein, we reported regio&#8208;controllable cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of arylacetylenes, delivering all the possible regio&#8208;outcomes with high regioselectivities (up to &gt;20/1 rr for all the cases). Each regioisomer of value&#8208;added silylboronates could be efficiently and regioselectively obtained from the same materials. The adjustment of the ligands of cobalt catalysts combined with dual catalysis relay strategy is the key to achieve regio&#8208;chemistry control. This regio&#8208;controllable research might inspire the exploration of the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis that involves multiple additions and provide full sets of regioisomers of other synthetic useful molecules.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aza&#8208;Sonogashira Cross&#8208;Coupling to Ynimines: Development and Application to the Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen substituted alkynes such as ynamines and ynamides are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic chemistry. Ynimines bearing additional nucleophilic and electrophilic centers relative to ynamines and ynamides are expected to have high synthetic potential. However, their chemical reactivity remains unexplored due mainly to the lack of synthetic accessibility. We report herein a versatile Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ynimines from readily available O&#8208;acetyl ketoximes and terminal alkynes. A wide range of O&#8208;acetyl ketoximes derived from diaryl ketones, aryl alkyl ketones and dialkyl ketones undergo cross&#8208;coupling with a diverse set of terminal alkynes to afford the ynimines in good to excellent isolated yields. An unprecedented [5+1] heteroannulation reaction exploiting the reactivity of the in situ generated ynimine is subsequently developed for the synthesis of medicinally important heterocycles including isoquinolines, aza&#8208;indoles, aza&#8208;benzofurans, aza&#8208;benzothiophenes and carbolines. We anticipate that this robust synthesis of ynimines would open an avenue for the exploration of this functionally rich building block  .</dc:description>

         <title>Dissection of the Polar and Non&#8208;Polar Contributions to Aromatic Stacking Interactions in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic stacking interactions have been a matter of study and debate due to their crucial role in chemical and biological systems. The strong dependence on orientation and solvent together with the relatively small interaction energies have made evaluation and rationalization a challenge for experimental and theoretical chemists. We have used a supramolecular cage formed by two tris(pyridylmethyl)amines units to build chemical Double Mutant Cycles (DMC) for the experimental measurement of the free energies of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Extrapolating the substituent effects to remove the contribution due to electrostatic interactions reveals that there is a substantial contribution to the measured stacking interaction energies which is due to non&#8208;polar interactions (&#8208;3 to &#8208;6 kJ mol&#8208;1). The perfectly flat nature of the surface of an aromatic ring gives &#960;&#8208;stacking an inherent advantage over non&#8208;polar interactions with alkyl groups and accounts for the wide&#8208;spread prevalence of stacking interactions in Nature.</dc:description>

Extrapolating the substituent effects to remove the contribution due to electrostatic interactions reveals that there is a substantial contribution to the measured stacking interaction energies which is due to non-polar interactions (-3 to -6 kJ mol-1). The perfectly flat nature of the surface of an aromatic ring gives &#960;-stacking an inherent advantage over non-polar interactions with alkyl groups and accounts for the wide-spread prevalence of stacking interactions in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrapyrrolic Pigments from Heme&#8208; and Chlorophyll Breakdown are Actin&#8208;Targeting Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physiological role of the degradation products of chlorophyll and heme, exogenous phyllobilins and endogenous bilins, respectively, remained an unsolved mystery for decades. We describe the influence of these tetrapyrroles on the actin cytoskeleton and introduce G&#8208;actin as the first human target protein for phyllobilins and a novel target for bilins. This study opens up a new perspective of the importance of these ubiquitous natural products.







Abstract
Chlorophyll and heme are among the &#8220;pigments of life&#8221;, tetrapyrrolic structures, without which life on Earth would not be possible. Their catabolites, the phyllobilins and the bilins, respectively, share not only structural features, but also a similar story: Long considered waste products of detoxification processes, important bioactivities for both classes have now been demonstrated. For phyllobilins, however, research on physiological roles is sparse. Here, we introduce actin, the major component of the cytoskeleton, as the first discovered target of phyllobilins and as a novel target of bilins. We demonstrate the inhibition of actin dynamics in vitro and effects on actin and related processes in cancer cells. A direct interaction with G&#8208;actin is shown by in silico studies and confirmed by affinity chromatography. Our findings open a new chapter in bioactivities of tetrapyrroles&#8212;especially phyllobilins&#8212;for which they form the basis for broad implications in plant science, ecology, and physiology.

         <title>An Air&#8208; and Water&#8208;Stable B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalene Serving as a Host Material for a Phosphorescent OLED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Replacement of the carbon&#8211;carbon bonds of antiaromatic compounds with polar boron&#8211;nitrogen bonds often provides the resultant isoelectronic BN&#8208;compounds with excellent thermodynamic stability and interesting photophysical properties. Based on this element&#8208;substitution strategy, we synthesized a new B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene derivative (1), which is fully substituted with mesityl groups. Due to the kinetic protection by the sterically bulky substituents,  1  is remarkably stable toward air and even water. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of  1  first revealed the bonding characters of&#160;B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene. In a glassy matrix,  1  emits short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence with an onset at 350 nm, indicating that the triplet energy is substantially high. DFT calculations reasonably explained the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state electronic structures of  1  as well as its emission properties. Motivated by the fact that  1  features a high&#8208;energy triplet state, we fabricated a phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode using  1  as a host material, where the external quantum efficiency reached 15%.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Composites with Ordered Macropores and Hollow Walls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks provide versatile templates for the fabrication of various metal/carbon materials, but most of the derived composites possess only microspores, limiting the accessibility of embedded active sites. Herein, we report the construction of cobalt/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon composites with a three&#8208;dimensional&#8208; (3D&#8208;) ordered macroporous and hollow&#8208;wall structure (H&#8208;3DOM&#8208;Co/NC) using a single&#8208;crystal ordered macropore&#8208; (SOM&#8208;) ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 as precursor. During the pyrolysis, the interconnected macroporous structure of SOM&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 is mostly preserved, while the pore wall achieves a solid&#8208;to&#8208;hollow transformation with Co nanoparticles formed in the hollow walls. The 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous carbon skeleton may effectively promote long&#8208;range mass transfer and the hollow wall can facilitate local accessibility of active sites. This unique structure can greatly boost its catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfural to cyclopentanol, much superior to its counterparts without this well&#8208;designed hierarchically porous structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on Pd3Bi Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform nanocrystals of intermetallic or solid&#8211;solution Pd3Bi alloy are prepared and demonstrated to exhibit intriguing phase dependence during electrochemical CO2 reduction in aqueous solution. The former can achieve unity formate selectivity and great CO poisoning resistance, while the latter has limited formate selectivity of &lt;60&#8201;%.







Abstract
Alloying is a general strategy for modulating the electronic structures of catalyst materials. Compared to more common solid&#8211;solution alloys, intermetallic alloys feature well&#8208;defined atomic arrangements and provide the unique platform for studying the structure&#8208;performance correlations. It is, unfortunately, synthetically challenging to prepare the nanostructures of intermetallic alloys for catalysis research. In this contribution, we prepare intermetallic Pd3Bi nanocrystals of a uniform size via a facile solvothermal method. These nanocrystals can phase&#8208;transform into solid solution alloy via thermal annealing while retaining a similar composition and size. In 0.1&#8197;M KHCO3 aqueous solution, the intermetallic Pd3Bi can selectively reduce CO2 to formate with high selectivity (&#8776;100&#8201;%) and stability even at &lt;&#8208;0.35&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, whereas the solid solution alloy has limited formate selectivity of &lt;60&#8201;%. Such unique phase&#8208;dependence is understood via theoretical simulations showing that the crystallographic ordering of Pd and Bi atoms within intermetallic alloys can suppress CO poisoning and enhance the *OCHO adsorption during electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate.

         <title>A Wireframe DNA Cube: Antibody Conjugate for Targeted Delivery of Multiple Copies of Monomethyl Auristatin&#8197;E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for preparation of an antibody, DNA wireframe cube, drug conjugate with exactly seven copies of the cytotoxic drug MMAE is presented. The drug is conjugated to a DNA strand via a cleavable linker and the conjugate is used for preparing a DNA wireframe cube. The drug loaded cube is furthermore attached to the antibody Trastuzumab. The construct is used for targeted drug delivery of MMAE to a HER2 positive cell line in vitro and a dramatic decline in viability is observed only for cells that overexpress the HER2 receptor.







Abstract
In recent years, several antibody drug conjugates (ADC) have been accepted by the FDA as therapeutics against cancer. It is well&#8208;known that control of drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) is vital for the success of an ADC, which inspires the advancement of better and simpler methods for tight control of DAR. We present the development of an antibody DNA wireframe cube conjugate for precise control of DAR. The DNA wireframe cube consists of four single strands, which when folded present eight single stranded domains. One domain is bound to a monofunctionalized antibody DNA conjugate, and the seven others are attached to DNA functionalized with the potent tubulin inhibitor MMAE, thereby preparing an ADC with a DAR of precisely seven. The formation of the ADC is investigated by gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy. Lastly, the developed MMAE loaded ADC was used for targeted drug delivery in vitro.

         <title>Feedback and Communication in Active Hydrogel Spheres with pH Fronts: Facile Approaches to Grow Soft Hydrogel Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
pH fronts are generated from feedback&#8208;controlled reaction networks encapsulated in hydrogel spheres. The pH front/reaction diffusion chemistry is utilized to understand the systems such as membrane activity and inter&#8208;sphere communication. Further, its potential to develop smart self&#8208;growing materials as 2D and 3D hydrogel structures is showcased as an alternative to 3D printing tool.







Abstract
Compartmentalized reaction networks regulating signal processing, communication and pattern formation are central to living systems. Towards achieving life&#8208;like materials, we compartmentalized urea&#8208;urease and more complex urea&#8208;urease/ester&#8208;esterase pH&#8208;feedback reaction networks into hydrogel spheres and investigate how fuel&#8208;driven pH fronts can be sent out from these spheres and regulated by internal reaction networks. Membrane characteristics are installed by covering urease spheres with responsive hydrogel shells. We then encapsulate the two networks (urea&#8208;urease and ester&#8208;esterase) separately into different hydrogel spheres to devise communication, pattern formation and attraction. Moreover, these pH fronts and patterns can be used for self&#8208;growing hydrogels, and for developing complex geometries from non&#8208;injectable hydrogels without 3D printing tools. This study opens possibilities for compartmentalized feedback reactions and their use in next generation materials fabrication.

         <title>Controlling Coagulation in Blood with Red Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered aptamer with a Cy7&#8208;based photocleavable linker can be used as anticoagulant. With tissue&#8208;penetrating red light, the aptamer is cleaved, and blood clotting is restored in human whole blood.







Abstract
Precise control of blood clotting and rapid reversal of anticoagulation are essential in many clinical situations. We were successful in modifying a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer with a red&#8208;light photocleavable linker derived from Cy7 by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Click chemistry. We were able to show that we can successfully deactivate the modified aptamer with red light (660&#8197;nm) even in human blood&#8212;restoring the blood's natural coagulation capability.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane to Ethylene in a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate efficient electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane at anode in conjunction with CO2 electrolysis at cathode in a solid oxide electrolyzer at reduced temperature.







Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene is an important process in light olefin industry; however, the over&#8208;oxidation of ethane leads to low ethylene selectivity. Here, we report a novel approach to electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in anode in conjunction with CO2 reduction at cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser using a porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 electrode at 600&#8201;&#176;C. We identify and engineer the flux and chemical states of active oxygen species that evolve from the lattice at anode surface to activate and dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene via the reaction of epoxy species. Active oxygen species (O2&#8722;, O22&#8722; and O2&#8722;) at the anode surface effectively dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene, but O&#8722; species tend to induce deep oxidation. We demonstrate exceptionally high ethylene selectivity of 95&#8201;% and an ethane conversion of 10&#8201;% with a durable operation of 300&#8197;h.

         <title>The First High&#8208;Pressure Chromium Oxonitridoborate CrB4O6N&#8212;an Unexpected Link to Nitridosilicate&#8208;Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature approach, CrB4O6N could be obtained as the first oxonitridoborate containing BO3N tetrahedra and building up a 3D framework. In contrast to other members of this substance class, the nitrogen atoms connect four boron atoms. Homeotypes can be found in the nitridosilicates MYbSi4N7 (M=Sr, Ba, Eu), which were the first to feature this fourfold connected nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
CrB4O6N crystallizes in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P63mc (no. 186) with the lattice parameters a=5.1036(1), c=8.3519(3)&#8197;&#197;, and a volume of 188.40(1)&#8197;&#197;3. It was synthesized in a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature experiment at 7&#8197;GPa and 1673&#8197;K and represents the first high&#8208;pressure oxonitridoborate. It is built up of starlike&#8208;shaped entities of four BO3N tetrahedra, connected via one common nitrogen atom that resembles the fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen atoms in the homeotypic nitridosilicates MYbSi4N7 (M=Sr, Ba). Building up a network with channels that contain the Cr3+ ions, CrB4O6N contains for the first time a tetrahedral building unit in contrast to trigonal planar B(O/N)3 entities in all other known oxonitridoborates. The structural relations as well as the results of spectroscopic measurements and calculations on the chromium oxonitridoborate are discussed.

         <title>Brightening up Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Monosubstituted Polyacetylene by Conformation Control: Mechanism, Switching, and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is described that enables the conventionally non&#8208;luminescent monosubstituted polyacetylenes bearing no pendant fluorophore to light up and show a switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a large dissymmetric factor (glum, 10&#8722;1), multiple reversible stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and quantitative detection by conformational transition of polyene backbone.







Abstract
The first example of luminescent monosubstituted polyacetylenes (mono&#8208;PAs) is presented, based on a contracted cis&#8208;cisoid polyene backbone. It has an excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performance with a high dissymmetric factor (up to the order of 10&#8722;1). The luminescence stems from the helical cis&#8208;cisoid PA backbone, which is tightly fixed by the strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thereby reversing the energy order of excited states and enabling an emissive energy dissipation. CPL switches are facilely achieved by the solvent and temperature through reversible conformational transition. By taking advantages of fast response and high sensitivity, the thin film of mono&#8208;PAs could be used as a CPL&#8208;based probe for quantitative detection of trifluoroacetic acid with a wider linear dynamic range than those of photoluminescence and circular dichroism. This work opens a new avenue to develop novel smart CPL materials through modulating conformational transition.

Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;carboboration of ynamides is presented. Readily available aryldichloroboranes react with alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted ynamides in high yields with complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity to valuable &#946;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkyl/aryl &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted enamides which belong to the class of trisubstituted alkenylboronates. The 1,2&#8208;carboboration reaction is experimentally easy to conduct, shows high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Gram&#8208;scale reactions and diverse synthetic transformations convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method. The reaction can also be used to access 1&#8208;boraphenalenes, a class of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Polymer Topology Reinforced Synergistic Interactions among Nanoscale Molecular Clusters for Impact Resistance with Facile Processability and Recoverability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique physical interaction facilitated by 1D topologies of molecular cluster&#8208;integrated polymers is applied for the design of impact&#8208;resistant materials with exceptional energy dissipation capability and strong rate&#8208;dependent mechanical strengths, enabling the simultaneous achievement of promising impact resistance and processability/recoverability.







Abstract
The intrinsic conflicts between mechanical performances and processability are main challenges to develop cost&#8208;effective impact&#8208;resistant materials from polymers and their composites. Herein, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSSs) are integrated as side chains to the polymer backbones. The one&#8208;dimension (1D) rigid topology imposes strong space confinements to realize synergistic interactions among POSS units, reinforcing the correlations among polymer chains. The afforded composites demonstrate unprecedented mechanical properties with ultra&#8208;stretchability, high rate&#8208;dependent strength, superior impact&#8208;resistant capacity as well as feasible processability/recoverability. The hierarchical structures of the hybrid polymers enable the co&#8208;existence of multiple dynamic relaxations that are responsible for fast energy dissipation and high mechanical strengths. The effective synergistic correlation strategy paves a new pathway for the design of advanced cluster&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Electrochemical Nitric Oxide Reduction on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An illustration of selectivity and activity on metals for nitric oxide reduction reaction is presented. Both selectivity and activity of NO reduction has been indicated by *N adsorption energy. There is a very little window to find both selective and active catalyst for the NO reduction in the volcano.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic denitrification is a promising technology for removing NOx species (NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722; and NO). For NOx electroreduction (NOxRR), there is a desire for understanding the catalytic parameters that control the product distribution. Here, we elucidate selectivity and activity of catalyst for NOxRR. At low potential we classify metals by the binding of *NO versus *H. Analogous to classifying CO2 reduction by *CO vs. *H, Cu is able to bind *NO while not binding *H giving rise to a selective NH3 formation. Besides being selective, Cu is active for the reaction found by an activity&#8208;volcano. For metals that does not bind NO the reaction stops at NO, similar to CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. At potential above 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, we speculate a low barrier for N coupling with NO causing N2O formation. The work provides a clear strategy for selectivity and aims to inspire future research on NOxRR.

         <title>Myxadazoles, Myxobacterium&#8208;Derived Isoxazole&#8211;Benzimidazole Hybrids with Cardiovascular Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report myxadazoles from Myxococcus sp. SDU36, a family of novel chimeric small molecules with sound cardiovascular activities. Myxadazoles consist of a N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole and a fatty acid chain endowed with an isoxazole ring. The fatty acid chain was encoded by a non&#8208;canonical PKS/NRPS gene cluster, whereas the N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole ring was originated from the endogenous vitamin B12 metabolism pathway. A plausible C&#8722;N cross coupling is likely to coordinate the convergence of these two distinct biosynthetic pathways that led to the final construction of the unique chemical scaffold of myxadazoles.







Abstract
There is a continuous need for novel microbial natural products to fill the drying&#8208;up drug development pipeline. Herein, we report myxadazoles from Myxococcus sp. SDU36, a family of novel chimeric small molecules that consist of N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole and a linear fatty acid chain endowed with an isoxazole ring. The experiments of genome sequencing, gene insertion mutation, isotope labelling, and precursor feeding demonstrated that the fatty acid chain was encoded by a non&#8208;canonical PKS/NRPS gene cluster, whereas the origin of N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole was related to the vitamin B12 metabolism. The convergence of these two distinct biosynthetic pathways through a C&#8208;N coupling led to the unique chemical framework of myxadazoles, which is an unprecedented hybridization mode in the paradigm of natural products. Myxadazoles exhibited potent vasculogenesis promotion effect and moderate antithrombotic activity, underscoring their potential usage for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

         <title>Intermetallic FePt@PtBi Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles for Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intermetallic FePt@PtBi electrocatalyst with a L10&#8208;FePt core and a PtBi shell shows excellent ORR performance and stability, which are attributed to superimposed strain. Even after 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, the activity of the FePt@PtBi electrocatalyst is still as high as 0.79&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1, comfortably exceeding the DOE 2020 targets. Moreover, FePt@PtBi shows a better tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide than benchmark Pt/C.







Abstract
The development of active and stable platinum (Pt)&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts with good resistance to poisoning is a prerequisite for widespread practical application of fuel cells. An effective strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance is to tune or control the physicochemical state of the Pt surface. Herein, we show a general surface&#8208;engineering approach to prepare a range of nanostructured Pt alloys by coating with alloy PtBi shells. FePt@PtBi core&#8211;shell nanoparticles showed the best ORR performance with a mass activity of 0.96&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and a specific activity of 2.06&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively 7&#8197;times and 11&#8197;times those of the corresponding values for benchmark Pt/C. Moreover, FePt@PtBi shows much better tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide than conventional Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The observed comprehensive enhancement in ORR performance of FePt@PtBi can be attributed to the increased compressive strain of the Pt surface due to in&#8208;plane shearing resulting from the presence of the large Bi atoms in the surface&#8208;structured PtBi overlayers, as well as charge displacement via Pt&#8208;Bi bonding which mitigates crossover issues.

         <title>Construction of Co&#8211;Mn Prussian Blue Analog Hollow Spheres for Efficient Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;rich Prussian Blue Analog (PBA) hollow spheres (CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs) are rationally designed and synthesized through an efficient self&#8208;templating approach. Benefiting from the hollow structure and partial Co substitution, the CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs electrode exhibits enhanced zinc ion storage performance with high capacity, favorable rate capability, and impressive cycling stability.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are considered as reliable and promising cathode materials for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), but they suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to insufficient active sites and structural damage caused by the ion insertion/extraction processes. Herein, a template&#8208;engaged ion exchange approach has been developed for the synthesis of Co&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;rich PBA hollow spheres (CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs) as cathode materials for AZIBs. Benefiting from the multiple advantageous features including hollow structure, abundant active sites, fast Zn2+ ion diffusion, and partial Co substitution, the CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs electrode shows efficient zinc ion storage properties in terms of high capacity, decent rate capability and prolonged cycle life.

         <title>Cycloadditions with a Stable Charge&#8208;Separated Cyclobutadiene&#8208;Type Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon Ring Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive debromination of {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 with activated magnesium yields a cyclobutadiene&#8208;type silicon ring compound 2 with a charge&#8208;separated electronic situation, which undergoes cycloadditions with alkenes and alkynes to yield unsaturated bicyclic and tricyclic silicon ring compounds with Si=Si and/or C=C double bonds (3&#8211;6).







Abstract
Reductive debromination of {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 with Rieke magnesium results in the formation of the five&#8208;vertex silicon cluster with one bromine substituent Si5{N(SiMe3)2}5Br, 1, and the cyclobutadiene analogue 2 in a 1:1 ratio. The latter features a planar four&#8208;membered silicon ring with a charge&#8208;separated electronic situation. Two silicon atoms in 2 are trigonal planar and the other two trigonal pyramidal. In cycloadditions with ethylene, diethylacetylene, 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, and 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene cyclic unsaturated ring compounds (3&#8211;6) were formed at room temperature in quantitative reactions. Two of the products (3 and 6) show photochemical isomerization with LED light (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) to afford saturated ring compounds 4&#8201;e and 6&#8242;.

&lt;p&gt;Reductive debromination of {N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}SiBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with Rieke magnesium results in the formation of the five-vertex silicon cluster with one bromine substituent Si&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;{N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Br, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, and the cyclobutadiene analogue &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in a 1:1 ratio. The latter features a planar four-membered silicon ring with a charge-separated electronic situation. Two silicon atoms in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; are trigonal planar and the other two trigonal pyramidal. In cycloadditions with ethylene, diethylacetylene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, and 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene cyclic unsaturated ring compounds (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) were formed at room temperature in quantitative reactions. Two of the products (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) show photochemical isomerization with LED light (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) to afford saturated ring compounds &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;e&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&#8242;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Methane: Recent Advancements and Prospects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of methane driven by solar energy offers a promising approach to directly transform methane into valuable energy sources under mild conditions, but remains a great challenge. This Review highlights recent advances in the photocatalytic conversion of methane and gives insights into the design of effective semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts and classifies the photooxidations according to the oxidants in the reaction system.







Abstract
Abundant and affordable methane is not only a high&#8208;quality fossil fuel, it is also a raw material for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven conversion of methane offers a promising approach to directly transform methane to valuable energy sources under mild conditions, but remains a great challenge at present. In this Review, recent advances in the photocatalytic conversion of methane are systematically summarized. Insights into the construction of effective semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts from the perspective of light&#8208;absorption units and active centers are highlighted and discussed in detail. The performance of various photocatalysts in the conversion of methane is presented, with the photooxidation classified according to the oxidant systems. Lastly, challenges and future perspectives in the photocatalytic oxidation of methane are described.

         <title>Contrasting E&#8722;H Bond Activation Pathways of a Phosphanyl&#8208;Phosphagallene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the synthesis and reactivity of a phosphanyl phosphagallene towards reagents with protic and hydridic E&#8722;H bonds. These studies reveal that there are two competing reactivity pathways available for such bond activation reactions: a frustrated Lewis pair type of mechanism, and a competing pathway which results in the hydroelementation of the Ga=P double bond.







Abstract
The reactivity of the phosphanyl&#8208;phosphagallene, [H2C{N(Dipp)}]2PP=Ga(Nacnac) (Nacnac=HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) towards a series of reagents possessing E&#8722;H bonds (primary amines, ammonia, water, phenylacetylene, phenylphosphine, and phenylsilane) is reported. Two contrasting reaction pathways are observed, determined by the polarity of the E&#8722;H bonds of the substrates. In the case of protic reagents (&#948;&#8722;E&#8722;H&#948;+), a frustrated Lewis pair type of mechanism is operational at room temperature, in which the gallium metal centre acts as a Lewis acid and the pendant phosphanyl moiety deprotonates the substrates. Interestingly, at elevated temperatures both NH2iPr and ammonia can react via a second, higher energy, pathway resulting in the hydroamination of the Ga=P bond. By contrast, with hydridic reagents (&#948;+E&#8722;H&#948;&#8722;), such as phenylsilane, hydroelementation of the Ga=P bond is exclusively observed, in line with the polarisation of the Si&#8722;H and Ga=P bonds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Radical Hydro&#8208; and Aminooxygenation of Unactivated Alkenes Tuned by Ketoxime Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable protocol for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208; and aminooxygenation of unactivated olefins under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has been developed. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is initiated through an energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated N&#8722;O bond homolysis of ketoxime carbonates, followed by an oxygen&#8208;centered radical addition.







Abstract
A tunable photocatalytic method is reported for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208; and aminooxygenation of unactivated alkenes using readily accessible ketoxime carbonates as the diverse functionalization reagents. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is initiated through an energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;promoted N&#8722;O bond homolysis of ketoxime carbonates leading to alkoxylcarbonyloxyl and iminyl radicals under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, followed by the addition of alkoxylcarbonyloxyl radical to alkenes. By taking advantage of the different stability of the iminyl radicals, the generated carbon radical either abstracts a hydrogen atom from the media to form the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrooxygenation product, or it is trapped by the persistent iminyl radical to furnish the aminooxygenation product. Notably, this is the first example of direct hydrooxygenation of unactivated olefins with anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity involving an oxygen&#8208;centered radical.

         <title>Integrating Hydrogen Production and Transfer Hydrogenation with Selenite Promoted Electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;Nitrotoluenes to E&#8208;Nitroethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluenes to carbon&#8208;added E&#8208;nitroethenes with wide substrate scope, high selectivity, and Faradaic efficiency is integrated with boosting H2 production or transfer hydrogenation over a bifunctional NiSe electrode. In situ formed hypervalent Ni&#948;+, surface adsorbed SeOx2&#8722;, and &#8722;NO2 adsorption of intermediate promote aqueous electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene to E&#8208;nitroethene.







Abstract
Developing an electrochemical carbon&#8208;added reaction with accelerated kinetics to replace the low&#8208;value and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is markedly significant to pure hydrogen production. Regulating the critical steps to precisely design electrode materials to selectively synthesize targeted compounds is highly desirable. Here, inspired by the surfaced adsorbed SeOx2&#8722; promoting OER, NiSe is demonstrated to be an efficient anode enabling &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene electrooxidation to E&#8208;nitroethene with up to 99&#8201;% E selectivity, 89&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, and the reaction rate of 0.25&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 via inhibiting side reactions for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen generation. The high performance can be associated with its in situ formed NiOOH surface layer and absorbed SeOx2&#8722; via Se leaching&#8208;oxidation during electrooxidation, and the preferential adsorption of two &#8208;NO2 groups of intermediate on NiOOH. A self&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;carbon radicals and subsequent elimination of a nitrite molecule pathway is proposed. Wide substrate scope, scale&#8208;up synthesis of E&#8208;nitroethene, and paired productions of E&#8208;nitroethene and hydrogen or N&#8208;protected aminoarenes over a bifunctional NiSe electrode highlight the promising potential. Gold also displays a similar promoting effect for &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene transformation like SeOx2&#8722;, rationalizing the strategy of designing materials to suppress side reactions.

         <title>Isolable Geminal Bisgermenolates: A New Synthon in Organo&#8208;metallic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized the first isolable geminal bisenolates L2K2Ge[(CO)R]2  (R = 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl (2a,b), L = THF for (2a  ) or [18]&#8208;crown&#8208;6 for (2b)), a new synthon for the synthesis of organometallic reagents. The formation of these derivatives was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The UV&#8208;Vis spectra of these anions show three distinct bands, which were assigned by DFT calculations. The efficiency of  2a,b  to serve as new building block in macromolecular chemistry is demonstrated by the reactions with two different types of electrophiles (acid chlorides and alkyl halides). In all cases the salt metathesis reaction gave rise to novel Ge&#8208;based photoinitiators in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>A TiO2&#8208;Co(terpyridine)2 photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of biomass to formate coupled to the reduction of CO2 to syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immobilization of a phosphonated cobalt bis(terpyridine) catalyst on TiO  2  nanoparticles generates a hybrid photocatalyst that allows coupling aqueous CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;syngas (CO and H  2  ) photoreduction to selective oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived oxygenates or cellulose to formate. An enzymatic saccharification pre&#8208;treatment process is employed that enables the use of insoluble cellulose as a substrate under benign conditions suitable for CO  2  conversion. The photocatalyst consists of solely earth&#8208;abundant components, and its heterogeneous nature allows for reuse and operation in aqueous solution for several days at 25 &#176;C, reaching a cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion yield of 17%. Thus, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for valorizing two waste streams (CO  2  and biomass) simultaneously into value&#8208;added chemicals through solar&#8208;driven catalysis is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Material Based on Catechol&#8208;Modified Self&#8208;Immolative Poly(Disulfide) Backbones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol&#8208;functionalized self&#8208;immolative poly(disulfides) are synthesized and fashioned into dual&#8208;responsive gels through formation of catecholato&#8211;Al3+ cross&#8208;links. Two distinct pathways to cargo release are engineered, namely the depolymerization in a self&#8208;immolative fashion, or breaking catecholato&#8211;Al3+ cross&#8208;links at low pH. Both gel degradation pathways lead to release of bound dye molecules on demand.







Abstract
Functional materials engineered to degrade upon triggering are in high demand due their potentially lower impact on the environment as well as their use in sensing and in medical applications. Here, stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers are prepared by decorating a self&#8208;immolative poly(dithiothreitol) backbone with pendant catechol units. The highly functional polymer is fashioned into stimuli&#8208;responsive gels, formed through pH&#8208;dependent catecholato&#8211;metal ion cross&#8208;links. The gels degrade in response to specific environmental changes, either by addressing the pH responsive, non&#8208;covalent, catecholato&#8211;metal complexes, or by addition of a thiol. The latter stimulus triggers end&#8208;to&#8208;end depolymerization of the entire self&#8208;immolative backbone through end&#8208;cap replacement via thiol&#8211;disufide exchanges. Gel degradation is visualized by release of a dye from the supramolecular gel as it itself is converted into smaller molecules.

         <title>Modulating Chalcogen Bonding and Halogen Bonding Sigma&#8208;Hole Donor Atom Potency and Selectivity for Halide Anion Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen (ChB) and halogen bonding (XB) phenyl and aryl functionalised anion receptors exhibit a dramatic modulation in sigma&#8208;hole donor atom potency for anion recognition. Variation of electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating properties of triazole appended&#8208; or directly Te&#8208;bound&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituents facilitated linear free energy relationship (LFER) Hammett plot analysis revealing electronic modulation of halide anion selectivity in sigma&#8208;hole anion receptor design.







Abstract
A series of acyclic anion receptors containing chalcogen bond (ChB) and halogen bond (XB) donors integrated into a neutral 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;triazole pyridine scaffold are described, in which systematic variation of the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl substituents reveal a dramatic modulation in sigma&#8208;hole donor atom potency for anion recognition. Incorporation of strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluorophenyl units appended to the triazole heterocycle telluro&#8208; or iodo&#8208; donor atoms, or directly linked to the tellurium donor atom dramatically enhances the anion binding potency of the sigma&#8208;hole receptors, most notably for the ChB and XB receptors displaying over thirty&#8208;fold and eight&#8208;fold increase in chloride anion affinity, respectively, relative to unfluorinated analogues. Linear free energy relationships for a series of ChB based receptors reveal the halide anion recognition behaviour of the tellurium donor is highly sensitive to local electronic environments. This is especially the case for those directly appended to the Te centre (3&#8901;ChB), where a remarkable enhancement of strength of binding and selectivity for the lighter halides is observed as the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the Te&#8208;bonded aryl group increases, highlighting the exciting opportunity to fine&#8208;tune anion affinity and selectivity in ChB&#8208;based receptor systems.

         <title>Dihydrogen Activation by Lithium&#8208; and Sodium&#8208;Aluminyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It turns out there is nothing special about potassium after all: Sodium and lithium metal reduce AlIII iodide precursors to the M2[Al(NONDipp)]2 aluminyls (M=Li, Na). Addition of Et2O afforded the monomeric ion pairs (NONDipp)Al&#8208;M(Et2O)2 containing unsupported Al&#8722;Li and Al&#8722;Na bonds. All species activate dihydrogen, albeit at significantly different rates of reaction.







Abstract
To date, aluminyl anions have been exclusively isolated as their potassium salts. We report herein the synthesis of the lithium and sodium aluminyls, M2[Al(NONDipp)]2 (M=Li, Na. NONDipp=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Both compounds crystallize from non&#8208;coordinating solvent as &#8220;slipped&#8221; contacted dimeric pairs with strong M&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;(aryl) interactions. Isolation from Et2O solution affords the monomeric ion pairs (NONDipp)Al&#8208;M(Et2O)2, which contain discrete Al&#8722;Li and Al&#8722;Na bonds. The ability of the full series of Li, Na and K aluminyls to activate dihydrogen is reported.

         <title>C&#8722;Boron Enolates Enable Palladium Catalyzed Carboboration of Internal 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of carbon&#8208;bound boron enolates, in cooperation with a Pd complex supported by an 1,4&#8208;azaborine&#8208;derived phosphine ligand, transforms enynes into highly substituted dienyl boronates in exquisite site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A new family of carbon&#8208;bound boron enolates, generated by a kinetically controlled halogen exchange between chlorocatecholborane and silylketene acetals, is described. These C&#8722;boron enolates are demonstrated to activate 1,3&#8208;enyne substrates in the presence of a Pd0/Senphos ligand complex, resulting in the first examples of a carboboration reaction of an alkyne with enolate&#8208;equivalent nucleophiles. Highly substituted dienyl boron building blocks are produced in excellent site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity by the described catalytic cis&#8208;carboboration reaction.

         <title>Harnessing Shape Complementarity for Upgraded Cyclohexane Purification through Adaptive Bottlenecked Pores in an Imidazole&#8208;Containing MOF</title>

         <dc:description>Shape complementarity is a biological craft for precisely binding substrates at protein&#8722;protein interfaces.

         <title>Stabilizing Transition Metal Vacancy Induced Oxygen Redox by Co2+/Co3+ Redox and Sodium&#8208;Site Doping for Layered Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A P2&#8208;Na0.8Mg0.13[Mn0.6Co0.2Mg0.07&#9633;0.13]O2 (&#9633;: transition metal (TM) vacancy) cathode material is designed that contains vacancies and Co2+ in TM sites, and Mg2+ in both TM and Na sites. The synergic effect of low&#8208;valence Co2+/Co3+ redox and Mg2+ in sodium sites stabilizes the structure of this cathode material significantly during cycling.







Abstract
Anionic redox is an effective way to boost the energy density of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes for rechargeable batteries. However, inherent rigid nature of the TMO6 (TM: transition metals) subunits in the layered materials makes it hardly tolerate the inner strains induced by lattice glide, especially at high voltage. Herein, P2&#8208;Na0.8Mg0.13[Mn0.6Co0.2Mg0.07&#9633;0.13]O2 (&#9633;: TM vacancy) is designed that contains vacancies in TM sites, and Mg ions in both TM and sodium sites. Vacancies make the rigid TMO6 octahedron become more asymmetric and flexible. Low valence Co2+/Co3+ redox couple stabilizes the electronic structure, especially at the charged state. Mg2+ in sodium sites can tune the interlayer spacing against O&#8208;O electrostatic repulsion. Time&#8208;resolved in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction confirms that irreversible structure evolution is effectively suppressed during deep desodiation benefiting from the specific configuration. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that, deriving from the intrinsic vacancies, multiple local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Mg&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;&#8221; are superior in facilitating the oxygen redox for charge compensation than previously reported &#8220;Na&#8208;O&#8208;Mg&#8221;. The resulted material delivers promising cycle stability and rate capability, with a long voltage plateau at 4.2&#8197;V contributed by oxygen, and can be well maintained even at high rates. The strategy will inspire new ideas in designing highly stable cathode materials with reversible anionic redox for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Carbon Nitride Supported High&#8208;Loading Fe Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Activating of Peroxymonosulfate to Generate 1O2 with 100&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon nitride supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe1/CN) with a Fe loading of 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% was developed to generate 100&#8201;% 1O2 by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The adsorption of terminal O and oxidation of PMS by Fe&#8208;N4 sites played the most important roles for 1O2 generation with 100&#8201;% selectivity. As a result, the Fe1/CN activated PMS system exhibited strong resistance to various factors during the degradation of organic pollutants.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an excellent active species for the selective degradation of organic pollutions. However, it is difficult to achieve high efficiency and selectivity for the generation of 1O2. In this work, we develop a graphitic carbon nitride supported Fe single&#8208;atoms catalyst (Fe1/CN) containing highly uniform Fe&#8208;N4 active sites with a high Fe loading of 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The Fe1/CN achieves generation of 100&#8201;% 1O2 by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), which shows an ultrahigh p&#8208;chlorophenol degradation efficiency. Density functional theory calculations results demonstrate that in contrast to Co and Ni single&#8208;atom sites, the Fe&#8208;N4 sites in Fe1/CN adsorb the terminal O of PMS, which can facilitate the oxidization of PMS to form SO5.&#8722;, and thereafter efficiently generate 1O2 with 100&#8201;% selectivity. In addition, the Fe1/CN exhibits strong resistance to inorganic ions, natural organic matter, and pH value during the degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of PMS. This work develops a novel catalyst for the 100&#8201;% selective production of 1O2 for highly selective and efficient degradation of pollutants.

         <title>Direct Amidation of Esters by Ball Milling**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical ball&#8208;milling enabled the direct amidation of esters through simple coupling under basic conditions (see scheme). A wide range of esters underwent amidation by this method with an array of primary and secondary amides without the need for a bulk solvent, catalysts, or additives.







Abstract
The direct mechanochemical amidation of esters by ball milling is described. The operationally simple procedure requires an ester, an amine, and substoichiometric KOtBu and was used to prepare a large and diverse library of 78 amide structures with modest to excellent efficiency. Heteroaromatic and heterocyclic components are specifically shown to be amenable to this mechanochemical protocol. This direct synthesis platform has been applied to the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and agrochemicals as well as the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of an active pharmaceutical, all in the absence of a reaction solvent.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Triggered Intracellular H+ Transients for Lamellipodia&#8208;Collapsed Antimetastasis and Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;activated H+ release strategy based on UMP NPs that successfully achieves the lamellipodia&#8208;collapsed antimetastasis and enhanced chemodynamic therapy. This metastasis&#8208;oriented anticancer strategy may offer a new option for tumor antimetastasis and tumor treatment in the field of nanomedicines.







Abstract
In solid tumors, tumor invasion and metastasis account for 90&#8201;% of cancer&#8208;related deaths. Cell migration is steered by the lamellipodia formed at the leading edge. These lamellipodia can drive the cell body forward by its mechanical deformation regulated by cofilin. Inhibiting cofilin activity can cause significant defects in directional lamellipodia formation and the locomotory capacity of cell invasion, thus contributing to antimetastatic treatment. Herein, a near infrared light (NIR)&#8208;controlled nanoscale proton supplier was designed with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a core coated in MIL&#8208;88B for interior photoacids loading; this photoacids loading can boost H+ transients in cells, which converts the cofilin to an inactive form. Strikingly, inactive cofilin loses the ability to mediate lamellipodia deformation for cell migration. Additionally, the iron, which serves as a catalyticaly active center in MIL&#8208;88B, initiates an enhanced Fenton reaction due to the increased H+ in the tumor, ultimately achieving intensive chemodynamic therapy (CDT). This work provides new insight into H+ transients in cells, which not only regulates cofilin protonation for antimetastatic treatment but also improves chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>Mild Intermolecular Synthesis of a Cyclopropane&#8208;Containing Tricyclic Skeleton: Unusual Reactivity of Isobenzopyryliums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new intermolecular approach for the expedient access to cyclopropane&#8208;incorporated tricyclic skeleton from the readily available isobenzopyryliums and vinyl boronic acids has been achieved. This protocol does not involve the highly active carbenoid intermediates or strong conditions as compared to traditional approaches.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes embedded in a polycyclic bridged architecture are a versatile structural motif, but such complex frameworks often impose substantial synthetic challenges. Herein we introduce a new approach for the expedient access to such spring&#8208;loaded strained systems via an exceptionally mild intermolecular convergent process between the readily available isobenzopyryliums and vinyl boronic acids. Different from the typical conventional approaches, our protocol does not involve the highly active carbenoid intermediates or strong conditions in order to overcome the disfavored kinetic and thermodynamic problems. Instead, the key cyclopropane ring was formed between the well&#8208;positioned nucleophile and electrophile in the adduct from the regioselective [4+2] cycloaddition. Thus, this unusual process also represents a new reactivity of the versatile isobenzopyryliums. The choice of a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst with proper acidity is crucial to the high efficiency and selectivity for this multiple bond&#8208;forming process. The strained products are precursors to other useful synthetic building blocks.

         <title>Hard X&#8208;Ray Nanotomography for 3D Analysis of Coking in Nickel&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of coke in nickel&#8208;based catalyst particles can be investigated by ptychographic X&#8208;ray computed tomography with sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm resolution. Based on localized changes of electron density between the activated and coked catalysts, the location of coke can be resolved in 3D at the nanoscale. This approach can be used to study different catalyst deactivation pathways on multiple length scales from nm to &#956;m.







Abstract
Understanding catalyst deactivation by coking is crucial for knowledge&#8208;based catalyst and process design in reactions with carbonaceous species. Post&#8208;mortem analysis of catalyst coking is often performed by bulk characterization methods. Here, hard X&#8208;ray ptychographic computed tomography (PXCT) was used to study Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2 methanation and CH4 dry reforming after artificial coking treatment. PXCT generated quantitative 3D maps of local electron density at ca. 80&#8197;nm resolution, allowing to visualize and evaluate the severity of coking in entire catalyst particles of ca. 40&#8197;&#956;m diameter. Coking was primarily revealed in the nanoporous solid, which was not detectable in resolved macropores. Coke formation was independently confirmed by operando Raman spectroscopy. PXCT is highlighted as an emerging characterization tool for nanoscale identification, co&#8208;localization, and potentially quantification of deactivation phenomena in 3D space within entire catalyst particles.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) into chemicals and fuels has recently attracted much interest, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. In this work, single P atoms were introduced into a N&#8208;doped carbon supported single Fe atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;  SAC  /NPC) mainly in the form of P&#8208;C bonds for CO  2  electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. This catalyst exhibited a CO Faradaic efficiency of ~97% at a low overpotential of 320 mV, and a Tafel slope of only 59 mV dec  &#8208;1  , comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gold catalysts. Experimental analysis combined with DFT calculations suggested that single P atom in high coordination shells (n &#8805; 3), in particular the third coordination shell of Fe center enhanced the electronic localization of Fe, which improved the stabilization of the key *COOH intermediate on Fe, leading to superior CO  2  electrochemical reduction performance at low overpotentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of a Bromodomain&#8208;like Region in 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1 Explains Its Nuclear Localization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based labeling of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity using the novel one&#8208;step labeling probe Labelox B enables detection of isoenzyme inhibitory selectivity in an ELISA&#8208;based assay and visualization of the localization of LOX activity in living cells. The observed nuclear localization was rationalized by identification of a bromodomain&#8208;like region in the 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 isoenzyme.







Abstract
Lipoxygenase (LOX) activity provides oxidative lipid metabolites, which are involved in inflammatory disorders and tumorigenesis. Activity&#8208;based probes to detect the activity of LOX enzymes in their cellular context provide opportunities to explore LOX biology and LOX inhibition. Here, we developed Labelox B as a potent covalent LOX inhibitor for one&#8208;step activity&#8208;based labeling of proteins with LOX activity. Labelox B was used to establish an ELISA&#8208;based assay for affinity capture and antibody&#8208;based detection of specific LOX isoenzymes. Moreover, Labelox B enabled efficient activity&#8208;based labeling of endogenous LOXs in living cells. LOX proved to localize in the nucleus, which was rationalized by identification of a functional bromodomain&#8208;like consensus motif in 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1. This indicates that 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 is not only involved in oxidative lipid metabolism, but also in chromatin binding, which suggests a potential role in chromatin modifications.

The observed nuclear localization was rationalized by identification of a bromodomain-like region in the 15-LOX-1 isoenzyme.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipoxygenase (LOX) activity provides oxidative lipid metabolites, which are involved in inflammatory disorders and tumorigenesis. Activity-based probes to detect the activity of LOX enzymes in their cellular context provide opportunities to explore LOX biology and LOX inhibition. Here, we developed Labelox B as a potent covalent LOX inhibitor for one-step activity-based labeling of proteins with LOX activity. Labelox B was used to establish an ELISA-based assay for affinity capture and antibody-based detection of specific LOX isoenzymes. Moreover, Labelox B enabled efficient activity-based labeling of endogenous LOXs in living cells. LOX proved to localize in the nucleus, which was rationalized by identification of a functional bromodomain-like consensus motif in 15-LOX-1. This indicates that 15-LOX-1 is not only involved in oxidative lipid metabolism, but also in chromatin binding, which suggests a potential role in chromatin modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have been strongly regarded as a promising next&#8208;generation system for advanced energy storage owing to high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg&#8208;1. However, the practical implementation of Li&#8208;S batteries has still been thwarted by the detrimental shuttling behavior of polysulfides, and the sluggish kinetics in electrochemical processes. Herein, a novel single atom (SA) catalyst with oversaturated Fe&#8208;N5 coordination structure (Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C) is precisely synthesized by the absorption&#8208;pyrolysis strategy and introduced to effective sulfur host material. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal synergism between atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N5 active sites and the unique carbon support. The results exhibit that the sulfur composite cathode built on the Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C can not only adsorb polysulfides via chemical interaction, but also boost the redox reaction kinetics, thus mitigating the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the robust three&#8208;dimensional nitrogen doped carbon nanofiber with large surface area, and high porosity enables strong physical confinement and fast electron/ion transfer process. Attributed to such unique features, Li&#8208;S batteries with S/Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C composite cathode realized outstanding cyclability and rate capability, as well as high areal capacities under raised sulfur loading, which demonstrates great potential in developing advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The cyano(triphenylsilyl)phosphanide anion was prepared as a sodium salt for the first time from 2&#8208;phosphaethynolate. We studied the electronic structure of this novel cyano(silyl)phosphanide via computational methods and investigated its reactivity with various electrophiles and Lewis acids, demonstrating its P&#8208; and N&#8208;nucleophilicity and application as a building block for the transfer of a PCN moiety. The ambident reactivity is in agreement with computations. The silyl group also shows lability and therefore the cyano(silyl)phosphanide can be considered as a phosphacyanamide synthon, [PCN]  2&#8208;  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a simple and rapid saliva&#8208;based SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antigen test that utilizes a newly developed dimeric DNA aptamer, denoted as DSA1N5, that specifically recognizes the spike proteins of the wildtype virus and its Alpha and Delta variants with dissociation constants of 120, 290 and 480 pM, respectively, and binds pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing the wildtype and alpha trimeric spike proteins with affinity constants of 2.1 pM and 2.3 pM, respectively. To develop a highly sensitive test, DSA1N5 was immobilized onto gold electrodes to produce an electrochemical impedance sensor, which was capable of detecting 1,000 viral particles per mL in 1:1 diluted saliva in under 10 min without any further sample processing. Evaluation of 36&#160;positive and 37 negative patient saliva samples produced a clinical sensitivity of 80.5% and specificity of 100% and could detect the wildtype virus as well as the alpha and Delta variants in the patient samples, which is the first reported rapid test that can detect any emerging variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Chiral Copper Selenide Nanochannels for Ultrasensitive Enantioselective Recognition and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion transport channels play a significant role in biological systems and have inspired scientists to design and fabricate artificial channels to mimic the functions of biological channels with regards to both fundamental and practical aspects. Inspired by biological ion channels, we designed and constructed a tailorable membrane channel system consisting of penicillamine molecules intercalated in copper selenide nanoparticles (CuSe NPs); this system exhibited circular dichroism (CD) bands in the near infrared region (CD, 800&#8211;1,600 nm) with a maximum intensity of 164.5 mdeg at 1440 nm. The chiral ligand hybridized to the surface of achiral CuSe NPs by breaking the intrinsic symmetry of CuSe NPs and further large&#8208;scale assembly induced strong optical activity. By controlling the size of the NPs, the number of layers and types of chiral ligands, the fabricated multilayer chiral membrane achieved a magnified rectification ratio up to 114. This high ratio was generated by the asymmetric feature characteristics of CuSe/anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) nanochannels, and their large charge density. The integration of penicillamine allowed for high enantioselective recognition against naproxen substrate. The chiral nanochannel membrane displayed high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.027 nM. This research not only provided a preparative strategy for large&#8208;scale chiral membranes with high rectification ratios, but also provided an efficient tool for chiral recognition and detection that will help us to understand biomimetic chiral transport in natural systems.</dc:description>

The chiral ligand hybridized to the surface of achiral CuSe NPs by breaking the intrinsic symmetry of CuSe NPs and further large-scale assembly induced strong optical activity. By controlling the size of the NPs, the number of layers and types of chiral ligands, the fabricated multilayer chiral membrane achieved a magnified rectification ratio up to 114. This high ratio was generated by the asymmetric feature characteristics of CuSe/anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) nanochannels, and their large charge density. The integration of penicillamine allowed for high enantioselective recognition against naproxen substrate. The chiral nanochannel membrane displayed high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.027 nM. This research not only provided a preparative strategy for large-scale chiral membranes with high rectification ratios, but also provided an efficient tool for chiral recognition and detection that will help us to understand biomimetic chiral transport in natural systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Desolvation&#8208;Free Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Chemistry for High Power Density and Extremely Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of conventional rechargeable batteries based on intercalation chemistry in the fields of fast charge and low temperature is generally hindered by the sluggish cation&#8208;desolvation process at the electrolyte/electrode interphase. To&#160;address this tough issue, a novel&#160;desolvation&#8208;free sodium dual&#8208;ion battery (SDIB) has been proposed by using artificial graphite (AG) as anode and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as cathode. Combining the cation&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation and anion storage chemistry, such a SDIB operated with ether&#8208;based electrolyte can intrinsically eliminate the sluggish desolvation process. Hence, it can exhibit an extremely fast kinetics of 10 A g  &#8208;1  (corresponding to 100C&#8208;rate) with a high capacity retention of 45%. Moreover, the desolvation&#8208;free mechanism endows the battery with 61% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity at an ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8208;70&#176;C. This advanced battery system will open a door for designing energy storage devices that require high power density and wide operational temperature range.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A highly efficient, automated continuous flow system capable of rapidly producing protected deoxy&#8208;sugar donors from commercial material is described. Through the use of affordable mechanical pumps and flow reactors, four 2,6&#8208;dideoxy and two 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy sugars with orthogonal protecting groups were synthesized in 11&#8208;32% overall yields in 74&#8208;131.5 minutes of total reaction time. Several of the reactions were able to be concatenated into a continuous process, avoiding the need for chromatographic purification of intermediates. The modular nature of the experimental setup allowed for reaction streams to be split into different lines for the parallel synthesis of multiple donors. Further, the continuous flow processes were fully automated and described through the design of an open&#8208;source Python&#8208;controlled automation platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Redoxdivergent Construction of (Dihydro)thiophenes with DMSO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiophene&#8208;based rings are one of the most widely used building blocks for the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Inspired by the redox diversity of nature&#8217;s feature, we demonstrate herein a redoxdivergent construction of dihydrothiophenes, thiophenes and bromothiophenes respectively from readily available allylic alcohols, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and HBr. The redoxdivergent selectivity could be manipulated mainly through controlling the dosage of DMSO and HBr. Mechanistic studies suggest that DMSO simultaneously acts as an oxidant and a sulfur donor. The synthetic potentials of the products as platform molecules have also been demonstrated by various derivatizations, including the preparation of bioactive and functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Microscale interfacial polymerization on a chip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels are powerful materials for inclusion in microfluidic devices. Forming hydrogels with precise geometries is however challenging and mostly done using photopolymerization, which involves toxic chemicals, rinsing steps, solvents and a bulky optical equipment. Here, we introduce a new method for in situ formation of hydrogels with a well&#8208;defined geometry in a sealed microfluidic chip by interfacial polymerization. The geometry of the hydrogel is programmed by microfluidic design using capillary pinning structures and bringing into contact solutions containing hydrogel precursors from vicinal channels. The characteristics of the hydrogel (mesh size, molecular weight cut&#8208;off) can be readily adjusted. This method is compatible with capillary&#8208;driven microfluidics, fast, uses small volumes of reagents and samples, and does not require specific laboratory equipment. Our approach therefore creates new opportunities for filtration, hydrogel functionalization, and hydrogel&#8208;based assays, as exemplified by a rapid and compact competitive immunoassay that does not require a rinsing step.</dc:description>

         <title>Li2MTeO6 (M=Ti, Sn): Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Wide Transparency Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide crystals have been widely used in the nonlinear optical (NLO) field in the ultraviolet&#8208;visible and near&#8208;infrared region. Most of the traditional oxide crystals are restricted in the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their narrow transmission window. Hence, attempting to extend infrared cutoff wavelength of oxide has attracted much attention. In our work, we reported two new tellurate Li  2  TiTeO  6  (LTT) and Li  2  SnTeO  6 &#173;  (LST) with broad transparent region 0.38&#8208;6.72 and 0.38&#8208;6.86 &#956;m, respectively, which could be excellent candidates for the mid&#8208;infrared NLO application. Both LTT and LST are crystallized in the orthorhombic space group  P  nn  2. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder second&#8208;order generation efficiency (26&#215;KDP) under the fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm. The first&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder second&#8208;harmonic generations based on the crystal structures. Our results provide a novel oxide NLO crystal with a strong SHG and wide transparency range. It also paves a way to design new oxide mid&#8208;IR NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the first example that using mesoporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) as the protecting scaffold to organize the biocatalytic cascade. The confined microenvironment of MHOFs has robust and large transport channels, allowing the efficient transport of a wide range of biocatalytic substrates. This new MHOF&#8208;confined cascades system shows superior activity, extended scope of catalytic substrate and ultrahigh stability  that enables to operate complex chemical transformations  in a porous carrier. In addition, the advantages of MHOFs&#8208;confined cascades system for point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensing are also demonstrated. This study highlights the advantages of HOFs as scaffold of multiple enzymes assemblies, which has huge potential to mimic complex cellular transformations networks in a controllable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Record&#8208;High Electroluminescence Efficiency of 31.5% for Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purely organic molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) hold an advantage of high exciton utilization in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, robust TADF materials with emission peaks over 600 nm are still insufficient due to strong non&#8208;radiative decay according to energy&#8208;gap law.

And their doped OLEDs radiate red lights (606&#8211;648 nm) and achieve outstanding  &#951;  ext,max  s of up to 31.5%, which is the highest value for TADF materials emitting over 600 nm ever reported. These red TADF materials should have great potentials in displays and lighting devices.</dc:description>

Abstract
Efficient organic emitters in the deep&#8208;red region are rare due to the &#8220;energy gap law&#8221;. Herein, multiple boron (B)&#8208; and nitrogen (N)&#8208;atoms embedded polycyclic heteroaromatics featuring hybridized &#960;&#8208;bonding/ non&#8208;bonding molecular orbitals are constructed, providing a way to overcome the above luminescent boundary. The introduction of B&#8208;phenyl&#8208;B and N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;N structures enhances the electronic coupling of those para&#8208;positioned atoms, forming restricted &#960;&#8208;bonds on the phenyl&#8208;core for delocalized excited states and thus a narrow energy gap. The mutually ortho&#8208;positioned B&#8208; and N&#8208;atoms also induce a multi&#8208;resonance effect on the peripheral skeleton for the non&#8208;bonding orbitals, creating shallow potential energy surfaces to eliminate the high&#8208;frequency vibrational quenching. The corresponding deep&#8208;red emitters with peaks at 662 and 692&#8197;nm exhibit narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums of 38&#8197;nm, high radiative decay rates of ca. 108&#8197;s&#8722;1, &#8776;100&#8201;% photo&#8208;luminescence quantum yields and record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiencies of ca. 28&#8201;% in a normal planar organic light&#8208;emitting diode structure, simultaneously.

         <title>Twofold C&#8722;H Activation&#8208;Based Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective C&#8722;H Arylation Using Diarylacetylenes as Rare Arylating Reagents</title>

Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1:2 coupling of phosphinamides and diarylacetylenes has been realized for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of axially chiral biaryls bearing a P&#8208;stereogenic center. The reaction proceeded via twofold C&#8722;H bond activation, with the alkynes being an arylating reagent.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond activation has been established as an attractive strategy to access axially chiral biaryls, and the most straightforward method is direct C&#8722;H arylation of arenes. However, the arylating source has been limited to several classes of reactive and bulky reagents. Reported herein is rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1:2 coupling of diarylphosphinic amides and diarylacetylenes for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of biaryls with both central and axial chirality. This twofold C&#8722;H activation reaction stays contrast to the previously explored Miura&#8211;Satoh type 1:2 coupling of arenes and alkynes in terms of chemoselectivity and proceeded under mild conditions with the alkyne acting as a rare arylating reagent. Both C&#8722;H activation events are stereo&#8208;determining and are under catalyst control, with the 2nd C&#8722;H activation being diastereo&#8208;determining in a remote fashion. Analysis of the stereochemistry of the major and side products suggests moderate enantioselectivity of the initial C&#8722;H activation&#8211;desymmetrization process. However, the minor (R) rhodium vinyl intermediate is consumed more readily in undesired protonolysis, eventually resulting in high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the major product.

A new type of photoactuator based on a heterostructured black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid presents high&#8208;performance light&#8208;driven reversible actuation. By using the BP&#8208;based actuator as the working unit, together with the self&#8208;oscillating configuration and asymmetric structure design, an inchworm&#8208;like soft actuator that can crawl autonomously towards the light source is constructed.







Abstract
Developing self&#8208;oscillating soft actuators that enable autonomous, continuous, and directional locomotion is significant in biomimetic soft robotics fields, but remains great challenging. Here, an untethered soft photoactuators based on covalently&#8208;bridged black phosphorus&#8208;carbon nanotubes heterostructure with self&#8208;oscillation and phototactic locomotion under constant light irradiation is designed. Owing to the good photothermal effect of black phosphorus heterostructure and thermal deformation of the actuator components, the new actuator assembled by heterostructured black phosphorus, polymer and paper produces light&#8208;driven reversible deformation with fast and large response. By using this actuator as mechanical power and designing a robot configuration with self&#8208;feedback loop to generate self&#8208;oscillation, an inchworm&#8208;like actuator that can crawl autonomously towards the light source is constructed. Moreover, due to the anisotropy and tailorability of the actuator, an artificial crab robot that can simulate the sideways locomotion of crabs and simultaneously change color under light irradiation is also realized.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Regulated Electron Transfer and Exchange&#8208;Enhanced Reactivity in Fe4S4&#8208;Mediated Redox Reaction of the Dph2 Enzyme During the Biosynthesis of Diphthamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20430-20436, September 6, 2021. </description>

We uncovered that the spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer and exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity are involved in Fe4S4&#8208;mediated reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C(&#947;) bond in Dph2, and that the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block may act as the redox site to mediate the electron donation and reception during the redox catalysis.







Abstract
The [4Fe&#8208;4S]&#8208;dependent radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins is one of large families of redox enzymes that are able to carry a panoply of challenging transformations. Despite the extensive studies of structure&#8211;function relationships of radical SAM (RS) enzymes, the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in these enzymes remains elusive. Using combined MD simulations and QM/MM calculations, we deciphered the electronic state&#8208;dependent reactivity of the [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in Dph2, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Our calculations show that the reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C(&#947;) bond is highly dependent on the electronic structure of [4Fe&#8208;4S]. Interestingly, the six electronic states can be classified into a low&#8208;energy and a high&#8208;energy groups, which are correlated with the net spin of Fe4 atom ligated to SAM. Due to the driving force of Fe4&#8722;C(&#947;) bonding, the net spin on the Fe4 moiety dictate the shift of the opposite spin electron from the Fe1&#8208;Fe2&#8208;Fe3 block to SAM. Such spin&#8208;regulated electron transfer results in the exchange&#8208;enhanced reactivity in the lower&#8208;energy group compared with those in the higher&#8208;energy group. This reactivity principle provides fundamental mechanistic insights into reactivities of [4Fe&#8208;4S] cluster in RS enzymes.

&lt;p&gt;We uncovered that the spin-regulated electron transfer and exchange-enhanced reactivity are involved in Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;(&#947;)&lt;/sub&gt; bond in Dph2, and that the Fe1-Fe2-Fe3 block may act as the redox site to mediate the electron donation and reception during the redox catalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [4Fe-4S]-dependent radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) proteins is one of large families of redox enzymes that are able to carry a panoply of challenging transformations. Despite the extensive studies of structure&#8211;function relationships of radical SAM (RS) enzymes, the electronic state-dependent reactivity of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in these enzymes remains elusive. Using combined MD simulations and QM/MM calculations, we deciphered the electronic state-dependent reactivity of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in Dph2, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide. Our calculations show that the reductive cleavage of the S&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;(&#947;)&lt;/sub&gt; bond is highly dependent on the electronic structure of [4Fe-4S]. Interestingly, the six electronic states can be classified into a low-energy and a high-energy groups, which are correlated with the net spin of Fe4 atom ligated to SAM. Due to the driving force of Fe4&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;(&#947;)&lt;/sub&gt; bonding, the net spin on the Fe4 moiety dictate the shift of the opposite spin electron from the Fe1-Fe2-Fe3 block to SAM. Such spin-regulated electron transfer results in the exchange-enhanced reactivity in the lower-energy group compared with those in the higher-energy group. This reactivity principle provides fundamental mechanistic insights into reactivities of [4Fe-4S] cluster in RS enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structural Changes during the Growth of Atomically Precise Metal Oxido Nanoclusters from Combined Pair Distribution Function and Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering Analysis</title>

The development of tools for combined, automated analysis of pair distribution function (PDF) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data enabled the identification of intermediate species in the formation of atomically precise [Bi38O45] nanoclusters (see picture). By studying cluster&#8211;solvent interactions it was also found that the solvent can affect the metal oxido structure.







Abstract
The combination of in situ pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) enables analysis of the formation mechanism of metal oxido nanoclusters and cluster&#8211;solvent interactions as they take place. Herein, we demonstrate the method for the formation of clusters with a [Bi38O45] core. Upon dissolution of crystalline [Bi6O5(OH)3(NO3)5]&#8901;3&#8201;H2O in DMSO, an intermediate rapidly forms, which slowly grows to stable [Bi38O45] clusters. To identify the intermediate, we developed an automated modeling method, where smaller [BixOy] structures based on the [Bi38O45] framework are tested against the data. [Bi22O26] was identified as the main intermediate species, illustrating how combined PDF and SAXS analysis is a powerful tool to gain insight into nucleation on an atomic scale. PDF also provides information on the interaction between nanoclusters and solvent, which is shown to depend on the nature of the ligands on the cluster surface.

         <title>Non&#8208;invasive Regulation of Cellular Morphology Using a Photoswitchable Mechanical DNA Polymer</title>

We created a photoswitchable DNA polymer containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides with photoirradiation. Using the mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced a significant morphology change of the cells. This study presents a general strategy to explore nanoscale interactions between stem cells and stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanostructures.







Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) in which the cells reside provides a dynamic and reversible environment. Spatiotemporal cues are essential when cells are undergoing morphogenesis, repair and differentiation. Emulation of such an intricate system with reversible presentation of nanoscale cues can help us better understand cellular processes and can allow the precise manipulation of cell function in&#8197;vitro. Herein, we formulated a photoswitchable DNA mechanical nanostructure containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides using a photoswitchable DNA polymer with photoirradiation. We found that the DNA polymer reversibly forms two different structures, a relaxed linear and shrunken compact form, observed by AFM. Using the mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced a significant morphology change of the cells between a round shape and spindle shape, thus providing a tool to decipher the language of the ECM better.

         <title>Photoinduced Charge Separation Prompted Intervalence Charge Transfer in a Bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole Bridged Donor&#8208;TCBD Push&#8208;Pull System</title>

Occurrence of intervalence charge transfer in a newly synthesized multi&#8208;modular donor&#8211;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl) diketopyrrolopyrrole hosting two phenothiazine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene entities on the opposite sides is demonstrated. The near&#8208;infrared IVCT band has been used as a diagnostic marker to probe photoinduced electron transfer.







Abstract
Intervalence charge transfer (IVCT), a phenomenon observed in molecular systems comprised of two redox centers differing in oxidation states by one unit, is reported in a novel, newly synthesized, multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system comprised of central bis(thienyl)diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) hosting two phenothiazine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene (PTZ&#8208;TCBD) entities on the opposite sides. One&#8208;electron reduction of TCBD promoted electron exchange between the two TCBD resulting in IVCT transition in the near&#8208;infrared region. The stabilization energy, &#8722;&#916;Gcom and comproportionation equilibrium constant, Kcom calculated from peak potentials of the split reduction waves were found to be 1.06&#215;104&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and 72.3&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively. Further, the IVCT transition was also witnessed during the process of thermodynamically feasible electron transfer upon excitation of the TDPP entity in the system, and served as a diagnostic marker to characterize the electron transfer product. Subsequent transient absorption spectral studies and data analysis by Global and Target analyses revealed occurrence of ultrafast charge separation (kcs&#8776;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1) owing to the close proximity and good communication between the entities of the multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor system. The role of central TDPP in promoting IVCT is borne out from the present investigation.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Efficient Capture and Purification of Propylene</title>

A robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with free COOH groups and suitable pore confinement demonstrates excellent performance for the important and challenging C3H6/C3H8 separation. 







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) mixture is desired for its potential energy saving on replacing currently deployed and energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation. Realizing efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation in the emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is very challenging owing to the lack of functional sites for preferential gas binding. By virtue of crystal engineering, we herein report a functionalized HOF (HOF&#8208;16) with free &#8208;COOH sites for the efficient separation of C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. Under ambient conditions, HOF&#8208;16 shows a significant C3H6/C3H8 uptake difference (by 76&#8201;%) and selectivity (5.4) in contrast to other carboxylic acid&#8208;based HOFs. Modeling studies indicate that free &#8208;COOH groups together with the suitable pore confinement facilitate the recognition and high&#8208;density packing of gas molecules. The separation performance of HOF&#8208;16 was validated by breakthrough experiments. HOF&#8208;16 is stable towards strong acidity and water.

Under ambient conditions, &lt;b&gt;HOF-16&lt;/b&gt; shows a significant C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; uptake difference (by 76&#8201;%) and selectivity (5.4) in contrast to other carboxylic acid-based HOFs. Modeling studies indicate that free -COOH groups together with the suitable pore confinement facilitate the recognition and high-density packing of gas molecules. The separation performance of &lt;b&gt;HOF-16&lt;/b&gt; was validated by breakthrough experiments. &lt;b&gt;HOF-16&lt;/b&gt; is stable towards strong acidity and water.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Protoboration of CF3&#8208;Containing 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>

         <dc:description>
The novel copper&#8208;catalyzed protoboration of CF3&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;dienes with proton source and B2Pin2 has been developed. This chemistry afforded the CF3&#8208;containing borated products with good selectivity and efficiency.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed highly selective protoboration of CF3&#8208;containing conjugated diene with proton source and B2Pin2 has been developed. This chemistry could suppress the well&#8208;known defluorination and provide borated reagents with an intact CF3&#8208;group. Further studies indicated that the functional group tolerance of this chemistry is very well, and the products could be used as versatile precursors for different types of transformations. Importantly, using chiral diphosphine ligand, we have developed the first example for using such starting material to synthesis allylic boron&#8208;reagents which bearing a CF3&#8208;containing chiral center. Notably, the reaction mechanism was intensively studied by DFT calculations, which could reveal the reason that defluorination was inhibited.

         <title>Electrodeposition of Zinc onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the Ionic Liquid [MPPip][TFSI]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20461-20468, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differences of the electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide are presented. The clearly different structures of the deposits on both gold single crystal electrodes reveal a strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc.







Abstract
The improvement of rechargeable zinc/air batteries was a hot topic in recent years. Predominantly, the influence of water and additives on the structure of the Zn deposit and the possible dendrite formation were studied. However, the effect of the surface structure of the underlying substrate was not focused on in detail, yet. We now show the differences in electrochemical deposition of Zn onto Au(111) and Au(100) from the ionic liquid N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. The fundamental processes were initially characterized via cyclic voltammetry and in situ scanning tunnelling microscopy. Bulk deposits were then examined using Auger electron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Different structures of Zn deposits are observed during the initial stages of electrocrystallisation on both electrodes, which reveals the strong influence of the crystallographic orientation on the metal deposition of zinc on gold.

         <title>Chromoselective Synthesis of Sulfonyl Chlorides and Sulfonamides with Potassium Poly(heptazine imide) Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20543-20550, September 6, 2021. </description>

Photons are traceless reagents in the photocatalytic system, able to control the reaction pathway. Herein, the carbon nitride photocatalyst is used to obtain three products from the same reaction mixture only varying the excitation light. The developed method is optimized for the synthesis of sulfonyl chlorides and amides. Finally, through different physico&#8208;chemical methods, the rationale behind the chromoselective synthesis is explained.







Abstract
Among external stimuli used to promote a chemical reaction, photocatalysis possesses a unique one&#8212;light. Photons are traceless reagents that provide an exclusive opportunity to alter chemoselectivity of the photocatalytic reaction varying the color of incident light. This strategy may be implemented by using a sensitizer capable to activate a specific reaction pathway depending on the excitation light. Herein, we use potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI), a type of carbon nitride, to generate selectively three different products from S&#8208;arylthioacetates simply varying the excitation light and otherwise identical conditions. Namely, arylchlorides are produced under UV/purple, sulfonyl chlorides with blue/white, and diaryldisulfides at green to red light. A combination of the negatively charged polyanion, highly positive potential of the valence band, presence of intraband states, ability to sensitize singlet oxygen, and multi&#8208;electron transfer is shown to enable this chromoselective conversion of thioacetates.

We introduce the new flexible physisorbent sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn and reveal that it exhibits an induced fit structural change that results in extraordinary affinity for C2H2 that in turn enables high selectivity for separation of C2H2 over C2H4 and CO2.







Abstract
Structural changes at the active site of an enzyme induced by binding to a substrate molecule can result in enhanced activity in biological systems. Herein, we report that the new hybrid ultramicroporous material sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn exhibits an induced fit binding mechanism when exposed to acetylene, C2H2. The resulting phase change affords exceptionally strong C2H2 binding that in turn enables highly selective C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 separation demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments. sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn was observed to exhibit at least four phases: as&#8208;synthesised (&#945;); activated (&#946;); and C2H2 induced phases (&#946;&#8242; and &#947;). sql&#8208;SIFSIX&#8208;bpe&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; exhibited strong affinity for C2H2 at ambient conditions as demonstrated by benchmark isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) of 67.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 validated through in situ pressure gradient differential scanning calorimetry (PG&#8208;DSC). Further, in situ characterisation and DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism of the C2H2 induced fit transformation, binding positions and the nature of host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Photoredox Catalysis Enables Self&#8208;Reporting Nitric Oxide Release for Efficient Antibacterial Treatment</title>

Red&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis for self&#8208;reporting nitric oxide release is reported in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin. The NO&#8208;releasing platform eradicates Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in&#8197;vitro and treats bacterial infection in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) serves as a key regulator of many physiological processes and as a potent therapeutic agent. The local delivery of NO is important to achieve target therapeutic outcomes due to the toxicity of NO at high concentrations. Although light stimulus represents a non&#8208;invasive tool with spatiotemporal precision to mediate NO release, many photoresponsive NO&#8208;releasing molecules can only respond to ultraviolet (UV) or near&#8208;UV visible light with low penetration and high phototoxicity. We report that coumarin&#8208;based NO donors with maximal absorbances at 328&#8197;nm can be activated under (deep) red&#8208;light (630 or 700&#8197;nm) irradiation in the presence of palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin, enabling stoichiometric and self&#8208;reporting NO release with a photolysis quantum yield of 8&#8201;% via photoredox catalysis. This NO&#8208;releasing platform with ciprofloxacin loading can eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm in&#8197;vitro and treat cutaneous abscesses in&#8197;vivo.

Different aggregation structures of three BDOPV&#8208;based polymers in solution were obtained via subtle adjustment of the molecular structures. By employing contact&#8208;free ultrafast terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, we directly reveal that the correlation of the charge carrier mobilities between the solution aggregates and the solid&#8208;state films remains highly consistent.







Abstract
The role of solution aggregates on the charge transport process of conjugated polymers in electronic devices has gained increasing attention; however, the correlation of the charge carrier mobilities between the solution aggregates and the solid&#8208;state films remains elusive. Herein, three polymers, FBDOPV&#8208;2T, FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T, and FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T, are designed and synthesized with distinct aggregation behavior in solution. By combining contact&#8208;free ultrafast terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and field&#8208;effect transistor measurements, we track the charge carrier mobility of the aggregates of these polymers from the solution to the thin&#8208;film state. Remarkably, the mobility of these three polymers is found to follow nearly the same trend (FBDOPV&#8208;2T&gt;FBDOPV&#8208;2F2T&#8811;FBDOPV&#8208;4F2T) in both solutions and thin&#8208;film states. The quantitative mobility correlation indicates that the charge transport properties of solution aggregates play a critical role in determining the thin&#8208;film charge transport properties and final device performance. Our results highlight the importance of investigating and controlling solution aggregation structures towards efficient organic electronic devices.

Inspired by biological nitrogenases, a bimetallic sulfide material (FeWSx@FeWO4) was synthesized for a highly efficient N2 reduction (NRR) catalyst. In&#8197;situ Raman spectra and hydrazine reduction kinetics analysis revealed that the reduction of undissociated hydrazine intermediates (M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2) on the surface of the catalyst is the rate&#8208;determing step for the NRR process.







Abstract
The multimetallic sulfur&#8208;framework catalytic site of biological nitrogenases allows the efficient conversion of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions. Inspired by biological nitrogenases, a bimetallic sulfide material (FeWSx@FeWO4) was synthesized as a highly efficient N2 reduction (NRR) catalyst by sulfur substitution of the surface of FeWO4 nanoparticles. Thus prepared FeWSx@FeWO4 catalysts exhibit a relatively high NH3 production rate of 30.2&#8197;ug&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat and a Faraday efficiency of 16.4&#8201;% at &#8722;0.45&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow cell; these results have been confirmed via purified 15N2&#8208;isotopic labeling experiments. In situ Raman spectra and hydrazine reduction kinetics analysis revealed that the reduction of undissociated hydrazine intermediates (M&#8208;NH2&#8208;NH2) on the surface of the bimetallic sulfide catalyst is the rate&#8208;determing step for the NRR process. Therefore, this work can provide guidance for elucidating the structure&#8211;activity relationship of NRR catalysts.

         <dc:description>
An electrochemical strategy to locally synthesize carbon monoxide (CO), a gaseous messenger molecule, with tunable kinetics is devised. By integrating this strategy with fiber&#8208;based fabrication, diverse CO&#8208;dependent signaling pathways in genetically engineered cells or neurons can be modulated at the microscale.







Abstract
Despite the critical role played by carbon monoxide (CO) in physiological and pathological signaling events, current approaches to deliver this messenger molecule are often accompanied by off&#8208;target effects and offer limited control over release kinetics. To address these challenges, we develop an electrochemical approach that affords on&#8208;demand release of CO through reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved in the extracellular space. Electrocatalytic generation of CO by cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalysts modulates signaling pathways mediated by a CO receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase. Furthermore, by tuning the applied voltage during electrocatalysis, we explore the effect of the CO release kinetics on CO&#8208;dependent neuronal signaling. Finally, we integrate components of our electrochemical platform into microscale fibers to produce CO in a spatially&#8208;restricted manner and to activate signaling cascades in the targeted cells. By offering on&#8208;demand local synthesis of CO, our approach may facilitate the studies of physiological processes affected by this gaseous molecular messenger.

         <title>Glycopolymer Microarrays with Sub&#8208;Femtomolar Avidity for Glycan Binding Proteins Prepared by Grafted&#8208;To/Grafted&#8208;From Photopolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20350-20357, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;femtomolar avidity with glycan binding protein is achieved in a glycan microarray architecture that controls precisely carbohydrate density and valency. The biomimetic glycopolymers are prepared via a new surface&#8208;initiated polymerization, termed &#8220;grafted&#8208;to/grafted&#8208;from radical photopolymerization&#8221; that was optimized using hypersurface photolithography, a printing strategy that substantially accelerates reaction discovery and optimization.







Abstract
We report a novel glycan array architecture that binds the mannose&#8208;specific glycan binding protein, concanavalin&#8197;A (ConA), with sub&#8208;femtomolar avidity. A new radical photopolymerization developed specifically for this application combines the grafted&#8208;from thiol&#8211;(meth)acrylate polymerization with thiol&#8211;ene chemistry to graft glycans to the growing polymer brushes. The propagation of the brushes was studied by carrying out this grafted&#8208;to/grafted&#8208;from radical photopolymerization (GTGFRP) at &gt;400 different conditions using hypersurface photolithography, a printing strategy that substantially accelerates reaction discovery and optimization on surfaces.

&lt;p&gt;Sub-femtomolar avidity with glycan binding protein is achieved in a glycan microarray architecture that controls precisely carbohydrate density and valency. The biomimetic glycopolymers are prepared via a new surface-initiated polymerization, termed &#8220;grafted-to/grafted-from radical photopolymerization&#8221; that was optimized using hypersurface photolithography, a printing strategy that substantially accelerates reaction discovery and optimization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a novel glycan array architecture that binds the mannose-specific glycan binding protein, concanavalin&#8197;A (ConA), with sub-femtomolar avidity. A new radical photopolymerization developed specifically for this application combines the grafted-from thiol&#8211;(meth)acrylate polymerization with thiol&#8211;ene chemistry to graft glycans to the growing polymer brushes. The propagation of the brushes was studied by carrying out this grafted-to/grafted-from radical photopolymerization (GTGFRP) at &amp;gt;400 different conditions using hypersurface photolithography, a printing strategy that substantially accelerates reaction discovery and optimization on surfaces. The effect of brush height and the grafting density of mannosides on the binding of ConA to the brushes was studied systematically, and we found that multivalent and cooperative binding account for the unprecedented sensitivity of the GTGFRP brushes. This study further demonstrates the ease with which new chemistry can be tailored for an application as a result of the advantages of hypersurface photolithography.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Green Conversion of CO2 and Propargylamines Triggered by Triply Synergistic Catalytic Effects in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

A mixed valence copper&#8208;based cationic framework {[(CuI6I5)Cu3IIL6(DMA)3](NO3)&#8901;9DMA}n was synthesized. The material realized the efficient and green conversion of propargylamine with CO2 in flue gas under solvent&#8208;free and co&#8208;catalyst free conditions.







Abstract
Cyclization of propargylamines with CO2 to obtain 2&#8208;oxazolidone heterocyclic compounds is an essential reaction in industry but it is usually catalyzed by noble&#8208;metal catalysts with organic bases as co&#8208;catalysts under harsh conditions. We have synthesized a unique CuI/CuII mixed valence copper&#8208;based framework {[(CuI6I5)Cu3IIL6(DMA)3](NO3)&#8901;9DMA}n (1) with good solvent and thermal stability, as well as a high density of uncoordinated amino groups evenly distributed in the large nanoscopic channels. Catalytic experiments show that 1 can effectively catalyze the reaction of propargylamines with CO2, and the yield can reach 99&#8201;%. The turnover frequency (TOF) reaches a record value of 230&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is much higher than that of reported noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Importantly, this is the first report of heterogeneously catalyzed green conversion of propargylamines with CO2 without solvents and co&#8208;catalysts under low temperature and atmospheric pressure. A mechanistic study reveals that a triply synergistic catalytic effect between CuI/CuII and uncoordinated amino groups promotes highly efficient and green conversion of CO2. Furthermore, 1 directly catalyzes this reaction with high efficiency when using simulated flue gas as a CO2 source.

Integration of a porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework on a conductive indium tin oxide surface affords an electrochemical sensor, Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO. Thanks to detecting several inorganic ions, organic hazardous substances and pollutants, Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO demonstrates multifaceted sensing with low detection limits. Benchmark sensing performances are set not only across several single components, but also in the corresponding binary and ternary mixtures.







Abstract
Electrochemical sensors are indispensable in clinical diagnosis, biochemical detection and environmental monitoring, thanks to their ability to detect analytes in real&#8208;time with direct electronic readout. However, electrochemical sensors are challenged by sensitivity&#8212;the need to detect low concentrations, and selectivity&#8212;to detect specific analytes in multicomponent systems. Herein, a porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic framework (PP&#8208;MOF), Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222 is deposited on a conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) surface. It affords Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO, a versatile voltammetric sensor able to detect redox&#8208;active analytes such as inorganic ions, organic hazardous substances and pollutants, including nitroaromatics, phenolic and quinone&#8208;hydroquinone toxins, heavy metal ions, biological species, as well as azo dyes. As a working electrode, the high surface area of Mn&#8208;PCN&#8208;222/ITO enables high currents, and therefore leverages highly sensitive analysis. The metalloporphyrin centre facilitates analyte&#8208;specific redox catalysis to simultaneously detect more than one analyte in binary and ternary systems allowing for detection of a wide array of trace pollutants under real&#8208;world conditions, most with high sensitivity.

         <title>Reversible Ligand Exchange in Atomically Dispersed Catalysts for Modulating the Activity and Selectivity of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Coordination environments of atomically dispersed catalysts are important for their catalytic performances. We report the reversible control of the metal coordination environment in atomically dispersed electrocatalysts via simple ligand exchange reactions, which could reversibly modulate the catalytic reactivity of the oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Rational control of the coordination environment of atomically dispersed catalysts is pivotal to achieve desirable catalytic reactivity. We report the reversible control of coordination structure in atomically dispersed electrocatalysts via ligand exchange reactions to reversibly modulate their reactivity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CO&#8208;ligated atomically dispersed Rh catalyst exhibited ca. 30&#8208;fold higher ORR activity than the NHx&#8208;ligated catalyst, whereas the latter showed three times higher H2O2 selectivity than the former. Post&#8208;treatments of the catalysts with CO or NH3 allowed the reversible exchange of CO and NHx ligands, which reversibly tuned oxidation state of metal centers and their ORR activity and selectivity. DFT calculations revealed that more reduced oxidation state of CO&#8208;ligated Rh site could further stabilize the *OOH intermediate, facilitating the two&#8208; and four&#8208;electron pathway ORR. The reversible ligand exchange reactions were generalized to Ir&#8208; and Pt&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Understanding the Roles of Electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ in Selectivity&#8208;Tuned 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20535-20542, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanism for cobalt&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation is revealed. A combined experimental and theoretical study shows that a Co3+ species is capable of oxidizing the formyl group to produce carboxylate but remains inert towards oxidation of the hydroxyl group. In contrast, a Co4+ species is required for the initial oxidation of the hydroxyl group in HMF.







Abstract
The Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst is among the most promising candidates for electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). However, the intrinsic active sites and detailed mechanism of this catalyst remains unclear. We combine experimental evidence and a theoretical study to show that electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ species act as chemical oxidants but with distinct roles in selective HMF oxidation. It is found that Co3+ is only capable of oxidizing formyl group to produce carboxylate while Co4+ is required for the initial oxidation of hydroxyl group with significantly faster kinetics. As a result, the product distribution shows explicit dependence on the Co oxidation states and selective production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) are achieved by tuning the applied potential. This work offers essential mechanistic insight on Co&#8208;catalyzed organic oxidation reactions and might guide the design of more efficient electrocatalysts.

As a result, the product distribution shows explicit dependence on the Co oxidation states and selective production of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) are achieved by tuning the applied potential. This work offers essential mechanistic insight on Co-catalyzed organic oxidation reactions and might guide the design of more efficient electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled Organocatalyzed Controlled Alternating Terpolymerization of Perfluorinated Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20443-20451, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyzed controlled alternating terpolymerization of perfluorinated vinyl ethers has been established, enabling the on&#8208;demand synthesis of various fluorinated terpolymers driven by light. This method offers a versatile and convenient platform to tailor fluoropolymers, which facilitates the preparation of novel block copolymers and engineering of high&#8208;performance solid terpolymer electrolytes.







Abstract
Polymerizations of perfluorinated vinyl ethers (PFVEs) provide an important category of fluoropolymers that have received considerable interests in applications. In this work, we report the development of an organocatalyzed controlled radical alternating terpolymerization of PFVEs and vinyl ethers (VEs) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method not only enables the synthesis of a broad scope of fluorinated terpolymers of low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity, facilitating tuning the chemical compositions by rationally choosing the type and/or ratio of comonomers, but also allows temporal control of chain&#8208;growth, as well as the preparation of a variety of novel fluorinated block copolymers. To showcase the versatility of this method, fluorinated alternating terpolymers have been synthesized and customized to simultaneously display a variety of desirable properties for solid polymer electrolyte design, creating new opportunities in high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Synergistical Dipole&#8211;Dipole Interaction Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Dipole&#8211;dipole interaction induced self&#8208;assembly of phenoxazine&#8208;based hole&#8208;transporting material, N01, is achieved by introducing a hexyl bromide side&#8208;chain to tune its self&#8208;assembling properties. N01 exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, extraction and perovskite growth, with a conversion efficiency of 21.85&#8201;% to be realized in an inverted PSC.







Abstract
Delicately designed dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) with ordered structure have become one of the major strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report two donor&#8208;&#960; linker&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) HTMs, N01 and N02, which consist of facilely synthesized 4,8&#8208;di(n&#8208;hexyloxy)&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene as a &#960; linker, with 10&#8208;bromohexyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine and 10&#8208;hexyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine as donors, respectively. The N01 molecules form a two&#8208;dimensional conjugated network governed by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br interaction between phenoxazine donors, and synchronously construct a three&#8208;dimension lamellar structure with the aid of interlaminar &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction. Consequently, N01 as a dopant&#8208;free small&#8208;molecule HTM exhibits a higher intrinsic hole mobility and more favorable interfacial properties for hole transport, hole extraction and perovskite growth, enabling an inverted PSC to achieve a very impressive power conversion efficiency of 21.85&#8201;%.

Like an eagle spreading its wings wide, the closed structure opens its hidden catalytic sites upon addition of an iron trigger thus furnishing a cavity for a double&#8208;click conversion toward rotaxanes. Surprisingly, a close distance match is not needed for double activation.







Abstract
Reversible switching between the closed cyclic dimeric assembly [Cu2(1)2]2+ (OFF state) and the extended dimeric homoleptic complex [FeCu2(1)2]4+ (ON State) by addition/removal of Fe2+ triggered catalysis of a double&#8208;click reaction and high yield preparation of [2]rotaxanes. Mechanistic and computational studies provide valuable general insight for double&#8208;click strategies by revealing cooperative effects in the second cycloaddition step due to a distance&#8208;tolerant preorganization of the first&#8208;click product by the two copper(I)&#8208;loaded phenanthroline subunits of [FeCu2(1)2]4+.

All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9&#8201;%, along with 86&#8201;% efficiency retention after 1000&#8197;h under ambient conditions.

Abstract
The emerging CsPbI3 perovskites are highly efficient and thermally stable materials for wide&#8208;band gap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the doped hole transport materials (HTMs) accelerate the undesirable phase transition of CsPbI3 in ambient. Herein, a dopant&#8208;free D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type HTM named CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F has been developed which overcomes this problem. The suitable optoelectronic properties and energy&#8208;level alignment endow CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F with excellent charge collection properties. Moreover, CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F provides multisite defect&#8208;healing effects on the defective sites of CsPbI3 surface. Inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with CI&#8208;TTIN&#8208;2F HTM feature high efficiencies up to 15.9&#8201;%, along with 86&#8201;% efficiency retention after 1000&#8197;h under ambient conditions. Inorganic perovskite solar modules were also fabricated that exhibiting an efficiency of 11.0&#8201;% with a record area of 27&#8197;cm2. This work confirms that using efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs is an attractive strategy to stabilize inorganic PSCs for their future scale&#8208;up.

         <title>Intermolecular [5+2] Annulation between 1&#8208;Indanones and Internal Alkynes by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;C Activation</title>

The Rh&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular [5+2] annulation between 1&#8208;indanones and alkynes is reported. It provides a rapid and straightforward entry to benzocycloheptenones. DFT calculation reveals the beneficial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the ligand and the substrate in the turnover&#8208;limiting migration insertion step.







Abstract
Herein, we report a [5+2] cycloaddition between readily accessible 1&#8208;indanones and internal alkynes through Rh&#8208;catalyzed activation of less strained C&#8722;C bonds. The reaction is enabled by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating NHC ligand and a carefully modified temporary directing group. A wide range of functional groups is tolerated, and the method provides straightforward access to diverse benzocycloheptenones that are hard to access otherwise. DFT studies of the reaction mechanism imply the migration insertion as the turnover&#8208;limiting step and suggest beneficial &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in the transition states.

         <title>In Situ Implanting of Single Tungsten Sites into Defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) by Solvent&#8208;Free Route for Efficient Oxidative Desulfurization at Room Temperature</title>

A one&#8208;pot green approach for in situ implanting of single tungsten sites (up to 12.7&#8197;wt.%) onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) structure via forming Zr&#8208;O&#8208;W bonds under solvent&#8208;free conditions is reported. The W/UiO&#8208;66(Zr) SSCs display extraordinary ODS activity under very mild condition, achieving complete oxidation of sulfur compounds (1000&#8197;ppm S) at room temperature within 30&#8197;min by using diluted H2O2 as oxidant.







Abstract
Design of single&#8208;site catalysts with catalytic sites at atomic&#8208;scale and high atom utilization, provides new opportunities to gain superior catalytic performance for targeted reactions. In this contribution, we report a one&#8208;pot green approach for in situ implanting of single tungsten sites (up to 12.7&#8197;wt.%) onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) structure via forming Zr&#8208;O&#8208;W bonds under solvent&#8208;free condition. The catalysts displayed extraordinary activity for the oxidative removal of sulfur compounds (1000&#8197;ppm S) at room temperature within 30&#8197;min. The turnover frequency (TOF) value can reach 44.0&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, which is 109.0, 12.3 and 1.2 times higher than that of pristine UiO&#8208;66(Zr), WO3, and WCl6 (homogeneous catalyst). Theoretical and experimental studies show that the anchored W sites can react with oxidant readily and generate WVI&#8208;peroxo intermediates that determine the reaction activity. Our work not only manifests the application of SSCs in the field of desulfurization of fuel oil but also opens a new solvent&#8208;free avenue for fabricating MOFs based SSCs.

         <title>Physicochemical Understanding of the Impact of Pore Environment and Species of Adsorbates on Adsorption Behaviour</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20504-20510, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relative strength of intermolecular interaction between adsorbates and substrate influences adsorption behaviour. For Ar, the capillary condensation of ZIF&#8208;412 starts at lower pressure than for MOF&#8208;205 due to different adsorbate&#8211;substrate interactions. However, this effect becomes negligible for adsorbates with strong interaction among adsorbates (CO2).







Abstract
For a better design of adsorbents, it is important to know the intermolecular interaction among adsorbates and host material, leading to improved guest selectivity and uptake capacity. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of the interaction among adsorbates and substrate, controlled by the pore environment and species of adsorbates, on the adsorption behaviour. We report the unique CO2 adsorption behaviour of MOF&#8208;205 due to distinct pore geometry. The precise analysis through gas&#8208;adsorption crystallography with molecular simulation shows that capillary condensation of CO2 in MOF&#8208;205 occurs preferentially in the large dodecahedral pore rather than the small tetrahedral pore, because the interaction of CO2 with MOF&#8208;205 framework is weaker than that among CO2 molecules, while Ar and N2 are sequentially filled into two different pores of MOF&#8208;205 according to their size. Comparison of the materials with different pore environments reveals that the relative strength of the adsorbate&#8211;adsorbate and adsorbate&#8211;substrate interaction gives rise to different shapes of isotherms.

The first sodium hydroxyfluorooxoborate Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] has been characterized as a new deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. Two rare heteroanionic units, [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3], are optimally aligned to induce large optical anisotropy and also the dangling bonds are eliminated with O&#8722;H bonds, which makes Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] have a large birefringence and band gap.







Abstract
Maximizing the optical anisotropy in birefringent materials has emerged as an efficient route for modulating the polarization&#8208;dependent light propagation. Currently, the generation of deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) polarized light below 200&#8197;nm is essential but challenging due to the interdisciplinary significance and insufficiency of high&#8208;performing birefringent crystals. Herein, by introducing multiple heteroanionic units, the first sodium difluorodihydroxytriborate&#8208;boric acid Na[B3O3F2(OH)2]&#8901;[B(OH)3] has been characterized as a novel deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystal. Two rare heteroanionic units, [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3], optimally align to induce large optical anisotropy and also the dangling bonds are eliminated with hydrogens, which results in an extremely large birefringence and band gap. The well&#8208;ordered OH/F anions in [B3O3F2(OH)2] and [B(OH)3] were identified and confirmed by various approaches, and also the origin of large birefringence was theoretically discussed. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing hydrogen involved heteroanionic units to design crystals with large birefringence, and also expand the alternative system of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals with new hydroxyfluorooxoborates.

         <title>Kinetic Selection in the Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Autocatalytic Reaction Networks that Produce Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20366-20375, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical system is presented where polymerization of peptide monomers results in predominantly macrocyclic oligomers. Using this system, we make a clear demonstration of how the combination of autocatalysis, diversity of products, and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions results in the selection of complex products.







Abstract
Autocatalytic reaction networks are instrumental for validating scenarios for the emergence of life on Earth and for synthesizing life de novo. Here, we demonstrate that dimeric thioesters of tripeptides with the general structure (Cys&#8208;Xxx&#8208;Gly&#8208;SEt)2 form strongly interconnected autocatalytic reaction networks that predominantly generate macrocyclic peptides up to 69 amino acids long. Some macrocycles of 6&#8211;12 amino acids were isolated from the product pool and were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. We studied the autocatalytic formation of macrocycles in a flow reactor in the presence of acrylamide, whose conjugate addition to thiols served as a model &#8220;removal&#8221; reaction. These results indicate that even not template&#8208;assisted autocatalytic production combined with competing removal of molecular species in an open compartment could be a feasible route for selecting functional molecules during the pre&#8208;Darwinian stages of molecular evolution.

         <title>Catalytic SNAr Hydroxylation and Alkoxylation of Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20391-20399, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation of aryl fluorides via &#951;6&#8208;coordination was achieved. This method was also applicable in the alkoxylation. A Meisenheimer&#8208;type intermediate was successfully isolated and well characterized. Density functional theory calculations and mechanistic studies suggested a stepwise or stepwise&#8208;like energy profile for the SNAr reaction.







Abstract
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is a powerful strategy for incorporating a heteroatom into an aromatic ring by displacement of a leaving group with a nucleophile, but this method is limited to electron&#8208;deficient arenes. We have now established a reliable method for accessing phenols and phenyl alkyl ethers via catalytic SNAr reactions. The method is applicable to a broad array of electron&#8208;rich and neutral aryl fluorides, which are inert under classical SNAr conditions. Although the mechanism of SNAr reactions involving metal arene complexes is hypothesized to involve a stepwise pathway (addition followed by elimination), experimental data that support this hypothesis is still under exploration. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest either a stepwise or stepwise&#8208;like energy profile. Notably, we isolated a rhodium &#951;5&#8208;cyclohexadienyl complex intermediate with an sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon bearing both a nucleophile and a leaving group.

         <title>Transformation Pathway from CdSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters with Absorption Doublets at 373/393&#8197;nm to Clusters at 434/460&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20358-20365, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) have their own unique precursor compounds (PCs). A PC&#8208;enabled pathway has been proposed for the transformation from photoluminescent (PL) CdSe displaying one absorption doublet at 373/393 (dMSC&#8208;393) to 433/460 (dMSC&#8208;460). This pathway contains three key steps with monomer addition (Step&#8197;2) transferring PC&#8208;393 to PC&#8208;460.







Abstract
Divergent interpretations have appeared in the literature regarding the structural nature and evolutionary behavior for photoluminescent CdSe nanospecies with sharp doublets in optical absorption. We report a comprehensive description of the transformation pathway from one CdSe nanospecies displaying an absorption doublet at 373/393&#8197;nm to another species with a doublet at 433/460&#8197;nm. These two nanospecies are zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) with 3D quantum confinement, and are labeled dMSC&#8208;393 and dMSC&#8208;460, respectively. Synchrotron&#8208;based small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) returns a radius of gyration of 0.92&#8197;nm for dMSC&#8208;393 and 1.14&#8197;nm for dMSC&#8208;460, and indicates that both types are disc shaped with the exponent of the SAXS form factor equal to 2.1. The MSCs develop from their unique counterpart precursor compounds (PCs), which are labeled PC&#8208;393 and PC&#8208;460, respectively. For the dMSC&#8208;393 to dMSC&#8208;460 transformation, the proposed PC&#8208;enabled pathway is comprised of three key steps, dMSC&#8208;393 to PC&#8208;393 (Step&#8197;1), PC&#8208;393 to PC&#8208;460 (Step&#8197;2 involving monomer addition), and PC&#8208;460 to dMSC&#8208;460 (Step&#8197;3). The present study provides a framework for understanding the PC&#8208;based evolution of MSCs and how PCs enable transformations between MSCs.

         <title>Holistic View on Materials Development: Water Electrolysis as a Case Study</title>

In the context of a circular economy, the design process of new materials has to change. The performance&#8208;based mindset must be replaced by a holistic approach to efficient materials. For this transition, the collaboration between materials science and sustainability assessment must be improved, and new ways of including assessments into design processes and standardized figures of sustainable merit must be defined.







Abstract
In view of rising ecological awareness, materials development is primarily aimed at improving the performance and efficiency of innovative and more elaborate materials. However, a materials performance figure of merit should include essential aspects of materials: environmental impact, economic constraints, technical feasibility, etc. Thus, we promote the inclusion of sustainability criteria already during the materials design process. With such a holistic design approach, new products may be more likely to meet the circular economy requirements than when traditional development strategies are pursued. Using catalysts for water electrolysis as an example, we present a modelling method based on experimental data to holistically evaluate processes.

The transformation pathway for magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) with absorption doublets has remained unknown so far. Meng Zhang, Jianrong Zeng, Kui Yu et&#8197;al. propose in their Research Article on page&#8197;20358 that the transformation from the MSCs with characteristic optical absorption at 373/393&#8197;nm (dMSC&#8208;393) to those at 433/460&#8197;nm (dMSC&#8208;460) occurs via the addition reaction of the CdSe monomers to the precursor compound of dMSC&#8208;393.

         <dc:description>
By combining X&#8208;ray total scattering and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to obtain unique insight into the formation of atomically precise nanoclusters. In a study of bismuth oxide clusters on page&#8197;20407, Michael Mehring, Kirsten&#8197;M.&#8197;&#216;. Jensen et&#8197;al. investigate the formation of&#160;[Bi38O45] clusters from&#160;[Bi6O8], and show that an intermediate structure of [Bi22O26] plays an important role in the process.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By combining X-ray&lt;/b&gt; total scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering, it is possible to obtain unique insight into the formation of atomically precise nanoclusters. In a study of bismuth oxide clusters on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202103641"&gt;page&#8197;20407&lt;/a&gt;, Michael Mehring, Kirsten&#8197;M.&#8197;&#216;. Jensen et&#8197;al. investigate the formation of&#160;[Bi&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;45&lt;/sub&gt;] clusters from&#160;[Bi&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;], and show that an intermediate structure of [Bi&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;] plays an important role in the process. This intermediate structure was identified through a new automated modelling&#160;approach.

Studies of proton conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have focused on increasing the charge carrier density. Of equal importance is the correlation of intrinsic properties (porosity and surface functionalization) of MOFs with conductivity. In their Communication on page&#8197;20173, Jihan Kim, Dae&#8208;Woon Lim, Hiroshi Kitagawa et&#8197;al. establish a correlation for proton conduction in MOFs with porosity and surface functionality. The confinement effect is essential for strengthening the hydrogen bonds leading to high proton conductivity.

1D hollow nanostructures have been considered as promising electrode materials for different electrochemical energy storage applications. This Minireview gives an overview of recent achievements in the rational design and engineering of 1D hollow nanostructures as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. This unique class of electrodes offers significant advantages for boosting the electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The unique structural characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hollow nanostructures result in intriguing physicochemical properties and wide applications, especially for electrochemical energy storage applications. In this Minireview, we give an overview of recent developments in the rational design and engineering of various kinds of 1D hollow nanostructures with well&#8208;designed architectures, structural/compositional complexity, controllable morphologies, and enhanced electrochemical properties for different kinds of electrochemical energy storage applications (i.e. lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, lithium&#8208;selenium sulfur batteries, lithium metal anodes, metal&#8208;air batteries, supercapacitors). We conclude with prospects on some critical challenges and possible future research directions in this field. It is anticipated that further innovative studies on the structural and compositional design of functional 1D nanostructured electrodes for energy storage applications will be stimulated.

This Review summarizes the use of oils and fats as a renewable raw material by covering novel examples, such as selective oxidation or cleavage of C&#8211;C double bonds in fatty acids, isomerizing hydroformylation and alkoxycarbonylation, and the use of these renewables for polymer chemistry. Further topics include biocatalysis, the optimization of microorganisms by metabolic engineering, and the generation of new oil qualities in existing crop plants.







Abstract
Oils and fats of vegetable and animal origin remain an important renewable feedstock for the chemical industry. Their industrial use has increased during the last 10&#8197;years from 31 to 51 million tonnes annually. Remarkable achievements made in the field of oleochemistry in this timeframe are summarized herein, including the reduction of fatty esters to ethers, the selective oxidation and oxidative cleavage of C&#8211;C double bonds, the synthesis of alkyl&#8208;branched fatty compounds, the isomerizing hydroformylation and alkoxycarbonylation, and olefin metathesis. The use of oleochemicals for the synthesis of a great variety of polymeric materials has increased tremendously, too. In addition to lipases and phospholipases, other enzymes have found their way into biocatalytic oleochemistry. Important achievements have also generated new oil qualities in existing crop plants or by using microorganisms optimized by metabolic engineering.

Life is a non&#8208;equilibrium state of matter maintained at the expense of energy. Nature uses chemical energy stored in molecules to sustain non&#8208;equilibrium structures. This Review describes how chemical energy can be used to control the self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules. The ability of chemists to implement the described strategies in a synthetic context will permit the development of artificial systems with life&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Life is a non&#8208;equilibrium state of matter maintained at the expense of energy. Nature uses predominantly chemical energy stored in thermodynamically activated, but kinetically stable, molecules. These high&#8208;energy molecules are exploited for the synthesis of other biomolecules, for the activation of biological machinery such as pumps and motors, and for the maintenance of structural order. Knowledge of how chemical energy is transferred to biochemical processes is essential for the development of artificial systems with life&#8208;like processes. Here, we discuss how chemical energy can be used to control the structural organization of organic molecules. Four different strategies have been identified according to a distinguishable physical&#8208;organic basis. For each class, one example from biology and one from chemistry are discussed in detail to illustrate the practical implementation of each concept and the distinct opportunities they offer. Specific attention is paid to the discussion of chemically fueled non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly. We discuss the meaning of non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly, its kinetic origin, and strategies to develop synthetic non&#8208;equilibrium systems.

         <title>Sequential Pd0&#8208; and PdII&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations: Enantioselective Heck and Nucleopalladation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20231-20236, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successive cyclization and cross&#8208;coupling of alkenyl aryl iodides and alkyne&#8208;appended nucleophiles via an enantioselective domino&#8208;Heck and regioselective nucleopalladation is reported. Heterocycles originated from N&#8208; or O&#8208;centered nucleophiles were successful in conjunction with the enantioselective formation of dihydrobenzofurans, indolines, chromans, indanes, and polycyclic indolines.







Abstract
An enantioselective consecutive cyclization/coupling process, catalyzed by palladium is reported. Stereoinduction arises from an enantioselective carbopalladation, generating an intermediate which promotes a nucleopalladation step. The dual cyclization sequence was compatible with a variety of alkyne&#8208;tethered oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophiles, and a variety of alkenyl&#8208;tethered aryl iodides, to forge numerous bisheterocycles in good yields and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

Two racemic compounds are combined to form a stable conglomerate system. Both compounds are simultaneously resolved through a single preferential cocrystallization process, showing excellent enantiopurity towards both compounds.







Abstract
We tap into an unexplored area of preferential crystallization, being the first to develop simultaneous chiral resolution of two racemic compounds by preferential cocrystallization. We highlight how the two racemic compounds RS&#8208;mandelic acid (MAN) and RS&#8208;etiracetam (ETI) can be combined together as enantiospecific R&#8208;MAN&#8901;R&#8208;ETI and S&#8208;MAN&#8901;S&#8208;ETI cocrystals forming a stable conglomerate system and subsequently develop a cyclic preferential crystallization allowing to simultaneous resolve both compounds. The developed process leads to excellent enantiopurity both for etiracetam (ee&gt;98&#8201;%) and mandelic acid (ee&#8776;95&#8201;%) enantiomers.

         <title>Controlling the Covalent Reactivity of a Kinase Inhibitor with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20178-20183, September 6, 2021. </description>

To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, we introduce the combination of covalent inhibitors, targeting a cysteine in the vicinity of the ATP binding site of the c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) and diazocine photoswitches. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that our lead inhibitor is a poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitor in the dark and undergoes proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
Covalent kinase inhibitors account for some of the most successful drugs that have recently entered the clinic and many others are in preclinical development. A common strategy is to target cysteines in the vicinity of the ATP binding site using an acrylamide electrophile. To increase the tissue selectivity of kinase inhibitors, it could be advantageous to control the reactivity of these electrophiles with light. Here, we introduce covalent inhibitors of the kinase JNK3 that function as photoswitchable affinity labels (PALs). Our lead compounds contain a diazocine photoswitch, are poor non&#8208;covalent inhibitors in the dark, and become effective covalent inhibitors after irradiation with visible light. Our proposed mode of action is supported by X&#8208;ray structures that explain why these compounds are unreactive in the dark and undergo proximity&#8208;based covalent attachment following exposure to light.

         <title>Understanding and Engineering the Stereoselectivity of Humulene Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20308-20312, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
AsR6 is a type I sesquiterpene cyclase with very low homology to other terpene cyclases. It has a unique bi&#8208;magnesium diphosphate binding site and thus lacks the canonical terpene cyclase aspartate&#8208;rich signature sequences. One magnesium is replaced by the &#1013;&#8208;ammonium ion of a conserved lysine. AsR6 can use FPP and both enantiomers of NPP as substrate. In addition, a single mutation directs formation of 2E or 2Z humulene with very high selectivity.







Abstract
The non&#8208;canonical terpene cyclase AsR6 is responsible for the formation of 2E,6E,9E&#8208;humulene during the biosynthesis of the tropolone sesquiterpenoid (TS) xenovulene A. The structures of unliganded AsR6 and of AsR6 in complex with an in crystallo cyclized reaction product and thiolodiphosphate reveal a new farnesyl diphosphate binding motif that comprises a unique binuclear Mg2+&#8208;cluster and an essential K289 residue that is conserved in all humulene synthases involved in TS formation. Structure&#8208;based site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of AsR6 and its homologue EupR3 identify a single residue, L285/M261, that controls the production of either 2E,6E,9E&#8208; or 2Z,6E,9E&#8208;humulene. A possible mechanism for the observed stereoselectivity was investigated using different isoprenoid precursors and results demonstrate that M261 has gatekeeping control over product formation.

Two benzo&#8208;fused tri[8]annulenes were synthesized via cyclotrimerization reactions, introducing two valid model compounds of the yet elusive carbon allotrope cubic graphite. Both conformers do not interconvert via temperature&#8208; or light&#8208;induced stimuli.







Abstract
Cyclotrimerization of 9,10&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[3,4:7,8]cycloocta[1,2&#8208;l]phenanthrene with potassium tert&#8208;butoxide in the presence of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst afforded two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon stereoisomers consisting of three cyclooctatetraene (COT) moieties connected via a central benzene ring. Both isomeric tri[8]annulenes were obtained selectively through the choice of the catalyst: The &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;form (Ru catalyst) displayed a threefold symmetrywith the COT subunits forming the side walls of a (chiral) molecular cup. In the thermodynamically more stable &#945;,&#945;,&#946;&#8208;isomer (Pd catalyst), one of the three boat&#8208;shaped COTs was flipped over and faced the opposite molecular hemisphere with respect to the central benzene ring as evidenced by crystal structure analysis. Both title compounds are small segments of &#8220;cubic graphite&#8221;, an elusive carbon allotrope.

         <title>Robust and Versatile Coatings Engineered via Simultaneous Covalent and Noncovalent Interactions</title>

Interfacial assemblies are spontaneously formed on various substrates in aqueous conditions via simultaneous covalent and noncovalent interactions using tannic acid and the small aromatic molecule benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol. The robust and colorless coatings enable the subsequent on&#8208;surface synthesis or modification for the development of various multifunctional coatings and nanosystems.







Abstract
Interfacial modular assembly has emerged as an adaptable strategy for engineering the surface properties of substrates in biomedicine, photonics, and catalysis. Herein, we report a versatile and robust coating (pBDT&#8208;TA), self&#8208;assembled from tannic acid (TA) and a self&#8208;polymerizing aromatic dithiol (i.e., benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol, BDT), that can be engineered on diverse substrates with a precisely tuned thickness (5&#8211;40&#8197;nm) by varying the concentration of BDT used. The pBDT&#8208;TA coating is stabilized by covalent (disulfide) bonds and supramolecular (&#960;&#8208;&#960;) interactions, endowing the coating with high stability in various harsh aqueous environments across ionic strength, pH, temperature (e.g., 100&#8197;mM NaCl, HCl (pH&#8197;1) or NaOH (pH&#8197;13), and water at 100&#8201;&#176;C), as well as surfactant solution (e.g., 100&#8197;mM Triton X&#8208;100) and biological buffer (e.g., Dulbecco's phosphate&#8208;buffered saline), as validated by experiments and simulations. Moreover, the reported pBDT&#8208;TA coating enables secondary reactions on the coating for engineering hybrid adlayers (e.g., ZIF&#8208;8 shells) via phenolic&#8208;mediated adhesion, and the facile integration of aromatic fluorescent dyes (e.g., rhodamine B) via &#960; interactions without requiring elaborate synthetic processes.

&lt;p&gt;Interfacial modular assembly has emerged as an adaptable strategy for engineering the surface properties of substrates in biomedicine, photonics, and catalysis. Herein, we report a versatile and robust coating (pBDT-TA), self-assembled from tannic acid (TA) and a self-polymerizing aromatic dithiol (i.e., benzene-1,4-dithiol, BDT), that can be engineered on diverse substrates with a precisely tuned thickness (5&#8211;40&#8197;nm) by varying the concentration of BDT used. The pBDT-TA coating is stabilized by covalent (disulfide) bonds and supramolecular (&#960;-&#960;) interactions, endowing the coating with high stability in various harsh aqueous environments across ionic strength, pH, temperature (e.g., 100&#8197;mM NaCl, HCl (pH&#8197;1) or NaOH (pH&#8197;13), and water at 100&#8201;&#176;C), as well as surfactant solution (e.g., 100&#8197;mM Triton X-100) and biological buffer (e.g., Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline), as validated by experiments and simulations. Moreover, the reported pBDT-TA coating enables secondary reactions on the coating for engineering hybrid adlayers (e.g., ZIF-8 shells) via phenolic-mediated adhesion, and the facile integration of aromatic fluorescent dyes (e.g., rhodamine B) via &#960; interactions without requiring elaborate synthetic processes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mechanistic Study of the Aqueous Reaction of Organic Peroxides with HSO3&#8722; on the Surface of a Water Droplet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20200-20203, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic peroxide&#8211;HSO3&#8722; reaction at the aqueous surface proceeds through two pathways, leading to the formation of inorganic and organic sulfates, respectively. The results have important atmospheric implications.







Abstract
Aqueous reactions between organic peroxides and SO2 are of intense interest in atmospheric science because of their ubiquitous implications for sulfate formation in secondary aerosols. However, the relative yields of the reaction products (inorganic vs. organic sulfates) remain controversial (i.e., 90&#8201;% vs. 40&#8211;70&#8201;% for inorganic sulfate) due in part to the lack of understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, our computational results suggest that the reactions of HSO3&#8722; (dissolved SO2) with organic peroxides are initiated on the surface of water nanodroplets and then proceed under two reaction pathways, in which the S atom of HSO3&#8722; attacks either the O1 or O2 atom of the peroxide group &#8208;O(O2)O(O1)H, leading to the formation of inorganic and organic sulfates, respectively. Notably, we find that thse reaction initiated by O1 atom exhibits a relatively low energy barrier and high reaction rate, which favours the formation of inorganic sulfate.

Catalytic formation of N&#8722;B bonds from atmospheric N2, chloroboranes and electrons is achieved with (triphosphine)molybdenum complexes.







Abstract
Catalytic formation of borylamines from atmospheric N2 is achieved for the first time using a series of homogenous (triphosphine)Mo complexes. Stepwise functionalization of the (triphosphine)Mo&#8208;nitrido complex with chloroborane led to the synthesis of the imido complex. Electrochemical characterization of the (PPP)Mo&#8208;nitrido and (PPP)Mo&#8208;borylimido complexes showed that the latter is much more easily reduced.

         <title>Tuning Electrostatic Gating of Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes by Controlling Protein Orientation in Biosensing Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20184-20189, September 6, 2021. </description>

Nanoscale protein&#8208;based sensing devices designed to present proteins in defined orientations allowed the control of local electrostatic surface presented within the Debye length, and thus modulation of the conductance gating effect upon sensing protein targets.







Abstract
The ability to detect proteins through gating conductance by their unique surface electrostatic signature holds great potential for improving biosensing sensitivity and precision. Two challenges are: (1) defining the electrostatic surface of the incoming ligand protein presented to the conductive surface; (2) bridging the Debye gap to generate a measurable response. Herein, we report the construction of nanoscale protein&#8208;based sensing devices designed to present proteins in defined orientations; this allowed us to control the local electrostatic surface presented within the Debye length, and thus modulate the conductance gating effect upon binding incoming protein targets. Using a &#946;&#8208;lactamase binding protein (BLIP2) as the capture protein attached to carbon nanotube field effect transistors in different defined orientations. Device conductance had influence on binding TEM&#8208;1, an important &#946;&#8208;lactamase involved in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Conductance increased or decreased depending on TEM&#8208;1 presenting either negative or positive local charge patches, demonstrating that local electrostatic properties, as opposed to protein net charge, act as the key driving force for electrostatic gating. This, in turn can, improve our ability to tune the gating of electrical biosensors toward optimized detection, including for AMR as outlined herein.

A facile and highly efficient synthetic protocol towards multifunctional fluorescent cyclopeptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide macrocyclization via dipyrrin staple construction is introduced, where the dipyrrin moiety serves as a novel multifunctional staple linker for targeted protein imaging and selective metal sensing.







Abstract
We introduce a new and highly efficient synthetic protocol towards multifunctional fluorescent cyclopeptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide macrocyclization via dipyrrin construction, with full scope of proteinogenic amino acids and different ring sizes. Various bicyclic peptides can be created by dipyrrin&#8208;based crosslinking and double dipyrrin&#8208;ring formation. The embedded dipyrrin can be either transformed to fluorescent BODIPY and then utilized as cancer&#8208;selective targeted protein imaging probe in vitro, or directly employed as a selective metal sensor in aqueous media. This work provides a valuable addition to the peptide macrocyclization toolbox, and a blueprint for the development of multifunctional dipyrrin linkers in cyclopeptides for a wide range of potential bioapplications.

Enantioselective synthesis of pyridines with all&#8208;carbon quaternary carbon centers has been developed by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of alkyne&#8208;bearing malononitrile and terminal alkynes using a desymmetrization strategy. The regioselectivity of pyridine is controlled by the inherent nature of terminal alkynes and the substituents on the bisoxazolinephosphine ligands.







Abstract
A Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective desymmetric [2+2+2] cycloaddition for synthesis of pyridines with all&#8208;carbon quaternary carbon centers has been developed. The regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities are controlled by the inherent nature of terminal alkynes and the substituents on the bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Pyridines with 5&#8208;substitutents could be obtained with &gt;20:1 regioselectivity and up to 94&#8201;% ee when terminal alkyl, alkenyl or silyl alkynes and DTBM/Ph&#8208;based NPN* ligand L6 were used. Terminal aryl alkynes and Ph/Bn&#8208;based ligand L4 leads to formation of pyridines with 6&#8208;substitutents in up to 99&#8201;% ee.

The regio- and enantioselectivities are controlled by the inherent nature of terminal alkynes and the substituents on the bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Pyridines with 5-substitutents could be obtained with &amp;gt;20:1 regioselectivity and up to 94&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; when terminal alkyl, alkenyl or silyl alkynes and DTBM/Ph-based NPN* ligand &lt;b&gt;L6&lt;/b&gt; were used. Terminal aryl alkynes and Ph/Bn-based ligand &lt;b&gt;L4&lt;/b&gt; leads to formation of pyridines with 6-substitutents in up to 99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Alkene Difunctionalization Triggered by a Stabilized Allenyl Radical: Concomitant Installation of Two Unsaturated C&#8722;C Bonds</title>

Disclosed herein for the first time is the photocatalytic 1,2&#8208;alkynylalkenylation and 1,2&#8208;enynylalkenylation of alkenes, triggered by the intermolecular addition of a stabilized allenyl radical to an alkene. A portfolio of strategically designed, easily accessible dual&#8208;function reagents are applied to a radical docking&#8208;migration cascade. The protocol has broad substrate scope and efficiently increases the degree of unsaturation.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated difunctionalization of alkenes provides a promising approach to introduce one alkenyl or alkynyl group to target compounds. However, simultaneous installation of two unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds via alkene difunctionalization remains elusive, attributable to the high instability and transient lifetimes of alkenyl and alkynyl radicals. Herein, we report the photocatalytic 1,2&#8208;alkynylalkenylation and 1,2&#8208;enynylalkenylation of alkenes for the first time, triggered by the intermolecular addition of a stabilized allenyl radical to an alkene. A portfolio of strategically designed, easily accessible dual&#8208;function reagents are applied to a radical docking&#8208;migration cascade. The protocol has broad substrate scope and efficiently increases the degree of unsaturation.

A nanographitic fused&#8208;nonacyclic &#960;&#8208;system embedded with multiple boron, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms was developed as a narrowband sky&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitter for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A design concept for inducing a synergetic effect on the luminescence function by exquisite multi&#8208;heteroatom hybridization is presented.







Abstract
Developing organic luminophores with unique capability of strong narrowband emission is both crucial and challenging for the further advancement of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a nanographitic fused&#8208;nonacyclic &#960;&#8208;system (BSBS&#8208;N1), which was strategically embedded with multiple boron, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms, was developed as a new multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter. Narrowband sky&#8208;blue emission with a peak at 478&#8197;nm, full width at half maximum of 24&#8197;nm, and photoluminescence quantum yield of 89&#8201;% was obtained with BSBS&#8208;N1. Additionally, the spin&#8208;orbit coupling was enhanced by incorporating two sulfur atoms, thereby facilitating the spin&#8208;flipping process between the excited triplet and singlet states. OLEDs based on BSBS&#8208;N1 as a sky&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter achieved a high maximum external electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 21.0&#8201;%, with improved efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich High&#8208;Entropy Oxide Nanosheets for Efficient 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20253-20258, September 6, 2021. </description>

Defect&#8208;rich high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) nanosheets with high surface area are synthesized through a plasma strategy under low&#8208;temperature. The unique structural and compositional advantages endow the HEOs nanosheets with superior electrocatalytic activity for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), a new concept of entropy stabilization, exhibit unique structures and fascinating properties, and are thus important class of materials with significant technological potential. However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques tend to afford micron&#8208;scale HEOs with low surface area, and the catalytic activity of available HEOs is still far from satisfactory because of their limited exposed active sites and poor intrinsic activity. Here we report a low&#8208;temperature plasma strategy for preparing defect&#8208;rich HEOs nanosheets with high surface area, and for the first time employ them for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrooxidation. Owing to the nanosheets structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and high surface area, the quinary (FeCrCoNiCu)3O4 nanosheets deliver improved activity for HMF oxidation with lower onset potential and faster kinetics, outperforming that of HEOs prepared by high&#8208;temperature method. Our method opens new opportunities for synthesizing nanostructured HEOs with great potential applications.

         <title>Void Space versus Surface Functionalization for Proton Conduction in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20173-20177, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Void space and pore surface functionalization are important structural factors for the design of proton&#8208;conductive MOFs. The priority of these factors was studied systematically, and a MOF with lower porosity and high pore surface functionalization was found to have remarkably high proton conductivity. On the other hand, high porosity proved inefficient in inducing high proton conductivity (see picture).







Abstract
Void space and functionality of the pore surface are important structural factors for proton&#8208;conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) impregnated with conducting media. However, no clear study has compared their priority factors, which need to be considered when designing proton&#8208;conductive MOFs. Herein, we demonstrate the effects of void space and pore&#8208;surface modification on proton conduction in MOFs through the surface&#8208;modified isoreticular MOF&#8208;74(Ni) series [Ni2(dobdc or dobpdc), dobdc=2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate and dobpdc=4,4&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate]. The MOF with lower porosity with the same surface functionality showed higher proton conductivity than that with higher porosity despite including a smaller amount of conducting medium. Density functional theory calculations suggest that strong hydrogen bonding between molecules of the conducting medium at high porosity is inefficient in inducing high proton conductivity.

         <title>Selective C&#8211;F Bond Allylation of Trifluoromethylalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20237-20242, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By capitalizing on the unique fluorine effects, a mono&#8208;selective C&#8722;F bond allylation of trifluoromethylalkenes, which proceeds through a cascade of nucleophilic SN2&#8242; defluorinative allylation and Cope rearrangement, was achieved under operationally convenient conditions.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond functionalization of CF3 group represents an appealing strategy for the incorporation of pharmaceutically privileged difluoromethylene moiety.

&lt;p&gt;By capitalizing on the unique fluorine effects, a mono-selective C&#8722;F bond allylation of trifluoromethylalkenes, which proceeds through a cascade of nucleophilic S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2&#8242; defluorinative allylation and Cope rearrangement, was achieved under operationally convenient conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective C&#8722;F bond functionalization of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group represents an appealing strategy for the incorporation of pharmaceutically privileged difluoromethylene moiety. Despite the recent significant advancement attained in the functionalization of Ar-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, prescriptions amenable for alkenyl-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; congeners remain sufficiently inadequate. Herein, we report a strategically novel protocol for the C&#8722;F bond elaboration of trifluoromethylalkene derivatives. By using readily available allyl metallics as nucleophilic coupling partner, the present reaction enables an expedient construction of structurally diversified CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-bridged 1,5-dienes. Furthermore, the exquisite selectivity observed in this transformation is revealed to be based on the underlying mechanism that consists of a cascade of nucleophilic S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2&#8242; defluorinative allylation and electronically promoted Cope rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis as Efficient Tool for the Direct Electrochemical Oxidation of Hydroxamic Acids for Acyl Nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>

Hydroxamic acids were electrochemically oxidised to initiate acyl nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with 1,3&#8208;dienes. By using alternating current, their often encountered electrochemically induced decomposition could be suppressed to generate the desired cycloaddition products in up to 96&#8201;% yield. The optimisation of this reaction was performed using the Design of Experiments approach.







Abstract
The acyl nitroso Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with electrochemically oxidised hydroxamic acids is described. By using alternating current electrolysis, their typical electro&#8208;induced decomposition could be suppressed in favour of the 1,2&#8208;oxazine cycloaddition products. The reaction was optimised using Design of Experiments (DoE) and a sensitivity test was conducted. A mixture of triethylamine/hexafluoroisopropanol served as supporting electrolyte in dichloromethane, thus giving products of high purity after evaporation of the volatiles without further purification. The optimised reaction conditions were applied to various 1,3&#8208;dienes and hydroxamic acids, giving up to 96&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis of Enterocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20269-20273, September 6, 2021. </description>

Entering Nature's Design Office: The highly oxygenated natural product enterocin, which has so far resisted total synthetic attempts, was obtained in a biomimetic key step from triketone 1, which in turn was assembled from an L&#8208;arabinose&#8208;derived core fragment with a defined absolute configuration.







Abstract
The first chemical total synthesis of the highly oxygenated polyketide enterocin has been accomplished. The key step of the synthesis was a late&#8208;stage biomimetic reaction cascade involving two intramolecular aldol reactions in which each step proceeded in 52&#8201;% yield (averaged) and which established four of the seven stereogenic centers. The pivotal precursor for the cascade reaction was assembled from three readily available building blocks. A chiral dithioacetal with two stereogenic centers originating from L&#8208;arabinose represented the core fragment to both ends of which the other building blocks were attached by aldol reactions. The remaining stereogenic center was installed by Davis oxygenation immediately prior to the key step.

         <title>HPM&#8208;16, a Stable Interrupted Zeolite with a Multidimensional Mixed Medium&#8211;Large Pore System Containing Supercages</title>

HPM&#8208;16 is a new interrupted zeolite with 3D intersecting 12+10&#215;10(12)&#215;12+10&#8197;MR channels containing 30&#8197;&#197; long supercages. The structure, with a very long b&#8208;axis (&gt;50&#8197;&#197;), was solved by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 3D&#8197;electron diffraction. Degermanated HPM&#8208;16 is stable up to 800&#8201;&#176;C. Several derived structures were studied, including a recently reported one.







Abstract
HPM&#8208;16 is a highly porous germanosilicate zeolite with an interrupted framework that contains a three&#8208;dimensional system of 12+10&#215;10(12)&#215;12+10&#8208;membered ring (MR) pores. The 10(12)&#8197;MR pore in the b&#8197;direction is a 10&#8197;MR pore with long 12&#8197;MR stretches forming 30&#8197;&#197; long tubular supercages. Along one direction the 10&#8197;MR pores are fused, meaning that the separation between adjacent pores consists of a single tetrahedron that is, additionally, connected to only three additional tetrahedra (a Q3). These fused pores are thus decorated by T&#8208;OH groups along the whole diffusion path, creating a hydrophilic region embedded in an otherwise essentially hydrophobic environment. The structure is built from highly porous 12&#215;12&#215;12&#8197;MR uninterrupted layers that are connected to each other through Q3 producing a second system of 10&#215;10&#215;10&#8197;MR pores. This zeolite can be extensively degermanated yielding a material with high thermal stability, despite its interrupted nature.

         <title>Molecular Engineering on MoS2 Enables Large Interlayers and Unlocked Basal Planes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20286-20293, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ molecular engineering of structure defect manufacturing and O&#8208;doping unlocks the MoS2 basal plane and simultaneously upgrades its interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6&#8197;&#197;), hydrophilicity, and electrical conductivity. These merits enable highly efficient 3D Zn&#8208;ion transport in the MoS2 lattice along both the ab plane and c&#8208;axis, thus leading to fast reaction kinetics and the exceptional rate performance in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;storage behaviors of MoS2&#8208;based cathodes mainly rely on the ion&#8208;(de)intercalation at edge sites but are limited by the inactive basal plane. Herein, an in&#8208;situ molecular engineering strategy in terms of structure defects manufacturing and O&#8208;doping is proposed for MoS2 (designated as D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O) to unlock the inert basal plane, expand the interlayer spacing (from 6.2 to 9.6&#8197;&#197;), and produce abundant 1T&#8208;phase. The tailored D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O with excellent hydrophilicity and high conductivity allows the 3D Zn2+ transport along both the ab plane and c&#8208;axis, thus achieving the exceptional high rate capability. Zn2+ diffusion through the basal plane is verified by DFT computations. As a proof of concept, the wearable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state rechargeable Zn battery employing the D&#8208;MoS2&#8208;O cathode operates stably even under severe bending conditions, showing great application prospects. This work opens a new window for designing high&#8208;performance layered cathode materials for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

A method is described for the isomerization of acyclic allylic alcohols into &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketones via 1,3&#8208;alkyl transposition. This reaction proceeds via light&#8208;driven proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) activation of the O&#8722;H bond in an allylic alcohol substrate, followed by C&#8722;C &#946;&#8208;scission of the resulting alkoxy radical to form an enone and an alkyl radical that may recombine via radical conjugate addition.

The transient alkyl radical and enone acceptor generated in the scission event subsequently recombine via radical conjugate addition to deliver &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketone products. A variety of allylic alcohol substrates bearing alkyl and acyl migratory groups were successfully accommodated. Insights from mechanistic studies led to a modified reaction protocol that improves reaction performance for challenging substrates.

         <title>Efficient Asymmetric Biomimetic Aldol Reaction of Glycinates and Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20166-20172, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient biomimetic aldol reaction of glycinate and trifluoromethyl ketones was developed with 0.1&#8211;0.0033&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral pyridoxal 7&#8201;a as the catalyst, producing &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid esters 6 in 55&#8211;82&#8201;% yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee) without protection of the active NH2 group. The reaction proceeds via a bifunctional&#8208;catalysis pathway similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine.







Abstract
The direct asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinates represents an intriguing and straightforward strategy to make biologically significant chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid derivatives. But it is not easy to realize the transformation due to the disruption of the reactive NH2 group of glycinates. Inspired by the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine, we successfully developed an asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinate 5 and trifluoromethyl ketones 4 with 0.1&#8211;0.0033&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral N&#8208;methyl pyridoxal 7&#8201;a as the catalyst, producing chiral &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid esters 6 in 55&#8211;82&#8201;% yields (for the syn&#8208;diastereomers) with up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99&#8201;% ee under very mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via a catalytic cycle similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine. Pyridoxal catalyst 7&#8201;a activates both reactants at the same time and brings them together in a specific spatial orientation, accounting for the high efficiency as well as excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Noncovalently Functionalized Commodity Polymers as Tailor&#8208;Made Additives for Stereoselective Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20243-20248, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy to fabricate &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives by attaching chiral small molecules onto achiral commodity polymers through non&#8208;covalent interactions is developed. These supramolecular additives were used in the stereoselective crystallization of various racemates and yielded enantiopure crystals with opposite configurations to the chiral moieties.







Abstract
Stereoselective inhibition of the nucleation and crystal growth of one enantiomer aided by &#8220;tailor&#8208;made&#8221; polymeric additives is an efficient method to obtain enantiopure compounds. However, the conventional preparation of polymeric additives from chiral monomers are laborious and limited in structures, which impedes their rapid optimization and applicability. Herein, we report a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; strategy to facilitate synthesis by using commercially available achiral polymers as the platform to attach various chiral small molecules as the recognition side&#8208;chains through non&#8208;covalent interactions. A library of supramolecular polymers made up of two vinyl polymers and six small molecules were applied with seeds in the selective crystallization of seven racemates in different solvents. They showed good to excellent stereoselectivity in yielding crystals with high enantiomeric purities in conglomerates and racemic compound forming systems. This convenient, low&#8208;cost modular synthesis strategy of polymeric additives will allow for high&#8208;efficient, economical resolution of various racemates on different scales.

A high mobility organic lasing semiconductor of 2,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;1) with crystallization&#8208;enhanced emission is demonstrated. The light emitting transistor based on an individual LD&#8208;1 nanowire crystal gives typical electrically induced emission. This work provides a new concept for developing superior organic lasing semiconductors to advance research of electrically&#8208;driven ultrasmall integrated optoelectronic devices and circuits.







Abstract
The development of high mobility organic laser semiconductors with strong emission is of great scientific and technical importance, but challenging. Herein, we present a high mobility organic laser semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;1) showing unique crystallization&#8208;enhanced emission guided by elaborately modulating its crystal growth process. The obtained one&#8208;dimensional nanowires of LD&#8208;1 show outstanding integrated properties including: high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) approaching 80&#8201;%, high charge carrier mobility of 0.08&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, Fabry&#8208;Perot lasing characters with a low threshold of 86&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high&#8208;quality factor of &#8776;2400. Furthermore, electrically induced emission was obtained from an individual LD&#8208;1 crystal nanowire&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting transistor due to the recombination of holes and electrons simultaneously injected into the nanowire, which provides a good platform for the study of electrically pumped organic lasers and other related ultrasmall integrated electrical&#8208;driven photonic devices.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling Gradient Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel Membranes as High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20294-20300, September 6, 2021. </description>

Benefitting from an inherent high conductivity, excellent ion selectivity of 3D charged polymer networks, and a charge&#8208;induced ionic&#8208;diode gradient effect, all&#8208;polysaccharide polyelectrolyte hydrogel gradient membranes prepared by ultrafast reaction/diffusion have been demonstrated to enable high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion.







Abstract
Emerging asymmetric ionic membranes consisting of two different porous membranes show great superiority in harvesting clean and renewable osmotic energy. The main barriers constraining their applications are incompatible interfaces and a low interfacial ionic transport efficiency, which are detrimental to the long&#8208;term stability and improvement of the power density.

&lt;p&gt;Benefitting from an inherent high conductivity, excellent ion selectivity of 3D charged polymer networks, and a charge-induced ionic-diode gradient effect, all-polysaccharide polyelectrolyte hydrogel gradient membranes prepared by ultrafast reaction/diffusion have been demonstrated to enable high-performance osmotic energy conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging asymmetric ionic membranes consisting of two different porous membranes show great superiority in harvesting clean and renewable osmotic energy. The main barriers constraining their applications are incompatible interfaces and a low interfacial ionic transport efficiency, which are detrimental to the long-term stability and improvement of the power density. Here, continuous-gradient all-polysaccharide polyelectrolyte hydrogel membranes prepared by ultrafast reaction/diffusion have been demonstrated to enable high-performance osmotic energy conversion. Besides an inherent high ion conductivity and excellent ion selectivity, the anti-swelling polyelectrolyte gradient membranes preserve the ionic diode effect of the asymmetric membranes to facilitate one-way ion diffusion but circumvent adverse interfacial effects. In consequence, they can present ultrahigh power densities of 7.87&#8197;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; by mixing seawater and river water, far superior to state-of-the-art membranes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergy and Antagonism between Allosteric and Active&#8208;Site Inhibitors of Abl Tyrosine Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20196-20199, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a better understanding of the interaction between allosteric and ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors of Abl. Using a protease accessibility assay we developed, we determined the global conformation of Abl when bound to Abl inhibitors. We found that synergy between ATP&#8208;competitive and allosteric inhibitors of Abl required a &#8220;matched&#8221; kinase conformation.







Abstract
Allosteric inhibitors of Abl kinase are being explored in the clinic, often in combination with ATP&#8208;site inhibitors of Abl kinase. However, there are conflicting data on whether both ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and myristoyl&#8208;site allosteric inhibitors can simultaneously bind Abl kinase. Here, we determine whether there is synergy or antagonism between ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors of Abl. We observe that clinical ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors are not synergistic with allosteric ABL inhibitors, however, conformation&#8208;selective ATP&#8208;site inhibitors that modulate the global conformation of Abl can afford synergy. We demonstrate that kinase conformation is the key driver to simultaneously bind two compounds to Abl kinase. Finally, we explore the interaction of allosteric and conformation selective ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors in a series of biochemical and cellular assays.

         <title>Multistage Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based on Host&#8211;Guest Doping Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 37, Page 20259-20263, September 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of different conjugation degrees on the quantum yield and lifetime of room temperature phosphorescence in a host&#8211;guest system is discussed. Multistage stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics from grinding to chemical stimulus were achieved by introducing a pyridine group into the guest molecule. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting printings were realized through various methods, including stylus printing, thermal printing and inkjet printing.







Abstract
Compared with inorganic long&#8208;lasting luminescent materials, organic room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) ones show several advantages, such as flexibility, transparency, solubility and color adjustability. However, organic RTP materials close to commercialization are still to be developed. In this work, we developed a new host&#8211;guest doping system with stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics, in which triphenylphosphine oxide (OPph3) acted host and benzo(dibenzo)phenothiazine dioxide derivatives as guests. Turn&#8208;on RTP effect was realized by mixing them together through co&#8208;crystallization or grinding, in which the efficient energy transfer from host to guest and the strong intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the guest have played significant role. Further on, multistage stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP characteristics from grinding to chemical stimulus were achieved via introducing pyridine group into the guest molecule. In addition, the anti&#8208;counterfeiting printings were realized for these materials through various methods, including stylus printing, thermal printing and inkjet printing, which brings RTP materials closer to commercialization.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitchably bioactive reagents promise powerful applications to high&#8208;precision biological research. Yet, as most photoswitch scaffolds cannot be quantitatively bidirectionally photoisomerised, they suffer from residual background activity that can confound experiments. We report the first cellular application of the emerging near&#8208;quantitative photoswitch pyrrole hemithioindigo, by rationally designing photopharmaceutical "  PHTub  " inhibitors of the cytoskeletal protein tubulin.  PHTubs  allow simultaneous visible&#8208;light imaging and photoswitching in live cells, delivering cell&#8208;precise photomodulation of microtubule dynamics, and photocontrol over cell cycle progression and cell death. This is the first acute use of a hemithioindigo photopharmaceutical for high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution biological control in live cells. It additionally demonstrates the utility of near&#8208;quantitative photoswitches, by enabling a dark&#8208;active design to overcome residual background activity during cellular photopatterning. This work opens up new horizons for high&#8208;precision microtubule research using  PHTubs  ; and shows the cellular applicability of pyrrole hemithioindigo as a valuable scaffold for photocontrol of a range of other biological targets.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds to generate chiral three&#8208;dimensional motifs is one of the most straightforward and important approaches in synthetic chemistry. We realized the Ru(II)&#8208;NHC catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild reaction conditions. Alkyl, aryl and halogen substituted optically active dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones were obtained in high yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. The reaction provides an efficient and atom economic pathway to construct simple chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones. The desired products could be further reduced to tetrahydroquinolines and octahydroquinolones.</dc:description>

         <title>Background&#8208;Free Proton NMR Spectroscopy with Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the utility of Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation (RASER) for background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized biomolecules. We performed hyperpolarization of ~0.3 M ethyl acetate via pairwise parahydrogen addition to vinyl acetate. Proton NMR signal with signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio exceeding 100,000 was detected without radio&#8208;frequency excitation at the clinically relevant magnetic field of 1.4 T using a standard (non&#8208;cryogenic) inductive detector with quality factor of Q = 68. No proton background signal was observed from protonated solvent (methanol) or other added co&#8208;solvents such as ethanol, water or bovine serum. Moreover, we demonstrate RASER detection without radio&#8208;frequency excitation of a bolus of hyperpolarized contrast agent in biological fluid.&#160; Completely background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized contrast agents in biological media paves the way to new applications in the areas of high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and in vivo spectroscopy and imaging.</dc:description>
