         <title>Achiral Dichroic Dyes&#8208;mediated Circularly Polarized Emission Regulated by Orientational Order Parameter through Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is noteworthy that cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) platforms have been witnessed in high&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) behaviors through the highly organized chiral co&#8208;assembled arrangement of achiral dyes. However, most CPL&#8208;active design strategies are closely relative to the helix co&#8208;assembly structure of CLC rather than achiral dyes. Herein, we developed an intriguing regulation strategy for CPL&#8208;active CLC materials. They were regulated using the orientational order parameter (SF) of achiral dichroic dyes as an incisive probe for the order arrangement degree of achiral dyes in CLC media. The I&#8208;shaped phenothiazine derivative PHECN dye (SF =0.30) emitted a strong CPL signal (|glum| = 0.47). In contrast, the T&#8208;shaped derivative (PHEBen) dye (SF =0.09) showed a weak circular polarization level (|glum| = 0.07) at similar CLC textures. Most interestingly, this kind of dichroic PHECN dye with a higher SF could greatly improve the contrast ratio of CPL (&#916;glum = 0.47) and emission intensity (&#916;FL = 46.0%) at direct&#8208;current electric field compared with the T&#8208;shaped PHEBen (&#916;glum = 0.07 and &#916;FL = 1.0%) in CLCs. This work demonstrates that an induced CPL emission can be mediated using achiral dichroic dye, which will open a new avenue for developing excellent CPL&#8208;active display materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Persistent Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Host&#8208;Guest System Regulated by the Multiple Roles of Gold(I)&#8208;Carbene Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The promotion of intersystem crossing (ISC) is critical for achieving a high&#8208;efficiency long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) from organic materials. However, the use of transition metal complex for LPL materials has not been explored because it can also shorten emission lifetime by accelerating the phosphorescence decay. Here, we report a new class of LPL materials by doping a monovalent Au&#8208;carbene complex into a boron&#8208;embedded molecular host . The donor&#8208;acceptor systems exhibit photoluminescence with both high efficiencies (&gt; 57%) and long lifetimes (ca. 40 ms) at room temperature. It is revealed that the Au atom promotes the population of low&#8208;lying triplet excited states of the host aggregate (T1*) which can be converted to the charge&#8208;transfer &#65288;CT&#65289;state, resulting in afterglow luminescence. Moreover, the use of a chirality unit on the guest molecule makes the LPL circularly polarized. This work manifests that transition metal complexes can be used for developing organic afterglow systems by exquisite control over the excited state mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Guanidinate Anions [CN3]5&#8208; in Calcite&#8208;Type SbCN3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stabilization of nitrogen&#8208;rich phases presents a significant chemical challenge due to the inherent stability of the dinitrogen molecule. This stabilization can be achieved by utilizing strong covalent bonds in complex anions with carbon, such as cyanide CN&#8208; and NCN2&#8208;&#160;carbodiimide, while more nitrogen&#8208;rich carbonitrides are hitherto unknown. Following a rational chemical design approach, we synthesized antimony guanidinate SbCN3 at pressures of 32&#8208;38 GPa using various synthetic routes in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. SbCN3, which is isostructural to calcite CaCO3, can be recovered under ambient conditions. Its structure contains the previously elusive guanidinate anion [CN3]5&#8208;, marking a fundamental milestone in nitridocarbonate&#160;chemistry. The crystal structure of SbCN3 was solved and refined from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and was fully corroborated by theoretical calculations, which also predict that SbCN3 has a direct band gap with the value 2.20 eV. This study opens a straightforward route to the entire new family of inorganic nitridocarbonates.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Decorated Organoboron Emitters with Low&#8208;Lying HOMO Levels for Solution&#8208;Processed Narrowband Blue Hyperfluorescence OLED Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hyperfluorescence has drawn great attention in achieving efficient narrowband emitting devices based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. However, achieving efficient solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices is still a challenge, due to the unbalanced charge transport and serious exciton quenching caused by that the holes are easily trapped on the high&#8208;lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level of traditional diphenylamine&#8208;decorated emitters. Here, we developed two narrowband blue organoboron emitters with low&#8208;lying HOMO levels by decorating the MR&#8208;TADF core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which could suppress the hole trapping effect by reducing the hole traps between host and MR&#8208;TADF emitter from deep (0.40 eV) to shallow (0.14/0.20 eV) ones for facilitating hole transport and exciton formation, as well as avoiding exciton quenching. And the large dihedral angle between the carbazole and MR&#8208;TADF core makes the carbazole act as a steric hindrance to inhibit molecular aggregation. Accordingly, the optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices simultaneously realize record external quantum efficiency of 29.2%, narrowband emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 16.6 nm, and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.139, 0.189), which is the best result for the solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Depolymerization of Plastic Waste Enabled by Plastic&#8208;Catalyst Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depolymerization of condensation polymers by chemolysis often suffers from the large usage of solvents and homogeneous catalysts such as acids, bases, and metal salts. The catalytic efficiency of heterogeneous catalysts is largely constrained by the poor interfacial contact between solid catalysts and solid plastics below melting points. We report here our discovery of autogenous heterogeneous catalyst layer on polyethylene terephthalate surfaces during the generally believed homogeneous catalytic depolymerization process. Inspired by the &#8220;contact mass&#8221; concept in industrial chlorosilane production, we further demonstrate that the construction of plastic&#8208;catalyst solid&#8208;solid interfaces enables solvent&#8208;free depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate by vapor phase methanolysis at relatively low temperatures. Trace amounts of earth&#8208;abundant element (zinc) introduced by electrostatic adsorption is sufficient for catalyzing the depolymerization. The concept of plastic&#8208;catalyst contact mass interfacial catalysis might inspire new pathways for tackling plastic waste problems.</dc:description>

         <title>Narrowband Fluorescent Emitters Based on BN&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons&#160;for&#160;Efficient&#160;and Stable Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using conventional fluorescent emitters are currently attracting considerable interests due to outstanding stability and abundant raw materials. To construct high&#8208;performance narrowband fluorophores to satisfy requirements of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays, a strategy fusing multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped moieties to naphthalene is proposed to construct two novel narrowband fluorophores.&#160;Green Na&#8208;sBN and red Na&#8208;dBN, manifest narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of 31 nm, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and molecular horizontal dipole ratios above 90%. Their OLEDs exhibit the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances including high external quantum efficiencies (EQE), ultra&#8208;low efficiency roll&#8208;off and long&#160;operational lifetimes. The Na&#8208;sBN&#8208;based device achieves EQE as high as 28.8% and remains 19.8% even at luminance of 100,000 cd m&#8208;2, and Na&#8208;dBN&#8208;based device acquires a record&#8208;high EQE of 25.2% among all red OLEDs using pure&#160;fluorescent emitters.</dc:description>

Their OLEDs exhibit the state-of-the-art performances including high external quantum efficiencies (EQE), ultra-low efficiency roll-off and long&#160;operational lifetimes. The Na-sBN-based device achieves EQE as high as 28.8% and remains 19.8% even at luminance of 100,000 cd m-2, and Na-dBN-based device acquires a record-high EQE of 25.2% among all red OLEDs using pure&#160;fluorescent emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Catalytic Potential: Exploring the Impact of Thermal Treatment on Enhanced Electrocatalysis of Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the evolving field of electrocatalysis, thermal treatment of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts has become an essential strategy for performance enhancement. This review systematically investigates the impact of various thermal treatments on the catalytic potential of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts. The focus encompasses an in&#8208;depth analysis of the changes induced in structural, morphological, and compositional properties, as well as alterations in electro&#8208;active surface area, surface chemistry, and crystal defects. By providing a comprehensive comparison of commonly used thermal techniques, such as annealing, calcination, sintering, pyrolysis, hydrothermal, and solvothermal methods, this review serves as a scientific guide for selecting the right thermal technique and favorable temperature to tailor the nano&#8208;electrocatalysts for optimal electrocatalysis. The resultant modifications in catalytic activity are explored across key electrochemical reactions such as electrochemical (bio)sensing, catalytic degradation, oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, fuel cells, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Through a detailed examination of the underlying mechanisms and synergistic effects, this review contributes to a fundamental understanding of the role of thermal treatments in enhancing electrocatalytic properties. The insights provided offer a roadmap for future research aimed at optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of nanomaterials, fostering the development of next&#8208;generation sensors and energy conversion technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Multivariate hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with tunable permanent porosity for a mustard gas simulant capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise synthesis of topologically predictable and discrete molecular crystals with permanent porosities remains a long&#8208;term challenge. Here, we report the first successful synthesis of a series of isoreticular multivariate hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MTV&#8208;HOFs) from pyrene&#8208;based derivatives bearing &#8208;H, &#8208;CH3, &#8208;NH2 and &#8208;F groups achieved by a shape&#8208;fitted, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly strategy. These MTV&#8208;HOFs are single&#8208;crystalline materials composed of tectons with as many as 4 different functionalities, verified by single&#8208;crystal diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, and Raman spectra. These MTV&#8208;HOFs exhibit tunable hydrophobicity with water uptake starting from 50 to 80% relative humidity, by adjusting the combinations and ratios of functional groups. As a proof of application, the resulting MTV&#8208;HOFs were shown to be capable of capturing a mustard gas simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) from moisture. The location of different functional groups within the pores of MTV&#8208;HOFs leads to a synergistic effect, which resulted in a superior CEES/H2O selectivity (up to 94%) to that of the HOFs with only pure component and enhanced breakthrough performance (up to 4000 min/g) when compared to benchmark MOF materials. The synthesis of MTV&#8208;HOFs provides a platform for the development of porous molecular materials for numerous applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting the Catenane Mechanical Bond Effect for Selective Halide Anion Transmembrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first examples of [2]catenanes capable of selective anion transport across a lipid bilayer are reported. The neutral halogen bonding (XB) [2]catenanes were prepared via a chloride template&#8208;directed strategy in an unprecedented demonstration of using XB&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;anion interactions to direct catenane assembly from all&#8208;neutral components. Anion binding experiments in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media revealed strong halide over oxoanion selectivity, and a marked enhancement in the chloride and bromide affinities of the catenanes relative to their constituent macrocycles. The catenanes displayed an anti&#8208;Hofmeister binding preference for bromide over the larger iodide anion, illustrating the efficacy of employing sigma&#8208;hole interactions in conjunction with the mechanical bond effect to tune receptor selectivity. Transmembrane anion transport studies conducted in POPC LUVs revealed that the catenanes were more effective anion transporters than the constituent macrocycles, with high chloride over hydroxide selectivity, which is critical to potential therapeutic applications of anionophores. Remarkably these outperform existing acyclic halogen bonding anionophores with regards to this selectivity. Record chloride over nitrate anion transport selectivity was also observed. This represents a rare example of the direct translation of intrinsic anion binding affinities to anion transport behaviour, and demonstrates the key role of the catenane mechanical bond effect for enhanced anion transport selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A High Pressure Operando Spectroscopy Examination of Bimetal Interactions in &#8216;Metal Efficient&#8217; Palladium/In2O3/Al2O3 Catalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando spectroscopy under CO2 hydrogenation conditions reveals the importance of catalyst design in a metal&#8208;efficient Palladium/In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. Concurrent X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of Pd and In, combined with infrared techniques reveals the roles of the two metals, relating them to the catalytic mechanism with vital insights for future multimetallic catalyst development.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has the potential to serve as a sustainable route to a wide variety of hydrocarbons, fuels and plastics in the quest for net zero. Synergistic Pd/In2O3 (Palldium on Indium Oxide) catalysts show high CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity, enhancing methanol yield. The identity of the optimal active site for this reaction is unclear, either as a Pd&#8722;In alloy, proximate metals, or distinct sites. In this work, we demonstrate that metal&#8208;efficient Pd/In2O3 species dispersed on Al2O3 can match the performance of pure Pd/In2O3 systems. Further, we follow the evolution of both Pd and In sites, and surface species, under operando reaction conditions using X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscpy (XAS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. In doing so, we can determine both the nature of the active sites and the influence on the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>A Deeper Understanding of Metal Nucleation and Growth in Rechargeable Metal Batteries Through Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable metal batteries are still at the forefront of battery research. Each battery cell component that relates to anode performance (the current collector, anode surface, solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), and electrolyte) is described by a unique set of applicable models and theories to better understand and predict metal nucleation and growth.







Abstract
Lithium and sodium metal batteries continue to occupy the forefront of battery research. Their exceptionally high energy density and nominal voltages are highly attractive for cutting&#8208;edge energy storage applications. Anode&#8208;free metal batteries are also coming into the research spotlight offering improved safety and even higher energy densities than conventional metal batteries. However, uneven metal nucleation and growth which leads to dendrites continues to limit the commercialisation of conventional and anode&#8208;free metal batteries alike. This review connects models and theories from well&#8208;established fields in metallurgy and electrodeposition to both conventional and anode&#8208;free metal batteries. These highly applicable models and theories explain the driving forces of uneven metal growth and can inform future experiment design. Finally, the models and theories that are most relevant to each anode&#8208;related cell component are identified. Keeping these specific models and theories in mind will assist with rational design for these components.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite three decades of intensive investigation of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) there are still unexplored roads towards increasing their magnetization blocking temperature. In this Review, after short overview of key SMM compounds, the basic strategies for further enhancement of SMM performance for mononuclear and polynuclear complexes are presented.







Abstract
The synthesis of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), magnetic complexes capable of retaining magnetization blocking for a long time at elevated temperatures, has been a major concern for magnetochemists over the last three decades. In this review, we describe basic SMMs and the different approaches that allow high magnetization&#8208;blocking temperatures to be reached. We focus on the basic factors affecting magnetization blocking, magnetic axiality and the height of the blocking barrier, which can be used to group different families of complexes in terms of their SMM efficiency. Finally, we discuss several practical routes for the design of mono&#8208; and polynuclear complexes that could be applied in memory devices.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Olefin Based Crystalline Schlenk Hydrocarbon Diradicals with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable crystalline Schlenk hydrocarbon diradical was isolated without any kinetic blocking at the central m&#8208;phenylene bridge. An EPR study and quantum chemical calculations suggest the triplet state to be the ground state.







Abstract
A modular approach for the synthesis of isolable crystalline Schlenk hydrocarbon diradicals from m&#8208;phenylene bridged electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;triazaalkenes as synthons is reported. EPR spectroscopy confirms their diradical nature and triplet electronic structure by revealing a half&#8208;field signal. A computational analysis confirms the triplet state to be the ground state. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the modular methodology, the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;m&#8208;phenylene was further utilized as a coupling unit between two alkene motifs. The steric conjunction of the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl groups substantially twists the substituents at the nonbonding electron bearing centers relative to the central coupling m&#8208;phenylene motif. As a result, the spin delocalization is decreased and the exchange coupling between the two unpaired spins, hence, significantly reduced. Notably, 108&#8197;years after Schlenk's m&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl) synthesis as a diradical, for the first time we were able to isolate its derivative with the same spacer, i.e. m&#8208;phenylene, between two radical centers in a crystalline form.

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Mo&#8208;Dependent Formylmethanofuran Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electroenzymatic catalysis of the multisubunit complex formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase was investigated (left panel). The O2&#8208;sensitive enzyme isolated from a thermophilic methanogen reduces CO2 with high faradaic efficiency upon deposition on a graphite rod electrode (middle panel). The low affinity for formate (right panel) favoured its accumulation, an interesting property for CO2&#8208;conversion technologies.







Abstract
Massive efforts are invested in developing innovative CO2&#8208;sequestration strategies to counter climate change and transform CO2 into higher&#8208;value products. CO2&#8208;capture by reduction is a chemical challenge, and attention is turned toward biological systems that selectively and efficiently catalyse this reaction under mild conditions and in aqueous solvents. While a few reports have evaluated the effectiveness of isolated bacterial formate dehydrogenases as catalysts for the reversible electrochemical reduction of CO2, it is imperative to explore other enzymes among the natural reservoir of potential models that might exhibit higher turnover rates or preferential directionality for the reductive reaction. Here, we present electroenzymatic catalysis of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, a CO2&#8208;reducing&#8208;and&#8208;fixing biomachinery isolated from a thermophilic methanogen, which was deposited on a graphite rod electrode to enable direct electron transfer for electroenzymatic CO2 reduction. The gas is reduced with a high Faradaic efficiency (109&#177;1&#8201;%), where a low affinity for formate prevents its electrochemical reoxidation and favours formate accumulation. These properties make the enzyme an excellent tool for electroenzymatic CO2&#8208;fixation and inspiration for protein engineering that would be beneficial for biotechnological purposes to convert the greenhouse gas into stable formate that can subsequently be safely stored, transported, and used for power generation without energy loss.

         <title>Azoxy Compounds &#8211; From Synthesis to Reagents for Azoxy Group Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The azoxy functional group is an important structural motif and represents the formally oxidized counterpart of the azo group. Azoxy compounds find numerous applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to functional materials, yet their synthesis remains underdeveloped with a main focus on the formation symmetric azoxy compounds. To overcome challenges in the synthesis of such unsymmetric azoxy compounds, we designed a process employing readily accessible nitroso compounds and iminoiodinanes. This method builds on the use of visible light irradiation to generate a triplet nitrene from iminoiodinanes, which is trapped by nitroso arenes to give access to sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds with a good substrate scope and functional group tolerance. We further describe two applications of these sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds as radical precursors in synthesis, where the whole azoxy group can be transferred and employed in C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization of ethers or 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of vinyl ethers.&#160;All of the reactions occurred at room temperature under visible light irradiation&#160;without the addition of any photoredox catalysts and additives. Control experiments, mechanism investigations, and DFT studies well explained the observed reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;based Chelating Ligand Additive as a Molecular Sieving Interfacial Barrier toward Durable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustained water consumption and uncontrollable dendrite growth strongly hamper the practical applications of rechargeable zinc (Zn) metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate that trace amount of chelate ligand additive can serve as a &#8220;molecular sieve&#8208;like&#8221; interfacial barrier and achieve highly efficient Zn plating/stripping. As verified by theoretical modeling and experimental investigations, the benzenesulfonic acid groups on the additive molecular not only facilitates its water solubility and selective adsorption on the Zn anode, but also effectively accelerates the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of Zn2+. Meanwhile, the central porphyrin ring on the chelate ligand effectively expels free water molecules from Zn2+ via chemical binding against hydrogen evolution, and reversibly releases the captured Zn2+ to endow a dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. By virtue of this non&#8208;consumable additive, high average Zn plating/stripping efficiency of 99.7% over 2100 cycles together with extended lifespan and suppressed water decomposition in the Zn||MnO2 full battery were achieved, thus opening a new avenue for developing highly durable ZMBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the development of cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective allylic alkylation reactions of tertiary allyl carbonates with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. A family of well&#8208;defined tetrahedral cobalt(I) complexes bearing commercially available bidentate bis(phosphine) ligands [(P,P)Co(PPh3)Cl] are synthesized and explored as catalysts in allylic alkylation reactions. The catalyst [(dppp)Co(PPh3)Cl] (dppp = 1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane) enables the alkylation of a large variety of tertiary allyl carbonates with high yields and excellent regioselectivity for the branched product. Remarkably, this methodology is selective for the activation of tertiary allyl carbonates even in the presence of secondary allyl carbonates. This contrasts with the selectivity observed in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylations enabled by visible light photocatalysis. Mechanistic insights by means of experimental and computational investigations support a Co(I)/Co(III) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bidentate Antimony Pnictogen Bonding Host&#8208;System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bidentate pnictogen bonding host&#8208;system based on 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene was synthesized by a selective tin&#8208;antimony exchange reaction and investigated regarding its ability to act as a Lewis acidic host component for the complexation of Lewis basic or anionic guests. In this work, the novel C&#8801;C&#8211;Sb(C2F5)2 unit was established to study the potential of antimony(III) sites as representatives for the scarcely explored pnictogen bonding donors. The capability of this partly fluorinated host system was investigated towards halide anions (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;), dimethyl chalcogenides Me2Y (Y = O, S, Se, Te) and nitrogen heterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine). Insights into the adduct formation behavior as well as the bonding situation of such E&#8943;Sb&#8211;CF moieties were obtained in solution by means of NMR spectroscopy, in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction, by elemental analyses and by computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, IQA), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Distribution&#8208;Directed Regioselective Substitution Strategy for Highly Stable Olympicenyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of bench&#8208;stable conjugated &#960;&#8208;radicals is challenging owing to the lack of modular approaches, which greatly hampers their practical material screens and applications. Here, we demonstrate a spin&#8208;distribution&#8208;directed regioselective substitution strategy to introduce substituents into the specific positions of an olympicenyl radical in a stepwise manner, resulting in a series of highly stable radical species. The substituents can also adjust the crystal packing by means of steric and electronic factors, enabling the changing from a &#960;&#8208;dimer to a pseudo&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional chain. The first single crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device based on a graphenic radical is fabricated in air, showing a hole mobility of up to 0.021 cm2 V&#8210;1 s&#8210;1 and excellent device stability. This approach may be generalized to diverse spin&#8208;delocalized open&#8208;shell organic radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Cylindrocyclophanes A and F and Merocyclophanes A and D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating enzymatic reactions into natural product synthesis can significantly improve synthetic efficiency and selectivity. In contrast to the increasing applications of biocatalytic functional&#8208;group interconversions, the use of enzymatic C&#8211;C bond formation reactions in natural product synthesis is underexplored. Here, we report a concise and efficient approach for the synthesis of [7.7]paracyclophane natural products, a family of polyketides with diverse biological activities. By using enzymatic Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, cylindrocyclophanes A and F and merocyclophanes A and D were synthesized in six to eight steps in the longest linear sequence. This work demonstrates the power of combining enzymatic reactions with contemporary synthetic methodologies and provides opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of [7.7]paracyclophane natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodotrimethylsilane as a Reactive Ligand for Surface Etching and Passivation of Perovskite Nanocrystals toward Efficient Pure&#8208;red to Deep&#8208;red LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resurfacing perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with tight&#8208;binding and conductive ligands to resolve the dynamic ligands &#8211; surface interaction is the fundamental issue for their applications in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Although various types of surface ligands have been proposed, these ligands either exhibit weak Lewis acid/based interactions or need high polar solvents for dissolution and passivation, resulting in a compromise in the efficiency and stability of PeLEDs. Herein, we report a chemically reactive agent (Iodotrimethylsilane, TMIS) to address the trade&#8208;off among conductivity, solubility and passivation using all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 NCs. The liquid TMIS ensures good solubility in non&#8208;polar solvents and reacts with oleate ligands and produces in&#8208;situ HI for surface etching and passivation, enabling strong&#8208;binding ligands on the NCs surface. We report, as a result, red PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~23%, which is 11.2&#8208;fold higher than the control, and is among the highest CsPbI3 PeLEDs. We further demonstrate the university of this ligand strategy in the pure bromide system (CsPbBr3), and report EQE of ~20% at 640, 652, and 664 nm. This represents the first demonstration of ligand strategy that applies to different systems and works effectively in red PeLEDs spanning emission from pure&#8208;red to deep&#8208;red.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Tunability for Uncatalyzed N&#8722;Alkylation of Primary Amines Enabled by Plasma&#8722;Microdroplet Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fusion of non&#8208;thermal plasma with charged microdroplets facilitates catalyst&#8208;free N&#8208;alkylation for a variety of primary amines, without halide salt biproduct generation. Significant reaction enhancement (up to &gt;200&#215;) is observed over microdroplet reactions generated from electrospray. This enhancement for the plasma&#8208;microdroplet system is attributed to the combined effects of energetic collisions and the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS (e.g., O2&#8226;&#8208;) act as a proton sink to increase abundance of free neutral amines in the charged microdroplet environment. The effect of ROS on N&#8208;alkylation is confirmed through three unique experiments: (i) utilization of radical scavenging reagent, (ii) characterization of internal energy distribution, and (iii) controls performed without plasma, which lacked reaction acceleration. Establishing plasma discharge in the wake of charged microdroplets as a green synthetic methodology overcomes two major challenges within conventional gas&#8208;phase plasma chemistry, including the lack of selectivity and product scale&#8208;up. Both limitations are overcome here, where dual tunability is achieved by controlling reagent concentration and residence time in the microdroplet environment, affording single or double N&#8208;alkylated products. Products are readily collected yielding milligram quantities in eight hours. These results showcase a novel synthetic strategy that represents a straightforward and sustainable C&#8211;N bond&#8208;forming process.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bismuth&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organobismuth&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation has recently been disclosed as an example of low&#8208;valent Bi redox catalysis. However, its mechanistic details have remained speculative. Herein, we report experimental and computational studies that provide mechanistic insights into a Bi&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes using p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol (4) and pinacolborane (5) as hydrogen sources. A kinetic analysis elucidated the rate orders in all components in the catalytic reaction and determined that 1a (2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)imino]phenylbismuth) is the resting state. In the transfer hydrogenation of azobenzene using 1a and 4, an equilibrium between 1a and 1a&#183;[OAr]2 (Ar = p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4) is observed, and its thermodynamic parameters are established through variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies. Additionally, pKa&#8208;gated reactivity is observed, validating the proton&#8208;coupled nature of the transformation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organobismuth-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation has recently been disclosed as an example of low-valent Bi redox catalysis. However, its mechanistic details have remained speculative. Herein, we report experimental and computational studies that provide mechanistic insights into a Bi-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes using p-trifluoromethylphenol (4) and pinacolborane (5) as hydrogen sources. A kinetic analysis elucidated the rate orders in all components in the catalytic reaction and determined that 1a (2,6-bis[N-(tert-butyl)imino]phenylbismuth) is the resting state. In the transfer hydrogenation of azobenzene using 1a and 4, an equilibrium between 1a and 1a&#183;[OAr]2 (Ar = p-CF3-C6H4) is observed, and its thermodynamic parameters are established through variable-temperature NMR studies. Additionally, pKa-gated reactivity is observed, validating the proton-coupled nature of the transformation. The ensuing 1a&#183;[OAr]2 is crystallographically characterized, and shown to be rapidly reduced to 1a in the presence of 5. DFT calculations indicate a rate-limiting transition state in which the initial N&#8211;H bond is formed via concerted proton transfer upon nucleophilic addition of 1a to a hydrogen-bonded adduct of azobenzene and 4. These studies guided the discovery of a second-generation&#160;Bi catalyst, the rate-limiting transition state of which is lower in energy, leading to catalytic transfer hydrogenation at lower catalyst loadings and at cryogenic temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Simple Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic direct functionalization/acylation of strong aliphatic C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds is disclosed via an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of aldehydes with simple alkanes. The inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds are efficiently cleaved through intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer, providing an alternative organocatalytic approach for alkane C&#8722;H functionalization under transition metal&#8208; and light free conditions.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds to form carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds offers vast potential for chemical synthesis and therefore receives increasing attention. At present, most successes come from strategies using metal catalysts/reagents or photo/electrochemical processes. The use of organocatalysis for this purpose remains scarce, especially when dealing with challenging C&#8722;H bonds such as those from simple alkanes. Here we disclose the first organocatalytic direct functionalization/acylation of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of completely unfunctionalized alkanes. Our approach involves N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst&#8208;mediated carbonyl radical intermediate generation and coupling with simple alkanes (through the corresponding alkyl radical intermediates generated via a hydrogen atom transfer process). Unreactive C&#8722;H bonds are widely present in fossil fuel feedstocks, commercially important organic polymers, and complex molecules such as natural products. Our present study shall inspire a new avenue for quick functionalization of these molecules under the light&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic conditions.

         <title>Crosstalk between Hepatic Glutathione Efflux and Tumor Targeting Efficiency of Indocyanine Green&#8208;Conjugated Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosstalk between the liver and tumor can significantly impact the tumor targeting efficiency of thiol&#8208;responsive nanoparticles through hepatic glutathione efflux.







Abstract
The elevated glutathione (GSH) level in solid tumors has been used as a major hallmark for GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity. Meanwhile, GSH is mainly synthesized inside the hepatocytes of the liver in the body and constantly released into the blood through hepatic GSH efflux to regulate redox potential of the entire body. However, it remains largely unknown how this hepatic GSH efflux affects the tumor targeting of GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we report that depletion of hepatic GSH enhanced the tumor targeting of GSH&#8208;responsive indocyanine green&#8208;conjugated Au25 nanoclusters coated with 18 GSH ligand (ICG&#8208;Au25SG18). The dissociation of ICG from Au25SG18 by the hepatic GSH through thiol&#8208;exchange reaction and the subsequent hepatobiliary clearance of the detached ICG were slowed down by GSH depletion, which in turn prolonged the blood circulation of intact ICG&#8208;Au25SG18 and enhanced its tumor targeting. Our work highlights glutathione&#8208;mediated crosstalk between the liver and tumor, in addition to well&#8208;known Kupffer cell&#8208;mediated uptake, in the tumor targeting of engineered nanoparticles, which could be modulated to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity of cancer nanomedicines while reducing their nonspecific accumulation.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly from Crystals to Helices of Protic Acyclic Carbene AuI&#8208;Enantiomers with Chirality Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel protic acyclic carbene&#8208;AuI enantiomers exhibited solvation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly from crystals to helices driven by synergetic aurophilicity and H&#8208;bonds. Three polymorphs showed intense thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with high quantum yield (&#934;FL). Extended helical Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au chains in helices amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with boosted luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) and CPL brightness (BCPL).







Abstract
Constructing chiral supramolecular assembly and exploring the underlying mechanism are of great significance in promoting the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. Herein, we report a solvation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly from single&#8208;crystals to helical nanofibers based on the first protic acyclic (methoxy)(amino)carbenes (pAMACs) AuI&#8208;enantiomers driven by a synergetic aurophilic interactions and H&#8208;bonds. Their aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties with high quantum yields (&#934;FL) up to 95&#8201;% were proved to be attributed to packing modes of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au dimers with &#960;&#8208;stacking or one&#8208;dimensional extended Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au chains. Via drop&#8208;casting method, supramolecular P&#8208; or M&#8208;helices were prepared. Detailed studies on the helices demonstrate that formations of extended helical Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au molecular chains amplify supramolecular chirality, leading to strong CPL with high dissymmetry factor (|glum|=0.030, &#934;FL=67&#8201;%) and high CPL brightness (BCPL) of 4.87&#215;10&#8722;3. Our findings bring new insights into the fabrication of helical structures to improve CPL performance by modifying aurophilic interactions.

         <title>Pd Loaded NiCo Hydroxides for Biomass Electrooxidation: Understanding the Synergistic Effect of Proton Deintercalation and Adsorption Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By loading Pd NCs on the Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2, we were able to promote the proton deintercalation process on the catalyst surface as well as HMF adsorption, respectively. As a result, a comprehensive optimization in performance by simultaneously decreasing the onset potential of the reaction and enhancing the current density can be achieved.







Abstract
The key issue in the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) is to understand the synergistic mechanism involving the protons deintercalation of catalyst and the adsorption of the substrate. In this study, a Pd/NiCo catalyst was fabricated by modifying Pd clusters onto a Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 support, in which the introduction of Co induced lattice distortion and optimized the energy band structure of Ni sites, while the Pd clusters with an average size of 1.96&#8197;nm exhibited electronic interactions with NiCo support, resulting in electron transfer from Pd to Ni sites. The resulting Pd/NiCo exhibited low onset potential of 1.32&#8197;V and achieved a current density of 50&#8197;mA/cm2 at only 1.38&#8197;V. Compared to unmodified Ni(OH)2, the Pd/NiCo achieved an 8.3&#8208;fold increase in peak current density. DFT calculations and in situ XAFS revealed that the Co sites affected the conformation and band structure of neighboring Ni sites through CoO6 octahedral distortion, reducing the proton deintercalation potential of Pd/NiCo and promoting the production of Ni3+&#8722;O active species accordingly. The involvement of Pd decreased the electronic transfer impedance, and thereby accelerated Ni3+&#8722;O formation. Moreover, the Pd clusters enhanced the adsorption of HMF through orbital hybridization, kinetically promoting the contact and reaction of HMF with Ni3+&#8722;O.

         <title>An Organic Coordination Manganese Complex as Cathode for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the coordination stabilization of PAL ligands, the highly reversible high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;phase Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple is realized in near&#8208;neutral aqueous Zn&#8722;Mn batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8722;Mn battery has been considered as the most promising scalable energy&#8208;storage system due to its intrinsic safety and especially ultralow cost. However, the traditional Zn&#8722;Mn battery mainly using manganese oxides as cathode shows low voltage and suffers from dissolution/disproportionation of the cathode during cycling. Herein, for the first time, a high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle Zn&#8722;Mn battery based on a highly reversible organic coordination manganese complex cathode (Manganese polyacrylate, PAL&#8722;Mn) was constructed. Benefiting from the insoluble carboxylate ligand of PAL&#8722;Mn that can suppress shuttle effect and disproportionationation reaction of Mn3+ in a mild electrolyte, Mn3+/Mn2+ reaction in coordination state is realized, which not only offers a high discharge voltage of 1.67&#8197;V but also exhibits excellent cyclability (100&#8201;% capacity retention, after 4000 cycles). High voltage reaction endows the Zn&#8722;Mn battery high specific energy (600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating a bright application prospect. The strategy of introducing carboxylate ligands in Zn&#8722;Mn battery to harness high&#8208;voltage reaction of Mn3+/Mn2+ well broadens the research of high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8722;Mn batteries under mild electrolyte conditions.

         <title>Structure and Function of the&#160;&#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation Bimodule of the Mupirocin Polyketide Synthase.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by a&#160;trans&#8208;AT Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in&#160;Pseudomonas fluorescens. The major bioactive metabolite, pseudomonic acid A (PA&#8208;A), is assembled on a tetrasubstituted tetrahydropyran (THP) core incorporating a 6&#8208;hydroxyl group proposed to be introduced via&#160;&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the thioester of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) bound polyketide chain. Herein, we describe an&#160;in vitro&#160;approach combining purified enzyme components, chemical synthesis, isotopic labelling, mass spectrometry and NMR in conjunction with&#160;in vivo&#160;studies leading to the first characterisation of the&#160;&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule of the mupirocin biosynthetic pathway. These studies reveal the precise timing of hydroxylation by MupA, substrate specificity and the ACP dependency of the enzyme components that comprise this&#160;&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule. Furthermore, using purified enzyme, it is shown that the MmpA KS0&#160;shows relaxed substrate specificity, suggesting precise spatio&#8208;temporal control of&#160;in&#8208;trans&#160;MupA recruitment versus inter&#8208;module (MmpD to MmpA) transfer. Finally, detection of multiple intermodular&#8208;modular MupA/ACP interactions suggest these bimodules may integrate MupA into their assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction via Regulating Charge Transfer Ability in a One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold potential for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, high energy barrier of imine linkage impede the in&#8208;plane photoelectron transfer process, resulting in inadequate efficiency of CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we present a dimensionality induced local electronic modulation strategy through the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PyTTA&#8208;COF). The dual&#8208;chain&#8208;like edge architectures of 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF enable the stabilization of aromatic backbones, thus reducing energy loss during exciton dissociation and thermal relaxation, which provides energetic photoelectron to traverse the energy barrier of imine linkages. As a result, the 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF exhibits significantly enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation when coordinated with metal cobalt ion, yielding a remarkable CO evolution of 1003 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 over an 8&#8208;hour period, which surpasses that of the corresponding 2D counterpart by a factor of 59. These findings present a valuable approach to address in&#8208;plane charge transfer limitations in imine&#8208;based COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bacterial Cytochrome P450 Catalyzed Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization of Ribosomal Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a fascinating group of natural products that exhibit diverse structural features and bioactivities. P450&#8208;catalyzed RiPPs stand out as a unique but underexplored family. Here, we introduce a rule&#8208;based genome mining strategy that harnesses the intrinsic biosynthetic principles of RiPPs, including the co&#8208;occurrence, co&#8208;conservation, and interactions between precursors and P450s, successfully facilitating the identification of diverse P450 catalyzed RiPPs. Intensive BGC characterization revealed four new P450s, KstB, ScnB, MciB, and SgrB, that can respectively catalyze Trp&#8208;Trp&#8208;Tyr (one C&#8208;C and two C&#8208;N bonds), Tyr&#8208;Trp (C&#8208;C bond), Trp&#8208;Trp (C&#8208;N bond), and His&#8208;His (ether bond) crosslinks within three or four residues. KstB, ScnB, and MciB could accept non&#8208;native precursors, suggesting they could be promising starting templates for bioengineering to construct macrocycles. Our study highlights the potential of P450s in expanding the chemical diversity of strained macrocyclic peptides and enriching biocatalytic tools for peptide macrocyclization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Spin frustration, resulted from geometric frustration and a systematical inability to satisfy all antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions between the unpaired spins simultaneously, is under spotlight for its importance in physics and materials science. Spin frustration is treated as structural basis of quantum spin liquid (QSL). Featuring flexible chemical structures, organic radical species exhibit great potential in building spin&#8208;frustrated molecules and lattices. Until now, the reported examples of spin&#8208;frustrated organic radical compounds include triradicals, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) radicals and derivatives, [Pd(dmit)2] compounds (dmit = 1,3&#8208;dithiol&#8208;2&#8208;thione&#8208;4,5&#8208;dithiolate), nitronyl nitroxides, fullerenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other heterocyclic compounds, where the spin frustration is generated intra&#8208; or intermolecularly. In this Minireview, we provide a brief summary for the reported radical compounds possess spin frustration. The related data, including magnetic exchange coupling parameters, spin models, frustration parameters, and crystal lattices, are summarized and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective De Novo Synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Diaryl Ketones from Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones from alkynes through chiral phosphoric acid catalysis is demonstrated. This method also serves as an efficient deuteration method for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones. Using the methodology, bioactive molecules, including one of the best&#8208;selling anti&#8208;breast cancer drugs, tamoxifen, are readily synthesized.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are structural motifs commonly present in bioactive molecules, and they are also valuable building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. However, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones bearing a tertiary stereogenic center remains largely unsolved. Herein, we report a catalytic de novo enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones from simple alkynes via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. A broad range of enolizable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are prepared in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The described protocol also serves as an efficient deuteration method for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched deuterated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones. Using the methodology reported, bioactive molecules, including one of the best&#8208;selling anti&#8208;breast cancer drugs, tamoxifen, are readily synthesized.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization of a Pyrene&#8208;Substituted Diamide and Its Ensemble of Kinetically Trapped Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic characteristics of the kinetic state in supramolecular polymerization must be thoroughly understood to advance the design and synthesis of functional soft materials. This molecular dynamics study provides the same, along with new insights into the monomeric and thermodynamic states, thus addressing the origin of the lag phase. It also describes the minimum free&#8208;energy path from the kinetic to the thermodynamic states.







Abstract
The prevalence of kinetically accessible states in supramolecular polymerization pathways has been exploited to control the growth of the polymer and thereby to obtain niche morphologies. Yet, these pathways themselves are not easily amenable for experimental delineation but could potentially be understood through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Herein, we report an extensive investigation of the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;substituted diamide (PDA) monomers in solution, conducted using atomistic MD simulations and advanced sampling methods. We characterize such kinetic and thermodynamic states as well as the transition pathways and free energy barriers between them. PDA forms a dimeric segment with the N&#8208; to C&#8208;termini vectors of the diamide moieties arranged either in parallel or anti&#8208;parallel fashion. This characteristic, combined with the molecule's torsional flexibility and pyrene&#8211;solvent interactions, presents an ensemble of molecular configurations contributing to the kinetic state in the polymerization pathway. While this ensemble primarily comprises short oligomers containing a mix of anti&#8208;parallel and parallel dimeric segments, the thermodynamic state of the assembly is a right&#8208;handed polymer featuring parallel ones only. Our work thus offers an approach by which the landscape of any specific supramolecular polymerization can be deconstructed.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aminomethylation of Alkyl Halides Enabled by Sterically Hindered N&#8208;Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalyzed aminomethylation of alkyl halides was realized for the synthesis of tertiary amines bearing bulky substituents and it involves radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. The bulky N&#8208;substituents serve as an activation group to overcome the redox&#8208;potential barrier in these reactions, allowing synthesis of sterically congested tertiary amines.







Abstract
The catalytic C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of alkyl halides and tertiary amines offers a promising tool for the rapid decoration of amine skeletons. However, this approach has not been well established, partially due to the challenges in precisely distinguishing and controlling the reactivity of amine&#8208;coupling partners and their product homologues. Herein, we developed a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic system for the aminomethylation of alkyl halides through radical&#8208;involved C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation, allowing for the synthesis of sterically congested tertiary amines that are of interest in organic synthesis but not easily prepared by other methods. Mechanistic studies disclosed that sterically hindered N&#8208;substituents are key to activate the amine coupling partners by tuning their redox potentials to drive the reaction forward.

         <title>Multimode Luminescence Tailoring and Improvement of Cs2NaHoCl6 Cryolite Crystals via Sb3+/Yb3+ Alloying for Versatile Photoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cryolite material (Cs2NaHoCl6) has been successfully synthesized, showing remarkable characteristics including anti&#8208;thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence. Further, its luminescence efficiency can be effectively improved and the emission was tailored through alloying Sb3+ ions (s&#8208;p energy levels) and Yb3+ ions (f&#8208;f energy levels). These findings highlight the immense potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites are currently gaining significant attention owing to their exceptional environmental friendliness, structural adjustability as well as self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. However, stable and efficient double perovskite with multimode luminescence and tunable spectra are still urgently needed for multifunctional photoelectric application. Herein, holmium based cryolite materials (Cs2NaHoCl6) with anti&#8208;thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence were successfully synthesized. By the further alloying of Sb3+ (s&#8208;p transitions) and Yb3+ (f&#8208;f transitions) ions, its luminescence properties can be well modulated, originating from tailoring band gap structure and enriching electron transition channels. Upon Sb3+ substitution in Cs2NaHoCl6, additional absorption peaking at 334&#8197;nm results in the tremendous increase of photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Meanwhile, not only the typical NIR emission around 980&#8197;nm of Ho3+ is enhanced, but also the red and NIR emissions show a diverse range of anti&#8208;thermal quenching photoluminescence behaviors. Furthermore, through designing Yb3+ doping, the up&#8208;conversion photoluminescence can be triggered by changing excitation laser power density (yellow&#8208;to&#8208;orange) and Yb3+ doping concentration (red&#8208;to&#8208;green). Through a combined experimental&#8208;theoretical approach, the related luminescence mechanism is revealed. In general, by alloying Sb3+/Yb3+ in Cs2NaHoCl6, abundant energy level ladders are constructed and more luminescence modes are derived, demonstrating great potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.

By the further alloying of Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; transitions) and Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; transitions) ions, its luminescence properties can be well modulated, originating from tailoring band gap structure and enriching electron transition channels. Upon Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; substitution in Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaHoCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, additional absorption peaking at 334&#8197;nm results in the tremendous increase of photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Meanwhile, not only the typical NIR emission around 980&#8197;nm of Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is enhanced, but also the red and NIR emissions show a diverse range of anti-thermal quenching photoluminescence behaviors. Furthermore, through designing Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doping, the up-conversion photoluminescence can be triggered by changing excitation laser power density (yellow-to-orange) and Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doping concentration (red-to-green). Through a combined experimental-theoretical approach, the related luminescence mechanism is revealed. In general, by alloying Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaHoCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, abundant energy level ladders are constructed and more luminescence modes are derived, demonstrating great potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Uniform DNA Monolayers Generated by Freezing&#8208;Directed Assembly on Gold Surfaces Enable Robust Electrochemical Sensing in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freezing a droplet containing DNA on gold surfaces gives rise to a uniform DNA monolayer with vertically standing up and laterally separated conformations. Compared to DNA surfaces obtained by traditional methods, the freezing&#8208;induced surface is remarkably stable over electrochemical interrogation and long&#8208;term storage. The uniform conformation increases the binding affinity of DNA by over 40&#8208;fold and enhances the antifouling performance in undiluted whole blood.







Abstract
Assembling DNA on solid surfaces is fundamental to surface&#8208;based DNA technology. However, precise control over DNA conformation and organization at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces remains a challenge, resulting in limited stability and sensitivity in biosensing applications. We herein communicate a simple and robust method for creating highly uniform DNA monolayers on gold surfaces by a freeze&#8208;thawing process. Using Raman spectroscopy, fluorescent imaging, and square wave voltammetry, we demonstrate that thiolated DNA is concentrated and immobilized on gold surfaces with an upright conformation. Moreover, our results reveal that the freezing&#8208;induced DNA surfaces are more uniform, leading to improved DNA stability and target recognition. Lastly, we demonstrate the successful detection of a model drug in undiluted whole blood while mitigating the effects of biofouling. Our work not only provides a simple approach to tailor the DNA&#8208;gold surface for biosensors but also sheds light on the unique behavior of DNA oligonucleotides upon freezing on the liquid&#8208;solid interface.

         <title>The Ambiguous Origin of Thermochromism in Molecular Crystals of Dichalcogenides: Chalcogen Bonds versus Dynamic Se&#8722;Se/Te&#8722;Te Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive thermochromism observed in dichalcogenide molecular crystals with no clear structural origin or associated phase transitions is found to be linked to the subtle changes in torsional vibrational modes around the dynamic Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonds.







Abstract
We report thermochromism in crystals of diphenyl diselenide (dpdSe) and diphenyl ditelluride (dpdTe), which is at variance with the commonly known mechanisms of thermochromism in molecular crystals. Variable temperature neutron diffraction studies indicated no conformational change, tautomerization or phase transition between 100&#8197;K and 295&#8197;K. High&#8208;pressure crystallography studies indicated no associated piezochromism in dpdSe and dpdTe crystals. The evolution of the crystal structures and their electronic band structure with pressure and temperature reveal the contributions of intramolecular and intermolecular factors towards the origin of thermochromism&#8212;especially the intermolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se and Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds and torsional modes of vibrations around the dynamic Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonds. Further, a co&#8208;crystal of dpdSe with iodine (dpdSe&#8208;I2) and an alloy crystal of dpdSe and dpdTe implied a predominantly intramolecular origin of the observed thermochromism associated with vibronic coupling.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Diacetoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient electrocatalytic 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation of alkenes utilizing readily available materials in ambient conditions is developed. The protocol is widely applicable to aliphatic and aromatic alkenes with excellent faradaic efficiencies and yields of up to 96&#8201;%. The versatility of the method is expanded with alkenoic acids towards lactone derivatives and with other carboxylic acids like HCOOH.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Dioxygenation of alkenes leads to a structural motif ubiquitous in organic synthons, natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Straightforward and green synthesis protocols starting from abundant raw materials are required for facile and sustainable access to these crucial moieties. Especially industrially abundant aliphatic alkenes have proven to be arduous substrates in sustainable 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation methods. Here, we report a highly efficient electrocatalytic diacetoxylation of alkenes under ambient conditions using a simple iodobenzene mediator and acetic acid as both the solvent and an atom&#8208;efficient reactant. This transition metal&#8208;free method is applicable to a wide range of alkenes, even challenging feedstock alkenes such as ethylene and propylene, with a broad functional group tolerance and excellent faradaic efficiencies up to 87&#8201;%. In addition, this protocol can be extrapolated to alkenoic acids, resulting in cyclization of the starting materials to valuable lactone derivatives. With aromatic alkenes, a competing mechanism of direct anodic oxidation exists which enables reaction under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic method is extensively investigated with cyclic voltammetry.

         <title>Gallium Sulfide Quantum Dots with Zinc Sulfide and Alumina Shells Showing Efficient Deep Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga2S3 nanocrystals constitute a novel type of quantum dots exempt from toxic heavy metals whose fluorescence can be tuned from broad trap&#8208;state to narrow band&#8208;edge emission in the deep blue range by coating their surface with a ZnS shell. An additional alumina shell enhances the photoluminescence quantum yield close to 50&#8201;% while maintaining a short lifetime around 1&#8197;ns.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed quantum dot (QD) based blue emitters are of paramount importance in the field of optoelectronics. Despite large research efforts, examples of efficient deep blue/near UV&#8208;emitting QDs remain rare due to lack of luminescent wide band gap materials and high defect densities in the existing ones. Here, we introduce a novel type of QDs based on heavy metal free gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) and their core/shell heterostructures Ga2S3/ZnS as well as Ga2S3/ZnS/Al2O3. The photoluminescence (PL) properties of core Ga2S3 QDs exhibit various decay pathways due to intrinsic defects, resulting in a broad overall PL spectrum. We show that the overgrowth of the Ga2S3 core QDs with a ZnS shell results in the suppression of the intrinsic defect&#8208;mediated states leading to efficient deep&#8208;blue emission at 400&#8197;nm. Passivation of the core/shell structure with amorphous alumina yields a further enhancement of the PL quantum yield approaching 50&#8201;% and leads to an excellent optical and colloidal stability. Finally, we develop a strategy for the aqueous phase transfer of the obtained QDs retaining 80&#8201;% of the initial fluorescence intensity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Free Radical&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photogenerated radicals effectively inhibit metal atom aggregation and facilitate their cooperative anchoring with nitrogen species and lattice oxygen on the support, thereby enabling precise synthesis of Single&#8208;atom catalysts.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as crucial players in catalysis research, prompting extensive investigation and application. The precise control of metal atom nucleation and growth has garnered significant attention. In this study, we present a straightforward approach for preparing SACs utilizing a photocatalytic radical control strategy. Notably, we demonstrate for the first time that radicals generated during the photochemical process effectively hinder the aggregation of individual atoms. By leveraging the cooperative anchoring of nitrogen atoms and crystal lattice oxygen on the support, we successfully stabilize the single atom. Our Pd1/TiO2 catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity and stability in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which was 43 times higher than Pd/C. Furthermore, we successfully depose Pd atoms onto various substrates, including TiO2, CeO2, and WO3. The photocatalytic radical control strategy can be extended to other single&#8208;atom catalysts, such as Ir, Pt, Rh, and Ru, underscoring its broad applicability.

&lt;p&gt;The photogenerated radicals effectively inhibit metal atom aggregation and facilitate their cooperative anchoring with nitrogen species and lattice oxygen on the support, thereby enabling precise synthesis of Single-atom catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as crucial players in catalysis research, prompting extensive investigation and application. The precise control of metal atom nucleation and growth has garnered significant attention. In this study, we present a straightforward approach for preparing SACs utilizing a photocatalytic radical control strategy. Notably, we demonstrate for the first time that radicals generated during the photochemical process effectively hinder the aggregation of individual atoms. By leveraging the cooperative anchoring of nitrogen atoms and crystal lattice oxygen on the support, we successfully stabilize the single atom. Our Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity and stability in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, which was 43 times higher than Pd/C. Furthermore, we successfully depose Pd atoms onto various substrates, including TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The photocatalytic radical control strategy can be extended to other single-atom catalysts, such as Ir, Pt, Rh, and Ru, underscoring its broad applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A series of isostructural Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln = La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure&#160;(25&#8208;54 GPa) high&#8208;temperature (2000&#8208;3000 K) conditions in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. The crystal structure of this novel class of compounds was determined via synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD)&#160;as well as corroborated by X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ln3O2(CN3) solids are composed of the hitherto unknown CN35&#8208; guanidinate anion &#8212; deprotonated guanidine. Changes in unit cell volumes and compressibility of Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln = La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) compounds are found to be dictated by the lanthanide contraction phenomenon. Decompression experiments show that Ln3O2(CN3) compounds are recoverable to ambient conditions. The stabilization of the CN35&#8208; guanidinate anion at ambient conditions provides new opportunities in inorganic and organic synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Effect Enabled by Ligand Substitution and CO2

Affinity in a Flexible SIFSIX Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that linker ligand substitution involving just one atom induces a shape&#8208;memory effect in a flexible coordination network.

Interestingly, &#945;&#8217; reverted to &#946; after resolvation/desolvation.

         <title>An NIR Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on and MRl Bimodal Probe for Concurrent Real&#8208;time in vivo Sensing and Labeling of &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To realize sensing and labeling biomarkers is quite challenging in terms of designing multimodal imaging probes. In this study, we developed a novel &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) activated bimodal imaging probe that combines near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enable real&#8208;time visualization of activity in living organisms. Upon &#946;&#8208;gal activation, Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1 exhibits a remarkable 42&#8208;fold increase in NIR fluorescence intensity at 717 nm, allowing covalent labeling of adjacent target enzymes or proteins and avoiding molecular escape to promote probe accumulation at the tumor site. This fluorescence reaction enhances the longitudinal relaxivity by approximately 1.9 times, facilitating high&#8208;resolution MRI. The unique features of Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1 enable real&#8208;time and precise visualization of &#946;&#8208;gal activity in live tumor cells and mice. The probe's utilization aids in identifying in situ ovarian tumors, offering valuable assistance in the precise removal of tumor tissue during surgical procedures in mice. The fusion of NIR fluorescence and MRI activation through self&#8208;immobilizing target enzymes or proteins provides a robust approach for visualizing &#946;&#8208;gal activity. Moreover, this approach sets the groundwork for developing other activatable bimodal probes, allowing real&#8208;time in vivo imaging of enzyme activity and localization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite With Heat Switching Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals that can switch light polarization have important applications in optoelectronics. In the last decades, birefringence is mostly optimized&#160;by chemical strategies. Recently, switching birefringence by physical means has attracted much attention. Here, this work reports the observation of heat switching birefringence in a 2D layered hybrid halide perovskite (C2N3H4)2PbCl4 ([C2N3H4]+ = 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium). This heat switching birefringence leads to a significant change in the interference color for the crystal plate under the illumination of orthogonal polarized light. Structure analyses reveal a heat dependent structure transition in (C2N3H4)2PbCl4, whose birefringence is switched by the change in the distortion degree of PbCl6 octahedron. This discovery may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polarization optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Neighboring Molecular Engineering in Diels&#8208;Alder Chemistry Enabling Easily Recyclable Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although a variety of dynamic covalent bonds have been successfully used in the development of diverse sustainable thermosetting polymers and their composites, solving the trade&#8208;off between recovery efficiency and comprehensive properties is still a major challenge. Herein, a &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds&#8221; strategy of lower rotational energy barrier (Er) phosphate&#8208;derived Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) cycloadditions was proposed for easily recyclable carbon fiber (CF)&#8208;reinforced epoxy resins (EPs) composites. In such a strategy, the phosphate spacer with lower Er accelerated the segmental mobility and dynamic DA exchange reaction for network rearrangement to achieve high&#8208;efficiency repairing, reprocessing of the EPs matrix and its composites and rapid nondestructive recycling of CF; meanwhile, incorporating phosphorus&#8208;based units especially reduced their fire hazards. The resulting materials simultaneously showed excellent thermal/mechanical properties, superb fire safety and facile recyclability, realizing the concept of recycling for high&#8208;performance thermosetting polymers and composites. This strategy is of great significance for understanding and enriching the molecular connotation of DA chemistry, making it potentially applicable to the design and development of a wide range of dynamic covalent adaptable materials toward practical cutting&#8208;edge&#8208;tech applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azomethine ylides are typically in situ generated synthons for making N&#8208;heterocycles through cycloaddition reactions. But an offbeat aspect about them is the isomeric nature of aldiminium&#8208;based azomethine ylides and (alkyl/aryl)(amino)carbenes, interconvertible by a formal 1,3&#8208;H+ transfer. Herein, two thermally robust azomethine ylides with a N&#8208;appended picolyl sidearm are isolated, which cyclize to pyaziridines at 80 0C but unprecedentedly result N&#8208;picoCAAC&#8208;CuCl (CAAC = cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes when heated with CuCl at merely 60 0C. The pendant Npy, as revealed by computational analysis, plays a crucial role in this unusual 1,3&#8208;H+ shift using a deprotonation&#8208;protonation sequence, as well as in placing the CuCl at the carbenic site in tandem. The softer nature of Cu(I) is also critical. Chelating CAACs are rare and one with a N&#8208;tethered additional donor is priorly unknown. Both N&#8208;picoCAAC and pyaziridine are bidentate chelators giving highly active cationic Rh(I) catalysts for hydrosilylating unactivated olefins by Et3SiH. Notably, the pyaziridine&#8208;Rh(I) is superior than the N&#8208;picoCAAC&#8208;Rh(I) catalyst.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Azomethine ylides are typically in situ generated synthons for making N-heterocycles through cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>A DNA Origami&#8208;based Bactericide for Efficient Healing of Infected Wounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacteria infection is a significant obstacle in the clinical treatment of exposed wounds facing widespread pathogens. Herein, we report a DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide for efficient anti&#8208;infection therapy of infected wounds in vivo. In our design, abundant DNAzymes (G4/hemin) can be precisely organized on the DNA origami for controllable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to break bacterial membranes. After the destruction of the membrane, broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic levofloxacin (LEV, loaded in the DNA origami through interaction with DNA duplex) can be easily delivered into the bacteria for successful sterilization. With the incorporation of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan, the DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide can achieve targeted and combined antibacterial therapy for efficiently promoting the healing of infected wounds. This tailored DNA origami&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a new strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Tuning the Electronic State of Copper Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic state in terms of charge and spin of metal site is fundamental to govern the catalytic activity of photocatalyst. Herein, we show that the modulation of electronic states of Cu sites without changing the coordination environments of two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies only based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking can significantly improve the photocatalytic activity. As heterogeneous photocatalysts without using noble metal cocatalysts, the hydrogen production rate increases from 522 to 3620 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. A systematical analysis reveals that the charge density and spin density of metal center are efficiently modulated via the modulation of coordination fields around active copper(II) centers by the variation of non&#8208;coordination groups of terminal ligands, leading to the significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity. This work provides an insight on the electronic state of active metal center for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation Activity&#8208;Stability Maps for Perovskite Oxides Containing 3d, 4d and 5d Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving catalytic activity without loss of catalytic stability is one of the core goals in search of low&#8208;iridium&#8208;content oxygen evolution electrocatalysts under acidic conditions. Here, we synthesize a family of 66 SrBO3 perovskite oxides (B = Ti, Ru, Ir) with different Ti:Ru:Ir atomic ratios and construct catalytic activity&#8208;stability maps over composition variation. The maps classify the multicomponent perovskites into chemical groups with distinct catalytic activity and stability for acidic oxygen evolution reaction, and highlights a chemical region where high catalytic activity and stability are achieved simultaneously at a relatively low iridium level. By quantifying the extent of hybridization of mixed transition metal 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d and oxygen 2p orbitals for multicomponent perovskites, we demonstrate this complex interplay between 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d metals and oxygen atoms in governing the trends in both activity and stability as well as in determining the catalytic mechanism involving lattice oxygen or not.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Stacking Modes of Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheet Membranes for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. The unique binary stacking modes of the [Cu2Br(IN)2]n nanosheets offers a chance to understand the relationship between nanosheet stacking behaviors and the gas separation performance of the resulting membranes.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes are considered potential gas separation membranes of the next generation due to their structural diversity and geometrical functionality. However, achieving a rational structure design for a 2D MOF membrane and understanding the impact of MOF nanosheet stacking modes on membrane separation performance remain challenging tasks. Here, we report a novel kind of 2D MOF membrane based on [Cu2Br(IN)2]n (IN=isonicotinato) nanosheets and propose that synergetic stacking modes of nanosheets have a significant influence on gas separation performance. The stacking of the 2D MOF nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. Our 2D MOF nanosheet membranes exhibit high gas separation performances for H2/CH4 (selectivity &gt;290 with H2 permeance &gt;520 GPU) and H2/CO2 (selectivity &gt;190 with H2 permeance &gt;590 GPU) surpassing the Robeson upper bounds, paving a potential way for eco&#8208;friendly H2 separation.

         <title>Tetracopper &#963;&#8208;Bound &#956;&#8208;Acetylide and &#8208;Diyne Units Stabilized by a Naphthyridine&#8208;based Dinucleating Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of two equivalents of a dicopper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide species with an appropriate acetylide synthon allowed the rational synthesis of a molecular tetracopper(I) acetylide, which possesses an unusual &#956;4&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1 coordination mode. This geometry opens the door to higher nuclearity homo&#8208; or heterometallic architectures, as demonstrated by the formation of a pentacopper(I) complex.







Abstract
Reactions of a dicopper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide complex with alkynes possessing boryl or silyl capping groups resulted in formation of unprecedented tetracopper(I) &#956;&#8208;acetylide/diyne complexes that were characterized by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These compounds possess an unusual &#956;4&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1 coordination mode for the bridging organic fragment, enforced by the rigid and dinucleating nature of the ligand utilized. Thus, the central &#960; system remains unperturbed and accessible for subsequent reactivity and modification. This has been corroborated by addition of a fifth copper atom, giving rise to a pentacopper acetylide complex.

     alt="Tetracopper &#963;-Bound &#956;-Acetylide and -Diyne Units Stabilized by a Naphthyridine-based Dinucleating Ligand"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction of two equivalents of a dicopper(I) &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butoxide species with an appropriate acetylide synthon allowed the rational synthesis of a molecular tetracopper(I) acetylide, which possesses an unusual &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; coordination mode. This geometry opens the door to higher nuclearity homo- or heterometallic architectures, as demonstrated by the formation of a pentacopper(I) complex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions of a dicopper(I) &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butoxide complex with alkynes possessing boryl or silyl capping groups resulted in formation of unprecedented tetracopper(I) &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-acetylide/diyne complexes that were characterized by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. These compounds possess an unusual &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; coordination mode for the bridging organic fragment, enforced by the rigid and dinucleating nature of the ligand utilized. Thus, the central &#960; system remains unperturbed and accessible for subsequent reactivity and modification. This has been corroborated by addition of a fifth copper atom, giving rise to a pentacopper acetylide complex. This work may provide a new approach by which metal-metal cooperativity can be exploited in the transformation of acetylide and diyne groups to a variety of substrates, or as a starting point for the controlled synthesis of copper(I) alkyne-containing clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptive Supramolecular Networks: Emergent Sensing from Complex Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining three supramolecular sensing elements in a single solution forms an adaptive network of equilibrating sensors. Fingerprint sensor&#8208;sensor and sensor&#8208;analyte interactions results in emergent photophysical responses, allowing for the discrimination of highly similar challenging analytes.







Abstract
Molecular differentiation by supramolecular sensors is typically achieved through sensor arrays, relying on the pattern recognition responses of large panels of isolated sensing elements. Here we report a new one&#8208;pot systems chemistry approach to differential sensing in biological solutions. We constructed an adaptive network of three cross&#8208;assembling sensor elements with diverse analyte&#8208;binding and photophysical properties. This robust sensing approach exploits complex interconnected sensor&#8208;sensor and sensor&#8208;analyte equilibria, producing emergent supramolecular and photophysical responses unique to each analyte. We characterize the basic mechanisms by which an adaptive network responds to analytes. The inherently data&#8208;rich responses of an adaptive network discriminate among very closely related proteins and protein mixtures without relying on designed protein recognition elements. We show that a single adaptive sensing solution provides better analyte discrimination using fewer response observations than a sensor array built from the same components. We also show the network's ability to adapt and respond to changing biological solutions over time.

         <title>Photoinduced Cobalt Catalysis for the Reductive Coupling of Pyridines and Dienes Enabled by Paired Single&#8208;Electron Transfer
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, regioselective method for the hydropyridylation of diene feedstocks is reported, and is amenable to late&#8208;stage&#8208;functionalisation. Experiments and DFT calculations suggest a mechanism involving non&#8208;reversible hydrogen atom transfer, resulting in a reaction that is uniquely selective for dienes in the presence of other olefins.







Abstract
Selective hydroarylation of dienes has potential to provide swift access to useful building blocks. However, most existing methods rely on dienes stabilised by an aromatic group and transmetallation or nucleophilic attack steps require electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners. As such, there are few examples which tolerate wide&#8208;spread heteroarenes such as pyridine. Whilst allylic C&#8722;H functionalisation could be considered an alternative approach, the positional selectivity of unsymmetrical substrates is hard to control. Here, we report a general approach for selective hydropyridylation of dienes under mild conditions using metal catalysed hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer. Photoinduced, reductive conditions enable simultaneous formation of a cobalt&#8208;hydride catalyst and the persistent radical of easily&#8208;synthesised pyridyl phosphonium salts. This facilitates selective coupling of dienes in a traceless manner at the C4&#8208;position of a wide&#8208;range of pyridine substrates. The mildness of the method is underscored by its functional&#8208;group tolerance and demonstrated by applications in late&#8208;stage functionalisation. Based on a combination of experimental and computational studies, we propose a mechanistic pathway which proceeds through non&#8208;reversible hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) from a cobalt hydride species which is uniquely selective for dienes in the presence of other olefins due to a much higher relative barrier associated with olefin HAT.

         <dc:description>
A highly efficient &#946;&#8208;arabinofuranosylation utilizing boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) is presented by Kazunobu Toshima, Daisuke Takahashi, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202307015). The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors under mild conditions with predictable regioselectivity and complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. Furthermore, the cover image shows that the regioselectivity in the BMAD reaction could be reversed by examining the reaction conditions and catalyst.

         <title>A Carbene Relay Strategy for Cascade Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We streamline the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms by sequentially generating two heteroatom metal carbenes using a designer I(III)/S(VI) reagent. This strategy enables the selective addition of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or carbon atoms, incorporating up to three functional groups at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of carbonyls in a single step.







Abstract
Insertion reactions that involve stabilized electrophilic metallocarbenes are of great importance for installing &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms to carbonyl compounds. Nevertheless, the limited availability of carbene precursors restricts the introduction of only a single heteroatom. In this report, we describe a new approach based on an I(III)/S(VI) reagent that promotes the cascade insertion of heteroatoms. This is achieved by sequentially generating two &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted metal carbenes in one reaction. We found that this mixed I(III)/S(VI) ylide reacts efficiently with a transition metal catalyst and an X&#8722;H bond (where X=O, N). This transformation leads to the sequential formation of a sulfoxonium&#8208; and an X&#8208;substituted Rh&#8208;carbenes, enabling further reactions with another Y&#8722;H bond. Remarkably, a wide range of symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,O&#8208;, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,N&#8208;, and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;N,N&#8208;subsituted ketones can be prepared under mild ambient conditions. In addition, we successfully demonstrated other cascades, such as CN/CN double amidation, C&#8722;H/C&#8722;S double insertion, and C&#8722;S/Y&#8722;H double insertion (where Y=S, N, O, C). Notably, the latter two cascades enabled the simultaneous installation of three functional groups to the &#945;&#8208;carbon of carbonyl compounds in a single step. These reactions demonstrate the versatility of our approach, allowing for the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms using a common precursor.

Remarkably, a wide range of symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-, &#945;,&#945;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-, and &#945;,&#945;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-subsituted ketones can be prepared under mild ambient conditions. In addition, we successfully demonstrated other cascades, such as CN/CN double amidation, C&#8722;H/C&#8722;S double insertion, and C&#8722;S/Y&#8722;H double insertion (where Y=S, N, O, C). Notably, the latter two cascades enabled the simultaneous installation of three functional groups to the &#945;-carbon of carbonyl compounds in a single step. These reactions demonstrate the versatility of our approach, allowing for the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;-heteroatoms using a common precursor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Pyridine Oximes using in Situ Generated NH2OH from NO species on Nanofiber Membranes Derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of converting NO into pyridine oximes utilizing in situ generated NH2OH for organophpsphorus poisoning is realized by electrocatalysis over Al coordinated on nanofiber membrane, which offers great significance to synthesize medicine and multidisciplinary science, providing new insights for constructing new efficient system for NH2OH production and utilization.







Abstract
Pyridine oximes produced from aldehyde or ketone with hydroxylamine (NH2OH) have been widely applied in pharmaceutics, enzymatic and sterilization. However, the important raw material NH2OH exhibits corrosive and unstable properties, leading to substantial energy consumption during storage and transportation. Herein, this work presents a novel method for directly synthesizing highly valuable pyridine oximes using in situ generated NH2OH from electrocatalytic NO reduction with well&#8208;design nanofiber membranes (Al&#8208;NFM) derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al). Particularly, 2&#8208;pyridinealdoxime, the precursor of antidote pralidoxime (2&#8208;PAM) for nerve agents suffering from scarcity and high cost, was achieved with a Faraday efficiency up to 49.8&#8201;% and a yield of 92.1&#8201;%, attributing to the high selectivity of NH2OH production on Al&#8208;NFM, further easily reacted with iodomethane to produce 2&#8208;PAM. This study proposes a creative approach, having wide universality for synthesizing pyridine and other oximes with a range of functional groups, which not only facilitates the conversion of exhaust gas (NO) and waste water (NO2&#8722;) into valuable chemicals especially NH2OH production and in situ utilization through electrochemistry, but also holds significant potential for synthesis of neuro detoxifying drugs to humanity security.

         <title>A Photolabile Curcumin&#8208;Diazirine Analogue Enables Phototherapy with Physically and Molecularly Produced Light for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photolabile curcumin analogue CRANAD&#8208;147 is reported. It could lead to changes in properties, structures (sequences) and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A&#946;) species in vitro and in transgenic 5xFAD mice in vivo with molecularly generated light (dubbed as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;) from chemiluminescence probe ADLumin&#8208;4. It has great potential as an alternative approach for AD drug discovery.







Abstract
The development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs has recently witnessed substantial achievement. To further enhance the pool of drug candidates, it is crucial to explore non&#8208;traditional therapeutic avenues. In this study, we present the use of a photolabile curcumin&#8208;diazirine analogue, CRANAD&#8208;147, to induce changes in properties, structures (sequences), and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A&#946;) species both in cells and in vivo. This manipulation was achieved through irradiation with LED light or molecularly generated light, dubbed as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, emitted by the chemiluminescence probe ADLumin&#8208;4. Next, aided by molecular chemiluminescence imaging, we demonstrated that the combination of CRANAD&#8208;147/LED or CRANAD&#8208;147/ADLumin&#8208;4 (molecular light) could effectively slow down the accumulation of A&#946;s in transgenic 5xFAD mice in vivo. Leveraging the remarkable tissue penetration capacity of molecular light, phototherapy employing the synergistic effect of a photolabile A&#946; ligand and molecular light emerges as a promising alternative to conventional AD treatment interventions.

         <title>Sulfonium Salt Reagents for the Introduction of Deuterated Alkyl Groups in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile deuterated reagents, namely, dn&#8208;alkyl sulfonium salts, dn&#8208;alkyl halides, a dn&#8208;alkyl azide, and a dn&#8208;alkyl amine, were prepared and used to efficiently introduce dn&#8208;alkyl groups into drug candidates and their analogues with complex skeletons. A liver microsomal metabolism study using 7&#8208;(d2&#8208;ethoxy)flavone as a model compound revealed a significant deuterium kinetic isotope effect due to the installed d2&#8208;ethoxy group.







Abstract
The pharmacokinetics of pharmaceutical drugs can be improved by replacing C&#8722;H bonds with the more stable C&#8722;D bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position to heteroatoms, which is a typical metabolic site for cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, the application of deuterated synthons is limited. Herein, we established a novel concept for preparing deuterated reagents for the successful synthesis of complex drug skeletons with deuterium atoms at the &#945;&#8208;position to heteroatoms. (dn&#8208;Alkyl)diphenylsulfonium salts prepared from the corresponding nondeuterated forms using inexpensive and abundant D2O as the deuterium source with a base, were used as electrophilic alkylating reagents. Additionally, these deuterated sulfonium salts were efficiently transformed into dn&#8208;alkyl halides and a dn&#8208;alkyl azide as coupling reagents and a dn&#8208;alkyl amine as a nucleophile. Furthermore, liver microsomal metabolism studies revealed deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIE) in 7&#8208;(d2&#8208;ethoxy)flavone. The present concept for the synthesis of deuterated reagents and the first demonstration of a KIE in a d2&#8208;ethoxy group will contribute to drug discovery research based on deuterium chemistry.

         <title>Rapidly Synthesized Single&#8208;Ion Conductive Hydrogel Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilized sulfonic acid&#8208;modified COFs (TCOF&#8208;S) photo&#8208;catalyst to generate free radicals to trigger the rapid in situ light solidification of acrylamide in the pore channels of COFs. Formed TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel has combined polymer gel electrolytes (PGE) with single&#8208;ion conductors (SICs) and make them complement each other.







Abstract
Single&#8208;ion conductive electrolytes can largely eliminate electrode polarization, reduce the proportion of anion migration and inhibit side reactions in batteries. However, they usually suffer from insufficient ion conductivity due to the strong interaction between cations and cationic receptors. Here we report an ultrafast light&#8208;responsive covalent organic frameworks (COF) with sulfonic acid groups modification as the acrylamide polymerization initiator. Benefiting from the reduced electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and sulfonic acid groups through solvation effects, the as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;based hydrogel electrolyte (TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel) receives an ion conductivity of up to 27.2&#8197;mS/cm and Zn2+ transference number of up to 0.89. In addition, sufficient hydrogen bonds endow the single&#8208;ion conductive TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to have good water retention and superb mechanical properties. The assembled Zn||TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel||MnO2 full zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits high discharge capacity (248&#8197;mAh/g at 1C), excellent rate capability (90&#8197;mAh/g at 10C) and superior cycling performance. These enviable results enlist the instantaneously photocured TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to be qualified to large&#8208;scaled flexible high&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Activation of Transesterification by Chemical Amplification in Dynamic Thiol&#8208;Ene Photopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of chemical amplification has been explored for the on&#8208;demand release of hydroxy groups in dynamic covalent thiol&#8208;ene photopolymers by controlled activation of a photoacid. In a domino effect fashion, a single photon event leads to a cascade of reactions, which ultimately endow the polymers with the ability to flow as a result of thermo&#8208;activated transesterification.







Abstract
Chemical amplification is a well&#8208;established concept in photoresist technology, wherein one photochemical event leads to a cascade of follow&#8208;up reactions that facilitate a controlled change in the solubility of a polymer. Herein, we transfer this concept to dynamic polymer networks to liberate both catalyst and functional groups required for bond exchange reactions under UV irradiation. For this, we exploit a photochemically generated acid to catalyse a deprotection reaction of an acid&#8208;labile tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl group, which is employed to mask the hydroxy groups of a vinyl monomer. At the same time, the released acid serves as a catalyst for thermo&#8208;activated transesterifications between the deprotected hydroxy and ester moieties. Introduced in an orthogonally cured (450&#8197;nm) thiol&#8208;click photopolymer, this approach allows for a spatio&#8208;temporally controlled activation of bond exchange reactions, which is crucial in light of the creep resistance versus reflow ability trade&#8208;off of dynamic polymer networks.

         <title>Design of an Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Photo&#8208;RAFT System for Protein&#8208;Polymer Conjugation Achieving High Bioactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effects of ROS on protein activity and secondary structure during photocatalysis. Specifically, it offers valuable insights into synthesizing protein&#8208;polymer conjugates while preserving high enzymatic activity under mild and aerobic conditions. The EY/TEOA system is identified as the optimal method for preparing conjugates, offering a simple and robust strategy with excellent oxygen tolerance in a minimal reaction volume.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer conjugates have significant potential in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. To enable their widespread use, robust conjugation techniques are crucial. This study introduces a photo&#8208;initiated reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (Photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system that exhibits excellent oxygen tolerance. This system allows for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates with high bioactivity under mild and aerobic conditions. Three photocatalytic systems utilizing Eosin&#8197;Y (EY) as the photocatalyst with two different cocatalysts (ascorbic acid and triethanolamine) were investigated, each generating distinct reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. The impact of these ROS on three model proteins (lysozyme, albumin, and myoglobin) was evaluated, demonstrating varying bioactivities based on the ROS produced. The EY/TEOA system was identified as the optimal photo&#8208;RAFT initiating system, enabling the preparation of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates under aerobic conditions while maintaining high protein enzymatic activity. To showcase the potential of this approach, lysozyme&#8208;poly(dimethylaminoethyl acrylate) conjugates were successfully prepared and exhibited enhanced antimicrobial property against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework to Upgrade Cycling Stability and Rate Capability of Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyano hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework has been applied to a Li&#8208;CO2 battery for the first time. The HOF endows Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with significantly enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of rate capability and cycling stability.







Abstract
Elaborately designed multifunctional electrocatalysts capable of promoting Li+ and CO2 transport are essential for upgrading the cycling stability and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with open channels and easily functionalized surfaces hold great potential for applications in efficient cathodes of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, a robust HOFS (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) is introduced for the first time as a co&#8208;catalyst in the cathode material of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with cyano groups located periodically in the pore can induce homogeneous deposition of discharge products and accommodate volumetric expansion of discharge products during cycling. Besides, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 enables effective interaction between Ru0 nanoparticles and cyano groups, thus forming efficient and uniform catalytic sites for CRR/CER. Moreover, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with regularly arranged open channels are beneficial for CO2 and Li+ transport, enabling rapid redox kinetic conversion of CO2. Therefore, the HOF&#8208;based Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are capable of stable operation at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 1800&#8197;h and maintain a low overpotential of 1.96&#8197;V even at high current densities up to 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work provides valuable guidance for developing multifunctional HOF&#8208;based catalysts to upgrade the longevity and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Building Block&#8208;Inspired Hybrid Perovskite Derivatives for Ferroelectric Channel Layers with Gate&#8208;Tunable Memory Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A building block assembling method allows a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites to be constructed. The resulting species have unprecedent gate&#8208;tunable memory behaviors potentially boosting future non&#8208;volatile memory applications.







Abstract
Ferroelectric photovoltaics driven by spontaneous polarization (Ps) holds a promise for creating the next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, spintronics and non&#8208;volatile memories. However, photoactive ferroelectrics are quite scarce in single homogeneous phase, owing to the severe Ps fatigue caused by leakage current of photoexcited carriers. Here, through combining inorganic and organic components as building blocks, we constructed a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites, (HA)2(MA)n&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 (n=1&#8211;5; HA=hexylamine and MA=methylamine). It is intriguing that their Curie temperatures are greatly enhanced by reducing the thickness of inorganic frameworks from MAPbBr3 (n=&#8734;, Tc=239&#8197;K) to n=2 (Tc=310&#8197;K, &#916;T=71&#8197;K). Especially, on account of the coupling of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity (Ps&#8776;1.5&#8197;&#956;C/cm2) and photoconductivity, n=3 crystal wafer was integrated as channel field effect transistor that shows excellent a large short&#8208;circuit photocurrent &#8776;19.74&#8197;&#956;A/cm2. Such giant photocurrents can be modulated through manipulating gate voltage in a wide range (&#177;60&#8197;V), exhibiting gate&#8208;tunable memory behaviors of three current states (&#8220;&#8208;1/0/1&#8221; states). We believe that this work sheds light on further exploration of ferroelectric materials toward new non&#8208;volatile memory devices.

         <title>Hyperbranched Polyborosiloxane: Non&#8208;traditional Luminescent Polymer with Red Delayed&#160;Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;traditional fluorescent polymers have attracted significant attention for their excellent biocompatibility and diverse applications. However, designing and preparing non&#8208;traditional fluorescent polymers that simultaneously possess long emission wavelengths and long fluorescence lifetime remains challenging. In this study, a series of novel hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes (P1 ~ P4) were synthesized. As the electron density increases on monomer diol, the optimal emission wavelengths of P1 ~ P4 polymers gradually red&#8208;shift to 510, 570, 575 and 640 nm, respectively. Particularly, P4 not only exhibits red emission but also demonstrates delayed fluorescence with lifetime of 9.73 &#956;s and the lowest critical cluster concentration (1.76 mg/mL). The experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic effect of dual heteroatom&#8208;induced electron delocalization, as well as through&#8208;space O&#183;&#183;&#183;O and O&#183;&#183;&#183;N interaction, was found to be&#160;the key factors contributing to the red&#8208;light emission with delayed fluorescence.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-traditional fluorescent polymers have attracted significant attention for their excellent biocompatibility and diverse applications. However, designing and preparing non-traditional fluorescent polymers that simultaneously possess long emission wavelengths and long fluorescence lifetime remains challenging. In this study, a series of novel hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes (P1 ~ P4) were synthesized. As the electron density increases on monomer diol, the optimal emission wavelengths of P1 ~ P4 polymers gradually red-shift to 510, 570, 575 and 640 nm, respectively. Particularly, P4 not only exhibits red emission but also demonstrates delayed fluorescence with lifetime of 9.73 &#956;s and the lowest critical cluster concentration (1.76 mg/mL). The experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic effect of dual heteroatom-induced electron delocalization, as well as through-space O&#183;&#183;&#183;O and O&#183;&#183;&#183;N interaction, was found to be&#160;the key factors contributing to the red-light emission with delayed fluorescence. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in dual-information encryption. This study provides a universal&#160;design strategy for the development of unconventional fluorescent polymers with both delayed fluorescence and long-wavelength emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Reversible Six&#8208;Electron Transfer Cathode for Advanced Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reactions for the storage of Zn2+ while embracing more electron transfer is a foundation of the future high&#8208;energy aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs). Herein, we report a six&#8208;electron transfer electrochemistry of nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C (n&#8208;TeO2/C) cathode by facilitating the reversible conversion of TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe. Benefitting from the integrated conductive nanostructure and the proton&#8208;rich environment in providing optimized electrochemical kinetics (facilitated Zn2+ uptake and high electronic conductivity) and feasible thermodynamic process (low Gibbs free energy), the as&#8208;prepared n&#8208;TeO2/C with stable cycling performance exhibits a superior reversible capacity of over 800&#160;mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 A g&#8211;1. A precise understanding of the reaction mechanism via ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ characterizations presents that the reversible six&#8208;electron transfer reaction is proton&#8208;dependent, and a proton generating and consuming mechanism of three&#8208;phase conversion n&#8208;TeO2/C in the acidic electrolyte is thoroughly revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioconvergent Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkylation of Tertiary Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioconvergent catalysis enables the conversion of racemic molecules into a single enantiomer in perfect yield and is considered an ideal approach for asymmetric synthesis. Despite remarkable advances in this field, enantioconvergent transformations of inert tertiary C&#8722;H bonds remain largely unexplored due to the high bond dissociation energy and the surrounding steric repulsion that pose unparalleled constraints on bond cleavage and formation. Here, we report an enantioconvergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds of &#945;&#8208;alkenes, providing a unique approach to access a broad range of enantioenriched &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds featuring quaternary carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that a stereoablative event occurs through the rate&#8208;limiting cleavage of tertiary allylic C&#8211;H bonds to generate &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species, and the achieved E/Z&#8208;selectivity of &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species effectively regulates the diastereoselectivity via a nucleophile coordination&#8208;enabled SN2'&#8208;allylation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Responsive Dinuclear Zinc Complex Consisting of Proximally Arranged Two d10&#8208;Zinc Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>So far, Zn(II)&#8208;based d10 complexes have been known to be colorless unless they are accompanied by chromophoric groups, and therefore both fundamental and advanced photophysical performance of Zn centers of complexes, especially in visible&#8208;light regions has been unexplored. Here, we first demonstrate a dinuclear Zn(II) complex that shows visible light absorption using an orbital distributed over closely contacted two Zn centers experimentally determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A contrastive study demonstrated that intermetallic orbital interaction in dinuclear Zn(II) complex is responsible for capturing visible light to exhibit orangish yellow color, whereas an analogous one without such an interaction is colorless. This work demonstrates that introduction of Zn&#8208;Zn interactions to Zn(II) molecules contradicts the common notion that Zn is unresponsive to visible light and expands the photophysical field of zinc chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Journey from Benzoborirene to Benzoborole&#8208;Supported 1,2&#8208;Diimine and Antiaromatic Borolediide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of benzoborirene with one equivalent of isocyanides leads to benzene&#8208;fused boretes bearing one imine function, while the reaction with two equivalents of isocyanide affords 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2,3&#8208;diiminoboroles with perfect regioselectivity. The isocyanide double insertion products represent a novel type of 1,2&#8208;diimine with a benzoborole backbone. The reduction chemistry of the benzoborole&#8208;supported 1,2&#8208;diimine was investigated. Single&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction allow for the isolation and full characterization of a radical anion and a dianion, respectively. In stark contrast to the ordinary boroles, which should turn aromatic by accepting two electrons, the antiaromatic character of the benzoborole backbone is highlighted upon reduction, thus presenting a rare example of antiaromatic borole dianion. Detailed quantum chemical calculations provide a rationale for the observed regioselectivity and the electronic structure of the reduced borole diimine species.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentrated Ionic Fluids: Is There a Difference Between Chloride&#8208;Based Brines and Deep Eutectic Solvents?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) have been lauded as novel solvents but is there really a difference between them and concentrated aqueous brines? They provide a method of adjusting the activity of water and chloride ions which can affect mass transport, speciation and reactivity. This study proposes a continuum of properties across concentrated ionic fluids and uses metal processing as an example. Charge transport is shown to be governed by fluidity and there is no discontinuity between molar conductivity and fluidity irrespective of cation, charge density or ionic radius. Diffusion coefficients of iron(III) and copper(II) chloride in numerous concentrated ionic fluids show the same linear correlation between diffusion coefficient and fluidity. These oxidising agents were used to etch copper, silver and nickel and while the etching rate increased with fluidity for copper, etching of silver and nickel only occurred at high chloride and low water activity as passivation occurred when water activity increased. Overall, brines provide a high chloride content at a lower viscosity than DESs, but unlike DESs, brines are unable to prevent passivation due to their high water content. The results show how selective etching of mixed metal waste streams can be achieved by tuning chloride and water activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Activity and Stability of Single&#8208; and Di&#8208;atom catalysts for O2 reduction reaction.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and in&#8208;expensive catalysts for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) is needed for advancement of renewable energy technologies. In this study, we design a computational catalyst screening method to identify single and di&#8208;atom metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defected nitrogenated graphene surfaces for ORR. Based upon the formation energy calculations and micro&#8208;kinetic modelling of reaction pathways using the intermediate binding free energies, we have identified four potentially interesting SACs and fifteen DACs with relatively high estimated catalytic activity at 0.8 V vs RHE. Among the best SACs, MnNC shows high stability in both acidic and alkaline media according to our model. For the DACs, we found four possible candidates as MnMn, FeFe, CoCo and MnNi doped on quad&#8208;atom vacancy sites having considerable stability over a wide pH range. The remaining SACs and DACs with high activity are either less stable or show a stability region at an alkaline pH.</dc:description>

Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals or fuels offers a promising approach to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely reported as capable of reducing CO2 to produce a variety of multicarbon products (e.g., ethylene and ethanol). In this work, we develop sulfur&#8208;doped Cu2O electrocatalysts, which instead can electrochemically reduce CO2 to almost exclusively formate. We show that a dynamic equilibrium of S exists at the Cu2O&#8208;electrolyte interface, and S&#8208;doped Cu2O undergoes in situ surface reconstruction to generate active S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu sites during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu surface can not only promote the formation of the *OCHO intermediate but also greatly suppress *H and *COOH adsorption, thus facilitating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion during the electrochemical CO2RR.

         <title>BiBr3&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Prins Cyclization of Aza&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement Products: Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Suaveoline and Sarpagine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed to construct the versatile 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;ABN) ring system with a variety of substitution patterns and then applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of six suaveoline and sarpagine alkaloids: macrophylline, suaveoline, norsuaveoline, affinisine, normacusine B and Na&#8208;Me&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine.







Abstract
An intramolecular aza&#8208;Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed in which bismuth tribromide (BiBr3) plays a dual role as an efficient Lewis acid and source of the bromide nucleophile. This approach enables the facile construction of highly functionalized 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes (9&#8208;ABNs), which are valuable synthetic building blocks and a powerful platform for the synthesis of a variety of alkaloid natural products and drug molecules. Suitable substrates for the aza&#8208;Prins cyclization include 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, alkynes, and allenes, with good to excellent yields observed. Finally, we showcase the application of this new approach to the enantioselective total synthesis of six indole alkaloids: (&#8722;)&#8208;suaveoline (1), (&#8722;)&#8208;norsuaveoline (2), (&#8722;)&#8208;macrophylline (3), (+)&#8208;normacusine B (4), (+)&#8208;Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine (5) and (+)&#8208;affinisine (6) in a total of 9&#8211;14&#8197;steps. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of the aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement, and the strategy (aza&#8208;Achmatowicz/aza&#8208;Prins) is expected to be applicable to the total synthesis of other members of the big family of macroline and sarpagine indole alkaloids.

         <title>Efficient Intersystem Crossing and Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated State Induced by Space Intramolecular Charge Transfer in a Parallel Geometry Carbazole&#8208;Bodipy Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through space intramolecular charge transfer, a compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor (cabazole&#8208;bodipy) dyad with face&#8208;to&#8208;face geometry exhibits long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns) and efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%). This discovery opens a new avenue for designing efficient photosensitizers and photonic applications that depend on long&#8208;lived excited states generation.







Abstract
The design of efficient heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) based on through bond charge transfer (TBCT) features is a formidable challenge due to the criteria of orthogonal donor&#8208;acceptor geometry. Herein, we propose using parallel (face&#8208;to&#8208;face) conformation carbazole&#8208;bodipy donor&#8208;acceptor dyads (BCZ&#8208;1 and BCZ&#8208;2) featuring through space intramolecular charge transfer (TSCT) process as efficient triplet PS. Efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%) and long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (&#964;T=186&#8197;&#956;s) were observed in the TSCT dyad BCZ&#8208;1 compared to BCZ&#8208;3 (&#934;&#916;=0.4&#8201;%), the dyad involving TBCT, demonstrating the superiority of the TSCT approach over conventional donor&#8208;acceptor system. Moreover, the transient absorption study revealed that TSCT dyads have a faster charge separation and slower intersystem crossing process induced by charge recombination compared to TBCT dyad. A long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (CSS) was observed in the BCZ&#8208;1 (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns). For the first time, the TSCT dyad was explored for the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion, and a high upconversion quantum yield of 11&#8201;% was observed. Our results demonstrate a new avenue for designing efficient PSs and open up exciting opportunities for future research in this field.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;to&#8208;Small Molecule Converter through Amplified Hairpin DNA Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realize the conversion of nucleic acid input into small molecule output using hairpin DNA circuits. The systems are combined with the biorthogonal Staudinger reduction to release fluorophore, dye, and anticancer agent triggered by oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Our approach would have great potential for efficient detection and chemotherapy of cancers based on nucleic acid expression profiles.







Abstract
Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are characteristically found in cancer cells, making miRNAs promising marker biomolecules for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. However, it is challenging to use miRNA as a cancer signature because it is difficult to convert the nucleic acid sequence information into molecular functionality. To address this challenge, we realize nucleic acid&#8208;to&#8208;small molecule converters using hairpin DNA circuits. Harnessing a Staudinger reduction as a trigger for the conversion, we constructed hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) circuits that respond to oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Fluorophore and dye molecules were released in response to miR&#8208;21 through the HCR, providing fluorogenic and chromogenic readouts. Selective cytotoxicity in miR&#8208;21&#8208;abundant cells was realized by the CHA to release the anticancer drug SN&#8208;38. This would be the first example of selective activation of a small&#8208;molecule prodrug triggered by oncogenic miRNA in human living cells.

         <title>Unravelling the Molecular Structure and Confining Environment of an Organometallic Catalyst Heterogenized within Amorphous Porous Polymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural elucidation of active sites in amorphous host materials is demonstrated by combining cutting&#8208;edge NMR techniques with pair distribution function analysis and computational chemistry. The detailed structure of the heterogenized organometallic complex and its confinement within two amorphous porous organic polymers is revealed by computation and confirmed by dedicated NMR techniques.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of multifunctional, microporous materials is directly linked to the spatial arrangement of their structural building blocks. Despite great achievements in the design and incorporation of isolated catalytically active metal complexes within such materials, a detailed understanding of their atomic&#8208;level structure and the local environment of the active species remains a fundamental challenge, especially when these latter are hosted in non&#8208;crystalline organic polymers. Here, we show that by combining computational chemistry with pair distribution function analysis, 129Xe NMR, and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization enhanced NMR spectroscopy, a very accurate description of the molecular structure and confining surroundings of a catalytically active Rh&#8208;based organometallic complex incorporated inside the cavity of amorphous bipyridine&#8208;based porous polymers is obtained. Small, but significant, differences in the structural properties of the polymers are highlighted depending on their backbone motifs.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Arylglycines via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Sch&#246;llkopf Bis&#8208;Lactim Ethers with Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide promote the coupling of chiral tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived Sch&#246;llkopf bis&#8208;lactim ether with cheap aryl chlorides at room temperature in yields up to 95&#8201;% and &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr. This enables a convenient access to non&#8208;natural tertiary arylglycines, which are key structural motifs in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This protocol is also suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of common pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Arylglycines are important pharmacophores present in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This compound class has now been made accessible from abundant aryl chlorides by a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sch&#246;llkopf&#8208;type amino acid synthesis. In the presence of the catalyst methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide, the base lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidide and the additive ZnCl2, tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived bis&#8208;lactim ethers were efficiently arylated at room temperature, reaching yields of 95&#8201;% and diastereoselectivities of 98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Hydrolysis gave the corresponding arylglycines in high enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Melleolides from Basidiomycota Fungi: Mechanistic Analysis of the Multifunctional GMC Oxidase Mld7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the total biosynthesis of the melleolide sesquiterpenoids produced by Basidiomycota fungi revealed that the glucose&#8208;methanol&#8208;choline oxidase enzyme Mld7 is a key enzyme that catalyzes multistep reactions leading to two different types of melleolides. Notably, these two reactions are highly regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.







Abstract
Mushroom terpenoids are biologically and chemically diverse fungal metabolites. Among them, melleolides are representative sesquiterpenoids with a characteristic protoilludane skeleton. In this study, we applied a recently established hot spot knock&#8208;in method to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway leading to 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxymelleolide. The biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene core involves the cytochrome P450 catalyzing stepwise hydroxylation of the &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene framework and a stereochemical inversion process at the C5 position catalyzed by short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins. The highlight of the biosynthesis is that the flavoprotein Mld7 catalyzes an oxidation&#8208;triggered double&#8208;bond shift accompanying dehydration and acyl&#8208;group&#8208;assisted substitution with two different nucleophiles at the C6 position to afford the &#916;7&#8208;protoilludene derivatives, such as melleolide and armillarivin. The complex reaction mechanism was proposed by DFT calculations. Of particular importance is that product distribution is regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.

         <title>Frontier Molecular Orbital Engineering: Constructing Highly Efficient Narrowband Organic Electroluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, highlighting the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering strategy.







Abstract
It is of great strategic significance to develop highly efficient narrowband organic electroluminescent materials that can be utilized to manufacture ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays and meet or approach the requirements of Broadcast Television 2020 (B.T.2020) color gamut standards. This motif poses challenges for molecular design and synthesis, especially for developing generality, diversity, scalability, and robustness of molecular structures. The emergence of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters has ingeniously solved the problems and demonstrated bright application prospects in the field of UHD displays, sparking a research boom. This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, with emphasis on the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) strategy. It combines the outstanding advantages of MR framework and donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, and can achieve red&#8208;shift and narrowband emission simultaneously, which is of great significance in the development of long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters with emission maxima especially exceeding 500&#8197;nm. We hope that this Minireview would provide some inspiration for what could transpire in the future.

         <title>StereoPHIP: Stereoselective Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral enol pyruvate ester with chiral catalysts followed by polarization transfer to 13C affords highly 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized (over 20&#8201;%) L&#8208; and D&#8208;lactate derivatives with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) followed by polarization transfer to 13C is a rapidly developing technique for the generation of 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized substrates. Chirality plays an essential role in living systems and differential metabolism of enantiomeric pairs of metabolic substrates is well documented. Inspired by asymmetric hydrogenation, here we report stereoPHIP, which involves the addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral substrate with a chiral catalyst followed by polarization transfer to 13C spins. We demonstrate that parahydrogen could be rapidly added to the prochiral precursor to both enantiomers of lactic acid (D and L), with both the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers of a chiral rhodium(I) catalyst to afford highly 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized (over 20&#8201;%) L&#8208; and D&#8208;lactate ester derivatives, respectively, with excellent stereoselectivity. We also show that the hyperpolarized 1H signal decays obtained with the (R,R) and (S,S) catalysts were markedly different. StereoPHIP expands the scope of conventional PHIP to the production of 13C hyperpolarized chiral substrates with high stereoselectivity.

         <title>A Golgi&#8208;Targeted Platinum Complex Plays a Dual Role in Autophagy Regulation for Highly Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum(II) complex can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk, resulting in complete elimination of tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo.







Abstract
Regulating autophagy to control the homeostatic recycling process of cancer cells is a promising anticancer strategy. Golgi apparatus is a substrate of autophagy but the Golgi&#8208;autophagy (Golgiphagy) mediated antitumor pathway is rarely reported. Herein, we have developed a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum (II) complex Pt3, which is ca. 20 times more cytotoxic to lung carcinoma than cisplatin and can completely eliminate tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo. Its nano&#8208;encapsulated system for tail vein administration also features a good anti&#8208;tumor effect. Mechanism studies indicate that Pt3 induces substantial Golgi stress, indicated by the fragmentation of Golgi structure, down&#8208;regulation of Golgi proteins (GM130, GRASP65/55), loss of Golgi&#8208;dependent transport and glycosylation. This triggers Golgiphagy but blocks the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, that is a dual role in autophagy regulation, resulting in loss of proteostasis and apoptotic cell death. As far as we know, Pt3 is the first Golgi&#8208;targeted Pt complex that can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk for highly efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence in Multi&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Type Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules has been observed. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1&#8197;eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state.







Abstract
Photon&#8208;upconversion in organic molecular systems is one of the promising technologies for future energy harvesting systems because these systems can generate excitons that possess higher energy than excitation energy. The photon&#8208;upconversion caused by absorbing ambient heat as additional energy is particularly interesting because it could ideally provide a light&#8208;driving cooling system. However, only a few organic molecular systems have been reported. Here, we report the anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence (ASPL) derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1&#8197;eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state. The anti&#8208;Stokes shift corresponded well to the 1&#8211;0 vibration transition from the ground state to the excited singlet state, and we further evaluated a correlation between the activation energy for the ASPL intensity and the TADF process. Our demonstration underlines that MR&#8208;TADF molecules have become a novel class of ASPL materials for various future applications, such as light&#8208;driving cooling systems.

         <title>Eutectic&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte with the Enhanced Lithium Salt Dissociation for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of eutectic&#8208;based solid polymer electrolyte is elaborately designed and prepared. The experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations confirm that the electrophilic succinonitrile (SN) interacts with poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA), effectively promotes the dissociation of lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB), thus resulting the excellent comprehensive electrochemical performances.







Abstract
The deployment of lithium metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries with polymer electrolytes has been recognized as a promising approach to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density technologies. However, the practical application of the polymer electrolytes is currently constrained by various challenges, including low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrochemical window, and poor interface stability. To address these issues, a novel eutectic&#8208;based polymer electrolyte consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) is developed. The research results demonstrate that the interactions between SN and PEGMEA promote the dissociation of the lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) salt and increase the concentration of free Li+. The well&#8208;designed eutectic&#8208;based PAN1.2&#8208;SPE (PEGMEA: SN=1: 1.2 mass ratio) exhibits high ionic conductivity of 1.30&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C and superior interface stability with Li anode. The Li/Li symmetric cell based on PAN1.2&#8208;SPE enables long&#8208;term plating/stripping at 0.3 and 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Li/LiFePO4 cell achieves superior long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 80.3&#8201;% after 1500 cycles). Moreover, Li/LiFePO4 and Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 pouch cells employing PAN1.2&#8208;SPE demonstrate excellent cycling and safety characteristics. This study presents a new pathway for designing high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes and promotes the practical application of high&#8208;stable lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of Enamides or Enecarbamates with Racemic &#945;&#8208;Bromoamides
</title>

         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of enamides or enecarbamates with racemic &#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts with full control of the newly formed vicinal stereocenters is reported. A wide variety of enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically enriched chiral &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives were directly obtained through a key sequential process of enantioselective hydronickelation&#8211;enantioconvergent alkylation.







Abstract
Catalytic methods which control multiple stereogenic centers simultaneously are highly desirable in modern organic synthesis and chemical manufacturing. Herein, we report a regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation process which proceeds with simultaneous control of vicinal stereocenters originating from two readily accessible partners, prochiral internal alkenes (enamides or enecarbamates) and racemic alkyl electrophiles (&#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts). This reaction produces high&#8208;value &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives under mild conditions and with precise selectivity. Preliminary studies of the mechanism indicate that the reaction involves an enantioselective syn&#8208;hydronickelation to generate an enantiomerically enriched alkylnickel(II) species. Subsequent enantioconvergent alkylation with a racemic alkyl electrophile generates the desired product as a single stereoisomer.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Stereoconvergent C&#8722;H Borylation of Enamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is presented for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides through C&#8722;H borylation, providing a versatile means of creating stereodefined enamides. The remarkable feature of this methodology is its stereoconvergent nature, which enables the utilization of starting materials with both E and Z configurations.







Abstract
Enamides, functional derivatives of enamines, play a significant role as synthetic targets. However, the stereoselective synthesis of these molecules has posed a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry, particularly for acyclic enamides that are less thermodynamically stable. In this study, we present a general strategy for constructing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides by C&#8722;H borylation, which provides a versatile platform for generating the stereodefined enamides. Our approach involves the utilization of metalloid borenium cation, generated through the reaction of BBr3 and enamides in the presence of two different additives, avoiding any exogenous catalyst. Importantly, the stereoconvergent nature of this methodology allows for the use of starting materials with mixed E/Z configurations, thus highlighting the unique advantage of this chemistry. Mechanistic investigations have shed light on the pivotal roles played by the two additives, the reactive boron species, and the phenomenon of stereoconvergence.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Role of Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Tethered Benzimidazolium Cation in Promoting CO2/Pure Water Co&#8208;Electrolysis to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), as a promising route to realize negative carbon emissions, is known to be strongly affected by electrolyte cations (i.e., cation effect). In contrast to the widely&#8208;studied alkali cations in liquid electrolytes, the effect of organic cations grafted on alkaline polyelectrolytes (APE) remains unexplored, although APE has already become an essential component of CO2 electrolyzers. Herein, by studying the organic cation effect on CO2RR, we find that benzimidazolium cation (Beim+) significantly outperforms other commonly&#8208;used nitrogenous cations (R4N+) in promoting C2+(mainly C2H4) production over copper electrode. Cyclic voltammetry and in&#8208;situ spectroscopy studies reveal that the Beim+ can synergistically boost the CO2 to *CO conversion and reduce the proton supply at the electrocatalytic interface, thus facilitating the *CO dimerization toward C2+&#160;formation. By utilizing the homemade APE ionomer, we further realize efficient C2H4 production at an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 331 mA cm&#8208;2 from CO2/pure water co&#8208;electrolysis, thanks to the dual&#8208;role of Beim+ in synergistic catalysis and ionic conduction. This study provides a new avenue to boost CO2RR through the structural design of polyelectrolytes.</dc:description>

This study provides a new avenue to boost CO2RR through the structural design of polyelectrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biogenetic Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents that Produce Self&#8208;Assembled Chiroptical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) show particular properties compared to ionic liquids and other traditional organic solvents. Controlled synthesis of chiral materials in DESs is unprecedented due to the complex interplays between DESs and solutes. In this work, all bio&#8208;derived chiral DESs were prepared using choline chloride or cyclodextrin as hydrogen bonding acceptors and natural chiral acids as donors, which performed as chiral matrices for the rational synthesis of chiroptical materials taking advantages of efficient chirality transfer between DESs and solutes. In a very selective manner, building units with molecular pockets could facilitate the strong binding affinity towards chiral acid components of DESs disregarding the presence of competitive hydrogen bonding acceptors. Chirality transfer from DESs to nanoassemblies undergoes chirality amplification in the presence of minimal entrapped chiral acids, thanks to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of solutes during aggregation. This work firstly utilizes chiral DESs to control supramolecular chirality, and illustrates the structural basis for the fabrication of DESs&#8208;based chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Solvent Processable, Asymmetric Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport&#160;Layer Material&#160;for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of dopant&#8208;free hole transport layers (HTLs) is critical in stabilizing n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). However, these HTL materials are often processed with toxic solvents, which is not ideal for industrial production. Upon substituting them with green solvents, a trade&#8208;off emerges between maintaining the high crystallinity of the HTL materials and ensuring high solubility in the new solvents. In this paper, we designed a novel, linear, organic small molecule, BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O, by introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. This method not only overcomes the solubility limitations in green solvents but also enables stacking the conjugated main chains in two patterns, which further enhances crystallinity and hole mobility. As a result, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p pero&#8208;SCs based on chlorobenzene&#8208; or green (natural compound) solvent 3&#8208;methylcyclohexanone&#8208;processed BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL that without any dopant delivered world&#8208;recorded PCEs of 24.11% (certified of 23.82%) and 23.53%, respectively. The devices also demonstrated remarkable operational and high&#8208;temperature stabilities, maintaining over 84% and 79.5% of their initial efficiency for 2000 h, respectively. Encouragingly, dopant&#8208;free BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL exhibits significant advantages in large&#8208;area fabrication, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCEs exceeding 20% for 5&#215;5 cm2 modules (active area: 15.64 cm2), even when processed using green solvents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;I2&#160;batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their performance is still limited by the irreversible growth of Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reactions, corrosion, and shuttle effect of polyiodide. In this work, we have prepared&#160;a new&#160;porous polymer (CD&#8208;Si) by nucleophilic reaction&#160;of&#160;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin with SiCl4, and CD&#8208;Si is applied to the solid polymer electrolyte (denoted PEO/PVDF/CD&#8208;Si) to solve above&#8208;mentioned problems. Through the anchoring of the CD&#8208;Si, a conductive network with dual transmission channels was successfully constructed. Due to the non&#8208;covalent anchoring effect, the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolytes&#160;(SPE) can reach 1.64 &#215; 10&#8208;3&#160;S cm&#8208;1&#160;at 25 &#186;C. The assembled symmetrical batteries can achieve highly reversible dendrite&#8208;free galvanizing/stripping (stable cycling for 7500 h at 5 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and 1200 h at 20 mA cm&#8208;2). The solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2&#160;battery shows an&#160;ultra&#8208;long life of over 35,000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to elucidate the working mechanism of CD&#8208;Si in the polymer matrix. This work provides&#160;a novel strategy towards solid electrolytes for Zn&#8208;I2&#160;batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymerization of a Bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycle into a Brick&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a dendronized bis&#8208;urea macrocycle 1 self&#8208;assembling via a cooperative mechanism into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets formed solely by alternated urea&#8208;urea hydrogen bonding interactions. The pure macrocycle self&#8208;assembles in bulk into one&#8208;dimensional liquid&#8208;crystalline columnar phases. In contrast, its self&#8208;assembly mode drastically changes in CHCl3 or tetrachloroethane leading to 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. Theoretical calculations, complemented by previously reported crystalline structures, indicate that the 2D assembly is formed by a brick&#8208;like hydrogen bonding pattern between bis&#8208;urea macrocycles. This assembly is promoted by the swelling of the trisdodecyloxyphenyl groups upon solvation, which frustrates, due to steric effects, the formation of the thermodynamically more stable columnar macrocycle stacks. This work proposes a new design strategy to access 2D supramolecular polymers by means of a single non&#8208;covalent interaction motif, which is of great interest for materials development.</dc:description>

         <title>N = 8 Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons: Solution Synthesis and High Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have emerged as promising candidates for nanoelectronic devices. Low bandgap (&lt; 1 eV) GNRs are particularly important when considering the Schottky barrier in device performance. Here, we demonstrate the first solution synthesis of 8&#8208;AGNRs through a carefully designed arylated polynaphthalene precursor. The efficiency of the oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of the tailor&#8208;made polymer precursor into 8&#8208;AGNRs was validated by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV&#8208;vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopy, and further supported by the synthesis of naphtho[1,2,3,4&#8208;ghi]perylene derivatives (1 and 2) as subunits of 8&#8208;AGNR, with a width of 0.86 nm as suggested by the X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and solid&#8208;state NMR analyses provided further structural support for 8&#8208;AGNR. The resulting 8&#8208;AGNR exhibited a remarkable NIR absorption extending up to &#8764;2400 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap as low as &#8764;0.52 eV. Moreover, optical&#8208;pump TeraHertz&#8208;probe spectroscopy revealed charge&#8208;carrier mobility in the dc limit of &#8764;270 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 for the 8&#8208;AGNR.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various fluorogenic probes utilizing tetrazine (Tz) as a fluorescence quencher and bioorthogonal reaction partner have been extensively studied over the past few decades. Herein, we synthesized a series of boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;Tz probes using monochromophoric design strategy for bioorthogonal cellular imaging. The BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes exhibited excellent bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN)&#8208;selective fluorogenicity with three&#8208; to four&#8208;digit&#8208;fold enhancements in fluorescence over a wide range of emission wavelengths, including the far&#8208;red region. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes in bioorthogonal fluorescence imaging of cellular organelles without washing steps. We also elucidated the aromatized pyridazine moiety as the origin of BCN&#8208;selective fluorogenic behavior. Additionally, we discovered that the fluorescence of the trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) adducts was quenched in aqueous media via photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) process. Interestingly, we observed a distinctive recovery of the initially quenched fluorescence of BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;TCO upon exposure to hydrophobic media, accompanied by a significant bathochromic shift of its emission wavelength relative to that exhibited by the corresponding BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;BCN. Leveraging this finding, for the first time, we achieved dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal cellular imaging with a single BODIPY&#8208;Tz probe.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional polythioamides derived from thiocarbonyl fluoride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polythioamide is a unique type of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with advanced functionalities. Nonetheless, the prevailing synthetic methods, reliant upon elemental sulfur, tend to react readily with unsaturated functional groups, thereby limiting the scope of eligible substrates. Inspired by the highly efficient sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) polymerization through discrete hubs, we present herein a pioneering and versatile approach to the synthesis of polythioamides from diboronic acids, secondary diamines, and thiocarbonyl fluoride as the central connective hub.Well&#8208;defined structures, including previously inaccessible unsaturated substrates, were realized. These newly devised polythioamides can efficiently and selectively bind to metal ions and were applied in precious metal recovery. Further development results in PdII&#8208;crosslinked single&#8208;chain nanoparticles serving as recyclable homogeneous catalysts, demonstrating the vast potential of these unprecedented polythioamides. We anticipate that thiocarbonyl fluoride could emerge as a potent hub for facilitating the intricate synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Studies of Soluble Inorganic Nanostructures with X&#8208;rays and Neutrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review addresses the use of X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering and X&#8208;ray absorption to describe how inorganic nano&#8208;structured materials assemble, evolve, and function in solution. We first provide an overview of techniques and instrumentation (both large user facilities and benchtop). We review recent studies of soluble inorganic nanostructure assembly, covering the disciplines of materials synthesis, processes in nature, nuclear materials, and the widely applicable fundamental processes of hydrophobic interactions and ion&#8208;pairing. Reviewed studies cover size regimes and length scales ranging from sub&#8208;angstrom (coordination chemistry and ion&#8208;pairing) to several nanometers (molecular clusters; i.e. polyoxometalates, polyoxocations and metal&#8208;organic polyhedra), to meso&#8208;scale (supramolecular assembly processes). Reviewed studies predominantly exploit 1) SAXS/SWAXS/SANS (small and wide angle X&#8208;ray or neutron scattering), 2) PDF (pair distribution function analysis of X&#8208;ray total scattering), and 3) XANES and EXAFS (respectively X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure). While the scattering techniques provide structural information, X&#8208;ray absorption yields oxidation state, in addition to local coordination. Our goal for this review is to provide information and inspiration for the inorganic/materials science communities that may benefit from elucidating the role of solution speciation in natural and synthetic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Locking the Conformation of a Paddlewheel Rhodium Complex: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Catalytic Nitrene Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exponential proliferation of conformers makes it impossible to examine the entire population in most systems. Controlling conformational ensembles is thus pivotal in many areas of chemistry. Rh2(esp)2, a dicarboxylate&#8208;derived paddlewheel rhodium complex, is one of the most effective catalysts for nitrene chemistry. Its enormous success has led to preparing many analogous complexes. However, there has been little consideration for the conformational dynamics of the parent catalyst. Herein, we report a new ligand modification principle that prevents conformer interconversion. The resulting complex comprises two isolable conformers, whose structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Combined experimental and computational data has revealed similarities and dissimilarities between the conformationally confined and parent complexes. Three model cases have demonstrated the utility of conformational fixation in the development of stereoselective catalysts for nitrene transfer reactions. The design principle described in this study can be combined with other established modification strategies, serving as a springboard for further advancement of the chemistry of paddlewheel metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Photosensitizer Controlled Reactions of 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarins and Unactivated Olefins: Hydroarylation and Subsequent [2 + 2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a photoinduced approach for hydroarylation of unactivated olefins using 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins as the arylating reagent. Key to the success of this reaction is the conversion of nucleophilic 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, which not only circumvents the polarity&#8208;mismatch issue encountered under ionic conditions but also accommodates a broad substrate scope and inhibits side reactions that were previously observed. Moreover, divergent reactivity was achieved by changing the photocatalyst, enabling a subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition to deliver cyclobutane&#8208;fused pentacyclic products that are otherwise challenging to access in high yields and with high diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reactions and the origin of the divergent reactivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The narrow electrochemical stability window of water poses a challenge to the development of aqueous electrolytes. In contrast to non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, the products of water electrolysis do not contribute to the formation of a passivation layer on electrodes. As a result, aqueous electrolytes require the reactions of additional components, such as additives and co&#8208;solvents, to facilitate the formation of the desired solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the cathode. This review highlights the fundamental principles and recent advancements in generating electrolyte interphases in aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Is &#8216;Water in Salt&#8217; Electrolytes the Ultimate Solution? Achieving High Stability of Organic Anodes in Diluted Electrolyte Solutions Via a Wise Anions Selection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) concept, using highly concentrated electrolyte solutions to prevent water splitting and widen the electrochemical stability window, has greatly influenced modern aqueous batteries. The successful implementation of these electrolyte solutions in many electrochemical systems shifts the focus from diluted to WIS electrolyte solutions. Considering the high costs and the tendency of these nearly saturated solutions to crystallize, this trend can be carefully re&#8208;evaluated. Herein we show that the stability of organic electrodes comprising the active material perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is strongly influenced by the solvation character of the anions rather than the concentration of the electrolyte solution. Even though the charging process of PTCDA involves solely insertion of cations (i.e., principal counter&#8208;ions), surprisingly, the dominant factor influencing its electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;term electrode stability, is the type of the co&#8208;ions (i.e., electrolytic anions). Using systematic electrochemical analysis combined with theoretical simulations, we show that the selection of kosmotropic anions results in fast fading of the PTCDA anodes, while a selection of chaotropic anions leads to excellent stability, even at electrolytes concentrations as low as 0.2M. These findings provide a new conceptual approach for designing advanced electrolyte solutions for aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Initiated Dispersion Photopolymerization of Styrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polystyrene (PS) particles were synthesized in ethanol/water mixture by dispersion polymerization using visible light irradiation, with either a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene borane&#8208;based photoinitiating system (PIS) or a disulfide. With the full PIS and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) as stabilizer, the size distributions were broad and the amount of PEGMA had a strong impact on the experiment reproducibility. The addition of a base solved the problem, leading to faster polymerizations, narrower size distributions and larger particles. With the disulfide as sole PIS, bigger and narrowly distributed PS particles were again formed. Quantitative conversion was achieved in each system, with particle size ranging between 100 and 350 nm. The use of poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer led to significantly larger particles, up to 1.2&#160;&#956;m, with narrow size distributions. The production of such large latex particles by photoinitiated polymerizations is unprecedented.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing the Selectivity of CO Electrolysis to Acetate by Constructing Metal&#8208;Organic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically converting CO2 to valuable chemicals holds great promise for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Owing to complex reaction pathways and shared rate&#8208;determining steps, directing the selectivity of CO2/CO electrolysis to a specific multi&#8208;carbon product is very challenging. We report here a strategy for highly selective production of acetate from CO electrolysis by constructing metal&#8208;organic interfaces. We demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;organic interfaces constructed by in situ reconstruction of Cu complexes show very impressive acetate selectivity, with a high Faradaic efficiency of 84.2% and a carbon selectivity of 92.1% for acetate production, in an alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The maximum acetate partial current density and acetate yield reach as high as 605 mA cm&#8722;2 and 63.4%, respectively. Thorough structural characterizations, control experiments, operando Raman spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculation results indicate that the Cu&#8208;organic interface creates a favorable reaction microenvironment that enhances *CO adsorption, lowers the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling, and facilitates the formation of CH3COOH over other multicarbon products, thus rationalizing the selective acetate production.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Eco&#8208;friendly lead&#8208;free organic&#8208;inorganic manganese halides (OIMHs) have attracted considerable attention in various optoelectronic applications because of their superior optical properties and flexible solution processibility. Herein, we report a novel pseudo&#8208;2D layered OIMH (MTP)2MnBr4 (MTP: methyltriphenylphosphonium), which exhibits intense green emission under UV/blue or X&#8208;ray excitation, with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, high resistance to thermal quenching (T150 &#176;C = 84.1%) and good photochemical stability. These features enable (MTP)2MnBr4 as an efficient green phosphor for blue&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes, demonstrating a commercial&#8208;level luminous efficiency of 101 lm W&#8211;1 and a wide color gamut of 116% NTSC. Moreover, these (MTP)2MnBr4 crystals showcase outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties, delivering a light yield of 67000 photon MeV&#8211;1, a detection limit of 82.4 nGy s&#8211;1, and a competitive spatial resolution of 6.2 lp mm&#8211;1 for X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Tuning Binding Strength of Multiple Intermediates towards Efficient pH&#8208;universal Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy Heterocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

Herein, heterogeneous Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy&#160;supported on N&#8208;doped graphene (defined as Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy/NG) is synthesized by controllable&#160;hydrothermal reaction and nitridation process.&#160;The O&#8208;exposed&#160;Mo8O26&#160;clusters covalently confined on NbNxOy&#160;nanodomains provide a distinctive interface configuration and appropriate electronic structure, where&#160;fully exposed multiple active sites&#160;give excellent HER performance beyond commercial Pt/C catalyst in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes.&#160;Theoretical studies reveal that the&#160;Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy&#160;interface with electronic reconstruction affords near&#8208;optimal hydrogen adsorption energy and enhanced initial H2O adsorption. Furthermore, the terminal O atoms in Mo8O26&#160;clusters cooperate with Nb atoms to promote the initial H2O adsorption,&#160;and subsequently reduce the H2O dissociation energy, accelerating the entire HER kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Pillar&#8208;Cage Fluorinated Anion Pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via a Pillar Embedding Strategy and Efficient Separation of SO2 through Multi&#8208;Site Trapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flue gas desulfurization is crucial for both human health and ecological environments. However, developing efficient SO2 adsorbents that can break the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity is still challenging. In this work, a new type of fluorinated anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) with a pillar&#8208;cage structure is fabricated through pillar&#8208;embedding into a highly porous and robust framework. This type of APMOFs comprises smaller tetrahedral cages and larger icosahedral cages interconnected by embedded [NbOF5]2&#8208; and [TaOF5]2&#8208; anions acting as pillars. The APMOFs exhibits high porosity and density of fluorinated anions, ensuring exceptional SO2 adsorption capacity and ultrahigh selectivity for SO2/CO2 and SO2/N2 gas mixtures. Furthermore, these two structures demonstrate excellent stability towards water, acid/alkali, and SO2 adsorption. Cycle dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm the excellent separation performance of SO2/CO2 gas mixtures and their cyclic stability. SO2&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the preferred adsorption domains for SO2 molecules. The multiple&#8208;site host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions facilitate selective recognition and dense packing of SO2 in this hybrid porous material. This work will be instructive for designing porous materials for flue gas desulfurization and other gas&#8208;purification processes.</dc:description>

Herein, we report for the first time that palladium compounds can catalyze the hydroarylation of organoborons with 1&#8208;alkynylindoles for the synthesis of chiral C&#8208;N atropisomers. A series of rarely reported vinylindole atropisomers was synthesized with excellent regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; (Z&#8208;selectivity), and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.

         <dc:description>
A bifunctional concentration electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate) with high ion conductivity is developed to reduce the dissolution of polysulfides and stabilize the K anode for advanced K&#8722;S batteries. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries based on &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; conversion mechanism display superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) batteries have attracted wide attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the intractable shuttle effect of K polysulfides results in poor cyclability of K&#8722;S batteries, which severely limits their practical application. Herein, a bifunctional concentrated electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate (EC)) with high ionic conductivity and low viscosity is developed to regulate the dissolution behavior of polysulfides and induce uniform K deposition. The organic groups in the cathode electrolyte interphase layer derived from EC can effectively block the polysulfide shuttle and realize a &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; reaction mechanism. The KF&#8208;riched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase inhibits K dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries display a high reversible capacity of 654&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles and a long lifespan over 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Improbable Rotaxanes Constructed From Surrogate Malonate Rotaxanes as Encircled Methylene Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surrogate malonate&#8208;based rotaxanes allow the construction of improbable rotaxanes, with the final dumbbell&#8208;shaped component assembled from two different stoppers and the only structure inherited from the malonate rotaxane being a methylene group. The syntheses of improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components demonstrate the practicality and generality of this approach.







Abstract
We have developed a new approach for the synthesis of &#8220;improbable&#8221; rotaxanes by using malonate&#8208;centered rotaxanes as interlocked surrogate precursors. Here, the desired dumbbell&#8208;shaped structure can be assembled from two different, completely separate, portions, with the only residual structure introduced from the malonate surrogate being a methylene group. We have synthesized improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components to demonstrate the potential structural flexibility and scope of the guest species that can be interlocked when using this approach.

         <title>Dinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Arylation of Undirected Arenes by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of various monofluoroaromatic is disclosed with readily available aromatic silanes and germanes as coupling partners at room temperature. The flexibility of the binuclear gold catalyst skeleton and the noncovalent interactions between hexafluorobenzene and fluorobenzene can furnish a high para selectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2).







Abstract
The regioselectivity of C&#8722;H functionalization is commonly achieved by directing groups, electronic factors, or steric hindrance, which facilitate the identification of reaction sites. However, such strategies are less effective for reactants such as simple monofluoroarenes due to their relatively low reactivity and the modest steric demands of the fluorine atom. Herein, we present an undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of a wide array of monofluoroarenes using air&#8208;stable aryl silanes and germanes at room temperature. A high para&#8208;regioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2) can be realized by utilizing a dinuclear dppm(AuOTs)2 (dppm=bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) as the catalyst and hexafluorobenzene as the solvent. This provides a general and practical protocol for the concise construction of structurally diverse para&#8208;arylated monofluoroarenes through C&#8722;H activation manner. It features excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope (&gt;80 examples). Besides, this strategy is also robust for other simple monosubstituted arenes and heteroarenes. Our mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations suggest that para&#8208;C&#8722;H selectivity arises from highly electrophilic and structurally flexible dinuclear Ar&#8722;Au(III)&#8722;Au(I) species, coupled with noncovalent interaction induced by hexafluorobenzene.

         <title>Stereoselective Photoredox Catalyzed (3+3) Dipolar Cycloaddition of Nitrone with Aryl Cyclopropane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical type (3+3) cycloaddition of cyclopropane is realized with aryl cyclopropane and nitrone under photoredox catalysis in a highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. The reaction includes a stereospecific three&#8208;electron&#8208;type nucleophilic ring opening and a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization.







Abstract
By resorting to the principle of remote activation, we herein demonstrate the first photoredox catalyzed (3+3) dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones with aryl cyclopropanes. Key to the fidelity of the reaction resides in a facile manner of substrate activation by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation with photoredox catalysis, and the reaction takes place through a stepwise cascade encompassing a three&#8208;electron&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution triggered cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening and a diastereoselective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization manifold. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, nicely complementing the well&#8208;developed Lewis acid catalyzed cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Other merits of the protocol include wide scope of aryl cyclopropanes with diversified substitution patterns and good functional&#8208;group compatibility. A mechanism involving an aryl radical cation promoted remote activation mode was also proposed and supported by mechanistic experiments.

         <title>Work&#8208;Function&#8208;Induced Interfacial Electron/Ion Transport in Carbon Hosts toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon fiber host with high work function was designed to promote electron transfer and surface Li+ diffusion, thus leading to uniform dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition on the fiber scaffold. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibited high reversibility and long&#8208;term cycling stability (EVac: vacuum level; Ef : Fermi level; EVBM: maximum valence&#8208;band energy level; ECBM: minimum conduction&#8208;band energy level).







Abstract
Coupled electron/ion transport is a decisive feature of Li plating/stripping, wherein the compatibility of electron/ion transport rates determines the morphology of deposited Li. Local Li+ hotspots form due to inhomogeneous interfacial charge transfer and lead to uncontrolled Li deposition, which decreases the Li utilization rate and safety of Li metal anodes. Herein, we report a method to obtain dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes by driving electron pumping and accumulating and boosting Li ion diffusion by tuning the work function of a carbon host using cobalt&#8208;containing catalysts. The results reveal that increasing the work function provides an electron deviation from C to Co, and electron&#8208;rich Co shows favorable binding to Li+. The Co catalysts boost Li+ diffusion on the carbon fiber scaffolds without local aggregation by reducing the Li+ migration barrier. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99.0&#8201;%, a cycle life of over 2000&#8197;h, a Li utilization rate of 50&#8201;%, and a capacity retention of 83.4&#8201;% after 130 cycles in pouch cells at a negative/positive capacity ratio of 2.5. These findings provide a novel strategy to stabilize Li metal by regulating the work function of materials using electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Halides as Selectively Bifunctional Catalysts Enabling the Syntheses of Recyclable High Molecular Weight Salicylic Acid&#8208;Based Copolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalysis system of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester (salicylic methyl glycolide), and yields salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters with high molecular weights (Mn=361.8&#8197;kg/mol, &#272;=1.25). Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation can synergistically activate monomer and initiator. Moreover, these polymers can be recycled to monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.







Abstract
To synthesize high molecular weight poly(phenolic ester) via a living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester monomers remains a critical challenge due to serious transesterification and back&#8208;biting reactions. Both phenolic ester bonds in monomer and polymer chains are highly active, and it is difficult so far to distinguish them. In this work, an unprecedented selectively bifunctional catalytic system of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered to mediate the syntheses of high molecular weight salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters via a living ROP of salicylate cyclic esters (for poly(salicylic methyl glycolide) (PSMG), Mn=361.8&#8197;kg/mol, &#208;&lt;1.30). Compared to previous catalysis systems, the side reactions were suppressed remarkably in this catalysis system because phenolic ester bond in monomer can be selectively cleaved over that in polymer chains during ROP progress. Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation work synergistically, where the alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation moiety interacts with the carbonyl group of substrates via non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding. Moreover, these salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters can be recycled to dimeric monomer under solution condition, and can be recycled to original monomeric monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Oriented Design Based on Elementary Reactions (CODER) for Triarylamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst design strategy designated &#8220;catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER)&#8221; enabled the development of a Pd catalyst based on cyclopropane skeleton, which improves the efficiency of catalytic C&#8722;N coupling reaction by up to 3 orders of magnitude, and is expected to be applied to the efficient production of triarylamine optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
Recently, the application of computational tools to the rational design of catalysts has received considerable attention, but progress has been limited by the reliance on databases and because mechanistic data have been almost neglected. Herein, we report a new strategy for catalyst design, designated catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER), which fully utilizes mechanistic data, combines the strengths of computational tools and researcher experience. CODER enabled the development of extremely efficient Pd catalysts for C&#8722;N coupling, which markedly improved the efficiency of the synthesis of widely used triarylamine optoelectronic materials by enhancing the turnover numbers (up to 340000) to 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude towards literature values.

         <title>FINDER: A Fluidly Confined CRISPR&#8208;Based DNA Reporter on Living Cell Membranes for Rapid and Sensitive Cancer Cell Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is of great significance. Herein, we developed a fluidly confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) on living cell membranes for rapid and sensitive cancer cells identification. The FINDER can rapidly identify target cancer cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieve over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells in clinical blood samples.







Abstract
The accurate, rapid, and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is significant in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the naturally confined enzymes on fluid cell membranes, a fluidly confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) was developed on living cell membranes, which was successfully applied for rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification in clinical blood samples. Benefiting from the spatial confinement effect for improved local concentration, and membrane fluidity for higher collision efficiency, the activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a was, for the first time, found to be significantly enhanced on living cell membranes. This new phenomenon was then combined with multiple aptamer&#8208;based DNA logic gate for cell recognition, thus a FINDER system capable of accurate, rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification was constructed. The FINDER rapidly identified target cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieved over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells presented in clinical blood samples, indicating its potential application in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering.

         <title>Interphasial Pre&#8208;lithiation and Reinforcement of Micro&#8208;Si Anode through Fluorine&#8208;free Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bi&#8208;functional fluorine&#8208;free electrolyte was specifically designed for the micro&#8208;Si anodes. Benefiting from pre&#8208;lithiation of the native SiOx, limited accumulation of LiF&#8208;free interphase with high modulus and fast interphasial kinetics, the optimized micro&#8208;Si anode (&gt;5 mAh/cm2) exhibits exceptional performance, which can be comparable to the best one reported for a particular fluorinated electrolyte.







Abstract
Micro&#8208;sized silicon (mSi) anodes offer advantages in cost and tap density over nanosized counterparts. However, its practical application still suffers from poor cyclability and low initial and later&#8208;cycle coulombic efficiency (CE), caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and irreversible lithiation of the surface oxide layer. Herein, a bifunctional fluorine (F)&#8208;free electrolyte was designed for the mSi anode to stabilize the interphase and improve the CE. A combined analysis revealed that this electrolyte can chemically pre&#8208;lithiate the native oxide layer by the reductive LiBH4, and relieve SEI formation and accumulation to preserve the internal conductive network. The significance of this F&#8208;free electrolyte brings unprecedented F&#8208;free interphase that also enables the high&#8208;performance mSi electrode (80&#8197;wt&#8201;% mSi), including high specific capacity of 2900&#8197;mAh/g, high initial CE of 94.7&#8201;% and excellent cyclability capacity retention of 94.3&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C. This work confirms the feasibility of F&#8208;free interphase, thus opening up a new avenue toward cost&#8208;advantaged and environmentally friendly electrolytes for more emerging battery systems.

         <title>Assessing the Productivity of the Direct Conversion of Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol over Copper&#8208;Exchanged Zeolite Omega (MAZ) via Oxygen Looping</title>

Cu&#8208;omega (MAZ) is a very active and selective material for the methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) conversion using the oxygen looping approach. By determining the productivity via a novel screening method combining operando XAS and mass spectrometry, this body of work shows the potential this material exhibits for industrial valorization, as well as a screening method for other materials utilizing the oxygen looping approach.







Abstract
The methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) conversion via the oxygen looping approach using copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites has been extensively studied over the last decade. While a lot of research has focussed on maximizing yield and selectivity, little has been directed toward productivity&#8212;a metric far more meaningful for evaluating industrial potential. Using copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega), a material highly active and selective for the MtM conversion using the isothermal oxygen looping approach, we show that this material exhibits unprecedented potential for industrial valorization. In doing so, we also present a novel methodology combining operando XAS and mass spectrometry for the screening of materials for the MtM conversion in oxygen looping mode.

         <title>An Experimental and Computational Investigation Rules Out Direct Nucleophilic Addition on the N2 Ligand in Manganese Dinitrogen Complex [Cp(CO)2Mn(N2)]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peculiar reactivity of [CpMn(CO)2(N2)] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) is revisited to shed light on the proposed nucleophilic attack of PhLi on its N2 ligand. Our study shows that such reactivity doesn't happen while the attack of the carbanion on CO is favored, albeit giving rise to a very labile compound. The latter decomposes above &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C into a N2&#8208;free phenyl manganate that was erroneously proposed to be an anionic phenyldiazenido complex.







Abstract
We have re&#8208;examined the reactivity of the manganese dinitrogen complex [Cp(CO)2Mn(N2)] (1, Cp=&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, C5H5) with phenylithium (PhLi). By combining experiment and density functional theory (DFT), we have found that, unlike previously reported, the direct nucleophilic attack of the carbanion onto coordinated dinitrogen does not occur. Instead, PhLi reacts with one of the CO ligands to provide an anionic acylcarbonyl dinitrogen metallate [Cp(CO)(N2)MnCOPh]Li (3) that is stable only below &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Full characterization of 3 (including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) was performed. This complex decomposes quickly above &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with N2 loss to give a phenylate complex [Cp(CO)2MnPh]Li (2). The latter compound was erroneously formulated as an anionic diazenido compound [Cp(CO)2MnN(Ph)=N]Li in earlier reports, ruling out the claimed and so&#8208;far unique behavior of the N2 ligand in 1. DFT calculations were run to explore both the hypothesized and the experimentally verified reactivity of 1 with PhLi and are fully consistent with our results. Direct attack of a nucleophile on metal&#8208;coordinated N2 remains to be demonstrated.

         <title>Modulating Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions to Boost Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrolysis of Ammonia Borane: Nickel&#8208;Platinum Nanoparticles Supported on Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Titania</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>

Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles supported on P&#8208;doped TiO2 mediate visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ammonia borane hydrolysis. The optimized Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 catalyst exhibits a high turnover frequency of 967.8&#8197;molH2&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1. P doping enhances the visible&#8208;light absorption and modulates the electronic states of the metals to enhance the strong metal&#8208;support interactions, thereby promoting the hydrogen&#8208;evolving activity and stability of the catalyst.







Abstract
Ammonia borane (AB) is a promising material for chemical H2 storage owing to its high H2 density (up to 19.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%). However, the development of an efficient catalyst for driving H2 evolution through AB hydrolysis remains challenging. Therefore, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for generating H2 through AB hydrolysis was implemented in this study using Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles supported on phosphorus&#8208;doped TiO2 (Ni&#8208;Pt/P&#8208;TiO2) as photocatalysts. Through surface engineering, P&#8208;TiO2 was prepared by phytic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted phosphorization and then employed as an ideal support for immobilizing Ni&#8722;Pt nanoparticles via a facile co&#8208;reduction strategy. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation at 283&#8197;K, Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 exhibited improved recyclability and a high turnover frequency of 967.8&#8197;mol
&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1. Characterization experiments and density functional theory calculations indicated that the enhanced performance of Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 originated from a combination of the Ni&#8722;Pt alloying effect, the Mott&#8211;Schottky junction at the metal&#8208;semiconductor interface, and strong metal&#8208;support interactions. These findings not only underscore the benefits of utilizing multipronged effects to construct highly active AB&#8208;hydrolyzing catalysts, but also pave a path toward designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by surface engineering to modulate the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions for other visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Efficient Polyethylene Hydrocracking over Two&#8208;Dimensional Platinum&#8208;Anchored Tungsten Trioxide</title>

         <dc:description>
A 2D platinum&#8208;anchored tungsten trioxide (Pt/WO3) catalyst with abundant vacancies and acidic sites activates high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE) polymer chains by forming C=O intermediates. Hydrocracking occurs when the intermediates are hydrogenated by the dissociated H2 on Pt/WO3 to form alkanes. The well&#8208;dispersed Pt on 2D WO3 nanosheets achieved almost complete HDPE conversion with a yield of 88.9&#8201;% fuel at a low temperature of 200&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Chemical upcycling of polyethylene (PE) can convert plastic waste into valuable resources. However, engineering a catalyst that allows PE decomposition at low temperatures with high activity remains a significant challenge. Herein, we anchored 0.2&#8197;wt.% platinum (Pt) on defective two&#8208;dimensional tungsten trioxide (2D WO3) nanosheets and achieved hydrocracking of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE) waste at 200&#8211;250&#8201;&#176;C with a liquid fuel (C5&#8211;18) formation rate up to 1456&#8197;gproducts&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gmetal species&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1. The reaction pathway over the bifunctional 2D Pt/WO3 is elucidated by quasi&#8208;operando transmission infrared spectroscopy, where (I) well&#8208;dispersed Pt immobilized on 2D WO3 nanosheets trigger the dissociation of hydrogen; (II) adsorption of PE and activation of C&#8722;C cleavage on WO3 are through the formation of C=O/C=C intermediates; (III) intermediates are converted to alkane products by the dissociated H. Our study directly illustrates the synergistic role of bifunctional Pt/WO3 catalyst in the hydrocracking of HDPE, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance catalysts with optimized chemical and morphological properties.

Herein, we anchored 0.2&#8197;wt.% platinum (Pt) on defective two-dimensional tungsten trioxide (2D WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) nanosheets and achieved hydrocracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) waste at 200&#8211;250&#8201;&#176;C with a liquid fuel (C&lt;sub&gt;5&#8211;18&lt;/sub&gt;) formation rate up to 1456&#8197;g&lt;sub&gt;products&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;metal species&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The reaction pathway over the bifunctional 2D Pt/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is elucidated by quasi-operando transmission infrared spectroscopy, where (I) well-dispersed Pt immobilized on 2D WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets trigger the dissociation of hydrogen; (II) adsorption of PE and activation of C&#8722;C cleavage on WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are through the formation of C=O/C=C intermediates; (III) intermediates are converted to alkane products by the dissociated H. Our study directly illustrates the synergistic role of bifunctional Pt/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst in the hydrocracking of HDPE, paving the way for the development of high-performance catalysts with optimized chemical and morphological properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Induced&#8208;Fit&#8208;Identification in a Rigid Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for ppm&#8208;Level CO2 Removal and Ultra&#8208;Pure CO Enrichment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atypical thermoresponsive feature is incorporated into a rigid Mg&#8208;MOF, which realizes ppm&#8208;level CO2 capture and ultra&#8208;pure CO enrichment (&#8805;99.99&#8201;%) at elevated working temperature. The property is demonstrated by comprehensive in situ variable&#8208;temperature tests showing outstanding performance in syngas purification and CO upgrading through an induced&#8208;fit&#8208;identification mechanism.







Abstract
Removing CO2 from crude syngas via physical adsorption is an effective method to yield eligible syngas. However, the bottleneck in trapping ppm&#8208;level CO2 and improving CO purity at higher working temperatures are major challenges. Here we report a thermoresponsive metal&#8211;organic framework (1&#8201;a&#8208;apz), assembled by rigid Mg2(dobdc) (1&#8201;a) and aminopyrazine (apz), which not only affords an ultra&#8208;high CO2 capacity (145.0/197.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.01/0.1&#8197;bar) at 298&#8197;K) but also produces ultra&#8208;pure CO (purity &#8805;99.99&#8201;%) at a practical ambient temperature (TA). Several characterization results, including variable&#8208;temperature tests, in situ high&#8208;resolution synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (HR&#8208;SXRD), and simulations, explicitly unravel that the excellent property is attributed to the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;identification in 1&#8201;a&#8208;apz that comprises self&#8208;adaption of apz, multiple binding sites, and complementary electrostatic potential (ESP). Breakthrough tests suggest that 1&#8201;a&#8208;apz can remove CO2 from 1/99 CO2/CO mixtures at practical 348&#8197;K, yielding 70.5&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of CO with ultra&#8208;high purity of &#8805;99.99&#8201;%. The excellent separation performance is also revealed by separating crude syngas that contains quinary mixtures of H2/N2/CH4/CO/CO2 (46/18.3/2.4/32.3/1, v/v/v/v/v).

         <title>Tuning C1/C2 Selectivity of CO2 Electrochemical Reduction over in&#8208;Situ Evolved CuO/SnO2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we report a tuning C1/C2 selectivity of CO2 electrochemical reduction over in situ electrochemically evolved CuO/SnO2 heterostructure. Specifically, the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of the newly evolved Cu/SnO2&#8208;x facilitates ethanol generation.







Abstract
Heterostructured oxides with versatile active sites, as a class of efficient catalysts for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER), are prone to undergo structure reconstruction under working conditions, thus bringing challenges to understanding the reaction mechanism and rationally designing catalysts. Herein, we for the first time elucidate the structural reconstruction of CuO/SnO2 under electrochemical potentials and reveal the intrinsic relationship between CO2ER product selectivity and the in situ evolved heterostructures. At &#8722;0.85&#8197;VRHE, the CuO/SnO2 evolves to Cu2O/SnO2 with high selectivity to HCOOH (Faradaic efficiency of 54.81&#8201;%). Mostly interestingly, it is reconstructed to Cu/SnO2&#8208;x at &#8722;1.05&#8197;VRHE with significantly improved Faradaic efficiency to ethanol of 39.8&#8201;%. In situ Raman spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of Cu/SnO2&#8208;x favors the formation of *CO and decreases the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling, leading to high selectivity to ethanol.

         <title>Elucidating the Underlying Reactivities of Alternating Current Electrosynthesis by Time&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Short&#8208;Lived Reactive Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;resolved operando electrochemical mass spectrometry platform was developed to elucidate the unique reactivities of alternating current (AC) electrosynthesis. Minimization of over&#8208;oxidation and effective reaction of the electrogenerated intermediates in AC electrolysis was demonstrated. Notably, the kinetics of reactive N&#8208;centered radical intermediates in multistep sequential AC electrosynthesis could be controlled to minimize side reactions.







Abstract
Alternating current (AC) electrolysis is an emerging field in synthetic chemistry, however its mechanistic studies are challenged by the effective characterization of the elusive intermediate processes. Herein, we develop an operando electrochemical mass spectrometry platform that allows time&#8208;resolved mapping of stepwise electrosynthetic reactive intermediates in both direct current and alternating current modes. By dissecting the key intermediate processes of electrochemical functionalization of arylamines, the unique reactivities of AC electrosynthesis, including minimizing the over&#8208;oxidation/reduction through the inverse process, and enabling effective reaction of short&#8208;lived intermediates generated by oxidation and reduction in paired electrolysis, were evidenced and verified. Notably, the controlled kinetics of reactive N&#8208;centered radical intermediates in multistep sequential AC electrosynthesis to minimize the competing reactions was discovered. Overall, this work provides direct evidence for the mechanism of AC electrolysis, and clarifies the underlying reasons for its high efficiency, which will benefit the rational design of AC electrosynthetic reactions.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Synthesis and Concurrent Immobilization of Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks on Electrodes Using an Electrogenerated Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a novel synthetic methodology for covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that utilizes an electrogenerated acid (EGA), which is produced at an electrode surface by electrochemical oxidation of a precursor, acting as an effective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst for imine bond formation from amine and aldehyde monomers. Simultaneously, it provides the corresponding COF film deposited on the electrode surface with high crystallinity and porosity.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous materials with prospective uses in various devices. However, general bulk synthetic methods usually produce COFs as powders that are insoluble in most of the common organic solvents, arising challenges for the subsequent molding and fixing of these materials on substrates. Here, we report a novel synthetic methodology that utilizes an electrogenerated acid (EGA), which is produced at an electrode surface by electrochemical oxidation of a suitable precursor, acting as an effective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst for imine bond formation from the corresponding amine and aldehyde monomers. Simultaneously, it provides the corresponding COF film deposited on the electrode surface. The COF structures obtained with this method exhibited high crystallinities and porosities, and the film thickness could be controlled. Furthermore, such process was applied for the synthesis of various imine&#8208;based COFs, including a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COF structure.

Simultaneously, it provides the corresponding COF film deposited on the electrode surface. The COF structures obtained with this method exhibited high crystallinities and porosities, and the film thickness could be controlled. Furthermore, such process was applied for the synthesis of various imine-based COFs, including a three-dimensional (3D) COF structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sodium Bicarbonate Nanoparticles for Amplified Cancer Immunotherapy by Inducing Pyroptosis and Regulating Lactic Acid Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and drug&#8208;free inorganic nanomaterial, alkalescent sodium bicarbonate nanoparticles (NaHCO3 NPs), was obtained to regulate lactic acid metabolism through acid&#8208;base neutralization, and thus to reverse the mildly acidic immunosuppressive tumor environment. Furthermore, it can release high amounts of Na+ ions and induce a surge in intracellular osmolarity to activate the pyroptosis pathway and improve immune responses.







Abstract
Although immunotherapy has a broad clinical application prospect, it is still hindered by low immune responses and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a simple and drug&#8208;free inorganic nanomaterial, alkalescent sodium bicarbonate nanoparticles (NaHCO3 NPs), is prepared via a fast microemulsion method for amplified cancer immunotherapy. The obtained alkalescent NaHCO3 regulates lactic acid metabolism through acid&#8208;base neutralization so as to reverse the mildly acidic immunosuppressive tumor environment. Additionally, it can further release high amounts of Na+ ions inside tumor cells and induce a surge in intracellular osmolarity, and thus activate the pyroptosis pathway and immunogenic cell death (ICD), release damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and inflammatory factors, and improve immune responses. Collectively, NaHCO3 NPs observably inhibit primary/distal tumor growth and tumor metastasis through acid neutralization remitted immunosuppression and pyroptosis induced immune activation, showing an enhanced antitumor immunity efficiency. This work provides a new paradigm for lactic acid metabolism and pyroptosis mediated tumor treatment, which has a potential for application in clinical tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Maximizing Electrostatic Polarity of Non&#8208;Sacrificial Electrolyte Additives Enables Stable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of different saccharide molecules as non&#8208;sacrificial electrolyte additives in regulating Zn2+ desolvation and Zn deposition was investigated for the first time through experimental and theoretical studies.







Abstract
Although additives are widely used in aqueous electrolytes to inhibit the formation of dendrites and hydrogen evolution reactions on Zn anodes, there is a lack of rational design principles and systematic mechanistic studies on how to select a suitable additive to regulate reversible Zn plating/stripping chemistry. Here, using saccharides as the representatives, we reveal that the electrostatic polarity of non&#8208;sacrificial additives is a critical descriptor for their ability to stabilize Zn anodes. Non&#8208;sacrificial additives are found to continuously modulate the solvation structure of Zn ions and form a molecular adsorption layer (MAL) for uniform Zn deposition, avoiding the thick solid electrolyte interphase layer due to the decomposition of sacrificial additives. A high electrostatic polarity renders sucrose the best hydrated Zn2+ desolvation ability and facilitates the MAL formation, resulting in the best cycling stability with a long&#8208;term reversible plating/stripping cycle life of thousands of hours. This study provides theoretical guidance for the screening of optimal additives for high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>Universal Sub&#8208;Nanoreactor Strategy for Synthesis of Yolk&#8208;Shell MoS2 Supported Single Atom Electrocatalysts toward Robust Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by theoretical prediction of the &#8220;E&#8208;Lock&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8208;Channel&#8221; at sulfur vacancy and intercalation carbon, we report a universal sub&#8208;nanoreactor strategy to precisely regulate the spatial location and local microenvironment of metal single atoms (Co, Ni, Fe, Zn, W, Cu, Mn, and Cd) over yolk&#8208;shell C&#8722;MoS2 dual&#8208;support for robust hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction in acid.







Abstract
The coordination structure determines the electrocatalytic performances of single atom catalysts (SACs), while it remains a challenge to precisely regulate their spatial location and coordination environment. Herein, we report a universal sub&#8208;nanoreactor strategy for synthesis of yolk&#8208;shell MoS2 supported single atom electrocatalysts with dual&#8208;anchored microenvironment of vacancy&#8208;enriched MoS2 and intercalation carbon toward robust hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the &#8220;E&#8208;Lock&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8208;Channel&#8221; are conducive to stabilize and activate metal single atoms. A group of SACs is subsequently produced with the assistance of sulfur vacancy and intercalation carbon in the yolk&#8208;shell sub&#8208;nanoreactor. The optimized C&#8722;Co&#8722;MoS2 yields the lowest overpotential (&#951;10=17&#8197;mV) compared with previously reported MoS2&#8208;based electrocatalysts to date, and also affords a 5&#8211;9 fold improvement in activity even comparing with those as&#8208;prepared single&#8208;anchored analogues. Theoretical results and in situ characterizations unveil its active center and durability. This work provides a universal pathway to design efficient catalysts for electro&#8208;refinery.

         <title>Harnessing Aromatic&#8208;Histidine Interactions through Synergistic Backbone Extension and Side Chain Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational and coordinated side chain modification and backbone extension, by replacing &#945;&#8208;amino acid residues with &#946;&#8208;amino acid residues, enables favorable interaction between a His side chain on a target protein and an aromatic side chain on a synthetic peptide ligand. This strategy, which enhances affinity, is showcased with peptides that bind to the parathyroid hormone receptor 1.







Abstract
Peptide engineering efforts have delivered drugs for diverse human diseases. Side chain alteration is among the most common approaches to designing new peptides for specific applications. The peptide backbone can be modified as well, but this strategy has received relatively little attention. Here we show that new and favorable contacts between a His side chain on a target protein and an aromatic side chain on a synthetic peptide ligand can be engineered by rational and coordinated side chain modification and backbone extension. Side chain modification alone was unsuccessful. Binding measurements, high&#8208;resolution structural studies and pharmacological outcomes all support the synergy between backbone and side chain modification in engineered ligands of the parathyroid hormone receptor&#8208;1, which is targeted by osteoporosis drugs. These results should motivate other structure&#8208;based designs featuring coordinated side chain modification and backbone extension to enhance the engagement of peptide ligands with target proteins.

         <title>A Rapidly Responsive Sensor for Wireless Detection of Early and Mature Microbial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A setup for wireless detection of early and mature microbial biofilms has been developed by combining inkjet printing of nanomaterials, chip&#8208;less antenna, and electrogenicity of biofilms. Wireless sensing relies on the biofilm ability to electro&#8208;reduce antenna integrated AgCl to Ag. Detection of medically relevant biofilms formed by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa has been demonstrated, aiming for wireless wound infection sensing in clinics.







Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;associated infections, which are able to resist antibiotics, pose a significant challenge in clinical treatments. Such infections have been linked to various medical conditions, including chronic wounds and implant&#8208;associated infections, making them a major public&#8208;health concern. Early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation offers significant advantages in mitigating adverse effects caused by biofilms. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of employing a novel wireless sensor for tracking both early&#8208;stage and matured&#8208;biofilms formed by the medically relevant bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sensor utilizes electrochemical reduction of an AgCl layer bridging two silver legs made by inkjet&#8208;printing, forming a part of near&#8208;field&#8208;communication tag antenna. The antenna is interfaced with a carbon cloth designed to promote the growth of microorganisms, thereby serving as an electron source for reduction of the resistive AgCl into a highly&#8208;conductive Ag bridge. The AgCl&#8722;Ag transformation significantly alters the impedance of the antenna, facilitating wireless identification of an endpoint caused by microbial growth. To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first time presents the evidence showcasing that electrons released through the actions of bacteria can be harnessed to convert AgCl to Ag, thus enabling the wireless, battery&#8208;less, and chip&#8208;less early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation.

     alt="A Rapidly Responsive Sensor for Wireless Detection of Early and Mature Microbial Biofilms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A setup for wireless detection of early and mature microbial biofilms has been developed by combining inkjet printing of nanomaterials, chip-less antenna, and electrogenicity of biofilms. Wireless sensing relies on the biofilm ability to electro-reduce antenna integrated AgCl to Ag. Detection of medically relevant biofilms formed by &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; has been demonstrated, aiming for wireless wound infection sensing in clinics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biofilm-associated infections, which are able to resist antibiotics, pose a significant challenge in clinical treatments. Such infections have been linked to various medical conditions, including chronic wounds and implant-associated infections, making them a major public-health concern. Early-detection of biofilm formation offers significant advantages in mitigating adverse effects caused by biofilms. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of employing a novel wireless sensor for tracking both early-stage and matured-biofilms formed by the medically relevant bacteria &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. The sensor utilizes electrochemical reduction of an AgCl layer bridging two silver legs made by inkjet-printing, forming a part of near-field-communication tag antenna. The antenna is interfaced with a carbon cloth designed to promote the growth of microorganisms, thereby serving as an electron source for reduction of the resistive AgCl into a highly-conductive Ag bridge. The AgCl&#8722;Ag transformation significantly alters the impedance of the antenna, facilitating wireless identification of an endpoint caused by microbial growth.

         <title>Engineering Soluble Diketopyrrolopyrrole Chromophore Stacks from a Series of Pd(II)&#8208;Based Ravels
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking of one, two, three, or four diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes was achieved by employing recent progress in Pd(II)&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly. Two unprecedented self&#8208;penetrated motifs have been identified: a Pd2L3 triple and a Pd2L4 quadruple stack. With increasing stack size, the absorption bathochromically shifts and emission quenches, except for Pd2L2L&#8242;2, which stands out with an exceptional luminescence quantum yield of 51&#8201;%.







Abstract
A strategy to engineer the stacking of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes based on non&#8208;statistical metallosupramolecular self&#8208;assembly is introduced. For this, the DPP backbone is equipped with nitrogen&#8208;based donors that allow for different discrete assemblies to be formed upon the addition of Pd(II), distinguished by the number of &#960;&#8208;stacked chromophores. A Pd3L6 three&#8208;ring, a heteroleptic Pd2L2L&#8242;2 ravel composed of two crossing DPPs (flanked by two carbazoles), and two unprecedented self&#8208;penetrated motifs (a Pd2L3 triple and a Pd2L4 quadruple stack), were obtained and systematically investigated. With increasing counts of stacked chromophores, UV/Vis absorptions red&#8208;shift and emission intensities decrease, except for compound Pd2L2L&#8242;2, which stands out with an exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield of 51&#8201;%. This is extraordinary for open&#8208;shell metal containing assemblies and explainable by an intra&#8208;assembly FRET process. The modular design and synthesis of soluble multi&#8208;chromophore building blocks offers the potential for the preparation of nanodevices and materials with applications in sensing, photo&#8208;redox catalysis and optics.

         <title>Sonodynamic Cytokine Nanocomplexes with Specific Stimulation towards Effector T Cell for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sonodynamic cytokine nanocomplexes (SPNAI) can not only specifically activate effector T cells (Teffs) rather than regulatory T cells (Tregs), but also generate 1O2 under sono&#8208;irradiation for induction of immunogenic cell death, which synergistically elevates the ratio of Teffs/Tregs for effective antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Cytokine therapy mediates the interaction between immune cells and non&#8208;immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), forming a promising approach in cancer therapy. However, the dose&#8208;dependent adverse effects and non&#8208;selective stimulation of cytokines limit their clinical use. We herein report a sonodynamic cytokine nano&#8208;immunocomplex (SPNAI) that specifically activates effector T cells (Teffs) for antitumor immunotherapy. By conjugating anti&#8208;interleukin&#8208;2 (anti&#8208;IL&#8208;2) antibodies S4B6 on the semiconducting polymer nanoparticles to afford SPNA, this nanoantibody SPNA can bind with IL&#8208;2 to form SPNAI which can block the interaction between IL&#8208;2 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), selectively activating Teffs in TME. Moreover, SPNAI generates 1O2 to trigger immunogenic cell death of cancer cells upon sono&#8208;irradiation, which promotes the maturation of dendritic cells and the proliferation of Teffs. This SPNAI&#8208;mediated combination sonodynamic immunotherapy thus elevates the ratio of Teffs/Tregs in TME, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth, suppression of lung metastasis and prevention of tumor relapse.

         <title>Thermodynamic Phase Transition of Three&#8208;Dimensional Solid Additives Guiding Molecular Assembly for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional solids were developed to optimize the nanoscale structure of the active layer in organic solar cells by offering ample assembly space during the phase&#8208;transition process, yielding a high power&#8208;conversion efficiency of over 19&#8201;%. This research not only established a valuable pre&#8208;selection approach for solid additives but also deepened our understanding of the underlying working mechanism.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning the thermodynamic self&#8208;assembly of molecules via volatile solid additives has emerged to be an effective way to construct high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Here, three&#8208;dimensional structured solid molecules have been designed and applied to facilitate the formation of organized molecular assembly in the active layer. By means of systematic theory analyses and film&#8208;morphology characterizations based on four solid candidates, we preselected the optimal one, 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline (FPA), which possesses good volatility and strong charge polarization. The three&#8208;dimensional solids can induce molecular packing in active layers via strong intermolecular interactions and subsequently provide sufficient space for the self&#8208;reassembly of active layers during the thermodynamic transition process. Benefitting from the optimized morphology with improved charge transport and reduced energy disorder in the FPA&#8208;processed devices, high efficiencies of over 19&#8201;% were achieved. The strategy of three&#8208;dimensional additives inducing ordered self&#8208;assembly structure represents a practical approach for rational morphology control in highly efficient devices, contributing to deeper insights into the structural design of efficient volatile solid additives.

         <title>Bulk and Surface Contributions to Ionisation Potentials of Metal Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combination of theoretical techniques, we separated the bulk and surface contributions of ionisation potentials of metal oxides, highlighting the critical role of electrostatics. Low bulk ionisation potentials and a high degree of tunability from surfaces were found in CeO2, HfO2, and ZrO2, explaining the discrepancies from measurements and guiding the future design of band&#8208;edge&#8208;related photocatalytic, photovoltaic, and electrochemical devices.







Abstract
Determining the absolute band edge positions in solid materials is crucial for optimising their performance in wide&#8208;ranging applications including photocatalysis and electronic devices. However, obtaining absolute energies is challenging, as seen in CeO2, where experimental measurements show substantial discrepancies in the ionisation potential (IP). Here, we have combined several theoretical approaches, from classical electrostatics to quantum mechanics, to elucidate the bulk and surface contributions to the IP of metal oxides. We have determined a theoretical bulk contribution to the IP of stoichiometric CeO2 of only 5.38&#8197;eV, while surface orientation results in intrinsic IP variations ranging from 4.2&#8197;eV to 8.2&#8197;eV. Highly tuneable IPs were also found in TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2, in which surface polarisation plays a pivotal role in long&#8208;range energy level shifting. Our analysis, in addition to rationalising the observed range of experimental results, provides a firm basis for future interpretations of experimental and computational studies of oxide band structures.

Here, we have combined several theoretical approaches, from classical electrostatics to quantum mechanics, to elucidate the bulk and surface contributions to the IP of metal oxides. We have determined a theoretical bulk contribution to the IP of stoichiometric CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of only 5.38&#8197;eV, while surface orientation results in intrinsic IP variations ranging from 4.2&#8197;eV to 8.2&#8197;eV. Highly tuneable IPs were also found in TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in which surface polarisation plays a pivotal role in long-range energy level shifting. Our analysis, in addition to rationalising the observed range of experimental results, provides a firm basis for future interpretations of experimental and computational studies of oxide band structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Balancing Interfacial Reactions through Regulating p&#8208;Band Centers by an Indium Tin Oxide Protective Layer for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>

A new principle of regulating p&#8208;band center of metal oxide protective layer to balance Zn adsorption energy and migration energy barrier for effective Zn anode with long lifetime and low overpotential.







Abstract
Metallic zinc (Zn) is considered as one of the most attractive anode materials for the post&#8208;lithium metal battery systems owing to the high theoretical capacity, low cost, and intrinsic safety. However, the Zn dendrites and parasitic side reaction impede its application. Herein, we propose a new principle of regulating p&#8208;band center of metal oxide protective coating to balance Zn adsorption energy and migration energy barrier for effective Zn deposition and stripping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that benefiting from the uniform zincophilic nucleation sites and fast Zn transport on indium tin oxide (ITO), highly stable and reversible Zn anode can be achieved. As a result, the I&#8722;Zn symmetrical cell achieves highly reversible Zn deposition/stripping with an extremely low overpotential of 9&#8197;mV and a superior lifespan over 4000&#8197;h. The Cu/I&#8722;Zn asymmetrical cell exhibits a long lifetime of over 4000&#8197;cycles with high average coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%. Furthermore, the assembled I&#8722;Zn/AC full cell exhibits an excellent lifetime for 70000&#8197;cycles with nearly 100&#8201;% capacity retention. This work provides a general strategy and new insight for the construction of efficient Zn anode protection layer.

         <title>Chemical Bonding Tuned Lattice Anharmonicity Leads to a High Thermoelectric Performance in Cubic AgSnSbTe3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of p&#8208;d and s&#8208;p antibonding states near the Fermi level as well as metavalent bonding provide an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity while maintaining a high electrical conductivity, resulting in a high thermoelectric performance of the cubic AgSnSbTe3 single crystal.







Abstract
Comprehension of chemical bonding and its intertwined relation with charge carriers and heat propagation through a crystal lattice is imperative to design compounds for thermoelectric energy conversion. Here, we report the synthesis of large single crystal of new p&#8208;type cubic AgSnSbTe3 which shows an innately ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of 0.47&#8211;0.27&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8197;K&#8722;1 and a high electrical conductivity (1238 &#8211; 800&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in the temperature range 294&#8211;723&#8197;K. We investigated the origin of the low &#954;lat by analysing the nature of the chemical bonding and its crystal structure. The interaction between Sn(5&#8197;s)/Ag(4d) and Te(5p) orbitals was found to generate antibonding states just below the Fermi level in the electronic band structure, resulting in a softening of the lattice in AgSnSbTe3. Furthermore, the compound exhibits metavalent bonding which provides highly polarizable bonds with a strong lattice anharmonicity while maintaining the superior electrical conductivity. The electronic band structure exhibits nearly degenerate valence&#8208;band maxima that help to achieve a high Seebeck coefficient throughout the measured temperature range and, as a result, the maximum thermoelectric figure of merit reaches to &#8776;1.2 at 661&#8197;K in pristine single crystal of AgSnSbTe3.

         <title>Elastic Polymer Coated Nanoparticles with Fast Clearance for 19F&#8197;MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastic polymer&#8208;coated nanoparticles (NPs) were developed as novel contrast agents for 19F&#8197;MRI. These NPs encapsulated liquid perfluorocarbon, resulting in high elasticity and robust sensitivity in 19F&#8197;NMR and MRI. Moreover, in vivo imaging of these NPs implied that elastic NPs suppressed long&#8208;term accumulation in the liver.







Abstract
19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful molecular imaging technique that enables high&#8208;resolution imaging of deep tissues without background signal interference. However, the use of nanoparticles (NPs) as 19F&#8197;MRI probes has been limited by the immediate trapping and accumulation of stiff NPs, typically of around 100&#8197;nm in size, in the mononuclear phagocyte system, particularly in the liver. To address this issue, elastic nanomaterials have emerged as promising candidates for improving delivery efficacy in vivo. Nevertheless, the impact of elasticity on NP elimination has remained unclear due to the lack of suitable probes for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term monitoring. In this study, we present the development of perfluorocarbon&#8208;encapsulated polymer NPs as a novel 19F&#8197;MRI contrast agent, with the aim of suppressing long&#8208;term accumulation. The polymer NPs have high elasticity and exhibit robust sensitivity in 19F&#8197;MRI imaging. Importantly, our 19F&#8197;MRI data demonstrate a gradual decline in the signal intensity of the polymer NPs after administration, which contrasts starkly with the behavior observed for stiff silica NPs. This innovative polymer&#8208;coated NP system represents a groundbreaking nanomaterial that successfully overcomes the challenges associated with long&#8208;term accumulation, while enabling tracking of biodistribution over extended periods.

         <title>Facile, Versatile and Stepwise Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Oligomer Acceptors for Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise method proposed to synthesize non&#8208;fullerene oligomer acceptors via consecutive Stille coupling reactions offers significant advantages compared to the traditional approach, resulting in fewer unwanted by&#8208;products and easier purification processes. By utilizing this method, the obtained Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based organic solar cells achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 18.03&#8201;%, along with excellent stability.







Abstract
Oligomer acceptors have recently emerged as promising photovoltaic materials for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited availability of diverse acceptors, resulting from the sole synthetic approach, has hindered their potential for future industrialization. In this study, we present a facile and effective stepwise approach that utilizes two consecutive Stille coupling reactions for the synthesis of oligomer acceptors. To demonstrate the feasibility of the novel approach, we successfully synthesize a trimer acceptor, Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD, and further systematically investigate the impact of oligomerization on device performance and stability. The results reveal that this approach has significant advantages compared to the conventional method, including reduced formation of unwanted by&#8208;products and lower difficulties in purification. Remarkably, the OSC based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Tri&#8208;Y6&#8208;OD achieves an impressive PCE of 18.03&#8201;% and maintains 80&#8201;% of the initial PCE (T80) for 1523&#8197;h under illumination, surpassing the performance of the corresponding small molecule acceptor Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based device. Furthermore, the versatility of the synthetic strategy in obtaining diverse acceptors is further demonstrated. Overall, our findings provide a facile, versatile and stepwise way for synthesizing oligomer acceptors, thereby facilitating the development of stable and efficient OSCs.

We report a straightforward synthesis of the first peraryl lithium diboriranide c&#8208;(DurB)2CPh&#8722; via the corresponding non&#8208;classical diborirane (Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl; Bn=benzyl) starting from a diborane(4). We demonstrate the strong preference of the diboriranide for &#963;&#8208;type coordination modes towards main group and transition metal centers (Au, Cu, Zn and Sn) under unperturbed retention of the three&#8208;membered B2C&#8208;ring's 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system.







Abstract
Diboriranides are the smallest conceivable monoanionic aromatic cycles, yet only limited examples have been reported and their reactivity and complexation behavior remain completely unexplored. We report a straightforward synthesis of the first peraryl diboriranide c&#8208;(DurB)2CPh&#8722; as its lithium salt in three steps via the corresponding non&#8208;classical diborirane from a readily available 1,2&#8208;dichlorodiborane(4) (Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl). With the preparation and complete characterization of representative complexes with tin, copper, gold and zinc, we demonstrate the strong preference of the diboriranide for &#963;&#8208;type coordination modes towards main group and transition metal centers under unperturbed retention of the three&#8208;membered B2C&#8208;ring's 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system.

         <title>A Molecular Z&#8208;Scheme Artificial Photosynthetic System Under the Bias&#8208;Free Condition for CO2 Reduction Coupled with Two&#8208;electron Water Oxidation: Photocatalytic Production of CO/HCOOH and H2O2</title>

The molecular Z&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthesis with a photocathode of CO2 reduction and a photoanode of two&#8208;electron water oxidation into H2O2 by visible light as the only energy input was developed for the first time.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;inspired molecular&#8208;engineered systems have been extensively investigated for the half&#8208;reactions of H2O oxidation or CO2 reduction with sacrificial electron donors/acceptors. However, there has yet to be reported a device for dye&#8208;sensitized molecular photoanodes coupled with molecular photocathodes in an aqueous solution without the use of sacrificial reagents. Herein, we will report the integration of SnIV&#8208; or AlIII&#8208;tetrapyridylporphyrin (SnTPyP or AlTPyP) decorated tin oxide particles (SnTPyP/SnO2 or AlTPyP/SnO2) photoanode with the dye&#8208;sensitized molecular photocathode on nickel oxide particles containing [Ru(diimine)3]2+ as the light&#8208;harvesting unit and [Ru(diimine)(CO)2Cl2] as the catalyst unit covalently connected and fixed within poly&#8208;pyrrole layer (RuCAT&#8208;RuC2&#8208;PolyPyr&#8208;PRu/NiO). The simultaneous irradiation of the two photoelectrodes with visible light resulted in H2O2 on the anode and CO, HCOOH, and H2 on the cathode with high Faradaic efficiencies in purely aqueous conditions without any applied bias is the first example of artificial photosynthesis with only two&#8208;electron redox reactions.

         <title>Defect Rich Structure Activated 3D Palladium Catalyst for Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of defect&#8208;rich structures (stacking faults, twin boundaries, lattice distortion, steps, and edges), low coordination number (CN), and tensile strain in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) urchin&#8208;like palladium nanoparticles through chlorine bonded with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY) can regulate the arrangement of metal atoms. The as&#8208;prepared Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY are highly efficient and durable methanol oxidation reaction electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Controlling the structure and properties of catalysts through atomic arrangement is the source of producing a new generation of advanced catalysts. A highly active and stable catalyst in catalytic reactions strongly depends on an ideal arrangement structure of metal atoms. We demonstrated that the introduction of the defect&#8208;rich structures, low coordination number (CN), and tensile strain in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) urchin&#8208;like palladium nanoparticles through chlorine bonded with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY) can regulate the arrangement of metal atoms in the palladium nanoparticles to form a special structure. In situ Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculation results show that Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY catalyst is beneficial to the oxidation and removal of CO intermediates. The Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) that display high current density (363.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and mass activity (3.6&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1), 12.0 and 10.9&#8197;times higher than Pd nanoparticles, respectively. The Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY catalyst also exhibited robust stability with still retained 95&#8201;% activity after 2000 cycles. A defects libraries of the face&#8208;centered cubic and hexagonal close&#8208;packed crystal catalysts (FH&#8208;NPs) were synthesized by introducing chlorine in graphdiyne. Such defect&#8208;rich structures, low CN, and tensile strain tailoring methods have opened up a new way for the catalytic reaction of MOR.

         <title>Design of Furan&#8208;Based Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>

Efficient and photostable furan&#8208;based n&#8208;type semiconductors were developed for organic solar cells. Important photodegradation mechanisms were revealed and analyzed and the findings lead to effective strategies to improve the photostability of non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors.







Abstract
We explore a series of furan&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and report their optoelectronic properties, solid&#8208;state packing, photodegradation mechanism and application in photovoltaic devices. Incorporating furan building blocks leads to the expected enhanced backbone planarity, reduced band gap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of these acceptors. Still, their position in the molecule is critical for stability and device performance. We found that the photodegradation of these acceptors originates from two distinct pathways: electrocyclic photoisomerization and Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of singlet oxygen. These mechanisms are of general significance to most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, and the photostability depends strongly on the molecular structure. Placement of furans next to the acceptor termini leads to better photostability, well&#8208;balanced hole/electron transport, and significantly improved device performance. Methylfuran as the linker offers the best photostability and power conversion efficiency (&gt;14&#8201;%), outperforming all furan&#8208;based acceptors reported to date and all indacenodithiophene&#8208;based acceptors. Our findings show the possibility of photostable furan&#8208;based alternatives to the currently omnipresent thiophene&#8208;based photovoltaic materials.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Corrole Radicals by Polycyclic Aromatic Fusion: Towards Open&#8208;Shell Near&#8208;Infrared Materials for Efficient Photothermal Therapy</title>

Highly stable &#960;&#8208;extended nickel corrole radicals and their cations exhibiting superior absorbing capacities across the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region are synthesized via the radial fusion of aromatic rings. The nanoparticles encapsulating corrole radicals are high&#8208;performance photothermal agents and enable efficient NIR&#8208;triggered photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy in vivo.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell radicals are promising near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal agents (PTAs) owing to their easily accessible narrow band gaps, but their stabilization and functionalization remain challenging. Herein, highly stable &#960;&#8208;extended nickel corrole radicals with [4n+1] &#960; systems are synthesized and used to prepare NIR&#8208;absorbing PTAs for efficient phototheranostics. The light&#8208;harvesting ability of corrole radicals gradually improves as the number of fused benzene rings on &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic locations increases radially, with naphthalene&#8208; and anthracene&#8208;fused radicals and their one&#8208;electron oxidized [4n] &#960; cations exhibiting panchromatic visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorption. The extremely low doublet excited states of corrole radicals promote heat generation via nonradiative decay. By encapsulating naphthocorrole radicals with amphiphilic polymer, water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles Na&#8208;NPs are produced, which exhibit outstanding photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency of 71.8&#8201;%. In vivo anti&#8208;tumor therapy results indicate that Na&#8208;NPs enable photoacoustic imaging of tumors and act as biocompatible PTAs for tumor ablation when triggered by 808&#8197;nm laser light. The &#8220;aromatic&#8208;ring fusion&#8221; strategy for energy&#8208;gap tuning of corrole radicals opens a new platform for developing robust NIR&#8208;absorbing photothermal materials.

         <title>A Fixable Fluorescence&#8208;Quenched Substrate for Quantitation of Lysosomal Glucocerebrosidase Activity in Both Live and Fixed Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescence&#8208;quenched substrate for glucocerebrosidase that can be conveniently fixed using standard conditions enables quantitative measurement of enzyme activity within lysosomes in both live and fixed cells, as well as antibody co&#8208;staining of cellular proteins.







Abstract
Fluorogenic substrates are emerging tools that enable studying enzymatic processes within their native cellular environments. However, fluorogenic substrates that function within live cells are generally incompatible with cellular fixation, preventing their tandem application with fundamental cell biology methods such as immunocytochemistry. Here we report a simple approach to enable the chemical fixation of a dark&#8208;to&#8208;light substrate, LysoFix&#8208;GBA, which enables quantification of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity in both live and fixed cells. LysoFix&#8208;GBA enables measuring responses to both chemical and genetic perturbations to lysosomal GCase activity. Further, LysoFix&#8208;GBA permits simple multiplexed co&#8208;localization studies of GCase activity with subcellular protein markers. This tool will aid studying the role of GCase activity in Parkinson's Disease, creating new therapeutic approaches targeting the GCase pathway. This approach also lays the foundation for an approach to create fixable substrates for other lysosomal enzymes.

         <title>Searching the Chemical Space of Bicyclic Dienes for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage Candidates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Illustration of the relative speed with which a large chemical space of bicyclic dienes can be screened for molecular solar thermal energy storage candidates. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is as illustrated not a feasible route due to computational cost, while extended tight binding (xTB) methods are much faster and can give estimates.







Abstract
Photoswitches are molecular systems that are chemically transformed subsequent to interaction with light and they find potential application in many new technologies. The design and discovery of photoswitch candidates require intricate molecular engineering of a range of properties to optimize a candidate to a specific applications, a task which can be tackled efficiently using quantum chemical screening procedures. In this paper, we perform a large scale screening of approximately half a million bicyclic diene photoswitches in the context of molecular solar thermal energy storage using ab initio quantum chemical methods. We further device an efficient strategy for scoring the systems based on their predicted solar energy conversion efficiency and elucidate potential pitfalls of this approach. Our search through the chemical space of bicyclic dienes reveals systems with unprecedented solar energy conversion efficiencies and storage densities that show promising design guidelines for next generation molecular solar thermal energy storage systems.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Batrachotoxin Enabled by a Pd/Ag&#8208;Promoted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Batrachotoxin is an extremely potent cardio&#8208; and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid. Its 6/6/6/5&#8208;membered carbocyclic framework is functionalized with two double bonds, a six&#8208;membered hemiacetal, a seven&#8208;membered oxazepane, and a dimethylpyrrolecarboxy group. By a novel and simple convergent strategy involving Pd/Ag&#8208;promoted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling and Dieckmann condensation reactions, the total synthesis of batrachotoxin was realized in 22 steps.







Abstract
Batrachotoxin is an extremely potent cardio&#8208; and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid found in certain species of frogs, birds, and beetles. The steroidal 6/6/6/5&#8208;membered carbocycle (ABCD&#8208;ring) is U&#8208;shaped and functionalized with two double bonds, a six&#8208;membered C3&#8208;hemiacetal across the AB&#8208;ring, a seven&#8208;membered oxazepane on the CD&#8208;ring, and a dimethylpyrrolecarboxy group at the D&#8208;ring carbon chain.

&lt;p&gt;Batrachotoxin is an extremely potent cardio- and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid. Its 6/6/6/5-membered carbocyclic framework is functionalized with two double bonds, a six-membered hemiacetal, a seven-membered oxazepane, and a dimethylpyrrolecarboxy group. By a novel and simple convergent strategy involving Pd/Ag-promoted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling and Dieckmann condensation reactions, the total synthesis of batrachotoxin was realized in 22 steps.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batrachotoxin is an extremely potent cardio- and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid found in certain species of frogs, birds, and beetles. The steroidal 6/6/6/5-membered carbocycle (ABCD-ring) is U-shaped and functionalized with two double bonds, a six-membered C3-hemiacetal across the AB-ring, a seven-membered oxazepane on the CD-ring, and a dimethylpyrrolecarboxy group at the D-ring carbon chain. These structural features present an unusual and formidable synthetic challenge. Herein we report a total synthesis of batrachotoxin based on a newly devised convergent strategy through a 22-step sequence. Enantiopure AB-ring and D-ring fragments were prepared and subjected to a crucial C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coupling reaction. Although both C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) centers were sterically encumbered by proximal tetrasubstituted carbon atoms, Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O strongly promoted the Pd(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction at room temperature, thereby connecting the two fragments without damaging their preexisting functionalities. Subsequent treatment with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-BuOK induced Dieckmann condensation to cyclize the C-ring. The judiciously optimized functionalizations realized oxazepane formation, carbon chain extension, and pyrrole carboxylic acid condensation to deliver batrachotoxin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Transition of Electrochemical Water Oxidation Mechanism Induced by Heteroatom Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by using P and S&#8208;doped Ni&#8722;Fe mixed oxides as model catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we discover that heteroatom doping triggers the OER mechanism transition from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM) by enlarging metal&#8208;oxygen covalency.







Abstract
Heteroatom doping has emerged as a highly effective strategy to enhance the activity of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is widely accepted that the doping does not switch the OER mechanism from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM), and the enhanced activity is attributed to the optimized binding energies toward oxygen intermediates. However, this seems inconsistent with the fact that the overpotential of doped OER electrocatalysts (&lt;300&#8197;mV) is considerably smaller than the limit of AEM (&gt;370&#8197;mV). To determine the origin of this inconsistency, we select phosphorus (P)&#8208;doped nickel&#8208;iron mixed oxides as the model electrocatalysts and observe that the doping enhances the covalency of the metal&#8208;oxygen bonds to drive the OER pathway transition from the AEM to the LOM, thereby breaking the adsorption linear relation between *OH and *OOH in the AEM. Consequently, the obtained P&#8208;doped oxides display a small overpotential of 237&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Beyond P, the similar pathway transition is also observed on the sulfur doping. These findings offer new insights into the substantially enhanced OER activity originating from heteroatom doping.

         <title>Dearomatization of (Hetero)arenes through Photodriven Interplay between Polysulfide Anions and Formate
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic protocol was developed for the dearomatization of substituted naphthalenes, indoles, and related heteroaromatic compounds through a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism induced by single&#8208;electron transfer from photoexcited polysulfide anions in the presence of methanol. The catalytic turnover is maintained by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer between polysulfide radical anions and formate.







Abstract
The facile construction of C(sp3)&#8208;rich carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic compounds is a pivotal synthetic strategy to foster contemporary drug discovery programs. The downstream dearomatization of readily accessible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) planar arenes represents a direct pathway towards accessing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) aliphatic scaffolds. Here, we demonstrate that polysulfide anions are capable of catalyzing a dearomatization process of substituted naphthalenes, indoles, and other related heteroaromatic compounds in the presence of potassium formate and methanol under visible light irradiation. The developed protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, scalability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, representing a practical and sustainable synthetic tool for the arene dearomatization.

         <title>An Ultrathin Inorganic Molecular Crystal Interfacial Layer for Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic molecular crystalline Sb2O3 film with an ultrathin thickness of 10&#8197;nm serves as an effective protection layer for Zn anodes to enable uniform under&#8208;layer Zn deposition with suppressed side reaction and tip growth effect, achieving a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan over 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
Zn metal anode suffers from dendrite growth and side reactions during cycling, significantly deteriorating the lifespan of aqueous Zn metal batteries. Herein, we introduced an ultrathin and ultra&#8208;flat Sb2O3 molecular crystal layer to stabilize Zn anode. The in situ optical and atomic force microscopes observations show that such a 10&#8197;nm Sb2O3 thin layer could ensure uniform under&#8208;layer Zn deposition with suppressed tip growth effect, while the traditional WO3 layer undergoes an uncontrolled up&#8208;layer Zn deposition. The superior regulation capability is attributed to the good electronic&#8208;blocking ability and low Zn affinity of the molecular crystal layer, free of dangling bonds. Electrochemical tests exhibit Sb2O3 layer can significantly improve the cycle life of Zn anode from 72&#8197;h to 2800&#8197;h, in contrast to the 900&#8197;h of much thicker WO3 even in 100&#8197;nm. This research opens up the application of inorganic molecular crystals as the interfacial layer of Zn anode.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembled J&#8208;Aggregate Nanofibers of Glycosylated Aza&#8208;BODIPY for Synergetic Cell Membrane Disruption and Type&#8197;I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a lactosylated Aza&#8208;BODIPY compound that self&#8208;assembles in situ to form J&#8208;aggregate nanofibers acting as type&#8197;I photosensitizers. The J&#8208;aggregate nanofibers exhibited remarkable superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;.) generation efficiency, the ability to damage the tumor cell membrane, and long&#8208;term retention at tumor sites. This efficient synergistic therapeutic effect was confirmed in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
The in situ self&#8208;assembly of exogenous molecules is a powerful strategy for manipulating cellular behavior. However, the direct self&#8208;assembly of photochemically inert constituents into supramolecular nano&#8208;photosensitizers (PSs) within cancer cells for precise photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a glycosylated Aza&#8208;BODIPY compound (LMBP) capable of self&#8208;assembling into J&#8208;aggregate nanofibers in situ for cell membrane destruction and type&#8197;I PDT. LMBP selectively entered human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and subsequently self&#8208;assembled into intracellular J&#8208;aggregate nanovesicles and nanofibers through supramolecular interactions. Detailed studies revealed that these J&#8208;aggregate nanostructures generated superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;&#8901;) exclusively through photoinduced electron transfer, thus enabling effective PDT. Furthermore, the intracellular nanofibers exhibited an aggregation&#8208;induced retention effect, which resulted in selective toxicity to HepG2 cells by disrupting their cellular membranes and synergizing with PDT for powerful tumor suppression efficacy in vivo.

         <title>Pushing the Upper Limit of Nucleophilicity Scales by Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) was synthesized and their reactions with Michael acceptors and CO2 investigated. The outstandingly high nucleophilicities of mNHOs were determined by kinetic measurements and located on the Mayr scale where they belong to the strongest carbon nucleophiles reported to date.







Abstract
A series of mesoionic, 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs), which have an extraordinarily electron&#8208;rich exocyclic CC&#8208;double bond, was synthesized and spectroscopically characterized, in selected cases by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The kinetics of their reactions with arylidene malonates, ArCH=C(CO2Et)2, which gave zwitterionic adducts, were investigated photometrically in THF at 20&#8201;&#176;C. The resulting second&#8208;order rate constants k2(20&#8201;&#176;C) correlate linearly with the reported electrophilicity parameters E of the arylidene malonates (reference electrophiles), thus providing the nucleophile&#8208;specific N and sN parameters of the mNHOs according to the correlation lg k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E). With 21&lt;N&lt;32, the mNHOs are much stronger nucleophiles than conventional NHOs. Some mNHOs even excel the reactivity of mono&#8208; and diacceptor&#8208;substituted carbanions. It is exemplarily shown that the reactivity parameters thus obtained allow to calculate the rate constants for mNHO reactions with further Michael acceptors and predict the scope of reactions with other electrophilic reaction partners including carbon dioxide, which gives zwitterionic mNHO&#8208;carboxylates. The nucleophilicity parameters N correlate linearly with a linear combination of the quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl cation affinities and buried volumes of mNHOs, which offers a valuable tool to tailor the reactivities of strong carbon nucleophiles.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of Bi&#8208;Functionalized Porphyrins: A Novel Class of Hole&#8208;Layer&#8208;Coordinating Perovskites and Indium Tin Oxide in Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a series of new self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) based on ZnII porphyrin for use as hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Our study successfully demonstrates the superior performance of dual carboxylic acid functionalized porphyrins can boost the solar efficiency of PSCs. The outstanding performance of these porphyrin SAMs lies in their inherent self&#8208;assembled properties and the presence of dual carboxylic acid groups that facilitate effective anchoring to both the ITO surface and perovskites.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) offer the advantage of facile interfacial modification, leading to significant improvements in device performance. In this study, we report the design and synthesis of a new series of carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized porphyrin derivatives, namely AC&#8208;1, AC&#8208;3, and AC&#8208;5, and present, for the first time, a strategy to exploit the large &#960;&#8208;moiety of porphyrins as a backbone for interfacing the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and perovskite active layer in an inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) configuration. The electron&#8208;rich nature of porphyrins facilitates hole transfer and the formation of SAMs, resulting in a dense surface that minimizes defects. Comprehensive spectroscopic and dynamic studies demonstrate that the double&#8208;anchored AC&#8208;3 and AC&#8208;5 enhance SAMs on ITO, passivate the perovskite layer, and function as conduits to facilitate hole transfer, thus significantly boosting the performance of PSCs. The champion inverted PSC employing AC&#8208;5 SAM achieves an impressive solar efficiency of 23.19&#8201;% with a high fill factor of 84.05&#8201;%. This work presents a novel molecular engineering strategy for functionalizing SAMs to tune the energy levels, molecular dipoles, packing orientations to achieve stable and efficient solar performance. Importantly, our comprehensive investigation has unraveled the associated mechanisms, offering valuable insights for future advancements in PSCs.

         <title>Dynamically Restructuring NixCryO Electrocatalyst for Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Real Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a NixCryO electrocatalyst that can dynamically restructure itself during the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and increase its porosity by Cr leaching. The enhancement of porosity improved electrolyte penetration and boosted electronic interaction between OH&#8722; and active sites, resulting in 2000, 275, and 100&#8197;h stability at 10, 100, and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, in real seawater.







Abstract
In the pursuit of long&#8208;term stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater, retaining the intrinsic catalytic activity is essential but has remained challenging. Herein, we developed a NixCryO electrocatalyst that manifested exceptional OER stability in alkaline condition while improving the activity over time by dynamic self&#8208;restructuring. In 1&#8197;M KOH, NixCryO required overpotentials of only 270 and 320&#8197;mV to achieve current densities of 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, with excellent long&#8208;term stability exceeding 475&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 280&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The combination of electrochemical measurements and in situ studies revealed that leaching and redistribution of Cr during the prolonged electrolysis resulted in increased electrochemically active surface area. This eventually enhanced the catalyst porosity and improved OER activity. NixCryO was further applied in real seawater from the Red Sea (without purification, 1&#8197;M KOH added), envisaging that the dynamically evolving porosity can offset the adverse active site&#8208;blocking effect posed by the seawater impurities. Remarkably, NixCryO exhibited stable operation for 2000, 275 and 100&#8197;h in seawater at 10, 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The proposed catalyst and the mechanistic insights represented a step towards realization of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based direct seawater splitting.

         <title>Ferricyanide Armed Anodes Enable Stable Water Oxidation in Saturated Saline Water at 2 A/cm2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous saline water electrolysis increases the concentration of Cl&#8722;, leading to severe anode corrosion. In this work, we have developed the anodes that could efficiently catalyze water oxidation in alkaline saturated saline water at ultra&#8208;high current densities up to 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over hundreds of hours. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most stable brine oxidation electrodes reported to date.







Abstract
The direct seawater electrolysis at high current density and low overpotential affords an effective strategy toward clean and renewable hydrogen fuel production. However, the severe corrosion of anode as a result of the saturation of Cl&#8722; upon continuous seawater feeding seriously hamper the electrolytic process. Herein, cobalt ferricyanide / cobalt phosphide (CoFePBA/Co2P) anodes with Cap/Pin structure are synthesized, which stably catalyze alkaline saturated saline water oxidation at 200&#8211;2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over hundreds of hours without corrosion. Together with the experimental findings, the molecular dynamics simulations reveal that PO43&#8722; and Fe(CN)63&#8722; generated by the electrode play synergistic role in repelling Cl&#8722; via electrostatic repulsion and dense coverage, which reduced Cl&#8722; adsorption by nearly 5&#8208;fold. The novel anionic synergy endow superior corrosion protection for the electrode, and is expected to promote the practical application of saline water electrolysis.

Herein, cobalt ferricyanide / cobalt phosphide (CoFePBA/Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P) anodes with Cap/Pin structure are synthesized, which stably catalyze alkaline saturated saline water oxidation at 200&#8211;2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over hundreds of hours without corrosion. Together with the experimental findings, the molecular dynamics simulations reveal that PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; generated by the electrode play synergistic role in repelling Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; via electrostatic repulsion and dense coverage, which reduced Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption by nearly 5-fold. The novel anionic synergy endow superior corrosion protection for the electrode, and is expected to promote the practical application of saline water electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charging Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes by Incorporating Crown Ethers to Capture Cations for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charging metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane realizes charge inversion from negative to positive by including crown ethers to capture cations. The result is enhanced Li+/Mg2+ selectivity. The improved Li+/Mg2+ selectivity is associated with the expanding of energy&#8208;barrier deviation between Li+ and Mg2+ caused by the steric effect and the electrostatic repulsion.







Abstract
Protein channels on the biofilm conditionally manipulate ion transport via regulating the distribution of charge residues, making analogous processes on artificial membranes a hot spot and challenge. Here, we employ metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) membrane with charge&#8208;adjustable subnano&#8208;channel to selectively govern ion transport. Various valent ions are binded with crown ethers embedded in the MOF cavity, which act as charged guest to regulate the channels&#8217; charge state from the negativity to positivity. Compared with the negatively charged channel, the positive counterpart obviously enhances Li+/Mg2+ selectivity, which benefit from the reinforcement of the electrostatic repulsion between ions and the channel. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations reveal that Mg2+ transport through the more positively charged channel needed to overcome higher entrance energy barrier than that of Li+. This work provides a subtle strategy for ion&#8208;selective transport upon regulating the charge state of insulating membrane, which paves the way for the application like seawater desalination and lithium extraction from salt lakes.

         <title>Room Temperature Anhydrous Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Polymerization Enabled by C&#8722;S Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anhydrous room temperature CAS&#8208;Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction between (hetero)aryl boronic esters and aryl sulfides was explored, of which universality was exemplified with thirty small molecules and twelve alternating conjugated polymers. Mechanism studies revealed the importance of room temperature and anhydrous condition in reducing the homocoupling defects and enhancing the optoelectronic properties of the conjugated polymers.







Abstract
The Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most important and powerful methods for constructing C&#8722;C bonds. However, the protodeboronation of arylboronic acids hinder the development of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling in the precise synthesis of conjugated polymers (CPs). Here, an anhydrous room temperature Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction between (hetero)aryl boronic esters and aryl sulfides was explored, of which universality was exemplified by thirty small molecules and twelve CPs. Meanwhile, the mechanistic studies involving with capturing four coordinated borate intermediate revealed the direct transmetalation of boronic esters in the absence of H2O suppressing the protodeboronation. Additionally, the room temperature reaction significantly reduced the homocoupling defects and enhanced the optoelectronic properties of the CPs. In all, this work provides a green protocol to synthesize alternating CPs.

         <title>Introducing Spiro&#8208;locks into the Nitrogen/Carbonyl System towards Efficient Narrowband Deep&#8208;blue Multi&#8208;resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various spiro&#8208;locks were introduced into the nitrogen/carbonyl&#8208;based multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) system via a designed synthetic route. The introduction of spiro&#8208;locks increased molecular rigidity and suppressed intermolecular interactions. Thus, narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence spectra and improved device efficiencies were achieved simultaneously.







Abstract
The current availability of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with excellent color purity and high device efficiency in the deep&#8208;blue region is appealing. To address this issue in the emerged nitrogen/carbonyl MR&#8208;TADF system, we propose a spiro&#8208;lock strategy. By incorporating spiro functionalization into a concise molecular skeleton, a series of emitters (SFQ, SOQ, SSQ, and SSeQ) can enhance molecular rigidity, blue&#8208;shift the emission peak, narrow the emission band, increase the photoluminescence quantum yield by over 92&#8201;%, and suppress intermolecular interactions in the film state. The referent CZQ without spiro structure has a more planar skeleton, and its bluer emission in the solution state redshifts over 40&#8197;nm with serious spectrum broadening and a low PLQY in the film state. As a result, SSQ achieves an external quantum efficiency of 25.5&#8201;% with a peak at 456&#8197;nm and a small full width at half maximum of 31&#8197;nm in a simple unsensitized device, significantly outperforming CZQ. This work discloses the importance of spiro&#8208;junction in modulating deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

We report a solvent&#8208;controlled rhodium&#8208;catalyzed tunable arylation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene, which allows the synthesis of monofluoroalkenes and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes from readily available feedstocks. This study provides a useful strategy for the divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds and sheds light on the importance of solvent selection in catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds starting from a suite of raw materials is an intriguing topic. Herein, we report the solvent&#8208;controlled rhodium&#8208;catalyzed tunable arylation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene. The selection of the reaction solvents provides switchable defluorinated or debrominated arylation from readily available feedstock resources (both arylboronic acids/esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene are commercially available). This switch is feasible because of the difference in coordination ability between the solvent (CH2Cl2 or CH3CN) and the rhodium center, resulting in different olefin insertion. This protocol allows the convenient synthesis of monofluoroalkenes and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, both of which are important scaffolds in the fields of medicine and materials. Moreover, this newly developed solvent&#8208;regulated reaction system can be applied to the site&#8208;selective dechlorinated arylation of trichloroethylene. Overall, this study provides a useful strategy for the divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds and provides insight into the importance of solvent selection in catalytic reactions.

         <title>Continuous Flow Electrochemistry Enables Practical and Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a practical and cost&#8208;efficient electrochemical method for the highly selective monooxygenation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using continuous flow reactors. The electrochemical method demonstrates excellent scope and scalability by producing 115&#8197;g of one of the alcohol products.







Abstract
The selective oxygenation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds remains a highly sought&#8208;after method in both academia and the chemical industry for constructing functionalized organic molecules. However, it is extremely challenging to selectively oxidize a certain C(sp3)&#8722;H bond to afford alcohols due to the presence of multiple C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with similar strength and steric environment in organic molecules, and the alcohol products being prone to further oxidation. Herein, we present a practical and cost&#8208;efficient electrochemical method for the highly selective monooxygenation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using continuous flow reactors. The electrochemical reactions produce trifluoroacetate esters that are resistant to further oxidation but undergo facile hydrolysis during aqueous workup to form benzylic alcohols. The method exhibits a broad scope and exceptional site selectivity and requires no catalysts or chemical oxidants. Furthermore, the electrochemical method demonstrates excellent scalability by producing 115&#8197;g of one of the alcohol products. The high site selectivity of the electrochemical method originates from its unique mechanism to cleave benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds through sequential electron/proton transfer, rather than the commonly employed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT).

         <title>Electroreductive Radical Borylation of Unactivated (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides Without Light by Using Cumulene&#8208;Based Redox Mediators
</title>

         <dc:description>
Electrochemically promoted functionalization of unactivated chloroarenes without light is achieved by using novel tetraarylcumulene&#8208;based redox mediators.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) plays a critical role in many chemical processes, from organic synthesis to environmental remediation. However, the selective reduction of inert substrates (Ep/2&lt;&#8722;2&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+), such as ubiquitous electron&#8208;neutral and electron&#8208;rich (hetero)aryl chlorides, remains a major challenge. Current approaches largely rely on catalyst photoexcitation to reach the necessary deeply reducing potentials or suffer from limited substrate scopes. Herein, we demonstrate that cumulenes&#8211;organic molecules with multiple consecutive double bonds&#8211;can function as catalytic redox mediators for the electroreductive radical borylation of (hetero)aryl chlorides at relatively mild cathodic potentials (approximately &#8722;1.9&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl) without the need for photoirradiation. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational studies support that step&#8208;wise electron transfer from reduced cumulenes to electron&#8208;neutral chloroarenes is followed by thermodynamically favorable mesolytic cleavage of the aryl radical anion to generate the desired aryl radical intermediate. Our findings will guide the development of other sustainable, purely electroreductive radical transformations of inert molecules using organic redox mediators.

         <title>The Power of Action Plots: Unveiling Reaction Selectivity of Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of action plots is demonstrated by unveiling a reaction selective window between two different substituted triazolinediones that exhibit near identical absorbance spectra. The remarkable difference in photoreactivity is exploited by designing a dual&#8208;gated reaction manifold, which demonstrates the site&#8208;selective (photo)chemical behavior of both triazolinedione substrates within a single small molecule.







Abstract
Exploiting the optimum wavelength of reactivity for efficient photochemical reactions has been well&#8208;established based on the development of photochemical action plots. We herein demonstrate the power of such action plots by a remarkable example of the wavelength&#8208;resolved photochemistry of two triazolinedione (TAD) substrates, i.e., aliphatic and aromatic substituted, that exhibit near identical absorption spectra yet possess vastly disparate photoreactivity. We present our findings in carefully recorded action plots, from which reaction selectivity is identified. The profound difference in photoreactivity is exploited by designing a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; bisfunctional TAD molecule, enabling the formation of a dual&#8208;gated reaction manifold that demonstrates the exceptional and site&#8208;selective (photo)chemical behavior of both TAD substrates within a single small molecule.

         <title>Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization for the Modular Synthesis of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Vinylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization for the regio&#8208; and atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones. The catalysis system was achieved by means of asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis which afforded trisubstituted as well as E&#8208; and Z&#8208;tetrasubstituted N&#8208;vinylquinazolinone atropisomers, respectively.







Abstract
Axially chiral N&#8208;substituted quinazolinones are important bioactive molecules, which are presented in many synthetic drugs. However, most strategies toward their atroposelective synthesis are mainly limited to the axially chiral arylquinazolinone frameworks. The development of modular synthetic methods to access diverse quinazolinone&#8208;based atropisomers remains scarce and challenging. Herein, we report the regio&#8208; and atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones via the strategy of asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization. The catalysis system utilized both asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis to efficiently afford trisubstituted and tetrasubstituted N&#8208;vinylquinazolinone atropisomers, respectively. With the meticulous design of &#946;&#8208;substituted allylic substrates, both Z&#8208; and E&#8208;tetrasubstituted axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones were obtained in good yields and high enantioselectivities.

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe for Investigating the Role of Biothiols in Signaling Pathways Associated with Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe for crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier was constructed via a rational molecular design strategy. The probe allowed the investigation of the biothiol&#8208;mediated nuclear factor kappa&#8208;light&#8208;chain&#8208;enhancer of activated B cells (NF&#8208;&#954;B) signaling pathway in cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury mice models.







Abstract
Cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (CIRI) is intimately associated with the redox regulation of biothiol, a crucial antioxidant marker that precludes the onset of ROS. We designed a novel fluorescent probe, DCI&#8208;Ac&#8208;Py, showing various physicochemical properties, such as high selectivity, exceptional signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) optical window, and blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetrability, for detecting biothiols in the brain. The picolinate serves as a specific recognition group that is rapidly activated by biothiol and undergoes nucleophilic substitution with the adjacent acrylic ester to yield the desired NIR probe. Additionally, the probe's lipid solubility is improved through the inclusion of halogen atoms, which aids in penetrating the BBB. Using DCI&#8208;Ac&#8208;Py, we investigated changes of biothiols in vivo in the brains of mice during CIRI. We found that biothiol&#8208;mediated NF&#8208;kB classical (P65&#8208;related) and nonclassical (RelB&#8208;related) pathways contribute to abundant ROS production induced by CIRI and that biothiols are involved in redox regulation. These findings provide new insights into the study of CIRI and shed light on the physiological and pathological mechanisms of biothiols in the brain.

Using &lt;b&gt;DCI-Ac-Py&lt;/b&gt;, we investigated changes of biothiols in vivo in the brains of mice during CIRI. We found that biothiol-mediated NF-kB classical (P65-related) and nonclassical (RelB-related) pathways contribute to abundant ROS production induced by CIRI and that biothiols are involved in redox regulation. These findings provide new insights into the study of CIRI and shed light on the physiological and pathological mechanisms of biothiols in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Solar&#8208;driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production over Thiazole&#8208;based Conjugated Polymers via Generating and Converting Singlet Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that singlet oxygen (1O2) can react with benzobisthiazole&#8208;based photocatalysts via [4+2] cycloaddition, leading to the formation of endoperoxide intermediate species, which promotes the separation of charge carriers and reduces the barrier for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. The H2O2 production rate of the catalyst is as high as 7274&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water in air.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air provides a low&#8208;cost and eco&#8208;friendly alternative route to the traditional anthraquinone method. Herein, four thiazole&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Tz&#8208;CPs: TTz, BTz, TBTz and BBTz) are synthesized via aldimine condensation. BBTz exhibits the highest H2O2 production rate of 7274&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water. Further, the reaction path is analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) and theoretical calculation, highlighting the prominent role of singlet oxygen (1O2). The generation of 1O2 occurs through the oxidation of superoxide radical (&#8901;O2&#8722;) and subsequent conversion into endoperoxides via [4+2] cycloaddition over BBTz, which promotes charge separation and reduces the barrier for H2O2 production. This work provides new insight into the mechanism of photocatalytic O2 reduction and the molecular design of superior single&#8208;polymer photocatalysts.

         <title>Triple&#8208;function Hydrated Eutectic Electrolyte for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;function eutectic electrolyte is designed by introducing tetramethylene sulfone (TMS) as hydrogen bond acceptor. The preferentially adsorbed TMS on the Zn surface provides a shielding buffer layer to retard the sedimentation and suppress dendrite growth. TMS modulates the primary solvation shell of Zn2+ to realize a novel solvent co&#8208;intercalation situation, and the intercalated TMS remains in the cathode as a &#8220;pillar&#8221; to stabilize the structure.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZBs) are impeded by the mutual problems of unstable cathode, electrolyte parasitic reactions, and dendritic growth of zinc (Zn) anode. Herein, a triple&#8208;functional strategy by introducing the tetramethylene sulfone (TMS) to form a hydrated eutectic electrolyte is reported to ameliorate these issues. The activity of H2O is inhibited by reconstructing hydrogen bonds due to the strong interaction between TMS and H2O. Meanwhile, the preferentially adsorbed TMS on the Zn surface increases the thickness of double electric layer (EDL) structure, which provides a shielding buffer layer to suppress dendrite growth. Interestingly, TMS modulates the primary solvation shell of Zn2+ ultimately to achieve a novel solvent co&#8208;intercalation ((Zn&#8208;TMS)2+) mechanism, and the intercalated TMS works as a &#8220;pillar&#8221; that provides more zincophilic sites and stabilizes the structure of cathode (NH4V4O10, (NVO)). Consequently, the Zn||NVO battery exhibits a remarkably high specific capacity of 515.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a low current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for over 40&#8197;days. This multi&#8208;functional electrolytes and solvent co&#8208;intercalation mechanism will significantly propel the practical development of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Isoreticular Preparation of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based Multicomponent Metallacages towards Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isoreticular tetraphenylethylene(TPE)&#8208;based multicomponent metallacages were prepared using TPE derivatives as the faces and different tetracarboxylic ligands as the pillars. The integration of TPE&#8208;based photosensitizers and open Re catalytic sites into a single metallacage promoted the directional electron transfer within the metallacage, offering good photocatalytic hydrogen production performance.







Abstract
Multicomponent metallacages can integrate the functions of their different building blocks to achieve synergetic effects for advanced applications. Herein, based on metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, we report the preparation of a series of isoreticular tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based metallacages, which are well characterized by multinuclear NMR, ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The suitable integration of photosensitizing tetraphenylethylene units as faces and Re catalytic complexes as the pillars into a single metallacage offers a high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 1707&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is one of the highest values among reported metallacages. Femtosecond transient absorption and DFT calculations reveal that the metallacage can serve as a platform for the precise and organized arrangement of the two building blocks, enabling efficient and directional electron transfer for highly efficient photocatalytic performance. This study provides a general strategy to integrate multifunctional ligands into a certain metallacage to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production, which will guide the future design of metallacages towards photocatalysis.

         <title>Polymeric Carbon Nitride with Chirality Inherited from Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;scale synthesis of chiral polymeric carbon nitride (CN) powder and electrode capable of enantioselective recognition from chiral supramolecular assemblies as monomers is reported. The optimized chiral CN exhibits good chiral recognition for tartaric acid, with an enantioselective preference of ca. 14&#8201;% for the D enantiomer.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of chiral materials is of paramount importance for various applications. Supramolecular preorganization of monomers for thermal polymerization has been proven as an effective tool to synthesize carbon and carbon nitride&#8208;based (CN) materials with ordered morphology and controlled properties. However, the transfer of an intrinsic chemical property, such as chirality from supramolecular assemblies to the final material after thermal condensation, was not shown. Here, we report the large&#8208;scale synthesis of chiral CN materials capable of enantioselective recognition. To achieve this, we designed supramolecular assemblies with a chiral center that remains intact at elevated temperatures. The optimized chiral CN demonstrates an enantiomeric preference of ca. 14&#8201;%; CN electrodes were also prepared and show stereoselective interactions with enantiomeric probes in electrochemical measurements. By adding chirality to the properties transferrable from monomers to the final product of a thermal polymerization, this study confirms the potential of using supramolecular precursors to produce carbon and CN materials and electrodes with designed chemical properties.

         <title>Janus&#8208;Type ESIPT Chromophores with Distinctive Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;bonding Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophores with distinctive hydrogen bonding selectivity between competitive hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) were reported. Single&#8208;crystal structures and theoretical studies unveiled the molecular origins of the biased intramolecular hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) and their impact on the ESIPT process. This Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophore skeleton provides new opportunities for the design of solid luminescent materials.







Abstract
Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)&#8208;based solid luminescent materials with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) remain unexplored. Herein, we introduced a family of Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophores featuring distinctive hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) selectivity between competitive HBAs in a single molecule. Our investigations showed that the central hydroxyl group preferentially forms intramolecular H&#8208;bonds with imines in imine&#8208;modified 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzothiazole (HBT) chromophores but tethers the benzothiazole moiety in hydrazone&#8208;modified HBT chromophores. Imine&#8208;derived HBTs generally exhibit higher fluorescence efficiency, while hydrazone&#8208;derived HBTs show a reduced overlap between the absorption and fluorescence bands. Quantum chemical calculations unveiled the molecular origins of the biased intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and their impact on the ESIPT process. This Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophore skeleton provides new opportunities for the design of solid luminescent materials.

Chemical upcycling of high&#8208;density polyethylene at low temperatures remains a significant challenge. In their Research Article (e202305644), Qingyue Wang, Pingwei Liu and co&#8208;workers report a two&#8208;dimensional platinum&#8208;anchored tungsten trioxide catalyst with abundant vacancies and acidic sites that converts polyethylene effectively to fuel. A quasi&#8208;operando spectroscopic study reveals that polymer chains are activated by forming olefinic intermediates, and then hydrocracked by the dissociated hydrogen&#160;on two&#8208;dimensional catalyst&#160;to form fuel alkanes.

The oxygen looping approach &#8230;. &#8230;, a potential scale&#8208;flexible methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion process, has been a focus of research for over a decade. Such a process would be essential to avoid the flaring of methane at remote oil exploitation sites, where methane emerges as an associated gas. Using a novel screening methodology, in their Research Article (e202305140) Mark A. Newton, Jeroen&#8197;A. van Bokhoven et&#8197;al. show the significant potential that copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega exhibits for such a looping process.

         <title>Liquids with Permanent Macroporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tao Li and co&#8208;workers reported a material based on metal&#8211;organic framework nanocrystals which contains the largest reported permanent pores for a liquid. They described the CO2 and water adsorption, as well as the thermal switching properties of the porous liquid. This is the first example of a dual micro&#8208;macroporous liquid created using design rules of hierarchical porosity.







Abstract
Permanent macropores (&gt;50&#8197;nm) had not been reported in the liquid state until a recent report by Tao Li and co&#8208;workers describing a synthetic strategy to form a porous liquid with dual micro&#8208;macroporosity. This is prepared by producing hierarchically porous particles that are surface coated and fluidised by dispersion. Surface micropores enable permanent porosity by steric exclusion of the fluid phase. The material has a considerable water uptake capacity (27&#8201;% w/w) due to large (480&#8197;nm) unoccupied macropores. This also enables switching of thermal conductivity on uptake of water. These are new properties translated from porous solids to the liquid state.

         <title>Non&#8208;activated Esters as Reactive Handles in Direct Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of non&#8208;activated esters represents interesting opportunities in polymer science. While early attempts indicated severe synthetic challenges in this area, recently several researchers have made significant progress, thus enabling structural diversification and synthetic upcycling of various polymers. This review summarizes this progress, and highlights unique structural features that can be exploited in a macromolecular context.







Abstract
Non&#8208;activated esters are prominently featured functional groups in polymer science, as ester functional monomers display great structural diversity and excellent compatibility with a wide range of polymerization mechanisms. Yet, their direct use as a reactive handle in post&#8208;polymerization modification has been typically avoided due to their low reactivity, which impairs the quantitative conversion typically desired in post&#8208;polymerization modification reactions. While activated ester approaches are a well&#8208;established alternative, the modification of non&#8208;activated esters remains a synthetic and economically valuable opportunity. In this review, we discuss past and recent efforts in the utilization of non&#8208;activated ester groups as a reactive handle to facilitate transesterification and aminolysis/amidation reactions, and the potential of the developed methodologies in the context of macromolecular engineering.

         <title>Nascent Proteomics: Chemical Tools for Monitoring Newly Synthesized Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nascent proteomics selectively analyzes newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) by labeling them with either isotopes or chemical tags, allowing for the detection of rapid changes in translational profiles upon acute biological modulations. Programmable variants of nascent proteomics enable the control of NSP labeling via optical or genetic manipulations, ensuring selectivity towards cell types and/or cellular states.







Abstract
Cellular proteins are dynamically regulated in response to environmental stimuli. Conventional proteomics compares the entire proteome in different cellular states to identify differentially expressed proteins, which suffers from limited sensitivity for analyzing acute and subtle changes. To address this challenge, nascent proteomics has been developed, which selectively analyzes the newly synthesized proteins, thus offering a more sensitive and timely insight into the dynamic changes of the proteome. In this Minireview, we discuss recent advancements in nascent proteomics, with an emphasis on methodological developments. Also, we delve into the current challenges and provide an outlook on the future prospects of this exciting field.

Inspired by paired metal sites in enzymes, dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) were developed as a frontier in heterogeneous catalysis. DACs possess many unique advantages and surpass their counterparts in various catalytic processes. Herein, we summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advancements in synthesis, characterization, structure&#8208;activity relationship of DACs and outlook the future development in this field with combination from computational insights.







Abstract
The pursuit of high metal utilization in heterogeneous catalysis has triggered the burgeoning interest of various atomically dispersed catalysts. Our aim in this review is to assess key recent findings in the synthesis, characterization, structure&#8208;property relationship and computational studies of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), which cover the full spectrum of applications in thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In particular, combination of qualitative and quantitative characterization with cooperation with DFT insights, synergies and superiorities of DACs compare to counterparts, high&#8208;throughput catalyst exploration and screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms are highlighted. Undoubtably, it would be wise to expect more fascinating developments in the field of DACs as tunable catalysts.

         <title>Recoverable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells for Next&#8208;Generation Portable Power Sources</title>

Flexible perovskite solar cells have attracted wide attention because of their unique advantages, such as light weight and high flexibility. This review article discusses the routes toward improvement of the recoverability and environmental stability of flexible perovskite solar cells, and highlights the practical applications. The outlook and challenges of durable flexible perovskite devices in future commercialization are also considered.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) with excellent recoverability show a wide range of potential applications in portable power sources. The recoverability of FPSCs requires outstanding bendability of each functional layer, including the flexible substrates, electrodes, perovskite light absorbers, and charge transport materials. This review highlights the recent progress and practical applications of high&#8208;recoverability FPSCs, and illustrates the routes toward improvement of the recoverability and environmental stability through the choice of flexible substrates and the preparation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films, as well as the optimization of charge&#8208;selective contacts. In addition, we explore the intrinsic properties of each functional layer from the physical perspective and analyze how to select suitable functional layers. Additionally, some effective strategies are summarized, including material modification engineering of selective contacts, additives and interface engineering of interlayers, which can release mechanical stress and increase the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) and recoverability of the FPSCs. The challenges of making high&#8208;performance FPSCs with long&#8208;term stability and high recoverability are discussed. Finally, future applications and perspectives for FPSCs are discussed, aiming to promote more extensive commercialization processes for lightweight and durable FPSCs.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes catalyzed by Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* is developed, affording a series of phosphine derivatives in high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes is reported. It provides a series of phosphine derivatives in high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The methodology enjoys broad substrate scope on both 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes and diarylphosphines. The high stereoselectivity is attributed to both the high stability of the Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* complex in the presence of stoichiometric HPPh2 and the produced phosphines, and the high&#8208;performance asymmetric induction of the Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* complex. Finally, the method is used for the synthesis of new chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin compounds built on a cyclopropane skeleton, one of which serves as a wonderful ligand in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of phenylboronic acid to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Large Pore Apertures and High Surface Areas for NO2 Selective Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) were synthesized via coordination of a new ligand (HAOTP) with metal ions (Ni2+ and Cu2+). The resulting HIOTP&#8208;Ni MOF has a large pore aperture of 3.3&#8197;nm and a high surface area of 1300&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. As a result, it has exceptional performance as a chemiresistive sensor, with a highly selective (405&#8201;%) and rapid response (1.69&#8197;min) towards 10&#8197;ppm NO2 gas.







Abstract
The emergence of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with pronounced electrical properties (e.g., high conductivity) has provided a novel platform for efficient energy storage, sensing, and electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the limited availability of suitable ligands restricts the number of available types of 2D c&#8208;MOFs, especially those with large pore apertures and high surface areas are rare. Herein, we develop two new 2D c&#8208;MOFs (HIOTP&#8208;M, M=Ni, Cu) employing a large p&#8208;&#960; conjugated ligand of hexaamino&#8208;triphenyleno[2,3&#8208;b:6,7&#8208;b&#8242;:10,11&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]tris[1,4]benzodioxin (HAOTP). Among the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, HIOTP&#8208;Ni exhibits the largest pore size of 3.3&#8197;nm and one of the highest surface areas (up to 1300&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). As an exemplary application, HIOTP&#8208;Ni has been used as a chemiresistive sensing material and displays high selective response (405&#8201;%) and a rapid response (1.69&#8197;min) towards 10&#8197;ppm NO2 gas. This work demonstrates significant correlation linking the pore aperture of 2D c&#8208;MOFs to their sensing performance.

         <title>Revision of the Absolute Configurations of Chelocardin and Amidochelocardin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chelocardin and its bioengineered derivative, amidochelocardin, are known to exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity. Herein, we describe the revised absolute configurations of amidochelocardin and chelocardin using a combination of XRD, NMR, ECD, and TDDFT&#8208;ECD calculations. The absolute configuration assigned via XRD analysis for a closely related semisynthetic analogue of 6&#8208;desmethyl&#8208;chelocardin (1) also supports this conclusion.







Abstract
Even with the aid of the available methods, the configurational assignment of natural products can be a challenging task that is prone to errors, and it sometimes needs to be corrected after total synthesis or single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Herein, the absolute configuration of amidochelocardin is revised using a combination of XRD, NMR spectroscopy, experimental ECD spectra, and time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory (TDDFT)&#8208;ECD calculations. As amidochelocardin was obtained via biosynthetic engineering of chelocardin, we propose the same absolute configuration for chelocardin based on the similar biosynthetic origins of the two compounds and result of TDDFT&#8208;ECD calculations. The evaluation of spectral data of two closely related analogues, 6&#8208;desmethyl&#8208;chelocardin and its semisynthetic derivative 1, also supports this conclusion.

Abstract
X&#8208;ray imaging technology has achieved important applications in many fields and has attracted extensive attentions. Dynamic X&#8208;ray flexible imaging for the real&#8208;time observation of the internal structure of complex materials is the most challenging type of X&#8208;ray imaging technology, which requires high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators with high X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) efficiency as well as excellent processibility and stability. Here, a macrocyclic bridging ligand with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature was introduced for constructing a copper iodide cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) scintillator. This strategy endows the scintillator with high XEL efficiency and excellent chemical stability. Moreover, a regular rod&#8208;like microcrystal was prepared through the addition of polyvinyl pyrrolidone during the in situ synthesis process, which further enhanced the XEL and processibility of the scintillator. The microcrystal was used for the preparation of a scintillator screen with excellent flexibility and stability, which can be used for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray imaging in extremely humid environments. Furthermore, dynamic X&#8208;ray flexible imaging was realized for the first time. The internal structure of flexible objects was observed in real time with an ultrahigh resolution of 20 LP mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Efficient Recycling of Gold and Copper from Electronic Waste by Selective Precipitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and selective recovery of gold and copper is achieved using triphenylphosphine oxide and 2,3&#8208;pyrazinedicarboxylic acid, respectively from 2&#8197;M HCl e&#8208;waste leach solutions. The selectivity of these precipitation methods, together with their ease of operation and capacity to recycle and reuse the precipitants, offers potential applications in the purification of Au and Cu from various metal sources.







Abstract
The recycling of metals from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) using efficient, selective, and sustainable processes is integral to circular economy and net&#8208;zero aspirations. Herein, we report a new method for the selective precipitation of metals such as gold and copper that offsets the use of organic solvents that are traditionally employed in solvent extraction processes. We show that gold can be selectively precipitated from a mixture of metals in hydrochloric acid solution using triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), as the complex [(TPPO)4(H5O2)][AuCl4]. By tuning the acid concentration, controlled precipitation of gold, zinc and iron can be achieved. We also show that copper can be selectively precipitated using 2,3&#8208;pyrazinedicarboxylic acid (2,3&#8208;PDCA), as the complex [Cu(2,3&#8208;PDCA&#8208;H)2]n&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2n(H2O). The combination of these two precipitation methods resulted in the recovery of 99.5&#8201;% of the Au and 98.5&#8201;% of the Cu present in the connector pins of an end&#8208;of&#8208;life computer processing unit. The selectivity of these precipitation processes, combined with their straightforward operation and the ability to recycle and reuse the precipitants, suggests potential industrial uses in the purification of gold and copper from e&#8208;waste.

         <title>Constructing Photoactivatable Protein with Genetically Encoded Photocaged Glutamic Acid</title>

Photocaged glutamic acid analogues are genetically encoded into proteins for the first time, opening up new opportunities for directly and effectively generating photoactivatable proteins.







Abstract
Genetically replacing an essential residue with the corresponding photocaged analogues via genetic code expansion (GCE) constitutes a useful and unique strategy to directly and effectively generate photoactivatable proteins. However, the application of this strategy is severely hampered by the limited number of encoded photocaged proteinogenic amino acids. Herein, we report the genetic incorporation of photocaged glutamic acid analogues in E. coli and mammalian cells and demonstrate their use in constructing photoactivatable variants of various fluorescent proteins and SpyCatcher. We believe genetically encoded photocaged Glu would significantly promote the design and application of photoactivatable proteins in many areas.

         <title>Photothermal Conversion by Carbon Black Facilitates Aryl Migration by Photon&#8208;Promoted Temperature Gradients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal conversion enables thermal gradients that facilitate high activation barrier reactions, such as the Newman Kwart Rearrangement. Substrates normally requiring bulk temperatures &gt;250&#8201;&#176;C are easily converted via visible light irradiation with short reaction times. Wavelength and intensity tunability enable selective product formation.







Abstract
The Newman Kwart Rearrangement (NKR) offers an efficient and high&#8208;yielding method for producing substituted thiophenols from phenols. While an industrially important protocol, it suffers from high activation energy barriers (35&#8211;43&#8197;kcal/mol), requiring the use of extreme temperatures (&gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) and specialty equipment. This report details a highly efficient and straightforward method for facilitating the NKR using photothermal conversion. This underused, unique reactivity pathway arises from the irradiation of nanomaterials that relax via a non&#8208;radiative decay pathway to generate intense thermal gradients. We show carbon black (CB) can be an inexpensive and abundant photothermal agent under visible light irradiation to achieve a facile NKR under mild conditions. The scope includes a wide array of stereo&#8208; and electronically diverse substrates with increasing difficulty of rearrangement, including BHT and BINOL as effective substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the unique application for temporal control in a thermal reaction and tunability of thermal gradients by modulating light intensity. Ultimately, photothermal conversion enables high&#8208;temperature reactions with simple, visible light irradiation.

         <title>Fragment Screening and Fast Micromolar Detection on a Benchtop NMR Spectrometer Boosted by Photoinduced Hyperpolarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benchtop NMR spectrometers are compact, lower in cost, and operate cryogen&#8208;free. The presented method using photoinduced hyperpolarization allows the detection of a protein&#8208;fragment interaction by a reduction of the ligand signal, simply by comparing the spectra measured in absence and presence of protein. Our approach enables to screen at micromolar concentrations of ligand and low micromolar concentrations of protein on a benchtop NMR.







Abstract
Fragment&#8208;based drug design is a well&#8208;established strategy for rational drug design, with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on high&#8208;field spectrometers as the method of reference for screening and hit validation. However, high&#8208;field NMR spectrometers are not only expensive, but require specialized maintenance, dedicated space, and depend on liquid helium cooling which became critical over the recurring global helium shortages. We propose an alternative to high&#8208;field NMR screening by applying the recently developed approach of fragment screening by photoinduced hyperpolarized NMR on a cryogen&#8208;free 80&#8197;MHz benchtop NMR spectrometer yielding signal enhancements of up to three orders in magnitude. It is demonstrated that it is possible to discover new hits and kick&#8208;off drug design using a benchtop NMR spectrometer at low micromolar concentrations of both protein and ligand. The approach presented performs at higher speed than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;field NMR approaches while exhibiting a limit of detection in the nanomolar range. Photoinduced hyperpolarization is known to be inexpensive and simple to be implemented, which aligns greatly with the philosophy of benchtop NMR spectrometers. These findings open the way for the use of benchtop NMR in near&#8208;physiological conditions for drug design and further life science applications.

The presented method using photoinduced hyperpolarization allows the detection of a protein-fragment interaction by a reduction of the ligand signal, simply by comparing the spectra measured in absence and presence of protein. Our approach enables to screen at micromolar concentrations of ligand and low micromolar concentrations of protein on a benchtop NMR.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fragment-based drug design is a well-established strategy for rational drug design, with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on high-field spectrometers as the method of reference for screening and hit validation. However, high-field NMR spectrometers are not only expensive, but require specialized maintenance, dedicated space, and depend on liquid helium cooling which became critical over the recurring global helium shortages. We propose an alternative to high-field NMR screening by applying the recently developed approach of fragment screening by photoinduced hyperpolarized NMR on a cryogen-free 80&#8197;MHz benchtop NMR spectrometer yielding signal enhancements of up to three orders in magnitude. It is demonstrated that it is possible to discover new hits and kick-off drug design using a benchtop NMR spectrometer at low micromolar concentrations of both protein and ligand. The approach presented performs at higher speed than state-of-the-art high-field NMR approaches while exhibiting a limit of detection in the nanomolar range. Photoinduced hyperpolarization is known to be inexpensive and simple to be implemented, which aligns greatly with the philosophy of benchtop NMR spectrometers. These findings open the way for the use of benchtop NMR in near-physiological conditions for drug design and further life science applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Performance Descriptors for Catalysts Based on Molybdenum, Tungsten, or Rhenium Oxides for Metathesis of Ethylene with 2&#8208;Butenes to Propene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis revealed the fundamentals of in situ transformation of M(W, Mo or Re)Ox into M&#8208;carbenes in C2H4&#8722;2&#8208;C4H8 metathesis to C3H6. Their concentration and intrinsic activity follow the order Re&gt;Mo&#8811;W. The concentration but not the activity can be increased through the usage of metathesis&#8208;inactive ZrO2 cocatalyst. The enhancing effect depends on the ability of ZrO2 to activate CH bonds in 2&#8208;butenes.







Abstract
The metathesis of ethylene with 2&#8208;butenes to propene is an established large&#8208;scale process. However, the fundamentals behind in situ transformation of supported WOx, MoOx, or ReOx species into catalytically active metal&#8208;carbenes and the intrinsic activity of the latter as well as the role of metathesis&#8208;inactive cocatalysts are still unsolved. This is detrimental for catalyst development and process optimization. In this study, we provide the required essentials derived from steady&#8208;state isotopic transient kinetic analysis. For the first time, the steady&#8208;state concentration, the lifetime, and the intrinsic reactivity of metal carbenes were determined. The obtained results can be directly used for the design and the preparation of metathesis&#8208;active catalysts and cocatalysts, thereby opening up possibilities for optimizing propene productivity.

         <title>Toward Magneto&#8208;Optical Cryogenic Thermometers with High Sensitivity: A Magnetic Circular Dichroism Based Thermometric Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the application potential of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) techniques is showcased through the inaugural application of MCD&#8208;based magneto&#8208;optical thermometry. Leveraging the intrinsic temperature dependence of the MCD C&#8208;term, the presence of dual&#8208;signaled bands, and the amalgamation of multiparametric thermal read&#8208;out with multiple regression, remarkable sensitivities of up to 95.3&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 are achieved with the [Ho(acac)3(phen)] complex. This achievement establishes a new benchmark for thermal sensitivity values within the cryogenic range.







Abstract
Remote temperature probing at the cryogenic range is of utmost importance for the advancement of future quantum technologies. Despite the notable achievements in luminescent thermometers, accurately measuring temperatures below 10&#8197;K remains a challenging endeavor. In this study, we propose a novel magneto&#8208;optical thermometric approach based on the magnetic&#8208;circular dichroism (MCD) technique, which offers unprecedented capabilities for meticulous temperature variation analysis at cryogenic temperatures. The inherent temperature sensitivity of the MCD C&#8208;term, in conjunction with both positive and negative signals, enables highly sensitive magneto&#8208;optical temperature probing. Additionally, a groundbreaking relative thermal sensitivity value of 95.3&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 2.54&#8197;K can be achieved using a mononuclear lanthanide complex, [[Ho(acac)3(phen)], in the presence of a 0.25&#8197;T applied magnetic field and using a combination of multiparametric thermal read&#8208;out with multiple regression. These results unequivocally demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of our methodology for cryogenic temperature sensing.

         <title>Carbene Formation or Reduction of the Diazo Functional Group? An Unexpected Solvent&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Cyclic Diazo Imides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;dependent light&#8208;assisted divergent reactivities of cyclic diazo imides and thiols have been disclosed. In dichloromethane, an indane&#8208;fused pyrrolidine is formed via triplet a carbene intermediate. By switching the solvent to acetonitrile, the aryl thiol acts as a reductant and leads to the reduction of the diazo functional group to a hydrazone.







Abstract
The control of the reactivity of diazo compounds is commonly achieved by the choice of a suitable catalyst, e.g. via stabilization of singlet carbenes or radical intermediates. Herein, we report on the light&#8208;promoted reactivity of cyclic diazo imides with thiols, where the choice of solvent results in two fundamentally different reaction pathways. In dichloromethane (DCM), a carbene is formed initially and engages in a cascade C&#8722;H functionalization/thiolation reaction to deliver indane&#8208;fused pyrrolidines in good to excellent yields. When switching to acetonitrile solvent, the carbene pathway is shut down and an unusual reduction of the diazo compound occurs under otherwise identical reaction conditions, where the aryl thiol acts as reductant. A combined set of experimental and computational studies was carried out to obtain mechanistic understanding and to support that indane formation proceeds via the insertion of a triplet carbene, while the reduction of diazo imides proceeds via an electron transfer process.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral QUINAP Derivatives by Ketone&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ketone&#8208;catalyzed reaction for the enantioselective oxidation of N atoms was developed and effectively applied to the atroposelective kinetic resolution of QUINAPOs and related compounds. Both highly enantioenriched QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide products could be readily converted into QUINAPs without loss of chiral integrity. QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide was also shown to act as a chiral Lewis base catalyst in a series of enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
QUINAPs have emerged as a pivotal class of axially chiral compounds with remarkable features in the stereoinduction of diverse enantioselective transformations. However, the confined substrate range and extravagant price still pose challenges, limiting their broader utilization. Herein, we describe the first atroposelective oxidation of an N atom using a chiral ketone catalyst, allowing the kinetic resolution of QUINAPOs to give both the unreacted substrates and their corresponding N&#8208;oxides with excellent enantioselectivity. Importantly, the enantioenriched products can be readily converted into the QUINAP targets without any loss of stereochemical integrity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that a dioxirane, generated through the oxidation of the ketone with oxone, acts as the active catalytic species. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this catalytic system to the kinetic resolution of QUINOLs and the dynamic kinetic transformation of pyridine analogues of QUINAPO possessing a labile stereogenic axis. The practicality of the developed protocol is further demonstrated by the successful application of QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide as a Lewis base catalyst in a series of enantioselective transformations.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Raman Lasing from Metal&#8208;Linked Organic Dimer Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave Raman lasing is realized in a metal&#8208;linked organic dimer microcrystal. It has much enhanced Raman gain and notably improved stability. By virtue of the wide transparency window of the microcrystal, broadband tunable Raman lasing is achieved.







Abstract
Stimulated Raman scattering offers an alternative strategy to explore continuous&#8208;wave (c.w.) organic lasers, which, however, still suffers from the limitation of inadequate Raman gain in organic material systems. Here we propose a metal&#8208;linking approach to enhance the Raman gain of organic molecules. Self&#8208;assembled microcrystals of the metal linked organic dimers exhibit large Raman gain, therefore allowing for c.w. Raman lasing. Furthermore, broadband tunable Raman lasing is achieved in the organic dimer microcrystals by adjusting excitation wavelengths. This work advances the understanding of Raman gain in organic molecules, paving a way for the design of c.w. organic lasers.

         <title>MIDA&#8208; and TIDA&#8208;Boronates Stabilize &#945;&#8208;Radicals Through B&#8722;N Hyperconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work shows that alkyl MIDA&#8208; and TIDA&#8208;boronates have a notable stabilizing effect on &#945;&#8208;radicals that arises via B&#8722;N hyperconjugation. This is supported by DFT radical stabilization energy and spin density studies, development of a site&#8208;selective bromination reaction, and LED&#8197;NMR kinetic analysis of bromination rates for different alkyl boronic esters.







Abstract
Multifunctional organoboron compounds increasingly enable the simple generation of complex, Csp3&#8208;rich small molecules. The ability of boron&#8208;containing functional groups to modify the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;radicals has also enabled a myriad of chemical reactions. Boronic esters with vacant p&#8208;orbitals have a significant stabilizing effect on &#945;&#8208;radicals due to delocalization of spin density into the empty orbital. The effect of coordinatively saturated derivatives, such as N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates and counterparts, remains less clear. Herein, we demonstrate that coordinatively saturated MIDA and TIDA boronates stabilize secondary alkyl &#945;&#8208;radicals via &#963;B&#8208;N hyperconjugation in a manner that allows site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bromination. DFT calculated radical stabilization energies and spin density maps as well as LED&#8197;NMR kinetic analysis of photochemical bromination rates of different boronic esters further these findings. This work clarifies that the &#945;&#8208;radical stabilizing effect of boronic esters does not only proceed via delocalization of radical character into vacant boron p&#8208;orbitals, but that hyperconjugation of tetrahedral boron&#8208;containing functional groups and their ligand electron delocalizing ability also play a critical role. These findings establish boron ligands as a useful dial for tuning reactivity at the &#945;&#8208;carbon.

         <title>Direct Acylation of Unactivated Alkyl Halides with Aldehydes through N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldehydes underwent cross&#8208;coupling with unactivated alkyl halides in the presence of an NHC organocatalyst, thus enabling the rapid synthesis of various ketones from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. This method was also applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical derivatives. Mechanistic investigations suggest a closed&#8208;shell nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this organocatalytic reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic acylation of organohalides with aldehydes is an ideal strategy for the direct synthesis of ketones. However, the utilization of unactivated alkyl halides in such a transformation remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we developed a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of aldehydes with unactivated alkyl halides through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. With this protocol, various ketones could be rapidly synthesized from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. This organocatalytic system was successfully applied in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical derivatives. Mechanistic investigations suggest a closed&#8208;shell nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this reaction.

         <title>Regioselective and Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminocarbonylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a general method for the regio&#8208; and enantioselective Cu&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes under mild conditions. The reaction tolerates a wild range of functional groups and applicable to different classes of alkenes. Alkynes are also compatible under this catalytic system with the cascade hydrogenation&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation process to alkyl amides.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of amide backbones in marketed pharmaceuticals and their ubiquity as critical binding units in natural peptides and proteins, it remains important to develop novel methods to construct amide bonds. We report here a general method for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes under mild conditions, using copper catalysis in combination with hydroxylamine electrophile reagents and poly(methylhydrosiloxane) (PMHS) as a cheap and environmentally friendly hydride source. The reaction tolerates a variety of functional groups and efficiently converts unactivated terminal alkenes, 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, and cyclic alkenes to the corresponding amides with exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity (and high enantioselectivities/diastereoselectivities). Additionally, with minimal modification of the reaction conditions, alkynes can also undergo tandem hydrogenation&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation to alkyl amides.

Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H arylation/DKR reaction was realized. This strategy provides an efficient and sustainable method for the synthesis of axially chiral biaryl&#8208;2&#8208;amines in good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%ee).







Abstract
Highly efficient synthesis of axially chiral biaryl amines through cobalt&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H arylation using easily accessible cobalt(II) salt and salicyloxazoline ligand has been reported. This methodology provides a straightforward and sustainable access to a broad range of enantioenriched biaryl&#8208;2&#8208;amines in good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular technique that streamlines the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;difluoroalkylated amines from benzyl amines and trifluoromethylarenes has been developed. This protocol demonstrates remarkable operational simplicity, excellent chemoselectivity, and wide applicability, including with advanced synthetic intermediates, thus providing a novel pathway to access medicinally&#8208;relevant &#945;&#8208;difluoroalkylated amines from readily available and simple precursors.

         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalytic micelles are introduced to expand the collection of systems catalysts compatible with anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis with a rich topic of general importance. They are of interest to realize anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis, anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis and anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; autocatalysis in water. Classics in supramolecular chemistry are installed to control substrate binding and positioning within the confined micellar space for access to emergent properties.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis operates by stabilizing anionic transition states on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces. In anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis, &#960; stacks add polarizability to strengthen interactions. In search of synthetic methods to extend &#960; stacks beyond the limits of foldamers, the self&#8208;assembly of micelles from amphiphilic naphthalenediimides (NDIs) is introduced. To interface substrates and catalysts, charge&#8208;transfer complexes with dialkoxynaphthalenes (DANs), a classic in supramolecular chemistry, are installed. In &#960;&#8208;stacked micelles, the rates of bioinspired ether cyclizations exceed rates on monomers in organic solvents by far. This is particularly impressive considering that anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis in water has been elusive so far. Increasing rates with increasing &#960; acidity of the micelles evince operational anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis. At maximal &#960; acidity, autocatalytic behavior emerges. Dependence on position and order in confined micellar space promises access to emergent properties. Anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalytic micelles in water thus expand supramolecular systems catalysis accessible with anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with an inspiring topic of general interest and great perspectives.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Metaphanine and Oxoepistephamiersine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two complex hasubanan alkaloids were synthesized from inexpensive cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal by a divergent route featuring a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization. Regioselective Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation followed by MeNH2&#8208;triggered skeletal reorganization formed the benzannulated aza[4.4.3]propellane, and late&#8208;stage regio&#8208; and diastereoselective oxidative annulation of a sp3 C&#8722;H bond formed the challenging tetrahydrofuran ring system.







Abstract
Herein, we report a concise and divergent synthesis of the complex hasubanan alkaloids metaphanine and oxoepistephamiersine from commercially available and inexpensive cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal. Our synthesis features a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization reaction to set the tricyclic carbon framework of the desired molecules, a regioselective Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation followed by a MeNH2 triggered skeletal reorganization cascade to construct the benzannulated aza[4.4.3]propellane, and a strategically late&#8208;stage regio&#8208;/diastereoselective oxidative annulation of sp3 C&#8722;H bond to form the challenging THF ring system and hemiketal moiety in a single step. In addition, a highly enantioselective alkylation of cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal paved the way for the asymmetric synthesis of target molecular.

         <title>Zeolite Synthesis in the Presence of Metallosiloxanes for the Quantitative Encapsulation of Metal Species for the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of NOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot hydrothermal zeolite synthesis using metallosiloxane precursors enables a quantitative encapsulation of metal species into the zeolite. For Fe&#8208;MFI zeolite the approach facilities a homogeneous distribution of the Fe species throughout the zeolite framework and leading to improved catalytic activity with good tolerance to H2O/SO2 in the NH3&#8208;selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx across a wide temperature range.







Abstract
Metal encapsulation in zeolitic materials through one&#8208;pot hydrothermal synthesis (HTS) is an attractive technique to prepare zeolites with a high metal dispersion. Due to its simplicity and the excellent catalytic performance observed for several catalytic systems, this method has gained a great deal of attention over the last few years. While most studies apply synthetic methods involving different organic ligands to stabilize the metal under synthesis conditions, here we report the use of metallosiloxanes as an alternative metal precursor. Metallosiloxanes can be synthesized from simple and cost&#8208;affordable chemicals and, when used in combination with zeolite building blocks under standard synthesis conditions, lead to quantitative metal loading and high dispersion. Thanks to the structural analogy of siloxane with TEOS, the synthesis gel stabilizes by forming siloxane bridges that prevent metal precipitation and clustering. When focusing on Fe&#8208;encapsulation, we demonstrate that Fe&#8208;MFI zeolites obtained by this method exhibit high catalytic activity in the NH3&#8208;mediated selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx along with a good H2O/SO2 tolerance. This synthetic approach opens a new synthetic route for the encapsulation of transition metals within zeolite structures.

         <title>Isolable Tetragold(0) Clusters with Polarity&#8208;Tunable exo&#8208;Au&#8722;Au Bond via Intramolecular &#963;&#8208;Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;enveloped tetragold(0) clusters have been successfully synthesized via a nucleophilic substitution reaction between a Au3 anionic cluster and PMe3AuCl. A novel stabilization mode, intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization has been discovered, in which the intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization has now been observed for the first time in homometallic clusters, and the polarity of the exo&#8208;Au&#8722;Au bonds can be tuned via the strength of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity.







Abstract
Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;aromatization is a trait of many organic compounds that enhances the stability of their structures and polarizes related C&#8722;C &#960; bonds. In contrast, rare study is focused on this phenomenon in metal clusters. Many existing homometallic clusters exhibit aromaticity, often characterized by nonpolar metal&#8208;metal bonds and a high degree of symmetry. However, synthesizing low&#8208;symmetric homometallic clusters with high&#8208;polar metal&#8208;metal bonds is challenging due to their limited thermodynamic stability. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of [Au(&#956;2&#8208;ER2)]3&#8722;AuPMe3 (E=Ge, Sn; R2=1,1,4,4&#8208;tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) clusters and reveal a novel stabilization mode, intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization. Our electronic structure analyses show that these low&#8208;symmetric clusters possess a ten&#8208;electron &#963;&#8208;aromatic system, which is achieved via intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization. Moreover, the strength of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity gives rise to a polarity&#8208;tunable exo&#8208;Au&#8722;Au bond.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intramolecular &#960;-aromatization is a trait of many organic compounds that enhances the stability of their structures and polarizes related C&#8722;C &#960; bonds. In contrast, rare study is focused on this phenomenon in metal clusters. Many existing homometallic clusters exhibit aromaticity, often characterized by nonpolar metal-metal bonds and a high degree of symmetry. However, synthesizing low-symmetric homometallic clusters with high-polar metal-metal bonds is challenging due to their limited thermodynamic stability. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of [Au(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ER&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;AuPMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (E=Ge, Sn; R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=1,1,4,4-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)butane-1,4-diyl) clusters and reveal a novel stabilization mode, intramolecular &#963;-aromatization. Our electronic structure analyses show that these low-symmetric clusters possess a ten-electron &#963;-aromatic system, which is achieved via intramolecular &#963;-aromatization. Moreover, the strength of &#963;-aromaticity gives rise to a polarity-tunable &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-Au&#8722;Au bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Benzofuranoindoline Formation in the Biosynthesis of the Strained Bridgehead Bicyclic Dipeptide (+)&#8208;Azonazine A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of the strained dipeptide (+)&#8208;azonazine A from marine&#8208;derived Aspergillus insulicola, which features a rarely observed benzofuranoindoline ring system, was uncovered. Heterologous reconstitution of the fourth&#8208;enzyme pathway showed a P450 enyzme catalyzes an oxidative cyclization of cyclo&#8208;(l&#8208;Trp&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr) to form the hexacyclic ring system. Analogs of azonazine A were generated by supplementing the producing strain with different indole&#8208;substituted tryptophan analogs.







Abstract
We uncovered and reconstituted a concise biosynthetic pathway of the strained dipeptide (+)&#8208;azonazine A from marine&#8208;derived Aspergillus insulicola. Formation of the hexacyclic benzofuranoindoline ring system from cyclo&#8208;(l&#8208;Trp&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr) is catalyzed by a P450 enzyme through an oxidative cyclization. Supplementing the producing strain with various indole&#8208;substituted tryptophan derivatives resulted in the generation of a series of azonazine A analogs.

         <title>Few&#8208;Layer Fullerene Network for Photocatalytic Pure Water Splitting into H2 and H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 40, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A few&#8208;layer fullerene C60 network was successfully synthesized and explored for photocatalytic water splitting into H2 and H2O2 under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The mechanism for water splitting of the few&#8208;layer C60 catalyst was investigated.







Abstract
A few&#8208;layer fullerene network possesses several advantageous characteristics, including a large surface area, abundant active sites, high charge mobility, and an appropriate band gap and band edge for solar water splitting. Herein, we report for the first time that the few&#8208;layer fullerene network shows interesting photocatalytic performance in pure water splitting into H2 and H2O2 in the absence of any sacrificial reagents. Under optimal conditions, the H2 and H2O2 evolution rates can reach 91 and 116&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, with good stability. This work demonstrates the novel application of the few&#8208;layer fullerene network in the field of energy conversion.
