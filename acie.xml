         <title>Membranes based on Covalent Organic Frameworks through Green and Scalable Interfacial Polymerization using Ionic Liquids for Antibiotic Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic framework (COF) membranes featuring uniform topological structures and devisable functions, show huge potential in water purification and molecular separation. Nevertheless, the inability of uniform COF membranes to be produced on an industrial scale and their nonenvironmentally friendly fabrication method are the bottleneck preventing their industrial applications. Herein, we report a new green and industrially adaptable scraping&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) technique to fabricate scalable and uniform TpPa COF membranes. The process used non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;volatility ionic liquids (ILs) as organic phase instead of conventional organic solvents for interfacial synthesis of TpPa COF layer on a support membrane, which can simultaneously achieve the purposes of (i) improving the greenness of membrane&#8208;forming process and (ii) fabricating a robust membrane that can function beyond the conventional membranes. This approach yields a large&#8208;area, continuous COF membrane (19 &#215; 25 cm2) with a thickness of 78 nm within a brief period of 2 minutes. The resulting membrane exhibited an unprecedented combination of high permeance (48.09 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1) and antibiotic desalination efficiency (e.g., NaCl/adriamycin separation factor of 41.8), which is superior to the commercial benchmarking membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Redox Reactions Enable Stable Tin&#8208;Lead Mixed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ poses an inherent challenge that limits the efficiency and stability of tin&#8208;lead mixed (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices. In this work, we discover the sustainable redox reactions enabling self&#8208;healing Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites, where their intractable oxidation degradation can be recovered to their original state under light soaking. Quantitative and operando spectroscopies are used to investigate the redox chemistry, revealing that metallic Pb0 from the photolysis of perovskite reacts with Sn4+ to regenerate Pb2+ and Sn2+ spontaneously. Given the sluggish redox reaction kinetics, V3+/V2+ ionic pair is designed as an effective redox shuttle to accelerate the recovery of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites from oxidation. The target Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs enabled by V3+/V2+ ionic pair deliver an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.22% and excellent device lifespan, retaining nearly 90% of its initial PCE after maximum power point tracking under light for 1,000 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline, Porous Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes are a class of fascinating chiral helical molecules with rich chemistry developed continuously over the past 100 years. Their helical, conjugated, and twisted structures make them attractive for constructing molecular systems. However, studies over the past century are mainly focused on synthesizing helicenes with increased numbers of aromatic rings and complex heterostructures, while research on inorganic, organic, and polymeric helicene materials is still embryonic. Herein, we report the first examples of helicene covalent organic frameworks, i.e., [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1, by condensing [7]helicene dialdehyde with trimethyl triazine via the C=C bond formation reaction under solvothermal conditions. The resultant [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibits prominent X&#8208;ray diffraction peaks and assumes a highly ordered 2D lattice structure originated from the twisted configuration of [7]Helicene unit. The C=C linked [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1 materials exhibited extended &#960; conjugation and broadly tuned their absorption, emission, redox activity, photoconductivity, and light&#8208;emitting activity, demonstrating rich multifunctionalities and great potentials in developing various applications. This work opens a way to a new family of COFs as well as helicene materials, enabling the exploration of unprecedented &#960; architectures and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Interfacial Carrier Dynamics Modulated by Bidirectional Charge Transport Channels in ZnIn2S4&#8208;based Composite Photoanodes Probed by Scanning Photoelectrochemical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Limited charge separation/transport efficiency remains the primary obstacle of achieving satisfying photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. Therefore, it is essential to develop diverse interfacial engineering strategies to mitigate charge recombination. Despite obvious progress having been made, most works only considered a single&#8208;side modulation in either the electrons of conduction band or the holes of valence band in a semiconductor photoanode, leading to a limited PEC performance enhancement. Beyond this conventional thinking, we developed a novel coupling modification strategy to achieve a composite electrode with bidirectional carrier transport for a better charge separation, in which Ti2C3Tx MXene quantum dots (MQDs) and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanodots (FO) are anchored on the surface of ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) nanoplates, resulting in markedly improved PEC water splitting of pure ZIS photoanode. Systematic studies indicated that the bidirectional charge transfer pathways were stimulated due to MQDs as &#8220;electron extractor&#8221; and S&#8208;O bonds as carriers transport channels, which synergistically favors significantly enhanced charge separation. The enhanced kinetic behavior at the FO/MQDs/ZIS interfaces was systematically and quantitatively evaluated by a series of methods, especially scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy. This work may deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation, and provide valuable guidance for the rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance composite electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Comonomer Additive for Radically Recyclable Vinyl&#8208;derived Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radically&#8208;formed, vinyl&#8208;derived polymers account for over 30% of polymer production. Connected through stable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, these materials are notoriously challenging to chemically recycle. Herein, we report universal copolymerization of a cyclic allyl sulfide (CAS) additive with multiple monomers under free&#8208;radical conditions, to introduce main&#8208;chain dynamic motifs. Backbone allyl sulfides undergo post&#8208;polymerization radical rearrangement via addition&#8208;fragmentation&#8208;transfer (AFT) that fosters both chain scission and extension. Scission is selectively induced through allyl sulfide exchange with small molecule thiyl radicals, resulting in oligomers as low as 14% of the initial molar mass. Crucially, oligomers retain allyl sulfide end groups, enabling their extension with monomer under radical conditions. Extended, i.e., recycled, product molar mass is tunable through the ratio of monomer to oligomer, and can surpass that of the initial copolymer. Two scission&#8208;extension cycles are demonstrated in copolymers with methyl methacrylate and styrene without escalation in dispersity. In illustration of forming higher&#8208;value products, i.e., upcycling, we synthesize block copolymers through the extension of oligomers with a different vinyl monomer. Collectively, our approach to chemical recycling is unparalleled in its ability to 1) function in a variety of vinyl&#8208;derived polymers, 2) complete radical closed&#8208;loop cycling, and 3) upcycle waste material.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;ClpP Bound to the Covalent Active Site Inhibitor Cystargolide A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The caseinolytic protease is a highly conserved serine protease, crucial to prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein homeostasis, and a promising antibacterial and anticancer drug target. Here, we describe the potent cystargolides as the first natural &#946;&#8208;lactone inhibitors of the proteolytic core ClpP.&#160;Based on the discovery of two&#160;clpP&#160;genes next to the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster in&#160;Kitasatospora cystarginea, we explored ClpP as a potential cystargolide target. We show the inhibition of&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;ClpP by cystargolide A and B by different biochemical methods&#160;in vitro.&#160;Synthesis of semi&#8208;synthetic derivatives and probes with improved cell penetration allowed us to confirm ClpP as a specific target in&#160;S. aureus&#160;cells and to demonstrate the anti&#8208;virulence activity of this natural product class. Crystal structures show cystargolide A covalently bound to all 14 active sites of ClpP from&#160;S. aureus,&#160;Aquifex aeolicus,&#160;as well as&#160;Photorhabdus laumondii, and reveal the molecular mechanism of ClpP inhibition by &#946;&#8208;lactones, the pioneering group of ClpP inhibitors.</dc:description>

We show the inhibition of&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;ClpP by cystargolide A and B by different biochemical methods&#160;in vitro.&#160;Synthesis of semi-synthetic derivatives and probes with improved cell penetration allowed us to confirm ClpP as a specific target in&#160;S. aureus&#160;cells and to demonstrate the anti-virulence activity of this natural product class. Crystal structures show cystargolide A covalently bound to all 14 active sites of ClpP from&#160;S. aureus,&#160;Aquifex aeolicus,&#160;as well as&#160;Photorhabdus laumondii, and reveal the molecular mechanism of ClpP inhibition by &#946;-lactones, the pioneering group of ClpP inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Click to Self&#8208;immolation: A &#8220;Click&#8221; Functionalization Strategy towards Triggerable Self&#8208;immolative Homopolymers and Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) are a class of degradable macromolecules that undergo stimuli&#8208;triggered head&#8208;to&#8208;tail depolymerization. However, a general approach to readily end&#8208;functionalize SIP precursors for programmed degradation remains elusive, restricting access to complex, functional SIP&#8208;based materials. Here we present a &#8220;click to self&#8208;immolation&#8221; strategy based on aroyl azide&#8208;capped SIP precursors, enabling the facile construction of diverse SIPs with different trigger units through a Curtius rearrangement and alcohol/thiol&#8722;isocyanate &#8220;click&#8221; reaction. This strategy is also applied to polymer&#8722;polymer coupling to access fully depolymerizable block copolymer amphiphiles, even combining different SIP backbones. Our results demonstrate that the depolymerization can be actuated efficiently under physiologically&#8208;relevant conditions by the removal of the trigger units and ensuing self&#8208;immolation of the p&#8208;aminobenzyl carbonate linkage, indicating promise for controlled release applications involving nanoparticles and hydrogels.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of 2&#8208;Acylimidazoles via Dehydrogenative Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with hydrocarbons is of substantial interest and challenge. Herein, we achieved the enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;acylimidazoles with up to 99&#8201;% ee in moderate to good yields, thus providing an elegant access to optically active carbonyl compounds. Density functional theory calculations suggest a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling pathway.







Abstract
The direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with nonactivated hydrocarbons through C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization is both extremely promising and notably challenging, especially when attempting to achieve enantioselectivity using iron&#8208;based catalysts. We have identified a robust chiral iron complex for the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;acylimidazoles with benzylic and allylic hydrocarbons, as well as nonactivated alkanes. The readily available and tunable N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide catalysts of iron in connection with oxidants exhibit precise asymmetric induction (up to 99&#8201;% ee) with good compatibility in moderate to good yields (up to 88&#8201;% yield). This protocol provides an elegant and straightforward access to optically active acyclic carbonyl derivatives starting from simple alkanes without prefunctionalization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments were made to gain insight into the nature of C&#8722;C bond formation and the origin of enantioselectivity. We propose a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling process enabled by the immediate interconversion between chiral ferric species and ferrous species.

         <title>Lignin Upconversion by Functionalization and Network Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides insights into up&#8208;conversion of lignin, which is a major byproduct of paper and pulp industries and has highly polyphenolic structure. Lignin can be functionalized through chemical and enzymatic routes to develop value&#8208;added chemicals for industries. Further, cross&#8208;linking strategies lead to the development of functional materials such as polymeric resins, bioplastics, hydrogels, nanocarriers and carbon fibers.







Abstract
Lignin, a complex and abundant biopolymer derived from plant cell walls, has emerged as a promising feedstock for sustainable material development. Due to the high abundance of phenylpropanoid units, aromatic rings, and hydroxyl groups, lignin is an ideal candidate for being explored in various material applications. Therefore, the demand on lignin valorization for development of value&#8208;added products is significantly increasing. This mini&#8208;review provides an overview of lignin upconversion, focusing on its functionalization through chemical and enzymatic routes, and its application in lignin&#8208;based polymer resins, hydrogels, and nanomaterials. The functionalization of lignin molecules with various chemical groups offers tailored properties and increased compatibility with other materials, expanding its potential applications. Additionally, the formation of lignin&#8208;based networks, either through cross&#8208;linking or blending with polymers, generates novel materials with improved mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties. However, challenges remain in optimizing functionalization techniques, preserving the innate complexity of lignin, and achieving scalability for industrial implementation. As lignin&#8216;s potential continues to be unlocked, it is poised to contribute significantly to the shift towards more eco&#8208;friendly and resource&#8208;efficient industries.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers via NHC&#160;Catalyzed Desymmetrization and Following Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral diaryl ethers present in numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. However, only few catalytic enantioselective approaches have been established to access diaryl ether atropisomers. Herein, we report the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via desymmetrization of prochiral 2&#8208;aryloxyisophthalaldehydes with aliphatic alcohols, phenol derivatives, and heteroaromatic amines. This reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity. The utility of this methodology is illustrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and diverse enantioretentive transformations. Control experiments and the DFT calculation support the association of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization with following kinetic resolution to enhance the enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging the Proximity and Distribution of Cu&#8722;Cs Sites for Direct Conversion of Methanol to Esters/Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented quadruple tandem catalytic production of esters and aldehydes from methanol and methyl acetate/ethanol has been developed, allowing for customized chain length and saturation by leveraging the proximity and distribution of Cu&#8722;Cs sites. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the production of value&#8208;added methyl methacrylate (MMA), surpassing the current industrial processes to significantly lower the production costs.







Abstract
Methanol serves as a versatile building&#8208;block for various commodity chemicals, and the development of industrially promising strategies for its conversion remains the ultimate goal in methanol chemistry. In this study, we design a dual Cu&#8722;Cs catalytic system that enables a one&#8208;step direct conversion of methanol and methyl acetate/ethanol into high value&#8208;added esters/aldehydes, with customized chain length and saturation by leveraging the proximity and distribution of Cu&#8722;Cs sites. Cu&#8722;Cs at a millimeter&#8208;scale intimacy triggers methanol dehydrogenation and condensation, involving proton transfer, aldol formation, and aldol condensation, to obtain unsaturated esters and aldehydes with selectivities of 76.3&#8201;% and 31.1&#8201;%, respectively. Cu&#8722;Cs at a micrometer&#8208;scale intimacy significantly promotes mass transfer of intermediates across catalyst interfaces and their subsequent hydrogenation to saturated esters and aldehydes with selectivities of 67.6&#8201;% and 93.1&#8201;%, respectively. Conversely, Cu&#8722;Cs at a nanometer&#8208;scale intimacy alters reaction pathway with a similar energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step, but blocks the acidic&#8208;basic sites and diverts the reaction to byproducts. More importantly, an unprecedented quadruple tandem catalytic production of methyl methacrylate (MMA) is achieved by further tailoring Cu and Cs distribution across the reaction bed in the configuration of Cu&#8722;Cs||Cs, outperforming the existing industrial processes and saving at least 15&#8201;% of production costs.

         <title>Liquid Metal Nanocores Initiated Construction of Smart DNA&#8208;Polymer Microgels with Programmable and Regulable Functions and Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven Locomotion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization reaction of gallium&#8208;based liquid metal nanoparticles under sonication allows the construction of smart core/shell microgels. Multifunctional DNA microgels with tunable properties were prepared by introducing different vinyl monomers and functional DNA structures and controlling the polymerization process. The photothermal effect of LM NPs also contributed to the NIR&#8208;driven motion of these smart microgels.







Abstract
Due to their sequence&#8208;directed functions and excellent biocompatibility, smart DNA microgels have attracted considerable research interest, and the combination of DNA microgels with functional nanostructures can further expand their applications in biosensing and biomedicine. Gallium&#8208;based liquid metals (LMs) exhibiting both fluidic and metallic properties hold great promise for the development of smart soft materials; in particular, LM particles upon sonication can mediate radical&#8208;initiated polymerization reactions, thus allowing the combination of LMs and polymeric matrix to construct &#8220;soft&#8211;soft&#8221; materials. Herein, by forming active surfaces under sonication, LM nanoparticles (LM NPs) initiated localized radical polymerization reactions allow the combination of functional DNA units and different polymeric backbones to yield multifunctional core/shell microgels. The localized polymerization reaction allows fine control of the microgel compositions, and smart DNA microgels with tunable catalytic activities can be constructed. Moreover, due to the excellent photothermal effect of LM NPs, the resulting temperature gradient between microgels and surrounding solution upon NIR light irradiation can drive the oriented locomotion of the microgels, and remote control of the activity of these smart microgels can be achieved. These microgels may hold promise for various applications, such as the development of in vivo and in vitro biosensing and drug delivery systems.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Electroreductive Alkylation of Unactivated Alkyl Chlorides with Conjugated Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild electrocatalytic system is reported for the reductive alkylation of primary, secondary, or tertiary alkyl chlorides with conjugated alkenes.







Abstract
Reactions of unactivated alkyl chlorides under mild and sustainable conditions are rare compared to those of alkyl bromides or iodides. As a result, synthetic methods capable of modifying the vast chemical space of chloroalkane reagents, wastes, and materials are limited. We report the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive addition of unactivated alkyl chlorides to conjugated alkenes. Co&#8208;catalyzed activation of alkyl chlorides is performed under electroreductive conditions, and the resulting reactions constitute formal alkyl&#8208;alkyl bond formation. In addition to developing an operationally simple methodology, detailed mechanistic studies provide insights into the elementary steps of a proposed catalytic cycle. In particular, we propose a switch in the mechanism of C&#8722;Cl bond activation from nucleophilic substitution to halogen atom abstraction, which is critical for efficiently generating alkyl radicals. These mechanistic insights were leveraged in designing ligands that enable couplings of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl chlorides.

         <title>Unlocking a Dual&#8208;Channel Pathway in CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Single&#8208;Site Zirconium on Amorphous Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a Cu/Zr&#8208;SiO2 catalyst, the interface between Cu and single&#8208;site Zr stabilized by a SiO2 matrix promotes a reverse water&#8208;gas shift + CO&#8208;hydro pathway. The additional pathway supplements the transitional formate pathway on ZrO2 particles during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.







Abstract
Converting CO2 into methanol on a large scale is of great significance in the sustainable methanol economy. Zirconia species are considered to be an essential support in Cu&#8208;based catalysts due to their excellent properties for CO2 adsorption and activation. However, the evolution of Zr species during the reaction and the effect of their structure on the reaction pathways remain unclear. Herein, single&#8208;site Zr species in an amorphous SiO2 matrix are created by enhancing the Zr&#8722;Si interaction in Cu/ZrO2&#8208;SiO2 catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the coordination environment of single&#8208;site Zr is sensitive to the atmosphere and reaction conditions. We demonstrate that the CO2 adsorption occurs preferably on the interface of Cu and single&#8208;site Zr rather than on ZrO2 nanoparticles. Methanol synthesis in reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (RWGS)+CO&#8208;hydro pathway is verified only over single&#8208;dispersed Zr sites, whereas the ordinary formate pathway occurs on ZrO2 nanoparticles. Thus, it expands a non&#8208;competitive parallel pathway as a supplement to the dominant formate pathway, resulting in the enhancement of Cu activity sixfold and twofold based on Cu/SiO2 and Cu/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. The establishment of this dual&#8208;channel pathway by single&#8208;site Zr species in this work opens new horizons for understanding the role of atomically dispersed oxides in catalysis science.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Based Dyotropic Rearrangement Enables A Triple Functionalization of Gem&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes: An Unusual Fluorolactonization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 4&#8208;methylenealkanoic acid derivatives with Selectfluor provides fluorolactones via a sequence of 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig oxypalladation, Pd oxidation, regioselective ring&#8208;enlarging 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8722;F bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination.







Abstract
We report in this paper a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed migratory gem&#8208;fluorolactonization of ene&#8208;carboxylic acids. Reaction of 4&#8208;methylenealkanoic acid derivatives with Selectfluor in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%) at room temperature affords fluorolactones in good to excellent yields. 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Methylenecycloalkanyl)acetic acids are transformed to bridged fluorolactones under identical conditions. One C&#8722;C, one C&#8722;O and one tertiary C&#8722;F bond were generated along the gem&#8208;disubstituted carbon&#8208;carbon double bond in this operationally simple transformation. Trapping experiments indicates that the reaction is initiated by a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig oxypalladation followed by Pd oxidation, regioselective ring&#8208;enlarging 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8722;F bond forming reductive elimination cascade. Post&#8208;transformations of these fluorolactones taking advantage of the electrophilicity of the 1&#8208;fluoroalkylcarboxylate function are also documented.

         <title>Prediction of Early Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Sequence&#8208;Activated Fluorescence Probe for the Simultaneous Detection of &#947;&#8208;Glutamyl Transpeptidase and Hypobromous Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To avoid false&#8208;positive diagnoses caused by a single disease biomarker, a two&#8208;photon fluorescence probe which is turned on sequentially by &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and HBrO was designed to predict early atherosclerotic plaques. The voltage&#8208;gated chloride channel (CLC&#8208;1)&#8208;HBrO&#8208;catalase (CAT)&#8208;GGT signaling pathway was confirmed at the cellular level, demonstrating that both GGT and HBrO can be applied as biomarkers of atherosclerosis.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis is a lipoprotein&#8208;driven disease, and there is no effective therapy to reverse atherosclerosis or existing plaques. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to create a noninvasive and reliable approach for early atherosclerosis detection to prevent initial plaque formation. Atherosclerosis is intimately associated with inflammation, which is accompanied by an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cells requiring more glutathione (GSH) to resist severe oxidative stress. Therefore, the GSH&#8208;hydrolyzed protein &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and the ROS&#8208;hypobromous acid (HBrO) are potential biomarkers for predicting atherogenesis. Hence, to avoid false&#8208;positive diagnoses caused by a single biomarker, we constructed an ingenious sequence&#8208;activated double&#8208;locked TP fluorescent probe, C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, in which two sequential triggers of GGT and HBrO are meticulously designed to ensure that the probe fluoresces in response to HBrO only after GGT hydrolyzes the probe. By utilization of C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, the voltage&#8208;gated chloride channel (CLC&#8208;1)&#8208;HBrO&#8208;catalase (CAT)&#8208;GGT signaling pathway was confirmed in cellular level. Notably, the forthcoming atherosclerotic plaques were successfully predicted before the plaques could be observed via the naked eye or classical immunofluorescent staining. Collectively, this research proposed a powerful tool to indicate the precise position of mature plaques and provide early warning of atherosclerotic plaques.

Hence, to avoid false-positive diagnoses caused by a single biomarker, we constructed an ingenious sequence-activated double-locked TP fluorescent probe, C-HBrO-GGT, in which two sequential triggers of GGT and HBrO are meticulously designed to ensure that the probe fluoresces in response to HBrO only after GGT hydrolyzes the probe. By utilization of C-HBrO-GGT, the voltage-gated chloride channel (CLC-1)-HBrO-catalase (CAT)-GGT signaling pathway was confirmed in cellular level. Notably, the forthcoming atherosclerotic plaques were successfully predicted before the plaques could be observed via the naked eye or classical immunofluorescent staining. Collectively, this research proposed a powerful tool to indicate the precise position of mature plaques and provide early warning of atherosclerotic plaques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroarylative Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Diynes to Access Atropisomerically Labile Chiral Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;diynes with three distinct classes of arenes has been realized, enabling highly enantioselective synthesis of a broad range of axially chiral 1,3&#8208;dienes that are conformationally labile. Detailed mechanistic studies have been explored by experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
Axially chiral open&#8208;chained olefins are an underexplored class of atropisomers, whose enantioselective synthesis represents a daunting challenge due to their relatively low racemization barrier. We herein report rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;diynes with three distinct classes of arenes, enabling highly enantioselective synthesis of a broad range of axially chiral 1,3&#8208;dienes that are conformationally labile (&#916;G&#8800;(rac)=26.6&#8211;28.0&#8197;kcal/mol). The coupling reactions in each category proceeded with excellent enantioselectivity, regioselectivity, and Z/E selectivity under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies of the coupling of quinoline N&#8208;oxide system reveal that the reaction proceeds via initial oxidative cyclization of the 1,6&#8208;diyne to give a rhodacyclic intermediate, followed by &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the arene C&#8722;H bond and the Rh&#8722;C(vinyl) bond, with subsequent C&#8722;C reductive elimination being enantio&#8208;determining and turnover&#8208;limiting. The DFT&#8208;established mechanism is consistent with the experimental studies. The coupled products of quinoline N&#8208;oxides undergo facile visible light&#8208;induced intramolecular oxygen&#8208;atom transfer, affording chiral epoxides with complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.

         <title>(3+2) Annulation of 4&#8208;Acetoxy Allenoate with Aldimine Enabled by AgF&#8208;Assisted P(III)/P(V) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgF is capable of converting the enolate&#8208;phosphonium zwitterion into a novel silver enolate&#8208;fluorophosphorane species, which enables the development of (3+2) annulation of 4&#8208;acetoxy allenoate and aldimine via P(III)/P(V) catalysis. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study has demonstrated that the silver enolate moiety offers an alternative approach to realize an asymmetric variant merely by the introduction of an additional chiral PyBox ligand.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) annulation of 4&#8208;acetoxy allenoate and aldimine with the assistance of AgF is described. The success of this reaction hinges on the metathesis between the enolate&#8208;phosphonium zwitterion and AgF, leading to a key intermediate comprising of silver enolate and a fluorophosphorane P(V)&#8208;moiety. The former is able to undergo a Mannich reaction with aldimine, whereas the latter initiates a cascade sequence of AcO&#8208;elimination/aza&#8208;addition, thus furnishing the P(III)/P(V) catalysis. By taking advantage of the silver enolate, a preliminary attempt at an asymmetric variant was conducted with the combination of an achiral phosphine catalyst and a chiral bis(oxazolinyl)pyridine ligand (PyBox), giving moderate enantioselectivity.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensionally Arranged Quantum&#8208;Dot Superstructures Guided by a Supramolecular Polymer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensionally arranged quantum&#8208;dot superstructure has been created by using a supramolecular polymer template composed of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cholesterol derivatives. This superstructure is not obtained by the self&#8208;assembly of the quantum dots in the absence of the template. The closely arranged quantum dots allows efficient energy transfer between them.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit important photophysical properties, such as long&#8208;range energy diffusion, miniband formation, and collective photoluminescence, when aggregated into well&#8208;defined superstructures, such as three&#8208;dimensional (3D) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) superlattices. However, the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) QD superstructures, which have a simpler arrangement, is challenging; therefore, the photophysical properties of 1D&#8208;arranged QDs have not been studied previously. Herein, we report a versatile strategy to obtain 1D&#8208;arranged QDs using a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. The SP is composed of self&#8208;assembling cholesterol derivatives containing two amide groups for hydrogen bonding and a carboxyl group as an adhesion moiety on the QDs. Upon mixing the SP and dispersed QDs in low&#8208;polarity solvents, the QDs self&#8208;adhered to the SP and self&#8208;arranged into 1D superstructures through van der Waals interactions between the surface organic ligands of the QDs, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we revealed efficient photoinduced fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the 1D&#8208;arranged QDs by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the emission spectra and decay curves.

         <title>Exchangeable Self&#8208;Assembled Lanthanide Antennas for PLIM Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a small aqueous&#8208;soluble lanthanide antenna (PAnt) specifically designed to dynamically interact with lanthanide ions and act as an exchangeable dye, aiming at mitigating photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Our self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complex exhibited an exceptional photostability compared to traditional lanthanide cryptates, marking a significant advance in quantitative PLIM bioimaging.







Abstract
Lanthanides have unique photoluminescence (PL) emission properties, including very long PL lifetimes. This makes them ideal for biological imaging applications, especially using PL lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). PLIM is an inherently multidimensional technique with exceptional advantages for quantitative biological imaging. Unfortunately, due to the required prolonged acquisitions times, photobleaching of lanthanide PL emission currently constitutes one of the main drawbacks of PLIM. In this study, we report a small aqueous&#8208;soluble, lanthanide antenna, 8&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrahydrocyclopenta[de]quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;phosphonic acid, PAnt, specifically designed to dynamically interact with lanthanide ions, serving as exchangeable dye aimed at mitigating photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Thus, self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complexes that may be photobleached during image acquisition are continuously replenished by intact lanthanide antennas from a large reservoir. Remarkably, our self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complex clearly demonstrated a significant reduction of PL photobleaching when compared to well&#8208;established lanthanide cryptates, used for bioimaging. This concept of exchangeable lanthanide antennas opens new possibilities for quantitative PLIM bioimaging.

         <title>Modulating Skeletons of Covalent Organic Framework for High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeleton engineering was used to form covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diarylamine derivatives and ionized skeletons, thus overcoming the weak binding ability of Au ions, giving gold adsorbents with high selectivity and uptakes. Experiments and theoretical calculations show that the transition of binding sites from C=N bonds to ionic amine sites, thereby avoiding the protonation process, contributed to enhanced absorbing kinetics.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted considerable attention as adsorbents for capturing and separating gold from electronic wastes. To enhance the binding capture efficiency, constructing hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotraps along the pore walls was one of the most widely adopted approaches. However, the development of absorbing skeletons was ignored due to the weak binding ability of the gold salts (Au). Herein, we demonstrated skeleton engineering to construct highly efficiently absorbs for Au capture. The strong electronic donating feature of diarylamine units enhanced the electronic density of binding sites (imine&#8208;linkage) and thus resulted in high capacities over 1750&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for all three COFs. Moreover, the absorbing performance was further improved via the ionization of diarylamine units. The ionic COF achieved 90&#8201;% of the maximal adsorption capacity, 1.63&#8197;times of that from the charge&#8208;neutral COF within ten minutes, and showed remarkable uptakes of 1834&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, exceptional selectivity (97.45&#8201;%) and cycling stability. The theoretical calculation revealed the binding sites altering from imine bonds to ionic amine sites after ionization of the frameworks, which enabled to bind the AuCl4&#8722; via coulomb force and contributed to enhanced absorbing kinetics. This work inspires us to design molecular/ionic capture based on COFs.

&lt;p&gt;Skeleton engineering was used to form covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diarylamine derivatives and ionized skeletons, thus overcoming the weak binding ability of Au ions, giving gold adsorbents with high selectivity and uptakes. Experiments and theoretical calculations show that the transition of binding sites from C=N bonds to ionic amine sites, thereby avoiding the protonation process, contributed to enhanced absorbing kinetics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted considerable attention as adsorbents for capturing and separating gold from electronic wastes. To enhance the binding capture efficiency, constructing hydrogen-bond nanotraps along the pore walls was one of the most widely adopted approaches. However, the development of absorbing skeletons was ignored due to the weak binding ability of the gold salts (Au). Herein, we demonstrated skeleton engineering to construct highly efficiently absorbs for Au capture. The strong electronic donating feature of diarylamine units enhanced the electronic density of binding sites (imine-linkage) and thus resulted in high capacities over 1750&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for all three COFs. Moreover, the absorbing performance was further improved via the ionization of diarylamine units. The ionic COF achieved 90&#8201;% of the maximal adsorption capacity, 1.63&#8197;times of that from the charge-neutral COF within ten minutes, and showed remarkable uptakes of 1834&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, exceptional selectivity (97.45&#8201;%) and cycling stability. The theoretical calculation revealed the binding sites altering from imine bonds to ionic amine sites after ionization of the frameworks, which enabled to bind the AuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; via coulomb force and contributed to enhanced absorbing kinetics. This work inspires us to design molecular/ionic capture based on COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving the High Capacity and High Stability of Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode in Garnet&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully constructed a high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state battery based on Li&#8208;rich Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode, Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 solid electrolyte and GaN&#8208;modified Li anode. The assembled Li symmetric cell shows quite low interfacial resistance and great interfacial stability, and the full battery shows a high initial capacity, a high capacity retention, a high rate capability and a significantly mitigated voltage decay demonstrating a great potential in high energy density solid&#8208;state battery.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) based on Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) cathodes attract much attention because of their high energy density as well as high safety. But their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we design a three&#8208;dimensional foam&#8208;structured GaN&#8722;Li composite anode and successfully construct a high&#8208;performance SSB based on Co&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) solid electrolyte. The interfacial resistance is considerably reduced to only 1.53&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm2 and the assembled Li symmetric cell is stably cycled more than 10,000&#8197;h at 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The full battery shows a high initial capacity of 245&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and does not show any capacity degradation after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C (&#8776;100&#8201;%). The voltage decay is well suppressed and it is significantly decreased from 2.96&#8197;mV/cycle to only 0.66&#8197;mV/cycle. The SSB also shows a very high rate capability (&#8776;170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C) comparable to a liquid electrolyte&#8208;based battery. Moreover, the oxygen anion redox (OAR) reversibility of LRMO in SSB is much higher than that in liquid electrolyte&#8208;based cells. This study offers a distinct strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance LRMO&#8208;based SSBs and sheds light on the development and application of high&#8208;energy density SSBs.

         <title>A Pyrene&#8208;Fused Dimerized Acceptor for Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 19% Efficiency and High Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pyrene&#8208;fused dimerized acceptor has been synthesized to show extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, low solubility, high glass transition temperature, and low&#8208;lying frontier energy levels, leading to over 19% efficiency and highly stable ternary organic solar cells.







Abstract
A pyrene&#8208;fused dimerized electron acceptor has been successfully synthesized and subsequently incorporated as the third component in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Diverging from the traditional dimerized acceptors with a linear configuration, this novel electron acceptor displays a distinctive &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; structure, comprising two Y&#8208;acceptors as wings fused with a pyrene&#8208;based backbone. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and the electron&#8208;donating nature of pyrene enable the new acceptor to show low solubility, elevated glass transition temperature (Tg), and low&#8208;lying frontier energy levels. Consequently, the new dimerized acceptor seamlessly integrates as the third component into ternary OSCs, enhancing electron transporting properties, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss, and elevating open&#8208;circuit voltage. These merits have enabled the ternary OSCs to show an exceptional efficiency of 19.07%, a marked improvement compared to the 17.6% attained in binary OSCs. More importantly, the high Tg exhibited by the pyrene&#8208;fused electron acceptor helps to stabilize the morphology of the photoactive layer thermal&#8208;treated at 70&#8201;&#176;C, retaining 88.7% efficiency over 600&#8197;hours. For comparison, binary OSCs experience a decline to 73.7% efficiency after the same duration. These results indicate that the &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; design and the incorporation of a pyrene unit is a promising strategy in the development of dimerized electron acceptors for OSCs.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Opportunities for Rational Materials Design in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptional customizability of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has attracted significant interest for function&#8208;oriented materials design. Recent advances in functionalization strategies and constructing COF&#8208;based therapeutic nanoplatforms for cancer therapy are highlighted, and some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are discussed to promote the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines.







Abstract
Nanomedicines are extensively used in cancer therapy. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline organic porous materials with several benefits for cancer therapy, including porosity, design flexibility, functionalizability, and biocompatibility. This review examines the use of COFs in cancer therapy from the perspective of reticular chemistry and function&#8208;oriented materials design. First, the modification sites and functionalization methods of COFs are discussed, followed by their potential as multifunctional nanoplatforms for tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy by integrating functional components. Finally, some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are presented with the hope of promoting the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines and bringing COFs closer to clinical trials.

         <title>Dormancy and double&#8208;activation strategy for construction of high&#8208;performance mixed&#8208;matrix membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient &#8216;dormancy and double&#8208;activation&#8217; strategy was demonstrated to construct highly ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;loaded MMM with quasi&#8208;semi&#8208;continuous channels for rapid CO2 transportation.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) have the potential for energy&#8208;efficient gas separation by matching the superior mass transfer and anti&#8208;plasticization properties of the fillers with processability and scaling up features of the polymers. However, construction of high&#8208;performance MMMs has been prohibited due to low filler&#8208;loading and the existence of interfacial defects. Here, high MOF&#8208;loaded, i.e., 55&#8197;wt&#8201;%, MMMs are developed by a &#8216;dormancy and double&#8208;activation&#8217; (DDA) strategy. High MOF precursor concentration suppresses crystallization in the membrane casting solution, realizing molecular level mixing of all components. Then, the polymeric matrix was formed with uniform encapsulation of MOF nutrients. Subsequently, double&#8208;activation was employed to induce MOF crystallization: the alkali promotes MOFs nucleation to harvest small porous nanocrystals while excessive ligands activate the metal ions to enhance the MOFs conversion. As such, quasi&#8208;semi&#8208;continuous mass transfer channels can be formed in the MMMs by the connected MOFs nanocrystals to boost the gas permeability. The optimized MMM shows significantly ameliorated CO2 permeability, i.e., 2841 Barrer, five&#8208;fold enhancement compared with pristine polymer membrane, with a good CO2/N2 selectivity of 36. Besides, the nanosized MOFs intensify their interaction with polymer chains, endowing the MMMs with good anti&#8208;plasticization behaviour and stability, which advances practical application of MMMs in carbon capture.

Then, the polymeric matrix was formed with uniform encapsulation of MOF nutrients. Subsequently, double-activation was employed to induce MOF crystallization: the alkali promotes MOFs nucleation to harvest small porous nanocrystals while excessive ligands activate the metal ions to enhance the MOFs conversion. As such, quasi-semi-continuous mass transfer channels can be formed in the MMMs by the connected MOFs nanocrystals to boost the gas permeability. The optimized MMM shows significantly ameliorated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability, i.e., 2841 Barrer, five-fold enhancement compared with pristine polymer membrane, with a good CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 36. Besides, the nanosized MOFs intensify their interaction with polymer chains, endowing the MMMs with good anti-plasticization behaviour and stability, which advances practical application of MMMs in carbon capture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Discorhabdin V
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis and full stereochemical assignment of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V was accomplished through a highly convergent strategy enabled by scalable access to the two key components. This highly selective asymmetric approach to nitrogen&#8208;bridged discorhabdins lays the foundation for access to this class of natural products.







Abstract
The discorhabdin natural products are a large subset of pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids with a myriad of biological activities. Despite garnering much synthetic attention, few members have thus far been completed, particularly those featuring a bridging carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond that is found in numerous discorhabdins, including discorhabdin V. Herein we report the first total synthesis and full stereochemical assignment of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V. To access the pyrroloiminoquinone we developed a convergent N&#8208;alkylation/oxidative aminocyclization/bromination cascade that joins two key components, which are both made on multigram scale. An intramolecular Heck reaction then forms the quaternary carbon center in an intermediate containing the carbon&#8208;nitrogen bridge, and a reductive N,O&#8208;acetal cyclization sequence introduces the final piperidine ring. Furthermore, we have established the relative configuration of (+)&#8208;discorhabdin V through experimental NOESY data and DP4 NMR probability calculations. The absolute configuration of the natural product has also been determined by circular dichroism and the use of an amino acid derived chiral starting material. Our work represents one of only two reports of a total synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;bridged discorhabdin and paves the way for future biological evaluation of such compounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Metallacycle for Orthogonal Multimode Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A system with spatially controlled fluorescence&#8208;resonance energy transfer has been built through the incorporation of a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle and a photochromic spiropyran derivative. This approach enables the realization of orthogonal multimode photopatterning including holographic, fluorescent, and photochromic patterning in one integrated system.







Abstract
The development of multimode photopatterning systems based on supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) is considerably attractive in supramolecular chemistry and materials science, because SCCs can serve as promising platforms for the incorporation of multiple functional building blocks. Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle that is constructed by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. By exploiting its fascinating liquid crystal features, bright emission properties, and facile photocyclization capability, a unique system with spatially&#8208;controlled fluorescence&#8208;resonance energy transfer (FRET) is built through the introduction of a photochromic spiropyran derivative, which led to the realization of the first example of a liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle for orthogonal photopatterning in three&#8208;modes, namely holography, fluorescence, and photochromism.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Gating of Selective Bacterial Membrane Interaction and Enhanced Antibacterial Activity for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photoswitchable bio&#8208;interface through ligand functionalization on #2D&#8208;MoS2, achieving differential&#8208;interactions&#8208;based #Gram&#8208;selective antibacterial activity that enables effective wound healing applications. @MrinmoyGroup @funbiomats @iiscbangalore







Abstract
Reversible biointerfaces are essential for on&#8208;demand molecular recognition to regulate stimuli&#8208;responsive bioactivity such as specific interactions with cell membranes. The reversibility on a single platform allows the smart material to kill pathogens or attach/detach cells. Herein, we introduce a 2D&#8208;MoS2 functionalized with cationic azobenzene that interacts selectively with either Gram&#8208;positive or Gram&#8208;negative bacteria in a light&#8208;gated fashion. The trans conformation (trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2) selectively kills Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, whereas the cis form (cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2), under UV light, exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive strains. The mechanistic investigation indicates that the cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 exhibits higher affinity towards the membrane of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria compared to trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2. In case of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 internalizes more efficiently than cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 and generates intracellular ROS to kill the bacteria. While the trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 exhibits strong electrostatic interactions and internalizes faster into Gram&#8208;negative bacterial cells, cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;MoS2 primarily interacts with Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through hydrophobic and H&#8208;bonding interactions. The difference in molecular mechanism leads to photo&#8208;controlled Gram&#8208;selectivity and enhanced antibacterial activity. We found strain&#8208;specific and high bactericidal activity (minimal bactericidal concentration, 0.65&#8197;&#956;g/ml) with low cytotoxicity, which we extended to wound healing applications. This methodology provides a single platform for efficiently switching between conformers to reversibly control the strain&#8208;selective bactericidal activity regulated by light.

         <title>Expanding the Enzymatic Polymerization Landscape by Lipid Mesophase Soft Nanoconfinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzymatic synthesis of dextran in lipidic mesophase catalyzed by the enzyme dextransucrase DSR&#8208;M not only yields polymers at 30&#8201;&#176;C that are six times longer than in bulk solution at identical concentrations of reactants, but also allows the reaction to be carried out in subzero liquid water at temperatures as low as &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Soft nanoconfinement can increase chemical reactivity in nature and has therefore led to considerable interest in transferring this universal feature to artificial biological systems. However, little is known about the underlying principles of soft nanoconfinement responsible for the enhancement of biochemical reactions. Herein we demonstrate how enzymatic polymerization can be expanded, optimized, and engineered when carried out under soft nanoconfinement mediated by lipidic mesophases. By systematically varying the water content in the mesophase and thus the diameter of the confined water nanochannels, we show higher efficiency, turnover rate, and degrees of polymerization as compared to the bulk aqueous solution, all controlled by soft nanoconfinement effects. Furthermore, we exploit the unique properties of unfreezing soft nanoconfined water to perform the first enzymatic polymerization at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in pure aqueous media. These results underpin lipidic mesophases as a versatile host system for chemical reactions and promote them as an original and unexplored platform for enzymatic polymerization.

The radical copolymerzation of benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE; A) with the highly electron&#8208;deficient acrylate monomer pentafluorophenylacrylate (PFA; B) progressed with unique backward isomerization to the penultimate BnVE unit. The isomerization caused the umpolung of the growing species, leading to a periodic consumption in the order AAB, and consequently the copolymer resulting after post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) was degradable under acidic conditions.







Abstract
This study revealed that benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE) shows a peculiar isomerization propagation in its radical copolymerization with an electron&#8208;deficient acrylate carrying a pentafluorophenyl group (PFA). The co&#8208;monomer pair inherently exhibits the cross&#8208;over propagation feature due to the large difference in the electron density. However, the radical species of PFA was found to undergo a backward isomerization to the penultimate BnVE pendant giving a benzyl radical species prior to propagation with BnVE. The isomerization brings a drastic change in the character of the growing radical species from electrophilic to nucleophilic, and thus the isomerized benzyl radial species propagates with PFA. Consequently, the two monomers were consumed in the order AAB (A: PFA; B: BnVE) and the unique periodic consumption was confirmed by the pseudo&#8208;reactivity ratios calculated by the penultimate model: r11=0.174 and r21=6600 for PFA (M1) with BnVE (M2). The pentafluorophenyl ester groups of the resulting copolymers are transformed into ester and amide groups by post&#8208;polymerization alcoholysis and aminolysis modifications. The unique isomerization in the AAB sequence allowed the periodic introduction of a benzyl ether structure in the backbone leading to efficient degradation under acid conditions.

Abstract
The development of potent adjuvants is an important step for improving the performance of subunit vaccines. CD1d agonists, such as the prototypical &#945;&#8208;galactosyl ceramide (&#945;&#8208;GalCer), are of special interest due to their ability to activate iNKT cells and trigger rapid dendritic cell maturation and B&#8208;cell activation. Herein, we introduce a novel derivatization hotspot at the &#945;&#8208;GalCer skeleton, namely the N&#8208;substituent at the amide bond. The multicomponent diversification of this previously unexplored glycolipid chemotype space permitted the introduction of a variety of extra functionalities that can either potentiate the adjuvant properties or serve as handles for further conjugation to antigens toward the development of self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccines. This strategy led to the discovery of compounds eliciting enhanced antigen&#8208;specific T cell stimulation and a higher antibody response when delivered by either the parenteral or the mucosal route, as compared to a known potent CD1d agonist. Notably, various functionalized &#945;&#8208;GalCer analogues showed a more potent adjuvant effect after intranasal immunization than a PEGylated &#945;&#8208;GalCer analogue previously optimized for this purpose. Ultimately, this work could open multiple avenues of opportunity for the use of mucosal vaccines against microbial infections.

         <title>Effect of Feature Shape and Dimension of a Confinement Geometry on Selectivity of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the relationship between confined space and product selectivity, a wrinkle structure was used as a model for confined spaces. The shape and dimension of the wrinkle can be systematically controlled at nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale. The systematic control of the wrinkle model has revealed that the selectivities for CH4, C2H4, and EtOH are influenced differently by the shape and dimension of the confined space.







Abstract
The local confinement effect, which can generate a high concentration of hydroxide ions and reaction intermediates near the catalyst surface, is an important strategy for converting CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon products in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Therefore, understanding how the shape and dimension of the confinement geometry affect the product selectivity is crucial. In this study, we report for the first time the effect of the shape (degree of confinement) and dimension of the confined space on the product selectivity without changing the intrinsic property of Cu. We demonstrate that geometry influences the outcomes of products, such as CH4, C2H4, and EtOH, in different ways: the selectivity of CH4 and EtOH is affected by shape, while the selectivity of C2H4 is influenced by dimension of geometry predominantly. These phenomena are demonstrated, both experimentally and through simulation, to be induced by the local confinement effect within the confined structure. Our geometry model could serve as basis for designing the confined structures tailored for the production of specific products.

         <title>Tipping the Balance Between the bcc and fcc Phase Within the Alkali and Coinage Metal Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relativistic density functional calculations for the cuboidal phase transition show that small effects such as dispersion interactions and phonon contributions can tip the balance between the body&#8208;centered and face&#8208;centered cubic structures shedding light into the difference between the Groups&#8197;1 and 11 elements in the Periodic Table.







Abstract
Why the Group&#8197;1 elements crystallize in the body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure, and the iso&#8208;electronic Group&#8197;11 elements in the face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structure, remains a mystery. Here we show that a delicate interplay between many&#8208;body effects, vibrational contributions and dispersion interactions obtained from relativistic density functional theory offers an answer to this long&#8208;standing controversy. It also sheds light on the Periodic Table of Crystal Structures. A smooth diffusionless transition through cuboidal lattices gives a detailed insight into the bcc&#8594;fcc phase transition for the Groups&#8197;1 and 11 elements.

         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free protocol for Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation of O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;Nucleophiles using nontoxic, solid allyl trimethylammonium chloride as alternative allylating agent is presented. This method features fast reaction kinetics, very low catalyst loadings, high yields, mild conditions, and high functional group tolerance. Its potential for late&#8208;stage modifications of bioactive compounds is demonstrated through multiple examples.







Abstract
We present the first solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemical protocol for a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation. This approach features exceptionally low catalyst loadings (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), short reaction times (&lt;90&#8197;min), and a simple setup, eliminating the need for air or moisture precautions, making the process highly efficient and environmentally benign. We introduce solid, nontoxic, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle allyl trimethylammonium salts as valuable alternative to volatile or hazardous reagents. Our approach enables the allylation of various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles in yields up to 99&#8201;% even for structurally complex bioactive compounds, owing to its mild conditions and exceptional functional group tolerance.

Ethylene polymerization catalyst prepared by grafting Cr[CH(SiMe3)2]3 on SiO2 contains well&#8208;defined Cr(III) alkyl surface sites, as shown using a combination of ML&#8208;supported&#8208;XAS and EPR spectroscopies. Furthermore, it is also possible to show by EPR that Cr(III) alkyl sites are competent for olefin insertion.







Abstract
The ethylene polymerization Phillips catalyst has been employed for decades and is central to the polymer industry. While Cr(III) alkyl species are proposed to be the propagating sites, there is so far no direct experimental evidence for such proposal. In this work, by coupling Surface organometallic chemistry, EPR spectroscopy, and machine learning&#8208;supported XAS studies, we have studied the electronic structure of well&#8208;defined silica&#8208;supported Cr(III) alkyls and identified the presence of several surface species in high and low&#8208;spin states, associated with different coordination environments. Notably, low&#8208;spin Cr(III) sites are shown to participate in ethylene polymerization, indicating that similar Cr(III) alkyl species could be involved in the related Phillips catalyst.

         <title>Magnetic Circular Dichroism Elucidates Molecular Interactions in Aggregated Chiral Organic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic circular dichroism gives access to the geometry and interactions leading to the supramolecular structure of a thin film of an organic chiral molecule. The technique presented here may be applied to elucidate the structures of aggregates of organic compounds.







Abstract
Chiral materials formed by aggregated organic compounds play a fundamental role in chiral optoelectronics, photonics and spintronics. Nonetheless, a precise understanding of the molecular interactions involved remains an open problem. Here we introduce magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) as a new tool to elucidate molecular interactions and structural parameters of a supramolecular system. A detailed analysis of MCD together with electronic circular dichroism spectra combined to ab initio calculations unveils essential information on the geometry and energy levels of a self&#8208;assembled thin film made of a carbazole di&#8208;bithiophene chiral molecule. This approach can be extended to a generality of chiral organic materials and can help rationalizing the fundamental interactions leading to supramolecular order. This in turn could enable a better understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships, resulting in a more efficient material design.

         <title>Diphosphine Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chelate&#8208;Assisted Inner&#8208;Selective Migratory Hydroarylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed migratory &#946;&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl ketones and alkenyl azahetereoarenes have been realized with aryl boronic acids using alkyl halide as the mild hydride source. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope and incredible heterocycle compatibility, providing a variety of &#946;&#8208;aryl or &#8208;alkenyl ketones or heteroarenes in moderate to high yields.







Abstract
The precise control of the regioselectivity in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed migratory hydrofunctionalization of alkenes remains a big challenge. With a transient ketimine directing group, the nickel&#8208;catalyzed migratory &#946;&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl ketones has been realized with aryl boronic acids using alkyl halide as the mild hydride source for the first time. The key to this success is the use of a diphosphine ligand, which is capable of the generation of a Ni(II)&#8208;H species in the presence of alkyl bromide, and enabling the efficient migratory insertion of alkene into Ni(II)&#8208;H species and the sequent rapid chain walking process. The present approach diminishes organosilanes reductant, tolerates a wide array of complex functionalities with excellent regioselective control. Moreover, this catalytic system could also be applied to the migratory hydroarylation of alkenyl azahetereoarenes, thus providing a general approach for the preparation of 1,2&#8208;aryl heteroaryl motifs with wide potential applications in pharmaceutical discovery.

         <title>Exploring Superacid&#8208;Promoted Skeletal Reorganization of Aliphatic Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rearrangement of isopropyl&#8208;containing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds allows the skeletal reorganization to cyclic and elongated functionalized systems. An unprecedented tandem C&#8722;N bond cleavage / C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formation through the generation of a dication is shown.







Abstract
Here we report a method to reorganize the core structure of aliphatic unsaturated nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates exploiting polyprotonation in superacid solutions. The superelectrophilic activation of N&#8208;isopropyl systems allows for the selective formal Csp3&#8722;H activation/cyclization or homologation / functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates. This study also reveals that this skeletal reorganization can be controlled through protonation interplay. The mechanism of this process involves an original sequence of C&#8722;N bond cleavage, isopropyl cation generation and subsequent C&#8722;N bond and C&#8722;C bond formation. This was demonstrated through in situ NMR analysis and labelling experiments, also confirmed by DFT calculations.

Novel LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu intermetallics were prepared. In these compounds, the 5d orbital of La transfers electrons to the 4d orbital of Ru, which provides adsorption sites for H*. The 3d orbitals of Ni and Co interact with the 5d and 4d orbitals to generate an anisotropic electron distribution, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of OH*. The synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons ensures efficient catalytic activity.







Abstract
Despite the fact that d&#8208;band center theory links the d electron structure of transition metals to their catalytic activity, it is yet unknown how the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons impacts catalytic performance. Herein, novel LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu intermetallics containing 5d, 4d, and 3d electrons were prepared. In these compounds, the 5d orbital of La transfers electrons to the 4d orbital of Ru, which provides adsorption sites for H*. The 3d orbitals of Ni and Co interact with the 5d and 4d orbitals to generate an anisotropic electron distribution, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of OH*. The synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons ensures efficient catalytic activity. The optimized LaNi0.5Co0.5Ru has an overpotential of 43mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Beyond offering a variety of new electrocatalysts, this work reveals the multi&#8208;d electron synergy in promoting catalytic reaction.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Free Exciton Emission in a Quasi&#8208;Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic connectivity of quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halide (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 is significantly elevated upon compression, leading to the generation and intensity enhancement of free exciton emission.







Abstract
Structural dimensionality and electronic dimensionality play a crucial role in determining the type of excitonic emission in hybrid metal halides (HMHs). It is important but challenging to achieve free exciton (FE) emission in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) HMHs based on the control over the electronic dimensionality. In this work, a quasi&#8208;0D HMH (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 with localized electronic dimensionality is prepared as a prototype model. With increasing pressure onto (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4, the broad and weak self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission at ambient conditions is considerably enhanced before 3.6&#8197;GPa, which originates from more distorted [PbBr4]2&#8722; seesaw units upon compression. Notably, a narrow FE emission in (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 appears at 3.6&#8197;GPa, and then this FE emission is gradually strengthened up to 8.4&#8197;GPa. High pressure structural characterizations reveal that anisotropic contraction of (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 results in a noticeable reduction in the distance between adjacent [PbBr4]2&#8722; seesaw units, as well as an obvious enhancement of crystal stiffness.

     alt="Pressure-Induced Free Exciton Emission in a Quasi-Zero-Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronic connectivity of quasi-zero-dimensional hybrid metal halide (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is significantly elevated upon compression, leading to the generation and intensity enhancement of free exciton emission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural dimensionality and electronic dimensionality play a crucial role in determining the type of excitonic emission in hybrid metal halides (HMHs). It is important but challenging to achieve free exciton (FE) emission in zero-dimensional (0D) HMHs based on the control over the electronic dimensionality. In this work, a quasi-0D HMH (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with localized electronic dimensionality is prepared as a prototype model. With increasing pressure onto (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the broad and weak self-trapped exciton (STE) emission at ambient conditions is considerably enhanced before 3.6&#8197;GPa, which originates from more distorted [PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; seesaw units upon compression. Notably, a narrow FE emission in (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; appears at 3.6&#8197;GPa, and then this FE emission is gradually strengthened up to 8.4&#8197;GPa.

         <title>Enzymatic Fluoromethylation as a Tool for ATP&#8208;Independent Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report shows that methyltransferase&#8208;mediated fluoromethylation can activate small and large carboxylate substrates for conjugation to thiols, hydrazine, hydroxylamine or amines. This methodology to produce anhydrides offers an alternative to the much more common ATP&#8208;dependent processes observed in nature and utilized in biocatalysis.







Abstract
S&#8208;adenosylmethionine&#8208;dependent methyltransferases are involved in countless biological processes, including signal transduction, epigenetics, natural product biosynthesis, and detoxification. Only a handful of carboxylate methyltransferases have evolved to participate in amide bond formation. In this report we show that enzyme&#8208;catalyzed F&#8208;methylation of carboxylate substrates produces F&#8208;methyl esters that readily react with N&#8208; or S&#8208;nucleophiles under physiological conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to the synthesis of small amides, hydroxamates, and thioesters, as well as to site&#8208;specific protein modification and native chemical ligation.

         <title>Bent &#960;&#8208;Conjugation within a Macrocycle: Asymmetric Total Syntheses of Spirohexenolides A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric total synthesis of spirotetronate polyketides spirohexenolides A and B is reported. This synthesis features a ring&#8208;closing metathesis macrocyclization followed by double dehydration to achieve the C15 macrocycle with the unprecedented deformed nonplanar 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation.







Abstract
Macrocycles with bent &#960;&#8208;conjugation motif are extremely rare in nature and synthetically daunting and anticancer haouamines and spirohexenolides were representative of such rare natural products with synthetically challenging bent &#960;&#8208;conjugation within a macrocycle. While the total synthesis of haouamines has been elegantly achieved, spirohexenolides remains an unmet synthetic challenge due to the highly strained bent 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation within C15 macrocycle. Inspired by the chemical synthesis of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) and haouamines, herein we devise a synthetic strategy to overcome the highly strained bent 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation within the macrocycle and achieve the first, asymmetric total synthesis of spirohexenolides&#8197;A (&gt;20&#8197;mg) and&#8197;B (&gt;50&#8197;mg). Our synthesis features strategic design of ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) macrocyclization followed by double dehydration to achieve the C15 macrocycle with the deformed nonplanar 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation. In addition, we have developed a new enantioselective construction of highly functionalized spirotetronate fragment (northeast moiety) through RCM and Ireland&#8211;Claisen rearrangement. Our in vitro bioassay studies reveal that both spirohexenolides are cytotoxic against a panel of human cancer cells with IC50 1.2&#8211;13.3&#8197;&#956;M and spirohexenolide A is consistently more potent (up to 3&#8197;times) than spirohexenolide B, suggesting the importance of alcohol for their bioactivity and for medicinal chemistry development.

         <title>Cesium Cyclopropane Acid&#8208;Aided Crystal Growth Enables Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Moisture Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using cesium cyclopropane acids (C3) gives high crystallization quality in an all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br prepared in a wide ambient moisture window (RH: 25&#8211;65&#8201;%). The resultant CsPbI2Br solar cells exhibit a high efficiency (&gt;17&#8201;%) and excellent environmental stability. The vaporization enthalpy of the side product DMA&#8208;acid (adjustable by C3 loads) modifies the perovskite crystallization and device performance under different humidity.







Abstract
While all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites (iHPs) are promising photovoltaic materials, the associated water sensitivity of iHPs calls for stringent humidity control to reach satisfactory photovoltaic efficiencies. Herein, we report a moisture&#8208;insensitive perovskite formation route under ambient air for CsPbI2Br&#8208;based iHPs via cesium cyclopropane acids (C3) as a compound introducer. With this approach, appreciably enhanced crystallization quality and moisture tolerance of CsPbI2Br are attained. The improvements are attributed to the modified evaporation enthalpy of the volatile side product of DMA&#8208;acid initiated by Cs&#8208;acids. As such, the water&#8208;involving reaction is directed toward the DMA&#8208;acids, leaving the target CsPbI2Br perovskites insensitive to ambient humidity. We highlight that by controlling the C3 concentration, the dependence of power conversion efficiency (PCE) in CsPbI2Br devices on the humidity level during perovskite film formation becomes favorably weakened, with the PCEs remaining relatively high (&gt;15&#8201;%) associated with improved device stability for RH levels changed from 25&#8201;% to 65&#8201;%. The champion solar cells yield an impressive PCE exceeding 17&#8201;%, showing small degradations (&lt;10&#8201;%) for 2000&#8197;hours of shell storage and 300&#8197;hours of 85/85 (temperature/humidity) tests. The demonstrated C3&#8208;based strategy provides an enabler for improving the long&#8208;sought moisture&#8208;stability of iHPs toward high photovoltaic device performance.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of C&#8722;O Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers by NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Desymmetrization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective synthesis of C&#8722;O axially chiral diaryl ethers is demonstrated by the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective esterification of dialdehyde containing diaryl ethers. The reaction proceeds via a desymmetrization of isophthalaldehyde derivatives bearing prochiral dual C&#8722;O axis affording atropoisomeric diaryl ethers with broad scope under mild conditions.







Abstract
Axially chiral diaryl ethers, a distinguished class of atropisomers possessing unique dual C&#8722;O axis, hold immense potential for diverse research domains. In contrast to the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of conventional single axis bearing atropisomers, the atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral ethers containing flexible C&#8722;O axis remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via atroposelective esterification of dialdehyde&#8208;containing diaryl ethers. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds via NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy to afford the corresponding axially chiral diaryl ether atropisomers in good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. The derivatization of the synthesized product expands the utility of present strategy via access to a library of C&#8722;O axially chiral compounds. The temperature dependency and preliminary investigations on the racemization barrier of C&#8722;O bonds are also presented.

Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds via NHC-catalyzed desymmetrization strategy to afford the corresponding axially chiral diaryl ether atropisomers in good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. The derivatization of the synthesized product expands the utility of present strategy via access to a library of C&#8722;O axially chiral compounds. The temperature dependency and preliminary investigations on the racemization barrier of C&#8722;O bonds are also presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Capturing Doublet Intermediate Emitters by Chemically Crosslinking Confinement towards Spatiotemporal Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical intermediates with red emission are captured by a strategy of chemically crosslinked confinement. The emitters have unique photochemical activity and work in spatiotemporal encryption.







Abstract
Photoluminescence is one of the most meticulous ways to manipulate light energy. Typical photoluminescent emitters are mostly stable substances with a pure photophysical process of spontaneous photon&#8208;emission from their excited states. Intermediate emitters are elusive attributing to their synchronous energy transfer process including photophysical and incomplete photochemical pathways. An intermediate emitter containing radicals is more difficult to be observed due to its inherent chemical reactivity. Here, these challenges are overcome by spontaneously formed space limitations in polymer crosslinking networks meanwhile chemically active intermediates are captured. These doublet intermediates exhibit unique long&#8208;wavelength emissions under chemically crosslinking confinement conditions, and their luminous mechanism provides a novel perspective for designing intermediate emitters with liquid&#8208;crystal character and photoresponsive features towards spatiotemporal encryption, promising for the detection of photochemical reactions and the development of fascinating luminescent systems.

         <title>Paired Electrosynthesis of Formaldehyde Derivatives from CO2 Reduction and Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing CO2&#8208;derived formaldehyde&#8208;derivatives for fuel additive or polymer synthesis is a promising approach to reduce net carbon dioxide emissions. Existing methodologies involve converting CO2 to methanol by thermal hydrogenation, followed by electrochemical or thermochemical oxidation to produce formaldehyde. Adding to the conventional methanol oxidation pathway, we propose a new electrochemical approach to simultaneously generate formaldehyde&#8208;derivatives at both electrodes by partial methanol oxidation and the direct reduction of CO2. To achieve this, a method to directly reduce CO2 to formaldehyde at the cathode is required. Still, it has been scarcely reported previously due to the acidity of the formic acid intermediate and the facile over&#8208;reduction of formaldehyde to methanol. By enabling the activation and subsequent stabilization of formic acid and formaldehyde respectively in methanol solvent, we were able to implement a strategy where formaldehyde derivatives were generated at the cathode alongside the anode. Further mechanism studies revealed that protons supplied from the anodic reaction contribute to the activation of formic acid and the stabilization of the formaldehyde product. Additionally, it was found that the cathodic formaldehyde derivative Faradaic efficiency can be further increased through prolonged electrolysis time up to 50% along with a maximum anodic formaldehyde derivative Faradaic efficiency of 90%.</dc:description>

         <title>Click&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Mediated Cell Membrane Glycopolymer Engineering to Potentiate Dendritic Cell Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendritic cell vaccine (DCV) holds great potential in tumor immunotherapy owing to its potent ability in eliciting tumor&#8208;specific immune responses. Aiming at engineering enhanced DCV, we report the first effort to construct a glycopolymer&#8208;engineered DC vaccine (G&#8208;DCV) via metabolic cell surface sugar engineering and copper&#8208;free click&#8208;chemistry. Model G&#8208;DCV was prepared by firstly delivering tumor antigens, ovalbumin (OVA) into dendritic cells (DC) with fluoroalkane&#8208;grafted polyethyleneimines, followed by conjugating glycopolymers with a terminal group of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) onto dendritic cells. Compared to unmodified DCV, our G&#8208;DCV could induce stronger T cell activation due to the enhanced adhesion between DCs and T cells. Notably, such G&#8208;DCV could more effectively inhibit the growth of the mouse B16&#8208;OVA (expressing OVA antigen) tumor model after adoptive transfer. Moreover, by combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, G&#8208;DCV shows further increased anti&#8208;tumor effects in treating different tumor models. Thus, our work provides a novel strategy to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of DC vaccines.</dc:description>

         <title>Cable Bacteria Skeletons as Catalytically Active Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cable bacteria are multicellular, filamentous bacteria that use internal conductive fibers to transport electrons over centimeter distances from donors within anoxic sediment layers to oxygen at the surface. We extracted the fibers and used them as free&#8208;standing bio&#8208;based electrodes to investigate their electrocatalytic behavior. The fibers catalyzed the reversible interconversion of oxygen and water, and an electric current was running through the fibers even when the potential difference was generated solely by a gradient of oxygen concentration. Oxygen reduction as well as oxygen evolution were confirmed by optical measurements. Within living cable bacteria, oxygen reduction by direct electrocatalysis on the fibers and not by membrane&#8208;bound proteins readily explains exceptionally high cell&#8208;specific oxygen consumption rates observed in the oxic zone, while electrocatalytic water oxidation may provide oxygen to cells in the anoxic zone.</dc:description>

         <title>Subnanometric Bismuth Clusters Confined in Pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 Enable Remarkable CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly efficient photocatalysts for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) into chemical fuels is of great importance for energy sustainability and carbon resource utilization. Herein, we demonstrated a facile hydrothermal method for in&#8208;situ construction of subnanometric Bi metallic clusters in pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 frameworks, leading to the remarkable improvements of photocatalytic performances for CO2 reduction into CO in the absence of sacrificial reagent. More specifically, an outstanding CO evolution activity of 114.1 &#181;mol&#8226;g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1 has been achieved, more than 20&#8208;fold improvement compared with the pristine Bi2Sn2O7 (5.7 &#181;mol&#8226;g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1). Detailed experiments together with in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the spatially confined Bi clusters could significantly promote charge&#8208;separation/electron&#8208;enrichment and adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, which provides highly efficient reaction channels to facilitate the generation of *COOH intermediate as well as the subsequent desorption of *CO towards CO formation. These demonstrations provide an important knowledge for precise design and fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion into solar fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Luminophore for Activatable Ultrasensitive In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Afterglow luminescence imaging probes, with long&#8208;lived emission after cessation of light excitation, have drawn increasing attention in biomedical imaging field. However, current afterglow agents always suffer from an unsatisfactory signal intensity and complex systems consisting of multiple ingredients. To address these issues, this study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow luminophore (TPP&#8208;DO) by chemical conjugation of an afterglow substrate and a photosensitizer acting as both an afterglow initiator and an energy relay unit into a single molecule, resulting in an intramolecular energy transfer process to improve the afterglow brightness. The constructed TPP&#8208;DO NPs emit a strong NIR afterglow luminescence with a signal intensity of up to 108 p/s/cm2/sr at a low concentration of 10 &#956;M and a low irradiation power density of 0.05 W/cm2, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than most existing organic afterglow probes. The highly bright NIR afterglow luminescence with minimized background from TPP&#8208;DO NPs allows a deep tissue penetration depth of 6 cm thickness. Moreover, we develop a GSH&#8208;activatable afterglow probe (Q&#8208;TPP&#8208;DO NPs) for ultrasensitive detection of subcutaneous tumor with the smallest tumor volume of 0.048 mm3, demonstrating the high potential for early diagnosis and imaging&#8208;guided surgical resection of tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Modulated 2D Coordination Polymers for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis under Air and Pure Water Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2O2 is a widely used eco&#8208;friendly oxidant and a potential energy carrier. Photocatalytic H2O2 production from water and O2 is an ideal approach with the potential to address the current energy crisis and environmental issues.Three zig&#8208;zag two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D CPs), named CuX&#8208;dptz, were synthesized by a rapid and facile method at room temperature, showing preeminent H2O2 photoproduction performance under pure water and open air without any additives. CuBr&#8208;dptz exhibits a H2O2 production rate high up to 1874 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, exceeding most reported photocatalysts under this condition, even comparable to those supported by sacrificial agents and O2. The coordination environment of Cu can be modulated by halogen atoms (X = Cl, Br, I), which in turn affects the electron transfer process and finally determines the reaction activity.This is the first time that 2D CPs have been used for photocatalytic H2O2 production in such challenging conditions, which provides a new pathway for the development of portable in&#8208;situ H2O2 photosynthesis devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanoinhibitor Targeting cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway to Reverse the Homeostatic Imbalance of Inflammation in Psoriasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psoriasis is a chronic skin inflammation characterized by dysregulated crosstalk between immune cells and keratinocytes. Here we show that the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a key regulator of psoriatic inflammation in a mouse model. Platinum&#8208;doped positively charged carbon dots (Pt&#8208;CDs) were designed to inhibit the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. By inhibiting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway with Pt&#8208;CDs, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages was reduced, and the proinflammatory cytokines&#8208;induced breakdown of immunological tolerance and overexpression of chemokines in keratinocytes was restored, which reversed the homeostatic imbalance through breaking these cytokines&#8208;mediated intercellular positive feedback loop. Topical Pt&#8208;CDs treatment exhibited therapeutic effects in imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mice without noticeable toxicity. The reversal of elevated expression of STING, phosphorylated STING, and downstream genes within psoriatic lesions indicates that Pt&#8208;CDs effectively inhibit the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. This work suggests a promising strategy for psoriasis treatment by targeting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway with Pt&#8208;CDs nanoinhibitor to restore skin homeostatic balance.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning on Singlet Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Photo&#8208;Oxidation by Outer&#8208;Sphere Microenvironment Modulation in Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) is ubiquitously involved in various photocatalytic oxidation reactions; however, efficient and selective production of 1O2 is still challenging. Herein, we reported the synthesis of nickel porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating functional groups with different electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing features on their pore walls. These functional groups established a dedicated outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment surrounding the Ni catalytic center that tunes the activity of the COFs for 1O2&#8208;mediated thioether oxidation. With the increase of the electron&#8208;donating ability of functional groups, the modulated outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment turns on the catalytic activity from a yield of nearly zero by the cyano group functionalized COF to an excellent yield of 98% by the methoxy group functionalized one. Electronic property investigation and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the distinct excitonic behaviors attributed to the diverse band energy levels and orbital composition are responsible for the discriminative activity. This study represents the first regulation of generating reactive oxygen species based on the strategy of outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment modulation in COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Nanoparticle Conjugates for Highly Sensitive and Versatile Sensing Using 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI) has emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional 1H MRI due to enhanced specificity deriving from negligible background signal in this modality. We report a dual nanoparticle conjugate (DNC) platform as an aptamer&#8208;based sensor for use in 19F MRI. DNC consists of core&#8208;shell nanoparticles with a liquid perfluorocarbon core and a mesoporous silica shell (19F&#8208;MSNs), which give a robust 19F MR signal, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as magnetic quenchers. Due to the strong magnetic quenching effects of SPIONs, this platform is uniquely sensitive and functions with a low concentration of SPIONs (4 equivalents) relative to 19F&#8208;MSNs. The probe functions as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor using target&#8208;induced dissociation of DNA aptamers. The thrombin binding aptamer was incorporated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept (DNCThr), and we demonstrate a significant increase in 19F MR signal intensity when DNCThr is incubated with human &#945;&#8208;thrombin. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept probe is highly versatile and can be adapted to sense ATP and kanamycin as well. Importantly, DNCThr generates a robust 19F MRI &#8220;hot&#8208;spot&#8221; signal in response to thrombin in live mice, establishing this platform as a practical, versatile, and biologically relevant molecular imaging probe.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The cyclopropyl group is of great importance in medicinal chemistry, as it can be leveraged to influence a range of pharmaceutical properties in drug molecules. This report describes a Vitamin B12&#8208;photocatalyzed approach for the cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) as the methylene source. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, has excellent functional group compatibility, and is highly chemoselective. The scope could also be extended to the preparation of D2&#8208;cyclopropyl and methyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropyl adducts starting from CD2Cl2 and 1,1&#8208;dichloroethane, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Acylsulfenamides from (Hetero)aryl Iodides and Boronic Acids by One&#8208;Pot Sulfur&#8208;Arylation and Dealkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general one&#8208;pot approach to diverse N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from a common S&#8208;phenethylsulfenamide starting material is reported. This approach was demonstrated by C&#8208;S bond formation utilizing commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids to provide sulfilimine intermediates that undergo thermal elimination of styrene. In contrast, all prior approaches to N&#8208;acylsulfenamides rely on thiol inputs to introduce sulfenamide S&#8208;substituents. A broad scope of reaction inputs was demonstrated including for approved drugs and drug precursors with dense display of functionality. Several different types of sulfur functionalization were performed on a sulfenamide derived from a complex precursor of the blockbuster anticoagulant drug apixaban, highlighting the utility of this approach for the introduction of high oxidation state sulfur groups in complex bioactive compounds. Mechanistic studies established that the key styrene elimination step proceeds by a concerted elimination that does not require reagents or catalysts, and therefore, this one&#8208;pot approach should be applicable to the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides utilizing diverse electrophiles and reaction conditions for C&#8208;S bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Modification Strategy to Modulate Reaction Microenvironment for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulation of the microenvironment on the electrode surface is one of the effective means to improve the efficiency of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (eCO&#8322;RR). To achieve high conversion rates, the phase boundary at the electrode surface should be finely controlled to overcome the limitation of CO&#8322;&#160;solubility in the aqueous electrolyte. Herein, we developed a simple and efficient method to structure electrocatalyst with a superhydrophobic surface microenvironment&#160;by one&#8208;step co&#8208;electrodeposition of Cu and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on carbon paper. The superhydrophobic Cu&#8208;based electrode displayed a high ethylene (C&#8322;H&#8324;) selectivity with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 67.3% at &#8722;1.25 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an H&#8208;type cell, which is 2.5 times higher than a regular Cu electrode without PTFE. By using PTFE as a surface modifier, the activity of eCO&#8322;RR is enhanced and water (proton) adsorption is inhibited.

To achieve high conversion rates, the phase boundary at the electrode surface should be finely controlled to overcome the limitation of CO&#8322;&#160;solubility in the aqueous electrolyte. Herein, we developed a simple and efficient method to structure electrocatalyst with a superhydrophobic surface microenvironment&#160;by one-step co-electrodeposition of Cu and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on carbon paper. The superhydrophobic Cu-based electrode displayed a high ethylene (C&#8322;H&#8324;) selectivity with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 67.3% at &#8722;1.25 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an H-type cell, which is 2.5 times higher than a regular Cu electrode without PTFE. By using PTFE as a surface modifier, the activity of eCO&#8322;RR is enhanced and water (proton) adsorption is inhibited. This strategy has the potential to be applied to other gas-conversion electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three in One: Three Different Molybdates Trapped in a Thiacalix[4]arene Protected Ag72 Nanocluster for Structural Transformation and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) represent crucial intermediates in the formation of insoluble metal oxides from soluble metal ions, however, the rapid hydrolysis&#8208;condensation kinetics of MoVI or WVI makes the direct characterization of coexisted molecular species in a given medium extremely difficult. Silver nanoclusters have shown versatile capacity to encapsulate diverse POMs, which provides an alternative scene to appreciate landscape of POMs in atomic precision. Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene protected silver nanocluster (Ag72b) that simultaneously encapsulates three kinds of molybdates (MoO42&#8208;, Mo6O228&#8208; and Mo7O258&#8208;) in situ transformed from classic Lindqvist Mo6O192&#8208;, providing more deep understanding on the structural diversity and condensation growth route of POMs in solution. Ag72b is the first silver nanocluster trapping so many kinds of molybdates, which in turn exert collective template effect to aggregate silver atoms into a nanocluster.  The post&#8208;reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc or PhCOOAg  produces a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a) or an Ag28 nanocluster based 1D chain structure (Ag28a), respectively. Moreover, the post&#8208;synthesized Ag28a can be utilized as potential ignition material for further application. This work not only provides an important model for unlocking dynamic features of POMs at atom&#8208;precise level but also pioneers a promising approach to synthesize silver nanoclusters from known to unknown.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiolation for Enhancing Photostability of Fluorophores at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule imaging can elucidate the intricate biomolecular dynamics in vivo. We present a straightforward thiolation of squaraine that enhances its photobleaching lifetime by approximately fivefold at the single molecule level. This advancement allows for extended single&#8208;molecule tracking of the membrane protein CD56 in live cells, effectively tripling the duration of our observations.







Abstract
Fluorescent probes are essential for single&#8208;molecule imaging. However, their application in biological systems is often limited by the short photobleaching lifetime. To overcome this, we developed a novel thiolation strategy for squaraine dyes. By introducing thiolation of the central cyclobutene of squaraine (thio&#8208;squaraine), we observed a &#8776;5&#8208;fold increase in photobleaching lifetime. Our single&#8208;molecule data analysis attributes this improvement to improved photostability resulting from thiolation. Interestingly, bulk measurements show rapid oxidation of thio&#8208;squaraine to its oxo&#8208;analogue under irradiation, giving the perception of inferior photostability. This discrepancy between bulk and single&#8208;molecule environments can be ascribed to the factors in the latter, including larger intermolecular distances and restricted mobility, which reduce the interactions between a fluorophore and reactive oxygen species produced by other fluorophores, ultimately impacting photobleaching and photoconversion rate. We demonstrate the remarkable performance of thio&#8208;squaraine probes in various imaging buffers, such as glucose oxidase with catalase (GLOX) and GLOX+trolox. We successfully employed these photostable probes for single&#8208;molecule tracking of CD56 membrane protein and monitoring mitochondria movements in live neurons. CD56 tracking revealed distinct motion states and the corresponding protein fractions. This investigation is expected to propel the development of single&#8208;molecule imaging probes, particularly in scenarios where bulk measurements show suboptimal performance.

         <title>Reconstitution of the Final Steps in the Biosynthesis of Valanimycin Reveals the Origin of Its Characteristic Azoxy Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final steps of valanimycin biosynthesis have been reconstituted in vitro. The oxidation of a dialkyl hydrazine intermediate to the characteristic azoxy moiety in valanimycin is catalyzed by VlmB, which is a non&#8208;heme diiron enzyme. The VlmB&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;electron oxidation may commence with a resting &#956;&#8208;oxo diferric complex without prior reduction.







Abstract
Valanimycin is an azoxy&#8208;containing natural product isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces viridifaciens MG456&#8208;hF10. While the biosynthesis of valanimycin has been partially characterized, how the azoxy group is constructed remains obscure. Herein, the membrane protein VlmO and the putative hydrazine synthetase ForJ from the formycin biosynthetic pathway are demonstrated to catalyze N&#8722;N bond formation converting O&#8208;(l&#8208;seryl)&#8208;isobutyl hydroxylamine into N&#8208;(isobutylamino)&#8208;l&#8208;serine. Subsequent installation of the azoxy group is shown to be catalyzed by the non&#8208;heme diiron enzyme VlmB in a reaction in which the N&#8722;N single bond in the VlmO/ForJ product is oxidized by four electrons to yield the azoxy group. The catalytic cycle of VlmB appears to begin with a resting &#956;&#8208;oxo diferric complex in VlmB, as supported by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. This study also identifies N&#8208;(isobutylamino)&#8208;d&#8208;serine as an alternative substrate for VlmB leading to two azoxy regioisomers. The reactions catalyzed by the kinase VlmJ and the lyase VlmK during the final steps of valanimycin biosynthesis are established as well. The biosynthesis of valanimycin was thus fully reconstituted in vitro using the enzymes VlmO/ForJ, VlmB, VlmJ and VlmK. Importantly, the VlmB&#8208;catalyzed reaction represents the first example of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed azoxy formation and is expected to proceed by an atypical mechanism.

         <title>Ultrapermeable Gel Membranes Enabling Superior Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel membranes integrate the structural benefits of solid and liquid phases, culminating in the plasticization of cross&#8208;linked structure. This results in a decrease in the density of chain segment stacking and enhances the free volume within the separation membrane. Consequently, these gel membranes exhibit exceptional gas permeability, setting new records in performance.







Abstract
Membrane technology is rapidly gaining broad attraction as a viable alternative for carbon capture to mitigate increasingly severe global warming. Emerging CO2&#8208;philic membranes have become crucial players in efficiently separating CO2 from light gases, leveraging their exceptional solubility&#8208;selectivity characteristics. However, economic and widespread deployment is greatly dependent on the boosted performance of advanced membrane materials for carbon capture. Here, we design a unique gel membrane composed of CO2&#8208;philic molecules for accelerating CO2 transportation over other gases for ultrapermeable carbon capture. The molecular design of such soft membranes amalgamates the advantageous traits of augmented permeation akin to liquid membranes and operational stability akin to solid membranes, effectively altering the membrane's free volume characteristics validated by both experiments and molecular dynamics simulation. Surprisingly, gas diffusion through the free&#8208;volume&#8208;tuned gel membrane undergoes a 9&#8208;fold improvement without compromising the separation factor for the superior solubility selectivity of CO2&#8208;philic materials, and CO2 permeability achieves a groundbreaking record of 5608 Barrer surpassing the capabilities of nonfacilitated CO2 separation materials and exceeding the upper bound line established in 2019 even by leading&#8208;edge porous polymer materials. Our designed gel membrane can maintain exceptional separation performance during prolonged operation, enabling the unparalleled potential of solubility&#8208;selective next&#8208;generation materials towards sustainable carbon capture.

         <title>Enantioselective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrizative Coupling of 7&#8208;Azabenzonorbornadienes with Alkynylanilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrizative coupling of prochiral 7&#8208;azabenzonorbornadienes with readily available alkynylanilines afforded dihydronaphthalenes via concomitant generation of three covalent bonds. The methods also allows to build two stereocenters and an indole motif in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective as well as atom&#8208;economic manner.







Abstract
A PdII&#8208;catalyzed, domino enantioselective desymmetrizative coupling of 7&#8208;azabenzonorbornadienes with alkynylanilines is disclosed herein. This operationally simple transformation generates three covalent bonds and two contiguous stereocenters with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selectivity. The resulting functionalized indole&#8208;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;amine conjugates served as an appealing platform to streamline the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS) of other valuable enantioenriched compounds. DFT calculations revealed that the two stabilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions contributed to the observed enantioselectivity.

     alt="Enantioselective Palladium(II)-Catalyzed Desymmetrizative Coupling of 7-Azabenzonorbornadienes with Alkynylanilines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A palladium-catalyzed enantioselective desymmetrizative coupling of prochiral 7-azabenzonorbornadienes with readily available alkynylanilines afforded dihydronaphthalenes via concomitant generation of three covalent bonds. The methods also allows to build two stereocenters and an indole motif in a highly diastereo- and enantioselective as well as atom-economic manner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed, domino enantioselective desymmetrizative coupling of 7-azabenzonorbornadienes with alkynylanilines is disclosed herein. This operationally simple transformation generates three covalent bonds and two contiguous stereocenters with excellent enantio- and diastereo-selectivity. The resulting functionalized indole-dihydronaphthalene-amine conjugates served as an appealing platform to streamline the diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) of other valuable enantioenriched compounds. DFT calculations revealed that the two stabilizing non-covalent interactions contributed to the observed enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Preparation of Carbohydrate&#8208;Containing Adjuvants Based on Self&#8208;Assembling Glycopeptide Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of self&#8208;assembling glycopeptide conjugates (GPCs) were synthesized to produce uniform nanoribbons with homogeneous oligosaccharides appended in a multivalent array. Some of the conjugates exhibited immunostimulatory effects both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Carbohydrates are intriguing biomolecules possessing diverse biological activities, including immune stimulating capability. However, their biomedical applications have been limited by their complex and heterogeneous structures. In this study, we have utilized a self&#8208;assembling glycopeptide conjugate (GPC) system to produce uniform nanoribbons appending homogeneous oligosaccharides with multivalency. This system successfully translates the nontrivial structural differences of oligomannoses into varied binding affinities to C&#8208;type lectin receptors (CLRs). We have shown that GPCs could promote the CLR&#8208;mediated endocytosis of ovalbumin (OVA) antigen, and two mannotriose&#8208;modified peptides F3m2 and F3m5 exhibit potent activity in inducing antigen&#8208;presenting cell maturation, as indicated by increased CD86 and MHCII expression. In vivo studies demonstrated that GPCs, combined with OVA antigen, significantly enhanced OVA&#8208;specific antibody production. Specifically, F3m2 and F3m5 exhibited the highest immunostimulatory effects, eliciting both Th1&#8208; and Th2&#8208;biased immune responses and promoting differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+&#8197;T cells. These findings highlight the potential of GPCs as vaccine adjuvants, and showcase their versatility in exploiting the biological functions of carbohydrates.

         <title>Domino&#8208;Redox Reaction Induced by An Electrochemically Triggered Conformational Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally activated twisted&#8208;folded (T&#8208;F) form of bisquinodimethane with a dithiin skeleton (SS&#8208;BQD) undergoes a facile apparent 2e&#8208;transfer (trigger). Furthermore, in the resulting dication, the steric repulsion and interelectrophore interaction cause a facile and rapid change in the structure from the as&#8208;generated T2+&#8208;F form to the T2+&#8208;T form (domino), which facilitates the subsequent oxidation to the tetracation (domino).







Abstract
The concept of a domino&#8208;type reaction has been applied in a wide range of fields such as synthetic organic chemistry, material engineering, and life science. To extend the domino concept to redox chemistry, we designed and synthesized a dimeric quinodimethane (QD) with a nonplanar dithiin spacer. The domino&#8208;redox properties can be activated by raising the temperature, based on a thermally equilibrated twisted conformation of QD, which has a higher HOMO level that is more readily oxidized. After one QD unit is oxidized (trigger), steric repulsion and electronic interaction between electrophores make the neighboring QD unit adopt a twisted conformation (domino process), which facilitates the following oxidation. Thus, a domino&#8208;redox reaction was achieved for the first time by a change in the HOMO level due to a drastic change in the molecular conformation.

         <title>An Electrolyte with Less Space&#8208;Occupying Diluent at Cathode Inner Helmholtz Plane for Stable 4.6 V Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reasonably elevating the working voltage (&#8805; 4.4 V vs. Li/Li+) of the cathode is one of the efficient approaches to maximize the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). As a preferred partner for high&#8208;voltage LIB systems, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE), characterized by a stronger Li solvation structure, less free solvent, and robust electrode/electrolyte interphase has attracted much attention in academic circles. Herein, we systematically studied the role of the diluent in LHCE on the formation of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and elucidated that the existing anion&#8208;diluent pairing in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) results in an uneven CEI and subsequent battery degradation under high voltage. A m&#8208;fluorotoluene (mFT) diluent was further employed in the LHCE containing lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) to facilitate a uniform and rich&#8208;anion&#8208;derived CEI, since the weaker interaction of HmFT&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, as compared to the HHhydrofluoroether&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, reduces the influence of mFT in IHP or initial CEI formation. Consequently, the mFT&#8208;dominated LHCE propels the high&#8208;voltage performance of LIBs one step forward, endowing a 4.6 V&#8208;class 1.2&#8208;Ah graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells a 90.4% capacity retention after 130 cycles. Our study thus describes a new index affecting the CEI formation and proposes novel strategies to deeply optimize the high&#8208;voltage LIBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (UHMW) polymers with tailored structures are highly desirable for the outstanding properties. In this work, we developed a novel photoorganocatalyzed controlled radical alternating copolymerizations of fluoroalkyl maleimide and diverse vinyl comonomers, enabling efficient preparation of fluorinated copolymers of predetermined UHMWs and well&#8208;defined structures at high conversions. Versatility of this method was demonstrated by expanding to controlled terpolymerization, which allows facial access toward fluorinated terpolymers of UHMWs and functional pendants. The obtained copolymers exhibited attractive physical properties and furnished thermoplastic, anticorrosive and (super)hydrophobic attributes as coatings on different substrates. Molecular simulations provided insights into the coating morphology, which unveiled a fluorous protective layer on the top surface with polar groups attached to the bottom substrate, resulting in good adhesion and hydrophobicity, simultaneously. This synthetic method and customized copolymers shed light on the design of high&#8208;performance coatings by macromolecular engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Stable Structural Evolution of Prussian White Cathodes for Long&#8208;Life Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to monoclinic Prussian White (PW) Na&#8208;ion cathodes to address the issue of unfavorable multilevel phase transitions upon electrochemical cycling, leading to poor stability and capacity decay. A series of Mn&#8208;based samples with up to six metal species sharing the N&#8208;coordinated positions was synthesized. The material of composition Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12[Fe(CN)6]0.92&#9633;0.08 was found to exhibit superior cyclability over medium/low&#8208;entropy and conventional single&#8208;metal PWs. We also report, to our knowledge for the first time, that a high&#8208;symmetry crystal structure may be advantageous for high&#8208;entropy PWs during battery operation. Computational comparisons of the formation enthalpy demonstrate that the compositionally less complex materials are prone to phase transitions, which negatively affect cycling performance. Based on data from complementary characterization techniques, an intrinsic mechanism for the stability improvement of the disordered PW structure upon Na+ insertion/extraction is proposed, namely the dual effect of suppression of&#160;phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Phosphor with High Efficiency and Long Lifetime in Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) Through Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Triplet Exciton Formation for Photolithography Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) strategy, a new ortho&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor dyad OF&#8208;BCz showing a long lifetime (&#964;P) of 1.92&#8197;s and a high efficiency (&#934;P) up to 30&#8201;% in PMMA matrix, was constructed. Thanks to its excellent performance and high triplet energy level (ET1), OF&#8208;BCz was successfully applied in photolithography as a photoinitiator and an in situ quality indicator.







Abstract
Currently, purely organic compounds showing ambient phosphorescence with high efficiency (&#934;P) and ultra&#8208;long lifetime (&#964;P) are quite rare and often need to be achieved in hydrophilic poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based hosts. This severely limits their applications. Here, we provide a solution to this issue by constructing an ortho&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) dyad whose D moiety has not only a long&#8208;lived T1 state to achieve a long &#964;P, but also a Tn state that is close to the S1 state of the dyad to trigger effective spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). The rationality of this strategy was validated by a new phosphor OF&#8208;BCz that is able to show a &#964;P of 1.92&#8197;s and a &#934;P of 30&#8201;% even in a less rigid matrix of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Excitingly, OF&#8208;BCz exhibited its potential as both a photocuring initiator and an in situ quality indicator, allowing for the visual detection of defects in photolithographic patterning.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation of Ketones with 2&#8208;Aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation of ketones with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes (N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines) is disclosed, which affords a series of functionalized homoallyl tertiary alcohols in high to excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric allylation of ketones under proton&#8208;transfer conditions is a challenging issue due to the limited pronucleophiles and the electrophilic inertness of ketones. Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation of ketones with 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes (N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines) is disclosed, which affords a series of functionalized homoallyl tertiary alcohols in high to excellent enantioselectivity. Interestingly, N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines work as synthetic equivalents of propanals. Upon the acidic workup, a formal asymmetric &#946;&#8208;addition of propanals to ketones is achieved. An investigation on KIE effect indicates that the deprotonation of N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylmethanimines is the rate&#8208;determining step, which generates nucleophilic allyl copper(I) species. Finally, the synthetic utility of the present method is demonstrated by the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;boivinianin A and (R)&#8208;gossonorol.

         <title>Rapid Formation of Non&#8208;canonical Phospholipid Membranes by Chemoselective Amide&#8208;Forming Ligations with Hydroxylamines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal de novo phospholipid synthesis utilizing the reactions between hydroxylamine and &#945;&#8208;ketoacids (KAs) or potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) enables the rapid formation of biomimetic membranes under physiological pH conditions, using reactant concentrations in the micromolar range. Additionally, these reactions are biocompatible and can be performed in living mammalian cells.







Abstract
There has been increasing interest in methods to generate synthetic lipid membranes as key constituents of artificial cells or to develop new tools for remodeling membranes in living cells. However, the biosynthesis of phospholipids involves elaborate enzymatic pathways that are challenging to reconstitute in vitro. An alternative approach is to use chemical reactions to non&#8208;enzymatically generate natural or non&#8208;canonical phospholipids de novo. Previous reports have shown that synthetic lipid membranes can be formed in situ using various ligation chemistries, but these methods lack biocompatibility and/or suffer from slow kinetics at physiological pH. Thus, it would be valuable to develop chemoselective strategies for synthesizing phospholipids from water&#8208;soluble precursors that are compatible with synthetic or living cells Here, we demonstrate that amide&#8208;forming ligations between lipid precursors bearing hydroxylamines and &#945;&#8208;ketoacids (KAs) or potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) can be used to prepare non&#8208;canonical phospholipids at physiological pH conditions. The generated amide&#8208;linked phospholipids spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into cell&#8208;like micron&#8208;sized vesicles similar to natural phospholipid membranes. We show that lipid synthesis using KAT ligation proceeds extremely rapidly, and the high selectivity and biocompatibility of the approach facilitates the in situ synthesis of phospholipids and associated membranes in living cells.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Indoles via Carbene Catalyzed Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles are widely found in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, in sharp contrast to the preparation of indole&#8208;based axially chiral structures, the enantioselective catalysis of indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles is still a formidable task so far. Here we report an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective macrocyclization of 3&#8208;carboxaldehyde indole/pyrroles, featuring with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and allowing for a rapid access to diverse indole/pyrrole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles with a variety of ring sizes (10&#8208;16 members) in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, the indole&#8208;based macrocyclic structures with both planar and axial chirality were directly and efficiently obtained through this protocol with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. In addition, these synthesized planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles offer many possibilities for chemists to develop new catalysts or ligands, as well as new reactions.</dc:description>

We developed an indirect methodology for the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Kdo glycosides with a C3&#8208;p&#8208;tolylthio&#8208;substituted Kdo phosphite donor. The presence of the p&#8208;tolylthio group enhanced the reactivity, suppressed the formation of elimination by&#8208;products (2,3&#8208;enes), and provided complete &#945;&#8208;stereocontrol. A variety of Kdo &#945;&#8208;glycosides were synthesized by our method in excellent yields (up to 98%). After glycosylation, p&#8208;tolylthio group can be efficiently removed by the free radical reduction. Subsequently, the orthogonality of phosphite donor and thioglycoside donor was demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a trisaccharide in Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria meningitidis LPS. Moreover, an efficient total synthesis route for the challenging 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo trisaccharide in LPS from several A. baumannii strains was highlighted. To demonstrate the high reactivity of our approach further, the highly crowded 4,5,7,8&#8208;branched Kdo pentasaccharide was synthesized as a model molecule for the first time. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aptamer&#8208;Based Nanoflow Cytometry Method for the Molecular Detection and Classification of Ovarian Cancers through Profiling of Tumor Markers on Small Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular profiling of protein markers on small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) is a promising strategy for the precise detection and classification of ovarian cancers. However, this strategy is challenging owing to the lack of simple and practical detection methods. In this work, using an aptamer&#8208;based nanoflow cytometry (nFCM) detection strategy, a simple and rapid method for the molecular profiling of multiple protein markers on sEVs was developed. The protein markers can be easily labeled with aptamer probes and then rapidly profiled by nFCM. Seven cancer&#8208;associated protein markers, including&#160;CA125, STIP1, CD24, EpCAM, EGFR, MUC1, and HER2, on plasma sEVs were profiled for the molecular detection and classification of ovarian cancers. Profiling these seven protein markers enabled the precise detection of ovarian cancer with a high accuracy of 94.2%. In addition, combined with machine learning algorithms, such&#160;as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF), the molecular classifications of ovarian cancer cell lines and subtypes were achieved with overall accuracies of 82.9% and 55.4%, respectively. Therefore, this simple, rapid, and non&#8208;invasive method exhibited&#160;considerable potential for the auxiliary diagnosis and molecular classification of ovarian cancers in clinical practice.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Divergent Generations and Transformations of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Cations from Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent generations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations from single alkyne functionalities and their divergent further transformations have been established. Broad spectrum of alkynes including aryl alkyne, ynamide, alkynyl ether, and alkynyl sulfide could be utilized. The intermediacy of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage was supported by DFT calculations in both catalytic systems.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Carbonyl cations are the umpolung forms of the synthetically fundamental &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbanions. They are highly reactive yet rarely studied and utilized species and their precursors were rather limited. Herein, we report the catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent generations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations from single alkyne functionalities and the interception of them via Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement. Two chemodivergent catalytic systems have been established, leading to two different types of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations and, eventually, two different types of products, i.e. the &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Broad spectrum of alkynes including aryl alkyne, ynamide, alkynyl ether, and alkynyl sulfide could be utilized and the migration priorities of different groups in the Wagner&#8211;Meerwein rearrangement step was elucidated. Density functional theory calculations further supported the intermediacy of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations via the N&#8722;O bond cleavage in both the two catalytic systems. Another key feature of this methodology was the fragmentation of synthetically inert tert&#8208;butyl groups into readily transformable olefin functionalities. The synthetic potential was highlighted by the scale&#8208;up reactions and the downstream diversifications including the formal synthesis of nicotlactone B and galbacin.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitchable Benzimidazole Azo&#8208;Arenes as &#946;&#8208;Arrestin2&#8208;Biased Selective Cannabinoid 2 Receptor Agonists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoswitchable scaffold was developed based on the &#8220;privileged structure&#8221; of benzimidazole: 2&#8208;benzimidazole azo&#8208;arenes. This scaffold was used for the development of functionally selective cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) ligands with &#946;&#8208;arrestin2 (&#946;arr2) bias. Compound 10&#8201;d acts as a &#8220;trans&#8208;on&#8221;&#8208;efficacy switch in &#946;arr2&#8208;mediated endocytosis and can be used to investigate the CB2R&#8208;&#946;arr2 endocytic pathway.







Abstract
The cannabinoid 2 receptor (CB2R) has high therapeutic potential for multiple pathogenic processes, such as neuroinflammation. Pathway&#8208;selective ligands are needed to overcome the lack of clinical success and to elucidate correlations between pathways and their respective therapeutic effects. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a photoswitchable scaffold based on the privileged structure of benzimidazole and its application as a functionally selective CB2R &#8220;efficacy&#8208;switch&#8221;. Benzimidazole azo&#8208;arenes offer huge potential for the broad extension of photopharmacology to a wide range of optically addressable biological targets. We used this scaffold to develop compound 10&#8201;d, a &#8220;trans&#8208;on&#8221; agonist, which serves as a molecular probe to study the &#946;&#8208;arrestin2 (&#946;arr2) pathway at CB2R. &#946;&#913;rr2 bias was observed in CB2R internalization and &#946;arr2 recruitment, while no activation occurred when looking at G&#945;16 or mini&#8208;G&#945;i. Overall, compound 10&#8201;d is the first light&#8208;dependent functionally selective agonist to investigate the complex mechanisms of CB2R&#8208;&#946;arr2 dependent endocytosis.

         <title>Streamlined Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Loop Mimicry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone Matching (BM) evaluates virtual libraries of cyclic peptidomimetics containing an organic fragment, for interface loop mimicry in protein&#8208;protein interactions. It does so by comparing their backbone conformers with interface loops on the protein ligand. Hits for iNOS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SPSB2 and uPA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;uPAR were validated experimentally.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides comprising endocyclic organic fragments, &#8220;cyclo&#8208;organopeptides&#8221;, can be probes for perturbing protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Finding loop mimics is difficult because of high conformational variability amongst targets. Backbone Matching (BM), introduced here, helps solve this problem in the illustrative cases by facilitating efficient evaluation of virtual cyclo&#8208;organopeptide core&#8208;structure libraries. Thus, 86 rigid organic fragments were selected to build a library of 602 cyclo&#8208;organopeptides comprising Ala and organic parts: &#8220;cyclo&#8208;{&#8208;(Ala)n&#8208;organo&#8208;}&#8221;. The central hypothesis is &#8220;hit&#8221; library members have accessible low energy conformers corresponding to backbone structures of target protein loops, while library members which cannot attain this conformation are probably unworthy of further evaluation. BM thereby prioritizes candidate loop mimics, so that less than 10&#8197;cyclo&#8208;organopeptides are needed to be prepared to find leads for two illustrative PPIs: iNOS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SPSB2, and uPA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;uPAR.

         <title>Organocatalytic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enabled Asymmetric Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Chiral Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and practical methodology has been developed for building two types of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes via the phosphonium salt catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael reaction together with copper salt enabled aromatization. The scalability and practicality of this protocol were validated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and transformation of products, particularly towards producing novel helical phosphine ligands that were successfully utilized in metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes remains a formidable challenge, presumably due to the lack of rational design of substrates, right choice of reactions together with highly effective catalysis systems. Herein, we disclosed an efficient and practical DKR&#8208;involving (dynamic kinetic resolution) cascade strategy toward synthesizing a novel family of phosphorus&#8208;installing helicenes by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis. The sequential process of PPS&#8208;catalyzed phospha&#8208;Michael attack and copper salt&#8208;facilitated aromatization led to the formation of unprecedented phosphorus&#8208;containing oxa[5]helicene scaffolds. A wide variety of substrates bearing an assortment of functional groups were compatible with this protocol, furnishing the expected helical compounds in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. Additionally, the helical products could be conveniently elaborated to promising phosphine ligands with perfectly retained helical chirality, which turned out to be highly efficient chiral ligands in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. These findings not only expand the current library of phosphorus&#8208;containing helicenes but also offer insights to explore other challenging scaffolds with molecular chirality.

         <title>Thermally Responsive Selenide&#8208;containing Materials Based on Transalkylation of Selenonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally responsive C&#8722;Se dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) that relies on the transalkylation between selenonium salts and selenides can be easily achieved by adding alkylation reagents to the selenide compounds. By incorporating selenonium salts into polyurethane networks, we observed that the materials exhibited good healing ability at elevated temperatures as well as solvent and creep resistance at ambient temperature.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) possess unique properties as a result of their internal dynamic bonds, such as self&#8208;healing and reprocessing abilities. In this study, we report a thermally responsive C&#8722;Se dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) that relies on the transalkylation exchange between selenonium salts and selenides, which undergo a fast transalkylation reaction in the absence of any catalyst. Additionally, we demonstrate the presence of a dissociative mechanism in the absence of selenide groups. After incorporation of this DCC into selenide&#8208;containing polymer materials, it was observed that the cross&#8208;linked networks display varying dynamic exchange rates when using different alkylation reagents, suggesting that the reprocessing capacity of selenide&#8208;containing materials can be regulated. Also, by incorporating selenonium salts into polymer materials, we observed that the materials exhibited good healing ability at elevated temperatures as well as excellent solvent resistance at ambient temperature. This novel dynamic covalent chemistry thus provides a straightforward method for the healing and reprocessing of selenide&#8208;containing materials.

         <title>Supracluster Assembly of Archimedean Cages with 72 Hydrogen Bonds for the Aldol Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8722;O clusters&#8208;based supraclusters presenting multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonded porous assemblies can offer outstanding catalysis ability both in the homogeneous and heterogeneous phases. The supracluster proposed here will build a bridge between &#8220;supramolecule&#8221; and &#8220;supraparticle&#8221;, and provide new perspectives for synthesizing zeolite&#8208;like materials.







Abstract
Clusters that can be experimentally precisely characterized and theoretically accurately calculated are essential to understanding the relationship between material structure and function. Here, we propose the concept of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221;, which aim to connect &#8220;supramolecules&#8221; and &#8220;suprananoparticles&#8221; as well as reveal the unique assembly behavior of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221; with nanoparticle size at the molecular level. The implementation of supraclusters is full of challenges due to the difficulty in satisfying the ordered connectivity of clusters due to their abundant and dispersed hydrogen bonding sites. By solvothermal synthesis under a high catechol (H2CATs) content, we successfully isolated a series of triangular {Al6M3} cluster compounds possessing brucite&#8208;like structural features. Interestingly, eight {Al6M3} clusters form 72&#8208;fold strong hydrogen bonding truncatedhexahedron Archimedean {Al6M3}8 supracluster cage (abbreviated as H&#8208;tcu). Surprisingly, the solution stability of the H&#8208;tcu was further proved by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) characterization. Therefore, it is not difficult to explain the reason for assembly of H&#8208;tcu into edge&#8208;directed and vertex&#8208;directed isomers. These porous supraclusters can be obtained by scale&#8208;up synthesis and exhibit a noticeable catalysis effect towards the condensation of acetone and p&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde. As an intermediate state of supramolecule and suprananoparticle, the supracluster assembly can enrich the cluster chemistry and bring new structural types.

         <title>Controlling Metal&#8208;Oxide Reducibility for Efficient C&#8722;H Bond Activation in Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through catalyst post&#8208;treatment in an NH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O solution, structural and chemical properties of supported metal oxide species can be controlled because of dissolution&#8208;recrystallization of amorphous or/and low&#8208;crystalline support in the parent catalyst. The method is applicable for tailoring the catalyst reducibility and thus its activity for C&#8722;H activation in hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Knowing the structure of catalytically active species/phases and providing methods for their purposeful generation are two prerequisites for the design of catalysts with desired performance. Herein, we introduce a simple method for precise preparation of supported/bulk catalysts. It utilizes the ability of metal oxides to dissolve and to simultaneously precipitate during their treatment in an aqueous ammonia solution. Applying this method for a conventional VOx&#8722;Al2O3 catalyst, the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites was tuned simply by changing the pH value of the solution. These sites affect the strength of V&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds of isolated VOx species and thus the reducibility of the latter. This method is also applicable for controlling the reducibility of bulk catalysts as demonstrated for a CeO2&#8722;ZrO2&#8722;Al2O3 system. The application potential of the developed catalysts was confirmed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene with CO2 and in the non&#8208;oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. Our approach is extendable to the preparation of any metal oxide catalysts dissolvable in an ammonia solution.

         <title>Palladium Encapsulated by an Oxygen&#8208;Saturated TiO2 Overlayer for Low&#8208;Temperature SO2&#8208;Tolerant Catalysis during CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayer was constructed on Pd nanoparticles in air at only 400&#8201;&#176;C. The resulting catalyst with non&#8208;metal active sites exhibited an exceptional resistance to poisoning by SO2 and H2O, yielding robust CO oxidation performance under 100&#8197;ppm SO2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O at temperatures as low as 120&#8201;&#176;C for at least 240&#8197;h.







Abstract
The development of oxidation catalysts that are resistant to sulfur poisoning is crucial for extending the lifespan of catalysts in real&#8208;working conditions. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of oxide&#8208;metal interaction (OMI) catalyst under oxidative atmospheres. By using organic coated TiO2, an oxide/metal inverse catalyst with non&#8208;classical oxygen&#8208;saturated TiO2 overlayers were obtained at relatively low temperature. These catalysts were found to incorporate ultra&#8208;small Pd metal and support particles with exceptional reactivity and stability for CO oxidation (under 21&#8197;vol&#8201;% O2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O). In particular, the core (Pd)&#8208;shell (TiO2) structured OMI catalyst exhibited excellent resistance to SO2 poisoning, yielding robust CO oxidation performance at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 240&#8197;h (at 100&#8197;ppm SO2 and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O). The stability of this new OMI catalyst was explained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that interfacial oxygen atoms at Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Ti sites (of oxygen&#8208;saturated overlayers) serve as non&#8208;metal active sites for low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation, and change the SO2 adsorption from metal(d)&#8208;to&#8208;SO2(&#960;*) back&#8208;bonding to much weaker &#963;(Ti&#8722;S) bonding.

&lt;p&gt;An oxygen-saturated TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overlayer was constructed on Pd nanoparticles in air at only 400&#8201;&#176;C. The resulting catalyst with non-metal active sites exhibited an exceptional resistance to poisoning by SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, yielding robust CO oxidation performance under 100&#8197;ppm SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at temperatures as low as 120&#8201;&#176;C for at least 240&#8197;h.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of oxidation catalysts that are resistant to sulfur poisoning is crucial for extending the lifespan of catalysts in real-working conditions. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of oxide-metal interaction (OMI) catalyst under oxidative atmospheres. By using organic coated TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an oxide/metal inverse catalyst with non-classical oxygen-saturated TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers were obtained at relatively low temperature. These catalysts were found to incorporate ultra-small Pd metal and support particles with exceptional reactivity and stability for CO oxidation (under 21&#8197;vol&#8201;% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). In particular, the core (Pd)-shell (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) structured OMI catalyst exhibited excellent resistance to SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; poisoning, yielding robust CO oxidation performance at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 240&#8197;h (at 100&#8197;ppm SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

         <title>Toward De Novo Catalyst Discovery: Fast Identification of New Catalyst Candidates for Alcohol&#8208;Mediated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reactions

A method to discover new catalysts: We grow a reaction network for each catalyst template (Ci) and look for catalytic activity in each reaction network. The reactant (R) reacts with the catalyst template (Ci) and forms several intermediates (Ii) before reaching a product (P) with the catalyst template regenerated.







Abstract
Recently we have demonstrated how a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from random tertiary amines can be used to discover a new and efficient catalyst for the alcohol&#8208;mediated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction. In particular, the discovered catalyst was shown experimentally to be eight times more active than DABCO, commonly used to catalyze the MBH reaction. This represents a breakthrough in using generative models for catalyst optimization. However, the GA procedure, and hence discovery, relied on two important pieces of information; 1)&#8197;the knowledge that tertiary amines catalyze the reaction and 2)&#8197;the mechanism and reaction profile for the catalyzed reaction, in particular the transition state structure of the rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, truly de novo catalyst discovery must include these steps. Here we present such a method for discovering catalyst candidates for a specific reaction while simultaneously proposing a mechanism for the catalyzed reaction. We show that tertiary amines and phosphines are potential catalysts for the MBH reaction by screening 11 molecular templates representing common functional groups. The method relies on an automated reaction discovery workflow using meta&#8208;dynamics calculations. Combining this method for catalyst candidate discovery with our GA&#8208;based catalyst optimization method results in an algorithm for truly de novo catalyst discovery.

         <title>Aryne&#8208;Enabled C&#8722;N Arylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free C&#8722;N arylation of easily accessible tertiary anilines enabled by bifunctional arynes is described. The reaction proceeds via a tandem nucleophilic attack of anilines to arynes, followed by a Smiles&#8208;Truce rearrangement to furnish synthetically valuable and densely substituted biaryls. This protocol was further utilized for heterocyclic scaffolds, providing access to medium size azaheterocycles via n+2 carbon insertion.







Abstract
Anilines are potentially high&#8208;value arylating agents, but are limited by the low reactivity of the strong C&#8722;N bond. We show that the reactive intermediate benzyne can be used to both activate anilines, and set&#8208;up an aryl transfer reaction in a single step. The reaction does not require any transition metal catalysts or stoichiometric organometallics, and establishes a metal&#8208;free route to valuable biaryl products by functionalizing the aniline C&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Silver and Copper Nitride Cooperate for CO Electroreduction to Propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8208;doped copper nitride is a highly selective electrocatalyst for CO reduction to n&#8208;propanol leading to a record Faradaic Efficiency value of 45&#8201;% at an industrially&#8208;relevant current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, in an alkaline flow electrolyser.







Abstract
The need of carbon sources for the chemical industry, alternative to fossil sources, has pointed to CO2 as a possible feedstock. While CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) allows production of interesting organic compounds, it suffers from large carbon losses, mainly due to carbonate formation. This is why, quite recently, tandem CO2R, a two&#8208;step process, with first CO2R to CO using a solid oxide electrolysis cell followed by CO electroreduction (COR), has been considered, since no carbon is lost as carbonate in either step. Here we report a novel copper&#8208;based catalyst, silver&#8208;doped copper nitride, with record selectivity for formation of propanol (Faradaic efficiency: 45&#8201;%), an industrially relevant compound, from CO electroreduction in gas&#8208;fed flow cells. Selective propanol formation occurs at metallic copper atoms derived from copper nitride and is promoted by silver doping as shown experimentally and computationally. In addition, the selectivity for C2+ liquid products (Faradaic efficiency: 80&#8201;%) is among the highest reported so far. These findings open new perspectives regarding the design of catalysts for production of C3 compounds from CO2.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Aryl Shift and Double Alkyne Benzannulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
If the occupied position on the heterocyclic core is exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, alkyne benzannulation occurs at this position with concomitant 1,2&#8208;aryl shift. The resulting slightly curved N&#8208;doped nanographenes possess an unprecedented combination of six fused aromatic rings and strong emission of yellow light.







Abstract
The tandem intramolecular hydroarylation of alkynes accompanied by a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift is described. Harnessing the unique electron&#8208;rich character of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole scaffold, we demonstrate that the hydroarylation of alkynes proceeds at the already occupied positions&#8197;2 and 5 leading to a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds only in the presence of cationic gold catalyst, and it leads to heretofore unknown &#960;&#8208;expanded, centrosymmetric pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles. The utility is verified in the preparation of 13&#8197;products that bear six conjugated rings. The observed compatibility with various functional groups allows for increased tunability with regard to the photophysical properties as well as providing sites for further functionalization. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism revealed that the formation of the six&#8208;membered rings accompanied with a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift is both kinetically and thermodynamically favourable over plausible formation of products containing 7&#8208;membered rings. Steady&#8208;state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. Their optical properties are rationalized through time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.

Steady-state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S-shaped N-doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. Their optical properties are rationalized through time-dependent density functional theory calculations. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dithienoazepine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes: Janus&#8208;Faced Effects of a Thiophene&#8208;Fused Structure on Antiaromatic Azepines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine was employed as a key core of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. The Janus&#8208;faced effect of the thiophene&#8208;fused structure, which enhances the antiaromaticity of the azepine ring and, at the same time, relieves the antiaromaticity through the deformation from the aromatic thiophene ring to the quinoidal thienyl moiety, is effective to attain the largely red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission in the NIR region.







Abstract
We here disclose that the incorporation of thiophene rings into a seven&#8208;membered 8&#960; azepine in a fused fashion produces a useful antiaromatic core for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. In contrast to dibenzazepine derivatives with bent structures, dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives with electron&#8208;accepting groups adopt flat conformations in the ground state. The dithieno&#8208;fused derivatives exhibited broad absorption spectra that cover the visible region as well as sharp emission bands in the NIR region, which are considerably red&#8208;shifted relative to those of the dibenzo&#8208;fused congeners. Theoretical study revealed two contradictory effects of the less&#8208;aromatic thiophene&#8208;fused structure, i.e., the enhancement of the antiaromaticity of the adjacent azepine ring and the relief of the antiaromaticity through the contribution of a quinoidal resonance form. The combination of the dithienoazepine core with cationic electron&#8208;accepting groups produced a NIR fluorescent dye with an emission at 878&#8197;nm in solution.

         <title>Synergetic Coupling of Redox&#8208;Active Sites on Organic Electrode Material for Robust and High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene, an organic electrode material with synergetic coupling effects of abundant redox&#8208;active sites and stable conjugated cores, via nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, delivers excellent rate capability, and robust cycling performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials (OEMs), valued for their sustainability and structural tunability, have been attracting increasing attention for wide application in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) and other rechargeable batteries. However, most OEMs are plagued with insufficient specific capacity or poor cycling stability. Therefore, it&#8242;s imperative to enhance their specific capacity and cycling stability through molecular design. Herein, we designed and synthesized a heteroaromatic molecule 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN&#8208;6OH) by the synergetic coupling of catechol (the precursor of ortho&#8208;quinone)/ortho&#8208;quinone functional groups and HATN conjugated core structures. The abundance of catechol/ortho&#8208;quinone and imine redox&#8208;active moieties delivers a high specific capacity of nine&#8208;electron transfer for SIBs. Most notably, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bond forces among HATN&#8208;6OH molecules secure the stable long&#8208;term cycling performance of SIBs. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared HATN&#8208;6OH electrode exhibited a high specific capacity (554&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (202&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and stable long&#8208;term cycling performance (73&#8201;% after 3000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) in SIBs. Additionally, the nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism is confirmed by systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculation, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), and Raman analysis. The achievement of the synergetic coupling of the redox&#8208;active sites on OEMs could be an important key to the enhancement of SIBs and other metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Diacetoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient electrocatalytic 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation of alkenes utilizing readily available materials in ambient conditions is developed. The protocol is widely applicable to aliphatic and aromatic alkenes with excellent faradaic efficiencies and yields of up to 96&#8201;%. The versatility of the method is expanded with alkenoic acids towards lactone derivatives and with other carboxylic acids like HCOOH.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Dioxygenation of alkenes leads to a structural motif ubiquitous in organic synthons, natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Straightforward and green synthesis protocols starting from abundant raw materials are required for facile and sustainable access to these crucial moieties. Especially industrially abundant aliphatic alkenes have proven to be arduous substrates in sustainable 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation methods. Here, we report a highly efficient electrocatalytic diacetoxylation of alkenes under ambient conditions using a simple iodobenzene mediator and acetic acid as both the solvent and an atom&#8208;efficient reactant. This transition metal&#8208;free method is applicable to a wide range of alkenes, even challenging feedstock alkenes such as ethylene and propylene, with a broad functional group tolerance and excellent faradaic efficiencies up to 87&#8201;%. In addition, this protocol can be extrapolated to alkenoic acids, resulting in cyclization of the starting materials to valuable lactone derivatives. With aromatic alkenes, a competing mechanism of direct anodic oxidation exists which enables reaction under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic method is extensively investigated with cyclic voltammetry.

         <title>Reaction Chemistry at Discrete Organometallic Fragments on Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular functionalization techniques are leveraged to anchor well&#8208;defined organometallic fragments on the surface of black phosphorus. The functionalized nanosheets feature a high density of metal sites, with discrete and robust M&#8722;P bonds that are stable to subsequent transformations. The Tolman electronic parameter and steric bulk of bP are also estimated relative to molecular phosphines.







Abstract
Black phosphorus (bP) is a two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals material unique in its potential to serve as a support for single&#8208;site catalysts due to its similarity to molecular phosphines, ligands quintessential in homogeneous catalysis. However, there is a scarcity of synthetic methods to install single metal centers on the bP lattice. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of bP nanosheets with molecular Re and Mo complexes. A suite of characterization techniques, including infrared, X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as scanning transmission electron microscopy corroborate that the functionalized nanosheets contain a high density of discrete metal centers directly bound to the bP surface. Moreover, the supported metal centers are chemically accessible and can undergo ligand exchange transformations without detaching from the surface. The steric and electronic properties of bP as a ligand are estimated with respect to molecular phosphines. Sterically, bP resembles tri(tolyl)phosphine when monodentate to a metal center, and bis(diphenylphosphino)propane when bidentate, whereas electronically bP is a &#963;&#8208;donor as strong as a trialkyl phosphine. This work is foundational in elucidating the nature of black phosphorus as a ligand and underscores the viability of using bP as a basis for single&#8208;site catalysts.

         <title>Polymer Multi&#8208;Block and Multi&#8208;Block+ Strategies for the Upcycling of Mixed Polyolefins and Other Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multi&#8208;block copolymers with tunable microstructures were prepared and used as compatibilizer additives for upcycling mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. Furthermore, a multi&#8208;block+ strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was demonstrated to enable block extension during in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties and 3D printing capability.







Abstract
Due to a continued rise in the production and use of plastic products, their end&#8208;of&#8208;life pollution has become a pressing global issue. One of the biggest challenges in plastics recycling is the separation of different polymers. Multi&#8208;block copolymers (MBCPs) represent an efficient strategy for the upcycling of mixed plastics via induced compatibilization, but this approach is limited by difficulties associated with synthesis and structural modification. In this contribution, several synthetic strategies are explored to prepare MBCPs with tunable microstructures, which were then used as compatibilizer additives to upcycle mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. A multi&#8208;block+ strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was introduced, which enabled block extension during the in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties as well as better 3D printing capability. This strategy was also applicable to more complex ternary plastic blends. The polymer multi&#8208;block strategy enabled by versatile MBCPs synthesis and the multi&#8208;block+ strategy enabled by in situ block extension show exciting opportunities for the upcycling of mixed plastics.

         <title>An Extended NIR&#8208;II Superior Imaging Window from 1500 to 1900&#8197;nm for High&#8208;Resolution In Vivo Multiplexed Imaging Based on Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of novel lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles in the whole near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) beyond 1700&#8197;nm. Inspired by the scattering and water absorption, we then defined the NIR&#8208;II long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8197;nm&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window for high&#8208;resolution multiplexed imaging of lymph, blood vessels and intestines.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution in vivo optical multiplexing in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) is vital to biomedical research. Presently, limited by bio&#8208;tissue scattering, only luminescent probes located at NIR&#8208;IIb (1500&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window can provide high&#8208;resolution in vivo multiplexed imaging. However, the number of available luminescent probes in this narrow NIR&#8208;IIb region is limited, which hampers the available multiplexed channels of in vivo imaging. To overcome the above challenges, through theoretical simulation we expanded the conventional NIR&#8208;IIb window to NIR&#8208;II long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window on the basis of photon&#8208;scattering and water&#8208;absorption. We developed a series of novel lanthanide luminescent nanoprobes with emission wavelengths from 1852&#8197;nm to 2842&#8197;nm. NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L nanoprobes enabled high&#8208;resolution in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging on blood vessels and intestines, and provided multi&#8208;channels imaging on lymph tubes, tumors and intestines. The proposed NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L probes without mutual interference are powerful tools for high&#8208;contrast in vivo multiplexed detection, which holds promise for revealing physiological process in living body.

         <title>Constructing Intrapenetrated Hierarchical Zeolites with Highly Complete Framework via Protozeolite Seeding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;crystalline intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolite with highly complete framework was synthesized via protozeolite seeding. The protozeolite provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as&#8208;prepared zeolite presented excellent performance in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction.







Abstract
Creation of intrapenetrated mesopores with open highway from external surface into the interior of zeolite crystals are highly desirable that can significantly improve the molecular transport and active sites accessibility of microporous zeolites to afford enhanced catalytic properties. Here, different from traditional zeolite&#8208;seeded methods that generally produced isolated mesopores in zeolites, nanosized amorphous protozeolites with embryo structure of zeolites were used as seeds for the construction of single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with intrapenetrated mesopores (mesopore volume of 0.51&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and highly complete framework. In this strategy, in contrast to the conventional synthesis, only a small amount of organic structure directing agents and a low crystallization temperature were adopted to promise the protozeolites as the dominant growth directing sites to induce crystallization. The protozeolite nanoseeds provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as&#8208;prepared hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 443.9&#8197;hours and a high propylene selectivity of 47.92&#8201;% at a WHSV of 2&#8197;h&#8722;1 in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction. This work provides a facile protozeolite&#8208;seeded strategy for the synthesis of intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolites that are highly effective for catalytic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous/Organic Hybrid Batteries Enabled by Cu2+ Redox Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via matching S cathodes in aqueous Cu2+ ion&#8208;based electrolyte and Li anodes in organic electrolyte. The Li||S hybrid batteries deliver a high discharge voltage and satisfactory capacity, contributing to incredible energy density.







Abstract
Lithium||sulfur (Li||S) batteries are considered as one of the promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and low cost of S cathodes, as well as the low redox potential of Li metal anodes (&#8722;3.04&#8197;V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the S reduction reaction from S to Li2S leads to limited discharge voltage and capacity, largely hindering the energy density of Li||S batteries. Herein, high&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via an electrolyte decoupling strategy. In cathodes, S electrodes undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction from S to Cu2S with four&#8208;electron transfer in a Cu2+&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte. Such an energy storage mechanism contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance of S electrodes, including high discharge potential and capacity, superior rate performance and stable cycling behavior. As a result, the assembled Li||S hybrid batteries exhibit a high discharge voltage of 3.4&#8197;V and satisfactory capacity of 2.3&#8197;Ah&#8201;g&#8722;1, contributing to incredible energy density. This work provides an opportunity for the construction of high&#8208;energy Li||S batteries.

         <title>Tetrahedraphene: A Csp3&#8208;centered 3D Molecular Nanographene Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular interactions in the solid state (X&#8208;ray) and solution (mixtures of THF/H2O) control the photophysical properties! A singular 3D nanographene (Tetrahedraphene) shows a remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission upon water addition changing from blue in solution to vivid yellow colour in the precipitated solid. TDDFT calculations predict the formation of efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in solution, thus supporting the photophysical findings.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of 3D tetrakis(hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenyl)methane, &#8220;tetrahedraphene&#8221;, is reported. This molecular nanographene constituted by four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) units attached to a central sp3 carbon atom, shows a highly symmetric arrangement of the HBC units disposed in the apex of a tetrahedron. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals a tetrahedral symmetry of the molecule and the packing in the crystal is achieved mostly by CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions since the interstitial solvent molecules prevent the &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. In solution, tetrahedraphene shows the same electrochemical and photophysical properties as the hexa&#8208;tBu&#8208;substituted HBC (tBu&#8208;HBC) molecule. However, upon water addition, it undergoes a fluorescence change in solution and in the precipitated solid, showing an aggregation induced emission (AIE) process, probably derived from the restriction in the rotation and/or vibration of the HBCs. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) calculations reveal that upon aggregation, the high energy region of the emission band decreases in intensity, whereas the intensity of the red edge emission signal increases and presents a smoother decay, compared to the non&#8208;aggregated molecule. All in all, the excellent correlation between our simulations and the experimental findings allows explaining the colour change observed in the different solutions upon increasing the water fraction.

&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular interactions in the solid state (X-ray) and solution (mixtures of THF/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) control the photophysical properties! A singular 3D nanographene (Tetrahedraphene) shows a remarkable aggregation-induced emission upon water addition changing from blue in solution to vivid yellow colour in the precipitated solid. TDDFT calculations predict the formation of efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in solution, thus supporting the photophysical findings.

         <title>Hierarchical Fluid Interface Enables Spatiotemporal Regulation of Ligand Distribution to Increase Kinetics and Thermodynamics of Interfacial Binding Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical fluid interface (HieFluidFace) based on aptamer&#8208;functionalized Au nanoparticles (&#8220;islands&#8221;) and fluid fluorescent aptamer ligands (&#8220;rafts&#8221;) was engineered on a microfluidic chip surface. HieFluidFace allowed to increase the rate and thermodynamic favorability of interfacial binding reactions via spatiotemporal regulation of ligand distribution, and was used for efficient capture and direct identification of circulating tumor cells from clinical samples.







Abstract
In nature, regulation of the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial receptors and ligands leads to optimum binding kinetics and thermodynamics of receptor&#8211;ligand binding reactions within interfaces. Inspired by this, we report a hierarchical fluid interface (HieFluidFace) to regulate the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial ligands to increase the rate and thermodynamic favorability of interfacial binding reactions. Each aptamer&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticle, termed spherical aptamer (SAPT), is anchored on a supported lipid bilayer without fluidity, like an &#8220;island&#8221;, and is surrounded by many fluorescent aptamers (FAPTs) with free fluidity, like &#8220;rafts&#8221;. Such ligand &#8220;island&#8208;rafts&#8221; model provides a large reactive cross&#8208;section for rapid binding to cellular receptors. The synergistic multivalency of SAPTs and FAPTs improves interfacial affinity for tight capture. Moreover, FAPTs accumulate at binding sites to bind to cellular receptors with clustered fluorescence to &#8220;lighten&#8221; cells for direct identification. Thus, HieFluidFace in a microfluidic chip achieves high&#8208;performance capture and identification of circulating tumor cells from clinical samples, providing a new paradigm to optimize the kinetics and thermodynamics of interfacial binding reactions.

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Density Lipoprotein&#8208;Based Nanomedicine to Silence SOCS1 in Tumor Microenvironment and Trigger Antitumor Immunity against Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanomedicine was designed to modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) against glioma (GBM). Upon intravenous injection, the nanomedicine penetrated the blood&#8211;brain barrier and accumulated within the TME of GBM&#8208;bearing mice, which subsequently abolished the negative feedback regulation function of SOCS1 on dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, elicited strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibited tumor growth.







Abstract
Immunotherapies have shed light on the treatment of many cancers, but have not improved the outcomes of glioma (GBM). Here, we demonstrated that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) was associated with the GBM&#8208;associated immunosuppression and developed a multifunctional nanomedicine, which silenced SOCS1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM and triggered strong antitumor immunity against GBM. Synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) was selected as the nanocarrier and a peptide was used to facilitate the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration. The nanocarrier was loaded with a small interfering RNA (siRNA), a peptide, and an adjuvant to trigger antitumor immunity. The nanomedicine concentrated on the TME in vivo, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. Our work provides an alternative strategy to simultaneously target and modulate the TME in GBM patients and points to an avenue for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapeutics.

         <title>Highly Flexible Dielectric Films from Solution Processable Covalent Organic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous polymers, like covalent organic frameworks, are promising materials for a wide variety of applications. However, unlike conventional polymers, they are challenging to mold, shape, or process. Here we show how insoluble COFs, functionalized with oligoether sidechains, can be solution cast into high&#8208;dielectric films, with excellent flexibility and mechanical strength.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are known to be a promising class of materials for a wide range of applications, yet their poor solution processability limits their utility in many areas. Here we report a pore engineering method using hydrophilic side chains to improve the processability of hydrazone and &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs and the production of flexible, crystalline films. Mechanical measurements of the free&#8208;standing COF films of COF&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (hydrazone&#8208;linked) and TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 (&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked), revealed a Young's modulus of 391.7&#8197;MPa and 1034.7&#8197;MPa, respectively. The solubility and excellent mechanical properties enabled the use of these COFs in dielectric devices. Specifically, the TFP&#8208;PEO&#8208;3 film&#8208;based dielectric capacitors display simultaneously high dielectric constant and breakdown strength, resulting in a discharged energy density of 11.22&#8197;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3. This work offers a general approach for producing solution processable COFs and mechanically flexible COF&#8208;based films, which hold great potential for use in energy storage and flexible electronics applications.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoclusters with reversible pH responsiveness have been developed by the incorporation of tertiary amine groups in the surface ligands. The amine groups change the highest occupied molecular orbital upon their pH&#8208;induced protonation and deprotonation, resulting in photoluminescence quenching.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with pH&#8208;responsive properties suggest merits in biological analyses. This work establishes a general and effective method to obtain pH&#8208;responsive NIR emissive gold nanoclusters by introducing aliphatic tertiary amine (TA) groups into the ligands. Computational study suggests that the pH&#8208;responsive NIR emission is associated with electronic structure change upon protonation and deprotonation of TA groups. Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer between deprotonated TA groups and the surface Au&#8208;S motifs of gold nanoclusters can disrupt the radiative transitions and thereby decrease the photoluminescence intensity in basic environments (pH=7&#8211;11). By contrast, protonated TA groups curb the electron transfer and restore the photoluminescence intensity in acidic environments (pH=4&#8211;7). The pH&#8208;responsive NIR&#8208;emitting gold nanoclusters serve as a specific and sensitive probe for the lysosomes in the cells, offering non&#8208;invasive emissions without interferences from intracellular autofluorescence.

Photo-induced electron transfer between deprotonated TA groups and the surface Au-S motifs of gold nanoclusters can disrupt the radiative transitions and thereby decrease the photoluminescence intensity in basic environments (pH=7&#8211;11). By contrast, protonated TA groups curb the electron transfer and restore the photoluminescence intensity in acidic environments (pH=4&#8211;7). The pH-responsive NIR-emitting gold nanoclusters serve as a specific and sensitive probe for the lysosomes in the cells, offering non-invasive emissions without interferences from intracellular autofluorescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Auxiliary Approach for Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes and alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes with chiral auxiliaries has been developed, affording, after hydrolysis, synthetically challenging enantioenriched ketones. This chiral auxiliary approach is an alternative to the use of complex chiral catalysts in gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclizations.







Abstract
Two different classes of stereoselective cyclizations have been developed using a chiral auxiliary approach with commercially available [JohnPhosAu(MeCN)SbF6] as catalyst. First, a stereoselective cascade cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes was achieved using the Oppolzer camphorsultam as chiral auxiliary. In this case, a one&#8208;pot cyclization&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was developed to directly afford enantioenriched spirocyclic ketones. Then, the stereoselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes was mediated by an Evans&#8208;type oxazolidinone. A reduction&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was selected to remove the auxiliary to give enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;tetralones. DFT studies confirmed that the steric clash between the chiral auxiliary and alkene accounts for the experimentally observed diastereoselective cyclization through the Si face.

         <title>UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR Harvesting Conjugated Porous Polymer Nanocomposite: Upconversion and Plasmon Expedited Thioether Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;functionalized upconversion nanoparticles are covalently linked to conjugated porous organic polymers, followed by the loading of gold nanoparticles to form a UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorbing photocatalyst, UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au. The synergistic influence of plasmon absorption and upconversion luminescence improves photocatalytic oxidation of thioethers, including the detoxification of chemical warfare agents under natural sunlight and solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Photocatalysts capable of harvesting a broad range of the solar spectrum are essential for sustainable chemical transformations and environmental remediation. Herein, we have integrated NIR&#8208;absorbing upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) with UV&#8208;Vis absorbing conjugated porous organic polymer (POP) through the in situ multicomponent C&#8722;C coupling to fabricate a UC&#8722;POP nanocomposite. The light&#8208;harvesting ability of UC&#8722;POP is further augmented by loading plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNP) into UC&#8722;POP. A three&#8208;times enhancement in the upconversion luminescence is observed upon the incorporation of AuNP in UC&#8722;POP, subsequently boosting the photocatalytic activity of UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au. The spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical investigations infer the enhanced photocatalytic oxidation of thioethers, including mustard gas simulant by UC&#8722;POP&#8722;Au compared to POP and UC&#8722;POP due to the facile electron&#8208;hole pair generation, suppressed exciton recombination, and efficient charge carrier migration. Thus, the unique design strategy of combining plasmonic and upconversion nanoparticles with a conjugated porous organic polymer opens up new vistas towards artificial light harvesting.

         <title>Green Ether Electrolytes for Sustainable High&#8208;voltage Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green ether solvent is reported through a rational design of carbon chain regulation that tunes steric hindrance for an efficient solvation structure. Such a structure significantly reduces the solvent&#8216;s biotoxicity, and the tuned solvation structure results in sustainable high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are promising for secondary batteries due to their good compatibility with alkali metal anodes and high ionic conductivity. However, they suffer from poor oxidative stability and high toxicity, leading to severe electrolyte decomposition at high voltage and biosafety/environmental concerns when electrolyte leakage occurs. Here, we report a green ether solvent through a rational design of carbon&#8208;chain regulation to elicit steric hindrance, such a structure significantly reducing the solvent&#8216;s biotoxicity and tuning the solvation structure of electrolytes. Notably, our solvent design is versatile, and an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure is favored, facilitating a stable interphase formation on both the anode and cathode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, the green ether&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates excellent compatibility with K metal and graphite anode and a 4.2&#8197;V high&#8208;voltage cathode (200 cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 99.64&#8201;%). This work points to a promising path toward the molecular design of green ether&#8208;based electrolytes for practical high&#8208;voltage potassium&#8208;ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries.

Six&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I2 electrodes is achieved via the synergistic effect of redox&#8208;ion charge&#8208;carriers and halide ions in aqueous electrolytes. The unique energy storage mechanism leads to high capacity and potential of I2 electrodes, contributing to enhanced energy density of corresponding aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Iodine (I2) shows great promising as the active material in aqueous batteries due to its distinctive merits of high abundance in ocean and low cost. However, in conventional aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries, the energy storage mechanism of I&#8722;/I2 conversion is only two&#8208;electron redox reaction, limiting their energy density. Herein, six&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I2 electrodes is achieved via the synergistic effect of redox&#8208;ion charge&#8208;carriers and halide ions in electrolytes. The redox&#8208;active Cu2+ ions in electrolytes induce the conversion between Cu2+ ions and I2 to CuI at low potential. Simultaneously, the Cl&#8722; ions in electrolytes activate the I2/ICl redox couple at high potential. As a result, in our case, I2&#8208;based battery system with six&#8208;electron redox is developed. Such energy storage mechanism with six&#8208;electron redox leads to high discharge potential and capacity, excellent rate capability, as well as stable cycling behavior of I2 electrodes. Impressively, six&#8208;electron&#8208;redox I2 cathodes can match various aqueous metal (e.g. Zn, Mn and Fe) anodes to construct metal||I2 hybrid batteries. These hybrid batteries not only deliver enhanced capacities, but also exhibit higher operate voltages, which contributes to superior energy densities. Therefore, this work broadens the horizon for the design of high&#8208;energy aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries.

Benefiting from optimized crystal packing, favourable morphology and ordered molecular arrangement, A&#8208;OSeF&#8208;based binary organic solar cells yield a champion efficiency of 18.5&#8201;% and low energy loss among selenium&#8208;containing acceptors.







Abstract
Both the regional isomerization and selenium&#8208;substitution of the small molecular acceptors (SMAs) play significant roles in developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs), while their synergistic effects remain elusive. Herein, we developed three isomeric SMAs (S&#8208;CSeF, A&#8208;ISeF, and A&#8208;OSeF) via subtly manipulating the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position (central, inner, or outer) and type of heteroaromatic ring on the central core by synergistic strategies for efficient OSCs, respectively. Crystallography of asymmetric A&#8208;OSeF presents a closer intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and more ordered 3&#8208;dimensional network packing and efficient charge&#8208;hopping pathways. With the successive out&#8208;shift of the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position, the neat films give a slightly wider band gap and gradually higher crystallinity and electron mobility. The PM1&#8201;:&#8201;A&#8208;OSeF afford favourable fibrous phase separation morphology with more ordered molecular packing and efficient charge transportation compared to the other two counterparts. Consequently, the A&#8208;OSeF&#8208;based devices achieve a champion efficiency of 18.5&#8201;%, which represents the record value for the reported selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our developed precise molecular engineering of the position and type of selenium&#8208;based heteroaromatic ring of SMAs provides a promising synergistic approach to optimizing crystal stacking and boosting top&#8208;ranked selenium&#8208;containing SMAs&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Photosynthesis of Benzonitriles on BiOBr Nanosheets Promoted by Vacancy Associates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
BiOBr photocatalysts with different surface vacancy associates were successfully synthesized. Vacancy associates of Br&#8722;Bi&#8722;Br triple atom vacancy (VBrBiBr) and oxygen vacancies can generate benzonitrile with high selectivity in the photocatalytic ammoxidation of benzyl alcohol by providing adsorption activation sites for NH3 and O2 and reaction sites for the multi&#8208;step formation of imine intermediates and oxidation to benzonitrile.







Abstract
Photocatalytic organic functionalization reactions represent a green, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable synthesis route for value&#8208;added chemicals. However, heterogeneous photocatalysis is inefficient in directly activating ammonia molecules for the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added nitrogenous organic products when compared with oxygen activation in the formation of related oxygenated compounds. In this study, we report the heterogeneous photosynthesis of benzonitriles by the ammoxidation of benzyl alcohols (99&#8201;% conversion, 93&#8201;% selectivity) promoted using BiOBr nanosheets with surface vacancy associates. In contrast, the main reaction of catalysts with other types of vacancy sites is the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde or benzoic acid. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations have demonstrated a specificity of vacancy type with respect to product selectivity, which arises from the adsorption and activation of NH3 and O2 that is required to promote subsequent C&#8722;N coupling and oxidation to nitrile. This study provides a better understanding of the role of vacancies as catalytic sites in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4 and H2O2 under Non&#8208;sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photocatalyst achieves high electronic selectivity for CH4 and facile separation of H2O2 in non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions with only CO2 and H2O. This exceptional performance is attributed to a long&#8208;lived oxygen&#8208;centered radical in the excited electron acceptor, promoting the formation of a stabilized five&#8208;member&#8208;ring cyclic intermediate with lower energy, leading to an 90&#8201;% selectivity for the eight&#8208;electron product CH4.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 requires photosensitizers and sacrificial agents to provide sufficient electrons and protons through metal&#8208;based photocatalysts, and the separation of CH4 from by&#8208;product O2 has poor applications. Herein, we successfully synthesize a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst of a novel electron&#8208;acceptor 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrenetetrone (PT), to our best knowledge, this is the first time that metal&#8208;free catalyst achieves non&#8208;sacrificial photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 and easily separable H2O2. This photocatalyst offers CH4 product of 10.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions (room temperature, and only water), which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the reported metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. Comprehensive in situ characterizations and calculations reveal a multi&#8208;step reaction mechanism, in which the long&#8208;lived oxygen&#8208;centered radical in the excited PT provides as a site for CO2 activation, resulting in a stabilized cyclic carbonate intermediate with a lower formation energy. This key intermediate is thermodynamically crucial for the subsequent reduction to CH4 product with the electronic selectivity of up to 90&#8201;%. The work provides fresh insights on the economic viability of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to easily separable CH4 in non&#8208;sacrificial and metal&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>Enhancing Local CO2 Adsorption by L&#8208;histidine Incorporation for Selective Formate Production Over the Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach towards enhancing the CO2 adsorption capacity of Bi&#8208;based catalysts was demonstrated via the L&#8208;histidine incorporation. The improved CO2 chemical adsorption and electron&#8208;rich nature of resultant catalysts enables high Faradaic efficiency for formate production in an ultra&#8208;wide potential window even with low&#8208;concentration CO2 feeding. (TETA and DEA refer to triethylenetetramine and diethanolamine, respectively).







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce valuable chemicals is a promising pathway to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming issues. However, simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current densities of CO2RR in a wide potential range remains as a huge challenge for practical implements. Herein, we demonstrate that incorporating bismuth&#8208;based (BH) catalysts with L&#8208;histidine, a common amino acid molecule of proteins, is an effective strategy to overcome the inherent trade&#8208;off between the activity and selectivity. Benefiting from the significantly enhanced CO2 adsorption capability and promoted electron&#8208;rich nature by L&#8208;histidine integrity, the BH catalyst exhibits excellent FEformate in the unprecedented wide potential windows (&gt;90&#8201;% within &#8722;0.1&#8211;&#8722;1.8&#8197;V and &gt;95&#8201;% within &#8722;0.2&#8211;&#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Excellent CO2RR performance can still be achieved under the low&#8208;concentration CO2 feeding (e.g., 20&#8197;vol.%). Besides, an extremely low onset potential of &#8722;0.05&#8197;VRHE (close to the theoretical thermodynamic potential of &#8722;0.02&#8197;VRHE) was detected by in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) measurements, together with stable operation over 50&#8197;h with preserved FEformate of &#8776;95&#8201;% and high partial current density of 326.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;VRHE.

         <title>Criteria for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting Revealed by Studying Carrier Dynamics in a Model Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoluminescence study of a model Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 photocatalyst reveals that by suppressing photocarrier recombination and establishing a facile charge separation and extraction mechanism, a quantum efficiency of almost 100&#8201;% can be achieved even with a very short (sub&#8208;ns) intrinsic photocarrier lifetime, challenging the belief that a long carrier lifetime is a fundamental requirement.







Abstract
Overall water splitting (OWS) using semiconductor photocatalysts is a promising method for solar fuel production. Achieving a high quantum efficiency is one of the most important prerequisites for photocatalysts to realize high solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency. In a recent study (Nature 2020, 58, 411&#8211;414), a quantum efficiency of almost 100&#8201;% has been achieved in an aluminum&#8208;doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Al) photocatalyst. Herein, using the SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Al as a model photocatalyst, we reveal the criteria for efficient photocatalytic water splitting by investigating the carrier dynamics through a comprehensive photoluminescence study. It is found that the Al doping suppresses the generation of Ti3+ recombination centers in SrTiO3, the surface band bending facilitates charge separation, and the in situ photo&#8208;deposited Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOOH co&#8208;catalysts render efficient charge extraction. By suppressing photocarrier recombination and establishing a facile charge separation and extraction mechanism, high quantum efficiency can be achieved even on photocatalysts with a very short (sub&#8208;ns) intrinsic photocarrier lifetime, challenging the belief that a long carrier lifetime is a fundamental requirement. Our findings could provide guidance on the design of OWS photocatalysts toward more efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bismuth&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a combined experimental and computational study of the bismuth&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes. With the protocol using p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol and pinacolborane, we identified the role of protic and hydridic hydrogens through kinetic analysis and reactivity studies. The possibility of Bi&#8208;ligand cooperativity was assessed through isotope labeling experiments. This work validates the notion of Bi(I)/Bi(III) redox cycling.







Abstract
Organobismuth&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation has recently been disclosed as an example of low&#8208;valent Bi redox catalysis. However, its mechanistic details have remained speculative. Herein, we report experimental and computational studies that provide mechanistic insights into a Bi&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes using p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol (4) and pinacolborane (5) as hydrogen sources. A kinetic analysis elucidated the rate orders in all components in the catalytic reaction and determined that 1&#8201;a (2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)iminomethyl]phenylbismuth) is the resting state. In the transfer hydrogenation of azobenzene using 1&#8201;a and 4, an equilibrium between 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;a&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[OAr]2 (Ar=p&#8208;CF3&#8722;C6H4) is observed, and its thermodynamic parameters are established through variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies. Additionally, pKa&#8208;gated reactivity is observed, validating the proton&#8208;coupled nature of the transformation. The ensuing 1&#8201;a&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[OAr]2 is crystallographically characterized, and shown to be rapidly reduced to 1&#8201;a in the presence of 5. DFT calculations indicate a rate&#8208;limiting transition state in which the initial N&#8722;H bond is formed via concerted proton transfer upon nucleophilic addition of 1&#8201;a to a hydrogen&#8208;bonded adduct of azobenzene and 4. These studies guided the discovery of a second&#8208;generation Bi catalyst, the rate&#8208;limiting transition state of which is lower in energy, leading to catalytic transfer hydrogenation at lower catalyst loadings and at cryogenic temperature.

         <title>Kinetic Delay in Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization by Redefining the Trade&#8208;Off Relationship between H&#8208;Bonds and Van der Waals/&#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper molecular engineering can open new opportunities to create kinetically metastable states in monomers undergoing cooperative supramolecular polymerizations. This occurs by favoring dispersive interactions over H&#8208;bonds and thereby rebalancing the interplay between &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, Van der Waals, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions.







Abstract
We here present how rebalancing the interplay between H&#8208;bonds and dispersive forces (Van der Waals/&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking) may induce or not the generation of kinetic metastable states. In particular, we show that extending the aromatic content and favouring the interchain VdW interactions causes a delay into the cooperative supramolecular polymerization of a new family of toluene bis&#8208;amide derivatives by trapping the metastable inactive state.

         <title>A Mushroom P450&#8208;Monooxygenase Enables Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Biocatalytic Synthesis of Epoxycyclohexenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PanH, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, was identified and verified as the enzyme responsible for epoxycyclohexenone formation in panepoxydone biosynthesis in the basidiomycete mushroom Panus rudis. A PanH&#8208;producing yeast as a biocatalyst enabled an enzymatic approach to synthesize a library of bioactive epoxycyclohexenone compounds.







Abstract
An epoxycyclohexenone (ECH) moiety occurs in natural products of both bacteria and ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi. While the enzymes for ECH formation in bacteria and ascomycetes have been identified and characterized, it remained obscure how this structure is biosynthesized in basidiomycetes. In this study, we i)&#8197;identified a genetic locus responsible for panepoxydone biosynthesis in the basidiomycete mushroom Panus rudis and ii)&#8197;biochemically characterized PanH, the cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing epoxide formation in this pathway. Using a PanH&#8208;producing yeast as a biocatalyst, we synthesized a small library of bioactive ECH compounds as a proof of concept. Furthermore, homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and site directed mutation revealed the substrate specificity of PanH. Remarkably, PanH is unrelated to ECH&#8208;forming enzymes in bacteria and ascomycetes, suggesting that mushrooms evolved this biosynthetic capacity convergently and independently of other organisms.

         <title>Stabilization of Guest Molecules inside Cation&#8208;Lidded Cucurbiturils Reveals that Hydration of Receptor Sites Can Impede Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal ions docked to water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors can unexpectedly enhance the binding of guest molecules. For instance, with cucurbit[5]uril and large cations, methane and ethane binding increased 5&#8211;8&#8197;times due to water molecule removal during cation binding. This reveals a previously unnoticed steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites.







Abstract
Docking of alkali metal ions to water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors generally reduces the affinity of guest molecules due to competitive binding. The idea that solvation water molecules could display a larger steric hindrance towards guest binding than cations has not been considered to date. We show that the docking of large cations to cucurbit[5]uril (CB5) unexpectedly increases (by a factor of 5&#8211;8) the binding of hydrophobic guests, methane and ethane. This is due to the removal of water molecules from the carbonyl portals of CB5 during cation binding, which frees up space for hydrophobe encapsulation. In contrast, smaller cations like sodium protrude deeply into the cavity of CB5 and cause the expected decrease in binding, such that the rational selection of alkali cations allows for a variation of up to a factor of 20 in binding of methane and ethane. The statistical analysis of crystallographic data shows that the cavity volume of CB5 can be enlarged by placing large alkali ions (Rb+ and Cs+) centro&#8208;symmetrically at the portals. The results reveal a hitherto elusive steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites, which is pertinent for the design of supramolecular catalysts and the understanding of biological receptors.

&lt;p&gt;Alkali metal ions docked to water-soluble macrocyclic receptors can unexpectedly enhance the binding of guest molecules. For instance, with cucurbit[5]uril and large cations, methane and ethane binding increased 5&#8211;8&#8197;times due to water molecule removal during cation binding. This reveals a previously unnoticed steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites.

         <title>Unveiling the Electrolyte Cations Dependent Kinetics on CoOOH&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte cations dependent kinetics on CoOOH catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is derived from cation intercalation, which can rationally tailor the formation energy of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process. This finding provides an informative picture to understand the complicated mechanism of electrolyte cation&#8208;targeted electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The electrolyte cations&#8208;dependent kinetics have been widely observed in many fields of electrocatalysis, however, the exact mechanism of the influence on catalytic performance is still a controversial topic of considerable discussion. Herein, combined with operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), we verify that the electrolyte cations could intercalate into the layer of pristine CoOOH catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, while the bigger cations lead to enlarged interlayer spacing and increased OER activity, following the order Cs+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ Raman, in situ Ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy, in situ XAS spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and theoretical calculations reveal that the intercalation of electrolyte cations efficiently modify the oxidation states of Co by enlarging the Co&#8722;O bonds, which in turn enhance the d&#8208;band center of Co, optimize the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates, facilitate the formation of OER active Co(IV) species, and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determing step (RDS), thereby enhancing the OER activity. This work not only provides an informative picture to understand the complicated dependence of OER kinetics on electrolyte cations, but also sheds light on understanding the mechanism of other electrolyte cation&#8208;targeted electrocatalysis.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assembly Meets Anion Coordination Chemistry: Framework Shaping and Polarity Tuning for Xenon/Krypton Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marriage between hydrogen bonding and the coordination chemistry of halide anions offers a promising strategy to construct crystalline microporous frameworks with adaptive cavities and fine&#8208;tunable surface polarity for efficient Xe/Kr separation. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect.







Abstract
Hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) frameworks built from charged components or metallotectons offer diverse guest&#8208;framework interactions for target&#8208;specific separations. We present here a study to systematically explore the coordination chemistry of monovalent halide anions, i.e., F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;, with the aim to develop hybrid H&#8208;bond synthons that enable the controllable construction of microporous H&#8208;bonded frameworks exhibiting fine&#8208;tunable surface polarity within the adaptive cavities for realistic xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation. The spherical halide anions, especially Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;, are found to readily participate in the charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding assembly with well&#8208;defined coordination behaviors, resulting in robust frameworks bearing open halide anions within the distinctive 1D pore channels. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe (IAST Xe/Kr selectivity ca. 10.5) because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect. Specifically, dynamic column Xe/Kr separation with a record&#8208;high separation factor (SF=7.0) among H&#8208;bonded frameworks was achieved, facilitating an efficient Xe/Kr separation in dilute, CO2&#8208;containing gas streams exactly mimicking the off&#8208;gas of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) reprocessing.

         <title>Reducing the Ir&#8722;O Coordination Number in Anodic Catalysts based on IrOx Nanoparticles towards Enhanced Proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>

Reducing the coordination number is feasible to lower the rate&#8208;determination&#8208;step energy barrier, thus accelerating the electrocatalytic reaction process. Our designed low&#8208;coordination IrOx delivers superior activity as well as excellent stability in water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Due to the robust oxidation conditions in strong acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER), developing an OER electrocatalyst with high efficiency remains challenging in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer. Recent theoretical research suggested that reducing the coordination number of Ir&#8722;O is feasible to reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determination step, potentially accelerating the OER. Inspired by this, we experimentally verified the Ir&#8722;O coordination number's role at model catalysts, then synthesized low&#8208;coordinated IrOx nanoparticles toward a durable PEM water electrolyzer. We first conducted model studies on commercial rutile&#8208;IrO2 using plasma&#8208;based defect engineering. The combined in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis and computational studies clarify why the decreased coordination numbers increase catalytic activity. Next, under the model studies&#8217; guidelines, we explored a low&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;based catalyst with a lower overpotential of 231&#8197;mV@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 accompanied by long durability (100&#8197;h) in an acidic OER. Finally, the assembled PEM water electrolyzer delivers a low voltage (1.72&#8197;V@1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) as well as excellent stability exceeding 1200&#8197;h (@1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) without obvious decay. This work provides a unique insight into the role of coordination numbers, paving the way for designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts for PEM water electrolyzers.

         <title>Construction of Low&#8208;Coordination Cu&#8722;C2 Single&#8208;Atoms Electrocatalyst Facilitating the Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the special structure of 1,3,5&#8208;triynylbenzene, Cu single atom catalysts with a Cu&#8722;C2 coordination structure were prepared for the first time and showed excellent performance in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e&#8208;CO2RR) process. Comprehensive experiments and calculations confirmed that the Cu&#8722;C2 structure not only endowed the Cu single atoms center with more positive charge, but also promoted the formation of H&#8901;, which improved the electrocatalytic performance of CO2RR to CH4.







Abstract
Constructing Cu single&#8208;atoms (SAs) catalysts is considered as one of the most effective strategies to enhance the performance of electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e&#8208;CO2RR) towards CH4, however there are challenges with activity, selectivity, and a cumbersome fabrication process. Herein, by virtue of the meta&#8208;position structure of alkynyl in 1,3,5&#8208;triethynylbenzene and the interaction between Cu and &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;, a Cu SAs electrocatalyst (Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY), containing low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8722;C2 active sites, was synthesized through a simple and efficient one&#8208;step method. Notably, this represents the first achievement of preparing Cu SAs catalysts with Cu&#8722;C2 coordination structure, which exhibited high CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity (72.1&#8201;%) with a high CH4 partial current density of 230.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a turnover frequency as high as 2756&#8197;h&#8722;1, dramatically outperforming currently reported catalysts. Comprehensive experiments and calculations verified the low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8722;C2 structure not only endowed the Cu SAs center more positive electricity but also promoted the formation of H&#8226;, which contributed to the outstanding e&#8208;CO2RR to CH4 electrocatalytic performance of Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY.

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the special structure of 1,3,5-triynylbenzene, Cu single atom catalysts with a Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coordination structure were prepared for the first time and showed excellent performance in the electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (e-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) process. Comprehensive experiments and calculations confirmed that the Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure not only endowed the Cu single atoms center with more positive charge, but also promoted the formation of H&#8901;, which improved the electrocatalytic performance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing Cu single-atoms (SAs) catalysts is considered as one of the most effective strategies to enhance the performance of electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (e-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) towards CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, however there are challenges with activity, selectivity, and a cumbersome fabrication process. Herein, by virtue of the meta-position structure of alkynyl in 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene and the interaction between Cu and &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;, a Cu SAs electrocatalyst (Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY), containing low-coordination Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; active sites, was synthesized through a simple and efficient one-step method. Notably, this represents the first achievement of preparing Cu SAs catalysts with Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coordination structure, which exhibited high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (72.1&#8201;%) with a high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; partial current density of 230.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a turnover frequency as high as 2756&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, dramatically outperforming currently reported catalysts. Comprehensive experiments and calculations verified the low-coordination Cu&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure not only endowed the Cu SAs center more positive electricity but also promoted the formation of H&#8226;, which contributed to the outstanding e-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalytic performance of Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY. Our work provides a novel H&#8901;-transferring mechanism for e-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and offers a protocol for the preparation of two-coordinated Cu SAs catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Coordination of Iron Atom Clusters on N,P,S Triply&#8208;Doped Hollow Carbon Support towards Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>

A general diffusion&#8208;controlled strategy is proposed to synthesize metal atom&#8208;clusters with engineered coordination in N,P,S triply&#8208;doped hollow carbon. The optimum FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC shows remarkably enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen reduction, compared with the benchmark analogue of N&#8208;coordinated iron single&#8208;atoms in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeSAs/N&#8722;C). This work presents a paradigm for the regulation and optimization of atomically dispersed catalysts.







Abstract
Constructing atom&#8208;clusters (ACs) with in situ modulation of coordination environment and simultaneously hollowing carbon support are critical yet challenging for improving electrocatalytic efficiency of atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs). Herein, a general diffusion&#8208;controlled strategy based on spatial confining and Kirkendall effect is proposed to construct metallic ACs in N,P,S triply&#8208;doped hollow carbon matrix (MACs/NPS&#8722;HC, M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). Thereinto, FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC with the best catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is thoroughly investigated. Unlike the benchmark sample of symmetrical N&#8208;surrounded iron single&#8208;atoms in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeSAs/N&#8722;C), FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC comprises bi&#8208;/tri&#8208;atomic Fe centers with engineered S/N coordination. Theoretical calculation reveals that proper Fe gathering and coordination modulation could mildly delocalize the electron distribution and optimize the free energy pathways of ORR. In addition, the triple doping and hollow structure of carbon matrix could further regulate the local environment and allow sufficient exposure of active sites, resulting in more enhanced ORR kinetics on FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC as cathodic catalyst exhibits all&#8208;round superiority to Pt/C and most Fe&#8208;based ADCs. This work provides an exemplary method for establishing atomic&#8208;cluster catalysts with engineered S&#8208;dominated coordination and hollowed carbon matrix, which paves a new avenue for the fabrication and optimization of advanced ADCs.

Our study makes a stride in the discovery of acid&#8208;stable Co&#8722;Co dinuclear active sites (DASs) for PEM through single&#8208;atom tuning strategy. The XAFS elucidated the incorporation of Zr greatly facilitated the generation of Co&#8722;Co DASs layer with stretching of cobalt oxygen bond and S&#8722;Co&#8722;O heterogeneous grain boundaries interfaces (HGBIs), engineering attractive activity of ultra&#8208;low overpotential and 500&#8197;h superior durability in acid.







Abstract
Developing cost&#8208;effective and sustainable acidic water oxidation catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth mechanism understanding for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. Herein, we developed a single atom regulatory strategy to construct Co&#8722;Co dinuclear active sites (DASs) catalysts that atomically dispersed zirconium doped Co9S8/Co3O4 heterostructure. The X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure elucidated the incorporation of Zr greatly facilitated the generation of Co&#8722;Co DASs layer with stretching of cobalt oxygen bond and S&#8722;Co&#8722;O heterogeneous grain boundaries interfaces, engineering attractive activity of significantly reduced overpotential of 75&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a breakthrough of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 high current density, and water splitting stability of 500&#8197;hours in acid, making it one of the best&#8208;performing acid&#8208;stable OER non&#8208;noble metal materials. The optimized catalyst with interatomic Co&#8722;Co distance (ca. 2.80&#8197;&#197;) followed oxo&#8208;oxo coupling mechanism that involved obvious oxygen bridges on dinuclear Co sites (1,090&#8197;cm&#8722;1), confirmed by in situ SR&#8208;FTIR, XAFS and theoretical simulations. Furthermore, a major breakthrough of 120,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 high mass current density using the first reported noble metal&#8208;free cobalt anode catalyst of Co&#8722;Co DASs/ZCC in PEM&#8208;WE at 2.14&#8197;V was recorded.

         <title>Sterically Allowed H&#8208;type Supramolecular Polymerizations</title>

Systematic increase in the bulkiness of dye substituents revealed an unexpected thermodynamic stability of face&#8208;to&#8208;face (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions during supramolecular polymerization. Our results contribute to the development of functional supramolecular polymers by controlling dye&#8208;dye interactions through molecular design.







Abstract
The functionalization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds with sterically demanding substituents is a widely used tactic to suppress cofacial (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions, which may even inhibit self&#8208;assembly. Contrary to expectations, we demonstrate herein that increasing steric effects can result in an enhanced thermodynamic stability of H&#8208;type supramolecular polymers. In our approach, we have investigated two boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes with bulky phenyl (2) and mesityl (3) meso&#8208;substituents and compared their self&#8208;assembly in nonpolar media with that of a parent meso&#8208;methyl BODIPY 1 lacking bulky groups. While the enhanced steric demand induces pathway complexity, the superior thermodynamic stability of the H&#8208;type pathways can be rationalized in terms of additional enthalpic gain arising from intermolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;B interactions of the orthogonally arranged aromatic substituents, which overrule their inherent steric demand. Our findings underline the importance of balancing competing non&#8208;covalent interactions in self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Fluorogenic Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Glycan&#8208;Binding Protein Recognition Using a Fluorinated Azido&#8208;Coumarin Fucoside</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoaffinity labeling has been a staple of chemical biology for the capture of non&#8208;covalent interactions. Through conjugation of a trifluorinated 7&#8208;azido&#8208;coumarin to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photo&#8208;crosslinking of glycan&#8208;protein interactions. This strategy and these &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; enable traceable photoaffinity labeling and could prove uniquely valuable for imaging biological recognition of glycans.







Abstract
Glycan recognition by glycan&#8208;binding proteins is central to the biology of all living organisms. The efficient capture and characterization of relatively weak non&#8208;covalent interactions remains an important challenge in various fields of research. Photoaffinity labeling strategies can create covalent bonds between interacting partners, and photoactive scaffolds such as benzophenone, diazirines and aryl azides have proved widely useful. Since their first introduction, relatively few improvements have been advanced and products of photoaffinity labeling remain difficult to detect. We report a fluorinated azido&#8208;coumarin scaffold which enables photolabeling under fast and mild activation, and which can leave a fluorescent tag on crosslinked species. Coupling this scaffold to an &#945;&#8208;fucoside, we demonstrate fluorogenic photolabeling of glycan&#8208;protein interactions over a wide range of affinities. We expect this strategy to be broadly applicable to other chromophores and we envision that such &#8220;fluoro&#8208;crosslinkers&#8221; could become important tools for the traceable capture of non&#8208;covalent binding events.

         <title>Cascade Energy Transfer and White&#8208;Light Emission in Chirality&#8208;Controlled Crystallization&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Dimensional Co&#8208;assemblies from Donor and Acceptor Dye&#8208;Conjugated Polylactides</title>

         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission by sequential F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from thermally robust precision two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies is unravelled. It is driven by stereocomplex crystallization between two complementary chromophore&#8208;conjugated polylactide stereoisomers in the presence of an external dye.







Abstract
Achieving predictable and programmable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures with specific functions from exclusively organic soft materials remains a scientific challenge. This article unravels stereocomplex crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly as a facile method for producing thermally robust discrete 2D&#8208;platelets of diamond shape from biodegradable semicrystalline polylactide (PLA) scaffolds. The method involves co&#8208;assembling two PLA stereoisomers, namely, PY&#8208;PDLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA, which form stereocomplex (SC)&#8208;crystals in isopropanol. By conjugating a well&#8208;known F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor and acceptor dye, namely, pyrene (PY) and naphthalene monoimide (NMI), respectively, to the chain termini of these two interacting stereoisomers, a thermally robust FRET process can be stimulated from the 2D array of the co&#8208;assembled dyes on the thermally resilient SC&#8208;PLA crystal surfaces. Uniquely, by decorating the surface of the SC&#8208;PLA crystals with an externally immobilized guest dye, Rhodamine&#8208;B, similar diamond&#8208;shaped structures could be produced that exhibit pure white&#8208;light emission through a surface&#8208;induced two&#8208;step cascade energy transfer process. The FRET response in these systems displays remarkable dependence on the intrinsic crystalline packing, which could be modulated by the chirality of the co&#8208;assembling PLA chains. This is supported by comparing the properties of similar 2D platelets generated from two homochiral PLLAs (PY&#8208;PLLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA) labeled with the same FRET pair.

         <title>A Lantern&#8208;Shaped Pd(II) Cage Constructed from Four Different Low&#8208;Symmetry Ligands with Positional and Orientational Control: An Ancillary Pairings Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cage with four different low&#8208;symmetry ligands, with positional and orientational control, has been built by using ancillary pairings. In this approach, the ligands with Pd(II)&#8208;binding sites come together in complementary ways due to their denticity (3&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 2&#8201;:&#8201;2) and/or hydrogen&#8208;bonding capability (AA&#8201;:&#8201;DD or AD&#8201;:&#8201;DA).







Abstract
One of the key challenges of metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry is to maintain the ease of self&#8208;assembly but, at the same time, create structures of increasingly high levels of complexity. In palladium(II) quadruply stranded lantern&#8208;shaped cages, this has been achieved through either 1)&#8197;the formation of heteroleptic (multi&#8208;ligand) assemblies, or 2)&#8197;homoleptic assemblies from low&#8208;symmetry ligands. Heteroleptic cages formed from low&#8208;symmetry ligands, a hybid of these two approaches, would add an additional rich level of complexity but no examples of these have been reported. Here we use a system of ancillary complementary ligand pairings at the termini of cage ligands to target heteroleptic assemblies: these complementary pairs can only interact (through coordination to a single Pd(II) metal ion) between ligands in a cis position on the cage. Complementarity between each pair (and orthogonality to other pairs) is controlled by denticity (tridentate to monodentate or bidentate to bidentate) and/or hydrogen&#8208;bonding capability (AA to DD or AD to DA). This allows positional and orientational control over ligands with different ancillary sites. By using this approach, we have successfully used low&#8208;symmetry ligands to synthesise complex heteroleptic cages, including an example with four different low&#8208;symmetry ligands.

         <title>Artificial Peptide&#8208;Protein Necrosomes Promote Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural feature of natural necrosome, kinase&#8208;biomimetic D&#8208;retro&#8208;inverso peptides (DRI&#8208;peptides) are designed and able to strongly associate with kinases. This feature of the peptides facilitates formation of artificial peptide&#8208;protein necrosomes and thus selectively activating the necrotic signaling pathway to induce cellular necroptosis.







Abstract
The presence of disordered region or large interacting surface within proteins significantly challenges the development of targeted drugs, commonly known as the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue. Here, we report a heterogeneous peptide&#8208;protein assembling strategy to selectively phosphorylate proteins, thereby activating the necroptotic signaling pathway and promoting cell necroptosis. Inspired by the structures of natural necrosomes formed by receptor interacting protein kinases (RIPK) 1 and 3, the kinase&#8208;biomimetic peptides are rationally designed by incorporating natural or D&#8208;amino acids, or connecting D&#8208;amino acids in a retro&#8208;inverso (DRI) manner, leading to one RIPK3&#8208;biomimetic peptide PR3 and three RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides. Individual peptides undergo self&#8208;assembly into nanofibrils, whereas mixing RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides with PR3 accelerates and enhances assembly of PR3. In particular, RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptide DRI&#8208;PR1 exhibits reliable binding affinity with protein RIPK3, resulting in specific cytotoxicity to colon cancer cells that overexpress RIPK3. Mechanistic studies reveal the increased phosphorylation of RIPK3 induced by RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides, elucidating the activation of the necroptotic signaling pathway responsible for cell death without an obvious increase in secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings highlight the potential of peptide&#8208;protein hybrid aggregation as a promising approach to address the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue and provide alternative strategies for overcoming cancer resistance in the future.

         <dc:description>
Broad screening of the substrate specificity of SIRT7 revealed a strong preference for the cleavage of long&#8208;chain acyllysine modifications. The activity was substantially increased in the presence of oligonucleotides or nucleosome particles. Finally, random nonstandard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID) delivered a cyclopeptide with potency in the sub&#8208;micromolar range and selectivity for SIRT7, which binds and stabilizes SIRT7 in cells.







Abstract
The sirtuins are NAD+&#8208;dependent lysine deacylases, comprising seven isoforms (SIRT1&#8211;7) in humans, which are involved in the regulation of a plethora of biological processes, including gene expression and metabolism. The sirtuins share a common hydrolytic mechanism but display preferences for different &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine substrates. SIRT7 deacetylates targets in nuclei and nucleoli but remains one of the lesser studied of the seven isoforms, in part due to a lack of chemical tools to specifically probe SIRT7 activity. Here we expressed SIRT7 and, using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, reveal SIRT7 to be a monomeric enzyme with a low degree of globular flexibility in solution. We developed a fluorogenic assay for investigation of the substrate preferences of SIRT7 and to evaluate compounds that modulate its activity. We report several mechanism&#8208;based SIRT7 inhibitors as well as de novo cyclic peptide inhibitors selected from mRNA&#8208;display library screening that exhibit selectivity for SIRT7 over other sirtuin isoforms, stabilize SIRT7 in cells, and cause an increase in the acetylation of H3&#8201;K18.

         <title>Rational Design of an Air&#8208;Stable, High&#8208;Spin Diradical with Diazapyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method has been developed for installing stable polyradicals into polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems, as illustrated by the formation of an air&#8208;stable, high&#8208;spin carbon&#8208;based diradical with a new ferromagnetic coupling motif of diazapyrene. The structure of the diradical was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, while the magnetic measurements provided unambiguous evidence for the high&#8208;spin ground state and a long spin relaxation process.







Abstract
Stable carbon&#8208;based polyradicals exhibiting strong spin&#8208;spin coupling and slow depolarization processes are particularly attractive functional materials. A new molecular motif synthesized by a convenient method that allows the integration of stable, high&#8208;spin radicals to (hetero)aromatic polycycles has been developed, as illustrated by a non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradical showing a triplet ground state with long persistency (&#964;1/2&#8776;31&#8197;h) in air. Compared to the widely used 1,3&#8208;phenylene, the newly designed (diaza)pyrene&#8208;4,10&#8208;diyl moiety is for the first time demonstrated to confer ferromagnetic (FM) spin coupling, allowing delocalized non&#8208;disjoint SOMOs. With the X&#8208;ray crystallography unambiguously proving the diradical structure, the triplet ground state was thoroughly characterized. A large &#916;ES&#8208;T of 1.1&#8197;kcal/mol, proving the strong FM coupling effect, was revealed consistently by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements and variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, while the zero&#8208;field splitting and triplet nutation characters were examined by continuous&#8208;wave and pulsed EPR spectroscopy. A millisecond spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time was also detected. The current study not only offers a new molecular motif enabling FM coupling between carbon&#8208;based spins, but more importantly presents a general method for installing stable polyradicals into functional &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Modular Customization and Regulation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Membrane Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular customization strategy was applied for efficient MOF membrane fabrication. MOF material screening, defect&#8208;free membrane output, membrane physicochemical property regulation and separation applications can be rapidly realized by separately designing and modifying the MOF module within the membrane. High separation performance is easily achieved, which can meet diverse separation requirements.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered ideal membrane candidates for energy&#8208;efficient separations. However, the MOF membrane amount to date is only a drop in the bucket compared to the material collections. The fabrication of an arbitrary MOF membrane exhibiting inherent separation capacity of the material remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a MOF modular customization strategy by employing four MOFs with diverse structures and physicochemical properties and achieving innovative defect&#8208;free membranes for efficient separation validation. Each membrane fully displays the separation potential according to the MOF pore/channel microenvironment, and consequently, an intriguing H2/CO2 separation performance sequence is achieved (separation factor of 1656&#8211;5.4, H2 permeance of 964&#8211;2745 gas permeation unit). Taking advantage of this strategy, separation performance can be manipulated by a non&#8208;destructive modification separately towards the MOF module. This work establishes a universal full&#8208;chain demonstration for membrane fabrication&#8208;separation validation&#8208;microstructure modification and opens an avenue for exclusive customization of membranes for important separations.

         <title>The Construction of Highly Substituted Piperidines via Dearomative Functionalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction of pyridines generates highly substituted piperidines, featuring diverse functional handles, with excellent site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity. The origin of the unprecedented selectivities and additional insights into the reaction mechanism are discussed based on combined experimental mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocycles play a vital role in pharmaceuticals and natural products, with the six&#8208;membered aromatic and aliphatic architectures being commonly used. While synthetic methods for aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles are well&#8208;established, the synthesis of their aliphatic functionalized analogues, particularly piperidine derivatives, poses a significant challenge. In that regard, we propose a stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction for the construction of highly decorated piperidine derivatives with diverse functional handles. We also discuss challenges related to site&#8208;selectivity, regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, and provide insights into the reaction mechanism through mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.

         <title>Lattice Distortion and H&#8208;passivation in Pure Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Stable Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a new understanding on the activation of 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of carbon materials, through H&#8208;passivated and distorted lattices, and demonstrated how carbon cloth can be offered via this strategy with excellent and stable 2e&#8722; ORR for the H2O2 production.







Abstract
The exploration of inexpensive and efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for chemical and energy industries. Carbon materials have been proved promising with different catalysts enabling 2 and 4e&#8722; ORR. Nevertheless, their ORR activity and selectivity is still complex and under debate in many cases. Many structures of these active carbon materials are also chemically unstable for practical implementations. Unlike the well&#8208;discussed structures, this work presents a strategy to promote efficient and stable 2e&#8722; ORR of carbon materials through the synergistic effect of lattice distortion and H&#8208;passivation (on the distorted structure). We show how these structures can be formed on carbon cloth, and how the reproducible chemical adsorption can be realized on these structures for efficient and stable H2O2 production. The work here gives not only new understandings on the 2e&#8722; ORR catalysis, but also the robust catalyst which can be directly used in industry.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Topochemical Synthesis of a Collagen&#8208;inspired Covalent Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic covalent helical polymers in solid form are in high demand. By biomimicry, we designed a dipeptide monomer containing azide and alkyne that organize in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail as supramolecular helices in their crystals. Upon heating, the monomer undergoes SCSC TAAC polymerization to yield a covalent helical polymer. Single crystals of this fully organic polymer show high flexural strength, compressive strength and load&#8208;bearing capacity.







Abstract
There is much demand for crystalline covalent helical polymers. Inspired by the helical structure of collagen, we synthesized a covalent helical polymer wherein the repeating dipeptide Gly&#8208;Pro units are connected by triazole linkages. We synthesized an azide and alkyne&#8208;modified dipeptide monomer made up of the repeating amino acid sequence of collagen. In its crystals, the monomer molecules aligned in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion with proximally placed azide and alkyne forming supramolecular helices. At 60&#8201;&#176;C, the monomer underwent single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a covalent helical polymer as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Compared to the monomer crystals, the polymer single&#8208;crystals were very strong and showed three&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus, which is higher than collagen, many synthetic polymers and other materials. The crystals of this covalent helical polymer could bear loads as high as 1.5&#8197;million times of their own weight without deformation. These crystals could also withstand high compression force and did not disintegrate even at an applied force of 98&#8197;kN. Such light&#8208;weight strong materials are in demand for various technological applications.

A design strategy toward near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes based on utilization of an antiaromatic azepine is reported by Masahito Murai, Takahiro Enoki, and Shigehiro Yamaguchi in their Research Article (e202311445). While benzo&#8208;fused azepines take bent conformations, which undergo large structural relaxation to planar conformations in the excited state, thieno&#8208;fused congeners with electron&#8208;accepting groups at both termini adopt flat conformations even in the ground state, giving rise to NIR&#8208;emissions that exceed 850 nm.

Electrochemical 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation is a sustainable tool for introducing important vicinal diol&#8208;related structures in alkenes. The scuba divers in the cover picture perform the highly efficient diacetoxylation of alkenes using renewable electricity as the driving force, as reported by Dirk De&#8197;Vos and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202311539). Excellent yields are obtained with a wide scope of aliphatic and aromatic alkenes in an atom&#8208;efficient and versatile protocol, with also application to lactone synthesis.

The rational design of metal oxide catalysts is a challenge. In their Research Article (e202310062), Bingsen Zhang, Evgenii V. Kondratenko, Zhong&#8208;Wen Liu et&#8197;al. report that structural properties of supported/bulk metal oxides can be controlled through catalyst post&#8208;treatment in an NH3&#8901;H2O solution because of dissolution and simultaneous precipitation of individual catalyst components. The method enables to tailor catalyst reducibility that plays a pivotal role for C&#8722;H bond activation in hydrocarbons.

This minireview provides an overview of recent developments in target&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions and their applications for different therapeutic targets. In addition, a perspective is provided on the challenges and future directions of this emerging field for expanding their practical application.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry is a promising toolbox for dissecting biological processes in the native environment. Recently, bioorthogonal reactions have attracted considerable attention in the medical field for treating diseases, since this approach may lead to improved drug efficacy and reduced side effects via in situ drug synthesis. For precise biomedical applications, it is a prerequisite that the reactions should occur in the right locations and on the appropriate therapeutic targets. In this minireview, we highlight the design and development of targeted bioorthogonal reactions for precise medical treatment. First, we compile recent strategies for achieving target&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions. Further, we emphasize their application for the precise treatment of different therapeutic targets. Finally, a perspective is provided on the challenges and future directions of this emerging field for safe, efficient, and translatable disease treatment.

         <title>Synthetic Advantages of Defluorinative C&#8722;F Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advantages of using C&#8722;F bonds as functional handles for chemical synthesis. Specific examples are used to illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can streamline small molecule synthesis and enable new reactions. The goal of this review is to educate chemists on the opportunities available for incorporating C&#8722;F bonds in synthetic route planning and for exploiting the unique mechanistic pathways available to C&#8722;F bonds.







Abstract
Much progress has been made in the development of methods to both create compounds that contain C&#8722;F bonds and to functionalize C&#8722;F bonds. As such, C&#8722;F bonds are becoming common and versatile synthetic functional handles. This review summarizes the advantages of defluorinative functionalization reactions for small molecule synthesis. The coverage is organized by the type of carbon framework the fluorine is attached to for mono&#8208; and polyfluorinated motifs. The main challenges, opportunities and advances of defluorinative functionalization are discussed for each class of organofluorine. Most of the text focuses on case studies that illustrate how defluorofunctionalization can improve routes to synthetic targets or how the properties of C&#8722;F bonds enable unique mechanisms and reactions. The broader goal is to showcase the opportunities for incorporating and exploiting C&#8722;F bonds in the design of synthetic routes, improvement of specific reactions and advent of new methods.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>

COFs are emerging and promising candidates in photocatalytic H2O2 production. Significant progress has developed in the past several years. However, comprehensive reviews on this specific field are lacking. This minireview presents an overview of the development of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production, highlighting the recent strategies to optimize COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. The insights into the future development of industrial&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;effective H2O2 production are also offered.







Abstract
Benefiting from the excellent structural tunability, robust framework, ultrahigh porosity, and rich active sites, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are widely recognized as promising photocatalysts in chemical conversions, and emerged in the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis in 2020. H2O2, serving as an environmental&#8208;friendly oxidant and a promising liquid fuel, has attracted increasing researchers to explore its potential. Over the past few years, numerous COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts are developed with encouraging achievements in H2O2 production, whereas no comprehensive review articles exist to summarize this specific and significant area. Herein we provide a systematic overview of the advances and challenges of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production. We first introduce the priorities of COFs in H2O2 photosynthesis. Then, various strategies to improve COFs photocatalytic efficiency are discussed. The perspective and outlook for future advances of COFs in this emerging field are finally offered. This timely review will pave the way for the development of highly efficient COFs photocatalysts for practical production of value&#8208;added chemicals not limited to H2O2.

Over the past few years, numerous COFs-based photocatalysts are developed with encouraging achievements in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, whereas no comprehensive review articles exist to summarize this specific and significant area. Herein we provide a systematic overview of the advances and challenges of COFs in photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. We first introduce the priorities of COFs in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis. Then, various strategies to improve COFs photocatalytic efficiency are discussed. The perspective and outlook for future advances of COFs in this emerging field are finally offered. This timely review will pave the way for the development of highly efficient COFs photocatalysts for practical production of value-added chemicals not limited to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Metals in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Via Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Matrix isolation of low&#8208;valent complexes within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) facilitates exceptional gas&#8208;phase catalytic activity, stabilization of solution&#8208;inaccessible catalysts, and fundamental insight into pertinent reaction mechanisms. MOFs present an ideal porous, crystalline, and chemically mutable matrix for such species. Herein we examine synthesis techniques and applications for the matrix isolation of low&#8208;valent complexes within MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide uniquely tunable, periodic platforms for site&#8208;isolation of reactive low&#8208;valent metal complexes of relevance in modern catalysis, adsorptive applications, and fundamental structural studies. Strategies for integrating such species in MOFs include post&#8208;synthetic metalation, encapsulation and direct synthesis using low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes as building blocks. These approaches have each proven effective in enhancing catalytic activity, modulating product distributions (i.e., by improving catalytic selectivity), and providing valuable mechanistic insights. In this minireview, we explore these different strategies, as applied to isolate low&#8208;valent species within MOFs, with a particular focus on examples that leverage the unique crystallinity, permanent porosity and chemical mutability of MOFs to achieve deep structural insights that lead to new paradigms in the field of hybrid catalysis.

The multifunctionality of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based textiles encourages innovation of a wearable platform technology capable of sensing, filtration, detoxification, and catalysis. This Review focuses on the implementation of MOFs at the fiber level to form functional components in smart textiles.







Abstract
Owing to high modularity and synthetic tunability, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on textiles are poised to contribute to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art wearable systems with multifunctional performance. While these composite materials have demonstrated promising functions in sensing, filtration, detoxification, and biomedicine, their applicability in multifunctional systems is only beginning to materialize. This review highlights the multifunctionality and versatility of MOF&#8208;integrated textile systems. It summarizes the operational goals of MOF@textile composites, encompassing sensing, filtration, detoxification, drug delivery, UV protection, and photocatalysis. Building upon these recent advances, this review concludes with an outlook on emerging opportunities for the diverse applications of MOF@textile systems in the realm of smart wearables.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Branched Enones via Chloroacylation of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show the conversion of unactivated alkenes into &#945;&#8208;branched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (enones) and esters. Regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides and chloroformates takes place under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.







Abstract
Here, we show the conversion of unactivated alkenes into &#945;&#8208;branched enones via regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides. The method relies upon the initial in situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the acyl chloride precursor under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Arylglycines via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Sch&#246;llkopf Bis&#8208;Lactim Ethers with Aryl Chlorides</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalytic methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide promotes the coupling of chiral tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived Sch&#246;llkopf bis&#8208;lactim ether with cheap aryl chlorides at room temperature in yields up to 95&#8201;% and &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr. This enables a convenient access to non&#8208;natural tertiary arylglycines, which are key structural motifs in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This protocol is also suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of common pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Arylglycines are important pharmacophores present in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This compound class has now been made accessible from abundant aryl chlorides by a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sch&#246;llkopf&#8208;type amino acid synthesis. In the presence of the catalyst methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide, the base lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidide and the additive ZnCl2, tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived bis&#8208;lactim ethers were efficiently arylated at room temperature, reaching yields of 95&#8201;% and diastereoselectivities of 98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Hydrolysis gave the corresponding arylglycines in high enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Uniform Colloidal Polymer Rods by Stabilizer&#8208;Assisted Liquid&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform colloidal polymer rods/disks with tunable aspect ratios and well&#8208;defined internal molecular packing and orientations were successfully achieved from homopolymers or random copolymers by stabilizer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. They show an unusual photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying memory effect, which have been used for high&#8208;level encryption and secure delivery of paper documents.







Abstract
The synthesis of anisotropic colloidal building blocks is essential for their self&#8208;assembly into hierarchical materials. Here, a highly efficient stabilizer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (SA&#8208;LCDSA) strategy was developed to achieve monodisperse colloidal polymer rods. This strategy does not require the use of block copolymers, but only homopolymers or random copolymers. The resulting rods have tunable size and aspect ratios, as well as well&#8208;defined columnar liquid crystal structures. The integrated triphenylene units enable the rods to exhibit unusual photo&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying irradiation memory effect, which, as demonstrated, are attractive for information encryption/decryption of paper documents. In particular, unwanted document decryption during delivery can be examined by fluorescence kinetics. This SA&#8208;LCDSA&#8208;based approach can be extended to synthesize other functional particles with desired &#960;&#8208;molecular units.

The integrated triphenylene units enable the rods to exhibit unusual photo-induced fluorescence enhancement and accompanying irradiation memory effect, which, as demonstrated, are attractive for information encryption/decryption of paper documents. In particular, unwanted document decryption during delivery can be examined by fluorescence kinetics. This SA-LCDSA-based approach can be extended to synthesize other functional particles with desired &#960;-molecular units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulation of Multiple Resonance Delayed Fluorescence via Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Excited State towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual steric and electronic effects of through&#8208;space charge transfer excited states have been exploited to concurrently shorten the delayed fluorescence lifetime and mitigate the aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching of multiple resonance B&#8722;N emitter. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the new emitter show high efficiencies, small efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and good operational stability.







Abstract
B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters usually suffer from slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching. Here, we report the design of a sandwich structure by placing the B&#8722;N MR core between two electron&#8208;donating moieties, inducing through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) states. The proper adjusting of the energy levels brings about a 10&#8208;fold higher RISC rate in comparison with the parent B&#8722;N molecule. In the meantime, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 91&#8201;% and a good color purity were maintained. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the new MR emitter achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.7&#8201;% and small roll&#8208;offs at high brightness. High device efficiencies were also obtained for a wide range of doping concentrations of up to 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% thanks to the steric shielding of the B&#8722;N core. A good operational stability with LT95 of 85.2&#8197;h has also been revealed. The dual steric and electronic effects resulting from the introduction of a TSCT state offer an effective molecular design to address the critical challenges of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Toughening Brittle Bio&#8208;P3HB with Synthetic P3HB of Engineered Stereomicrostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The longstanding mechanical brittleness issue associated with stereoperfect biological or synthetic P3HB is solved through blending it with synthetic P3HB with specifically engineered stereomicrostructures, which not only drastically enhances the toughness by &gt;156&#215; and optical clarity but also largely maintains its otherwise desirably high elastic modulus, tensile strength, melting temperature.







Abstract
Poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB), a biologically produced, biodegradable natural polyester, exhibits excellent thermal and barrier properties but suffers from mechanical brittleness, largely limiting its applications. Here we report a mono&#8208;material product design strategy to toughen stereoperfect, brittle bio or synthetic P3HB by blending it with stereomicrostructurally engineered P3HB. Through tacticity ([mm] from 0 to 100&#8201;%) and molecular weight (Mn to 788&#8197;kDa) tuning, high&#8208;performance synthetic P3HB materials with tensile strength to &#8776;30&#8197;MPa, fracture strain to &#8776;800&#8201;%, and toughness to 126&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3 (&gt;110&#215; tougher than bio&#8208;P3HB) have been produced. Physical blending of the brittle P3HB with such P3HB in 10 to 90&#8197;wt&#8201;% dramatically enhances its ductility from &#8776;5&#8201;% to 95&#8211;450&#8201;% and optical clarity from 19&#8201;% to 85&#8201;% visible light transmittance while maintaining desirably high elastic modulus (&gt;1&#8197;GPa), tensile strength (&gt;35&#8197;MPa), and melting temperature (160&#8211;170&#8201;&#176;C). This P3HB&#8208;toughening&#8208;P3HB methodology departs from the traditional approach of incorporating chemically distinct components to toughen P3HB, which hinders chemical or mechanical recycling, highlighting the potential of the mono&#8208;material product design solely based on biodegradable P3HB to deliver P3HB materials with diverse performance properties.

         <title>Propeller vs Quasi&#8208;Planar 6&#8208;Cantilever Small Molecular Platforms with Extremely Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Extension</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two exotic 6&#8208;cantilever small molecular platforms, characteristic of quite different molecular configurations of propeller and quasi&#8208;plane, are established by extremely two&#8208;dimensional conjugated extension on different elementary units (triptycene vs. triphenylene), demonstrating two pioneered yet highly promising molecular innovation platforms for organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Two exotic 6&#8208;cantilever small molecular platforms, characteristic of quite different molecular configurations of propeller and quasi&#8208;plane, are established by extremely two&#8208;dimensional conjugated extension. When applied in small molecular acceptors, the only two cases of CH25 and CH26 that could contain six terminals and such broad conjugated backbones have been afforded thus far, rendering featured absorptions, small reorganization and exciton binding energies. Moreover, their distinctive but completely different molecular geometries result in sharply contrasting nanoscale film morphologies. Finally, CH26 contributes to the best device efficiency of 15.41&#8201;% among acceptors with six terminals, demonstrating two pioneered yet highly promising 6&#8208;cantilever molecular innovation platforms.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Transfer Protocol for the Hydroxyalkenylation of Alkenes Using 1,2&#8208;Bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple protocol for alkene hydroxyalkenylation by 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene was developed using persulfate anion as a one&#8208;electron oxidizing reagent. Regioselective hydroxyalkenylation was observed for a variety of substituted alkenes. A photocatalytic protocol for alkoxyalkenylation using an acridinium salt was also successful.







Abstract
We report a protocol for alkene hydroxyalkenylation. Using a persulfate anion as a one&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation reagent and 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethylene as a radical acceptor in the presence of water, alkenes were converted into the corresponding 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyalkenes in good to high yields. The hydroxyalkenylation process involves the nucleophilic hydroxylation of alkene radical cations to give &#946;&#8208;hydroxyalkyl radicals, which, after a radical addition/&#946;&#8208;elimination sequence, provide the products. We also report a photocatalytic protocol for alkoxyalkenylation.

         <title>Modulating Ligand&#8208;Exchange Dynamics on Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Reversible Sorting and Hybridization of Miktoarm Star Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra possess logarithmic ligand&#8208;exchange dynamics that can only be activated at high temperatures. They have been applied as crosslinker templates for the synthesis of miktoarm star polymers with target compositions by thermal annealing of the mixture of star homo&#8208;polymers.

The precise synthesis of miktoarm star polymers (MSPs) remains one of the great challenges in synthetic chemistry due to the difficulty in locating appropriate structural templates and polymer grafting/growing strategies with high selectivity and efficiency. Herein, &#8776;2&#8197;nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs), constructed from the coordination of isophthalic acid (IPA) and Cu2+, are applied as templates for the precise synthesis of 24&#8208;arm MSPs for their unique logarithmic ligand&#8208;exchange dynamics. Six different polymers are prepared with IPA as an end group and they further coordinated with Cu2+ to afford the corresponding 24&#8208;arm star homo&#8208;polymers. MSPs can be obtained by mixing targeted homo&#8208;arm star polymers in solutions upon thermal annealing. The compositions of MSPs can be facilely and precisely tuned by the recipe of the star polymer mixtures used. Interestingly, the obtained MSPs can be sorted into homo&#8208;arm star polymers through a typical solvent extraction procedure. The hybridization and sorting process can be reversibly conducted through the cycle of thermal annealing and solvent treatment. The complex coordination framework not only opens new avenues for the facile and precise synthesis of MSPs and MOPs with hybrid functionalities, but also provides the capability to design sustainable polymer systems.

&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic polyhedra possess logarithmic ligand-exchange dynamics that can only be activated at high temperatures. They have been applied as crosslinker templates for the synthesis of miktoarm star polymers with target compositions by thermal annealing of the mixture of star homo-polymers. The reversible sorting process can be conducted through a typical solvent extraction procedure.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Mediator Duality of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene in Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond Formation with Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene acts as a substrate and a mediator in an electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming reaction with alkyl bromides. The reaction conditions avoid competing alkyl radical homocoupling and allows for the accommodation of alkyl bromides with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups that are difficult to incorporate using alternative C(sp3) precursors.







Abstract
Electrochemical approaches to form C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds have focused on coupling C(sp3) electrophiles that form stabilized carbon&#8208;centered radicals upon reduction or oxidation. Whereas alkyl bromides are desirable C(sp3) coupling partners owing to their availability and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their tendency to undergo radical&#8208;radical homocoupling makes them challenging substrates for electroreductive cross&#8208;coupling. Herein, we disclose a metal&#8208;free regioselective cross&#8208;coupling of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene, a useful precursor to aromatic nitriles, and alkyl bromides. Alkyl bromide reduction is mediated directly by 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene radical anions, leading to negligible homocoupling and high cross&#8208;selectivity to form 1,4&#8208;alkyl cyanobenzenes. The cross&#8208;coupling scheme is compatible with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups such as amines and alcohols, which have proven difficult to incorporate in alternative electrochemical approaches using carboxylic acids as C(sp3) precursors.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Cyanoacetates Enabled by Chiral Amide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;(heteroaryl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl cyanoacetates was achieved by Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted cyanoacetates under the assistance of two types of chiral ligands, (S)&#8208;nobin&#8208;embodied picolinamides and L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived amides. The reaction afforded the coupling products bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The (S)&#8208;nobin&#8208;embodied picolinamide and L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived amide are effective ligands for Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective coupling reaction of (hetero)aryl iodides with &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted cyanoacetates. This arylation reaction gave &#945;&#8208;(heteroaryl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl cyanoacetates in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee). A variety of functionalized (hetero)aryl and alkyl groups could be introduced to the quaternary center and therefore provided a valuable tool for preparing enantioenriched compounds with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups. The size of both &#945;&#8208;alkyl and ester groups was proven as the key factor for asymmetric induction.

         <title>Clustering Six Electrons within &#8220;Dawson&#8208;Like&#8221; Polyoxometalate: An Open Route toward Its Post&#8208;functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The super&#8208;reduction of Dawson&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POM) [H2AsW18O60]7&#8722; in water involves a disproportionation process generating POM with a metal&#8208;metal bonded triad as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and multi&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance investigations. Then, the resulting six&#8208;electron reduced POM was used as a precursor to construct the largest POM containing W4+ reported to date.







Abstract
Super&#8208;reduction of polyoxometalates (POMs) in solution is of fundamental interest for designing innovative energy storage systems. In this article, we show that the &#8220;Dawson&#8208;like&#8221; POM can undergo a disproportionation process during its massive electron uptake, leading to species containing three metal&#8208;metal bonds as evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction, multi&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H and 183W NMR), extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), UV/Vis, and voltammetry techniques. This result indicates that electron storing within metal&#8208;metal bonds is not a unique property of Keggin&#8208;type POM as postulated since the 70s. Besides, we demonstrate that the presence of an electron&#8208;rich triad in the &#8220;Dawson&#8208;like&#8221; POM allows its post&#8208;functionalization with additional tungstate ions, generating a chiral molecule that is also the largest WIV&#8208;containing POMs known to date.

         <title>Enhanced Gain in Organic Photodetectors Using the Polymer with Singlet Open&#8208;Shell Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of achieving high photoresponse and low dark or noise current with a fast response speed under a low bias in polymer photodetectors, this study demonstrates the potential of incorporating the polymer with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state in the active layer to enhance the performance of organic photodetectors.







Abstract
Photodetectors are critical components in intelligent optoelectronic systems, and photomultiplication&#8208;capable devices are essential for detecting weak optical signals. Despite significant advances, developing photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodetectors with high gain and low noise current simultaneously remains challenging. In this work, a new conjugated polymer PDN with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state is introduced in active layers for electron capture, and the corresponding PDN&#8208;based photodetectors exhibited an enhanced photoelectric gain and decreased dark current density at a low forward bias. At 1.5&#8197;V, the PDN&#8208;based ternary photodetector has the external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 2552.3&#8201;% and the specific detectivity of 1.4&#215;1014&#8197;Jones at 710&#8197;nm calculated by the measured noise current, with the gain 22&#8197;times higher than that of the control group. This study provides an approach for exploiting polymers with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state to enhance the gain of organic photodetectors.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Enantioselective Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Radical&#8208;Radical Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective radical&#8208;radical coupling using combined photoredox/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis was developed. The coupling of a ketyl radical and an sp3&#8208;carbon radical allows access to &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields and enantioselectivities. Computational investigations reveal the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene controls the double&#8208;facial selectivity of the ketyl radical and the alkyl radicals, respectively.







Abstract
An enantioselective carbene&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;radical coupling of acyl imidazoles and racemic Hantzsch esters is disclosed. This method involves the coupling of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;derived ketyl radical and a secondary sp3&#8208;carbon radical and allows access to chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl aliphatic ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields and enantioselectivities without any competitive epimerization. The utility of this protocol is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various pharmaceutical compounds and is further demonstrated by the transformation of the enantioenriched products to biologically relevant molecules. Computational investigations reveal the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene controls the double&#8208;facial selectivity of the ketyl radical and the alkyl radicals, respectively.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Cyclobutenes from a Common Scaffold: Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled enantioselective desymmetrization of a novel dibromocyclobutene facilitates access to a versatile cyclobutene intermediate that can be functionalized to access a wide range of chiral 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted cyclobutenes and cyclobutanes.







Abstract
Four&#8208;membered carbocycles are important structural motifs found in several natural products and drugs. Amongst those, cyclobutenes are attractive intermediates because the residual olefin can be manipulated selectively into various saturated and unsaturated analogs. Few methods exist to access chiral tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutenes and they are generally limited in terms of diversification. Herein, a divergent synthetic strategy was developed where a single optically enriched scaffold is diversified into a variety of derivatives with different substitution patterns. To this end, the enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral 1,2&#8208;dibromocyclobutene imides was enabled by a dual Ir/Ni&#8208;catalyzed photoredox C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling with an alkyltrifluoroborate salt to install a convertible carbon fragment in good yields and &gt;90&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. Exceptional mono&#8208;coupling selectivity is observed and the resulting chiral bromocyclobutene serves as a common scaffold that can be transformed in a divergent manner into several valuable 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra&#8208;C&#8208;substituted cyclobutane products while maintaining optical purity.

         <title>High&#8208;Spin and Reactive Fe13 Cluster with Exposed Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high nuclearity Fe13 cluster with metal&#8208;metal interactions was prepared from a WFe3S3 precursor. This compound displays a large room temperature spin value and undergoes core structural rearrangement upon multielectron group transfer chemistry.







Abstract
Atomically defined large metal clusters have applications in new reaction development and preparation of materials with tailored properties. Expanding the synthetic toolbox for reactive high nuclearity metal complexes, we report a new class of Fe clusters, Tp*4W4Fe13S12, displaying a Fe13 core with M&#8722;M bonds that has precedent only in main group and late metal chemistry. M13 clusters with closed shell electron configurations can show significant stability and have been classified as superatoms. In contrast, Tp*4W4Fe13S12 displays a large spin ground state of S=13. This compound performs small molecule activations involving the transfer of up to 12 electrons resulting in significant cluster rearrangements.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence BN&#8208;Doped Corannulene Trimer Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and properties of the radical cations of mixed&#8208;valence polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trimers have remained elusive because of their intrinsic instability. This has been overcome by the reaction of BN&#8208;doped corannulenes with oxidants. EPR spectroscopic analysis of the resulting compounds demonstrated the existence of two unpaired electrons, and theoretical calculations confirmed the uneven distribution of spin density.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;valence (MV) dimers have been extensively investigated, however, the structure and properties of purely organic MV trimers based on open&#8208;shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons remain elusive. Herein, unprecedented MV BN&#8208;doped corannulene radical cations [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8901;&#8901;2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BArylF4]&#8722; and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8901;&#8901;2+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BArylF4]&#8722; were synthesized via chemical oxidation, and their structures were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These uncommon radical cations consist of three corannulene cores and two [BArylF4]&#8722; anions, and three corannulene motifs [BN&#8208;Cor1]3&#8901;&#8901;2+ and [BN&#8208;Cor2]3&#8901;&#8901;2+ in the unit cell exhibit a trimer structure with a slipped &#960;&#8208;stacking configuration. Detailed structural analyses further revealed that the corannulene cores exhibit an infinite layered self&#8208;assembly configuration, allowing their potential applications as building blocks for molecular conductors.

     alt="Mixed-Valence BN-Doped Corannulene Trimer Radical Cations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure and properties of the radical cations of mixed-valence polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trimers have remained elusive because of their intrinsic instability. This has been overcome by the reaction of BN-doped corannulenes with oxidants. EPR spectroscopic analysis of the resulting compounds demonstrated the existence of two unpaired electrons, and theoretical calculations confirmed the uneven distribution of spin density.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed-valence (MV) dimers have been extensively investigated, however, the structure and properties of purely organic MV trimers based on open-shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons remain elusive. Herein, unprecedented MV BN-doped corannulene radical cations [&lt;b&gt;BN-Cor1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BAryl&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [&lt;b&gt;BN-Cor2&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2[BAryl&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; were synthesized via chemical oxidation, and their structures were unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. These uncommon radical cations consist of three corannulene cores and two [BAryl&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions, and three corannulene motifs [&lt;b&gt;BN-Cor1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [&lt;b&gt;BN-Cor2&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the unit cell exhibit a trimer structure with a slipped &#960;-stacking configuration. Detailed structural analyses further revealed that the corannulene cores exhibit an infinite layered self-assembly configuration, allowing their potential applications as building blocks for molecular conductors. The detection of a forbidden transition (&#916;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;=&#177;2) by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy further confirmed the existence of two unpaired electrons in the &#960;-trimers and the MV characteristic of these two species. Variable-temperature EPR and conductivity measurements suggested that the BN-doped &#960;-trimers exhibited antiferromagnetic coupling and conductivity properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coding Intrinsic Disorder into DNA Hybridization Probes Enables Discrimination of Single Nucleotide Variants over Wide and Tunable Temperature Ranges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Classic hybridization probes for discriminating single nucleotide mutations typically work at elevated temperatures and in very narrow temperature intervals (&#916;T) due to the high entropy penalty. By adding intrinsic disorder into hybridization probes, we successfully expanded &#916;T from less than 10&#8201;&#176;C to over 30&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
DNA hybridization probes are commonly used tools to discriminate clinically important single nucleotide variants (SNVs) but often work at elevated temperatures with very narrow temperature intervals (&#916;T). Herein, we investigated the thermodynamic basis of the narrow &#916;T both in silico and experimentally. Our study revealed that the high entropy penalty of classic hybridization probe designs was the key attributor for the narrow &#916;T. Guided by this finding, we further introduced an entropy&#8208;compensate probe (Sprobe) design by coding intrinsic disorder into a stem&#8208;loop hybridization probe. Sprobe expanded &#916;T from less than 10&#8201;&#176;C to over 30&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, both &#916;T and the optimal reaction temperature can be fine&#8208;tuned by simply altering the length of the loop domain. Sprobe was clinically validated by analyzing EGFR L858R mutation in 36&#8197;pairs of clinical tumor tissue samples collected from lung cancer patients, which revealed 100&#8201;% clinical sensitivity and specificity. We anticipate that our study will serve as a general guide for designing thermal robust hybridization probes for clinical diagnostics.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Imidazole&#8208;Linked Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 49, December 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust imidazole&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework was synthesized via the one&#8208;pot Debus&#8208;Radziszewski multicomponent reaction. The material showed excellent two electron oxygen&#8208;reduction activity and when it was used as cathode catalyst and assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H2O2 up to 326.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The semiconducting properties and applications of three dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are greatly hampered because of their long&#8208;ranged non&#8208;conjugated skeletons and relatively unstable linkages. Here, a robust imidazole&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7) is synthesized through the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Debus&#8208;Radziszewski reaction of the saddle&#8208;shaped aldehyde&#8208;substituted cyclooctatetrathiophene, pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone, and ammonium acetate. The semiconducting BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7, as a metal&#8208;free catalyst, shows excellent two electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium with high hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) selectivity of 83.4&#8201;%. When the BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7 as cathode catalyst is assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H2O2 up to 326.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The accumulative amount of H2O2 could totally degrade the dye methylene blue via Fenton reaction for wastewater treatment. This is the first report about intrinsic 3D COFs for efficient electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, revealing the promising applications of fully conjugated 3D COFs in the environment&#8208;related field.

         <title>Geometrically Compelled Silicon(II)/Silicon(IV) Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interaction Enables the Enamination of Nitriles</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydrido&#8208;benzosiloles bearing a side arm of the silylenyl group are prepared, all featuring the unique silicon(II)&#8594;silicon(IV) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction that facilitates the enamination of &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;bearing nitriles to afford the edge&#8208;fused Si&#8208;heterotricycles.







Abstract
Discovering new bonding scenarios and subsequently exploring the reactivity contribute substantially to advance the main group element chemistry. Herein, we report on the isolation and characterization of an intriguing class of the hydrido&#8208;benzosiloles 2&#8211;4. These compounds exhibit a side arm of the amidinatosilylenyl group, featuring unidirectional silicon(II)/silicon(IV) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction on account of the geometric constraint. Furthermore, the reactions involving 2&#8211;4 with nitriles yield the tricyclic compounds that edge&#8208;fused of the Si&#8208;heteroimidazolidine&#8208;CN2Si2, silole&#8208;C4Si, and phenyl&#8208;C6&#8208;rings (5&#8211;13). These compounds are manifesting a unique reaction that the silicon(II)/silicon(IV) interaction enables the enamination of the &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;bearing nitriles. The reaction mechanism involved in H&#8208;shift under oxidative addition at silylene followed by hydrosilylation of a ketenimine intermediate was revealed by density function theory (DFT) calculations.

Furthermore, the reactions involving &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with nitriles yield the tricyclic compounds that edge-fused of the Si-heteroimidazolidine-CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, silole-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si, and phenyl-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-rings (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;). These compounds are manifesting a unique reaction that the silicon(II)/silicon(IV) interaction enables the enamination of the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-H-bearing nitriles. The reaction mechanism involved in H-shift under oxidative addition at silylene followed by hydrosilylation of a ketenimine intermediate was revealed by density function theory (DFT) calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Small Cobalt Nanoparticles Favor Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction Over Methanation Under CO2 Hydrogenation Conditions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small cobalt nanoparticles readily oxidize under CO2 hydrogenation conditions according to X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, favoring reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction, in contrast to larger particles that remain metallic and catalyze methanation.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;based catalysts are well&#8208;known to convert syngas into a variety of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FTS) products depending on the various reaction parameters, in particular particle size. In contrast, the reactivity of these particles has been much less investigated in the context of CO2 hydrogenation. In that context, Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) was employed to synthesize highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles (Co&#8208;NPs) with particle sizes ranging from 1.6 to 3.0&#8197;nm. These SOMC&#8208;derived Co&#8208;NPs display significantly different catalytic performances under CO2 hydrogenation conditions: while the smallest cobalt nanoparticles (1.6&#8197;nm) catalyze mainly the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (rWGS) reaction, the larger nanoparticles (2.1&#8211;3.0&#8197;nm) favor the expected methanation activity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the smaller cobalt particles are fully oxidized under CO2 hydrogenation conditions, while the larger ones remain mostly metallic, paralleling the observed difference of catalytic performances. This fundamental shift of selectivity, away from methanation to reverse water&#8208;gas shift for the smaller nanoparticles is noteworthy and correlates with the formation of CoO under CO2 hydrogenation conditions.

         <title>Intergranular Shielding for Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Mo&#8208;Doped Ni&#8208;Rich Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Energy Density and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stage engineering strategy, i.e., the construction of strain&#8208;resistant ultrafine&#8208;grains and subsequent intergranular fluorination of the refined grains synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) cathode, effectively alleviating the structural degradation and gas generation, thereby enabling a long battery life.







Abstract
Deploying Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) layered cathodes for high energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) requires resolving a series of technical challenges. Among them, the structural weaknesses of the cathode, vigorous reactivity of the labile Ni4+ ion species, gas evolution and associated cell swelling, and thermal instability issues are critical obstacles that must be solved. Herein, we propose an intuitive strategy that can effectively ameliorate the degradation of an extremely high&#8208;Ni&#8208;layered cathode, the construction of ultrafine&#8208;scale microstructure and subsequent intergranular shielding of grains. The formation of ultrafine grains in the Ni&#8208;enriched Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 (NC96) cathode, achieved by impeding particle coarsening during cathode calcination, noticeably improved the mechanical durability and electrochemical performance of the cathode. However, the buildup of the strain&#8208;resistant microstructure in Mo&#8208;doped NC96 concurrently increased the cathode&#8208;electrolyte contact area at the secondary particle surface, which adversely accelerated parasitic reactions with the electrolyte. The intergranular protection of the refined microstructure resolved the remaining chemical instability of the Mo&#8208;doped NC96 cathode by forming an F&#8208;induced coating layer, effectively alleviating structural degradation and gas generation, thereby extending the battery's lifespan. The proposed strategies synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the NC96 cathode, satisfying the energy density, life cycle performance, and safety requirements for next&#8208;generation LIBs.

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanorods with Five&#8208;Fold Rotational Symmetry and Orientation&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Properties of Their Monomers and Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scattering dissymmetry factor (gs&#8208;factor) peaks of the horizontal chiral Au nanorods are redshifted with higher intensities compared to those of the vertical chiral Au nanorods. The intensity of the chiral response of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side chiral nanorod dimers is reduced because of the coupling between the plasmon resonance modes.







Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have attracted much attention because of their strong chiroptical responses and broad scientific applications. However, the types of chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have remained limited. Herein we report on a new type of chiral nanoparticle, chiral Au nanorod (NR) with five&#8208;fold rotational symmetry, which is synthesized using chiral molecules. Three different types of Au seeds (Au elongated nanodecahedrons, nanodecahedrons, and nanobipyramids) are used to study the growth behaviors. Different synthesis parameters, including the chiral molecules, surfactant, reductant, seeds, and Au precursor, are systematically varied to optimize the chiroptical responses of the chiral Au NRs. The chiral scattering measurements on the individual chiral Au NRs and their dimers are performed. Intriguingly, the chiroptical signals of the individual chiral Au NRs and their end&#8208;to&#8208;end dimers are similar, while those of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side dimers are largely reduced. Theoretical calculations and numerical simulations reveal that the different chiroptical responses of the chiral NR dimers are originated from the coupling effect between the plasmon resonance modes. Our study enriches chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and provides valuable insight for the design of plasmonic nanostructures with desired chiroptical properties.

         <title>Alicyclic&#8208;Amine&#8208;Derived Imine&#8208;BF3 Complexes: Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Make Building Blocks for the Synthesis of Valuable &#945;&#8208;Functionalized Azacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine&#8208;BF3 complexes derived from alicyclic amines represent novel building blocks that are readily prepared in a single synthetic operation. These complexes engage with a wide range of organometallic nucleophiles to afford &#945;&#8208;functionalized azacycles, typically under non&#8208;cryogenic conditions. The in situ preparation of imine&#8208;BF3 complexes provides access to &#945;&#8208;functionalized morpholines and piperazines directly from their parent amines.







Abstract
A new strategy to access &#945;&#8208;functionalized alicyclic amines via their corresponding imine&#8208;BF3 complexes is reported. Isolable imine&#8208;BF3 complexes, readily prepared via dehydrohalogenation of N&#8208;bromoamines in a base&#8208;promoted/18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 catalyzed process followed by addition of boron trifluoride etherate, undergo reactions with a wide range of organometallic nucleophiles to afford &#945;&#8208;functionalized azacycles. Organozinc and organomagnesium nucleophiles add at ambient temperatures, obviating the need for cryogenic conditions. In situ preparation of imine&#8208;BF3 complexes provides access to &#945;&#8208;functionalized morpholines and piperazines directly from their parent amines in a single operation. &#945;&#8208;Functionalized morpholines can be elaborated further, for instance by installing a second substituent in the &#945;&#8242;&#8208;position.

         <title>Recent Advances in Visible Light Induced Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light&#8208;induced Pd catalysis typically operates through the transfer of a single electron. The resulting hybrid Pd radical species can participate in a range of radical&#8208;based transformations otherwise challenging or unknown via conventional 2&#8208;electron processes. This Minireview highlights the recent progress in this emerging area.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced Pd catalysis has emerged as a promising subfield of photocatalysis. The hybrid nature of Pd radical species has enabled a wide array of radical&#8208;based transformations otherwise challenging or unknown via conventional Pd chemistry. In parallel to the ongoing pursuit of alternative, readily available radical precursors, notable discoveries have demonstrated that photoexcitation can alter not only oxidative addition but also other elementary steps. This Minireview highlights the recent progress in this area.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Mixed Metal Sulfamates with Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Properties and Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate, Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O, with the consistent&#8208;orientation&#8208;alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra exhibits an exceptionally large dipole moment, yielding a wide deep&#8208;UV transparent window, an enhanced SHG response of ca. 2.3&#8197;times that of KDP, and a suited birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Enhancing anisotropy through the controlled arrangement of anionic groups is essential for improving the nonlinear optical (NLO) performance of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of the first examples of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate materials, including noncentrosymmetric Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (1), as well as centrosymmetric K2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (2) and Rb2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (3). All three compounds feature promising deep ultraviolet cut&#8208;off edges, notably 1 with a cut&#8208;off edge below 180&#8197;nm. The synergy of Cs+ and Mg2+ cations in 1 facilitated the successful alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra in a uniform orientation. Remarkably, 1 stands as the sole instance among reported sulfamate compounds with a co&#8208;parallel anionic arrangement, yielding a very large dipole moment compared to other non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. Moreover, the substantial dipole moment of 1 yields an enhanced second harmonic generation response, approximately 2.3&#8197;times that of KH2PO4, and a large birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm. The approach of regulating the arrangement of anionic groups using aliovalent cations holds promise for advancing the exploration of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials.

         <title>Spiroluchuene A Synthase: A Cyclase from Aspergillus luchuensis Forming a Spirotetracyclic Diterpene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diterpene synthase for spiroluchuene A exhibiting a novel skeleton was discovered from Aspergillus luchuensis. Enzyme engineering through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis allowed for the isolation of spiroluchuene B and the intermediate spiroluchuene. The enzyme mechanism was deeply studied through isotopic labelling experiments, DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The thermal reactions of luchudiene were studied.







Abstract
The diterpene synthase AlTS was identified from Aspergillus luchuensis. AlTS catalyses the formation of the diterpene hydrocarbon spiroluchuene A, which exhibits a novel skeleton characterised by a spirocyclic ring system. The cyclisation mechanism towards this compound was elucidated through isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The biosynthetic intermediate luchudiene, besides the derivative spiroluchuene B, was captured from an enzyme variant obtained through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. With its 10&#8208;membered ring luchudiene is structurally related to germacrenes and can undergo a Cope rearrangement to luchuelemene.

         <title>Revealing the CO2 Conversion at Electrode/Electrolyte Interfaces in Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries via Nanoscale Visualization Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ atomic force microscopy, laser confocal microscopy&#8208;differential interference contrast microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we explored the electrode/electrolyte interfacial evolution in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. The results indicate that the laser alters the reaction pathways of the CO2 reduction processes, which changes the morphological evolution of the discharge products at the interfaces, and in turn, afftects the cell performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) battery technology presents a promising opportunity for carbon capture and energy storage. Despite tremendous efforts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the complex electrode/electrolyte/CO2 triple&#8208;phase interfacial processes remain poorly understood, in particular at the nanoscale. Here, using in situ atomic force microscopy and laser confocal microscopy&#8208;differential interference contrast microscopy, we directly observed the CO2 conversion processes in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries at the nanoscale, and further revealed a laser&#8208;tuned reaction pathway based on the real&#8208;time observations. During discharge, a bi&#8208;component composite, Li2CO3/C, deposits as micron&#8208;sized clusters through a 3D progressive growth model, followed by a 3D decomposition pathway during the subsequent recharge. When the cell operates under laser (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) irradiation, densely packed Li2CO3/C flakes deposit rapidly during discharge. Upon the recharge, they predominantly decompose at the interfaces of the flake and electrode, detaching themselves from the electrode and causing irreversible capacity degradation. In situ Raman shows that the laser promotes the formation of poorly soluble intermediates, Li2C2O4, which in turn affects growth/decomposition pathways of Li2CO3/C and the cell performance. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into interfacial evolution in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and the laser&#8208;tuned CO2 conversion reactions, which can inspire strategies of monitoring and controlling the multistep and multiphase interfacial reactions in advanced electrochemical devices.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Assisted Blockade of the Immune Suppressor Sialic Acid&#8208;Binding Immunoglobulin&#8208;Like Lectin&#8208;15 for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the discovered aptamer, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted blockade of the immune suppressor Siglec&#8208;15 (sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectin&#8208;15) for cancer immunotherapy. Importantly, the developed aptamer&#8208;based immunotherapy amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model by augmenting of macrophage and T cell functionality.







Abstract
The percentage of low response and adaptive resistance to current antibody&#8208;based immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy requires the development of novel immunotherapy strategies. Here, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted immune checkpoint blockade (Ap&#8208;ICB) against sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectin&#8208;15 (Siglec&#8208;15), a novel immune suppressor broadly upregulated on cancer cells and tumor infiltrating myeloid cells, which is mutually exclusive of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Using protein aptamer selection, we identified WXY3 aptamer with high affinity against Siglec&#8208;15 protein/Siglec&#8208;15 positive cells. We demonstrated that WXY3 aptamer rescued antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the WXY3 Ap&#8208;ICB against Siglec&#8208;15 amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model, which may result from enhanced macrophage and T cell functionality. In addition, by using aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids, we developed a synergetic ICB strategy of multivalent binding and steric hindrance, which further improves the in vivo anti&#8208;tumor effect. Taken together, our results support Ap&#8208;ICB targeted Siglec&#8208;15 as a potential strategy for normalization cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Interfacial Preparation of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Hybrid Supramolecular Polymers by Orthogonal Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient strategy is developed to prepare polyoxometalate&#8208;based hybrid supramolecular polymers (POM&#8208;SPs) by interfacial orthogonal self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the dynamic nature of noncovalent interactions, POM&#8208;SP&#8208;based interfacial assemblies with redox or competitive agent responsiveness can be achieved.







Abstract
The construction of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid supramolecular polymers using polyoxometalate (POM) as building block is expected to bring new opportunities to the functionalization of supramolecular polymers and the development of novel POM&#8208;based soft materials. Here, by using the orthogonal self&#8208;assembly based on host&#8211;guest interactions and metal&#8208;ligand interactions, we report the in situ construction of a novel POM&#8208;based hybrid supramolecular polymer (POM&#8208;SP) at the oil&#8208;water interface, while the redox and competitive responsiveness can be triggered independently. Moreover, the binding energy of POM&#8208;SP at the interface is sufficiently strong so that the assembly of POM&#8208;SP jams, allowing the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, offering the possibility of fabricating all&#8208;liquid constructs with reconfigurability.

         <dc:description>
A bicyclo[1.1.0]diphosphadisilabutane radical anion salt, namely [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+{[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2}&#8901;&#8722; (18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), has been isolated and characterized. This unique species showcases a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. What makes it particularly intriguing is the presence of an extremely rare 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron P&#8722;P &#960; bond, which exists in the absence of a supporting P&#8722;P &#963; bond.







Abstract
Featuring an extra electron in the &#960;* antibonding orbital, species with a 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (2c3e) &#960; bond without an underlying &#963; bond are scarcely known. Herein, we report the synthesis, isolation and characterization of a radical anion salt [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+{[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2}&#8901;&#8722; (i.e. [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+3&#8901;&#8722;) (18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), in which 3&#8901;&#8722; features a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. This species represents the first example of a Si&#8208; and P&#8208;containing analog of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. The unusual bonding motif of 3&#8901;&#8722; was thoroughly investigated via X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and calculations by density functional theory (DFT), which collectively unveiled the existence of a 2c3e &#960; bond between the bridgehead P atoms and no clearly defined supporting P&#8722;P &#963; bond.

         <dc:description>Among the list of planar tetracoordinate atoms, the smallest element hydrogen is missing. No experimental and theoretical evidence have ever been put forwarded. Herein, we introduce the first planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom (ptH) in the global minimum geometry of In4H+ cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is acting like a proton and significant charge transfer from the surrounding In4 framework results in a negative charge of the central hydrogen atom. The proposed global minimum geometry possesses &#963;&#8208;aromaticity and the central hydrogen atom forms unusual multicentre bond with more than three centres.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Metallic NH4+/H+ Co&#8208;Storage in Organic Superstructures for Ultra&#8208;Fast and Long&#8208;Life Zinc&#8722;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with Zn2+ storage, non&#8208;metallic charge carrier with small hydrated size and light weight shows fast dehydration and diffusion kinetics for Zn&#8722;organic batteries. Here we first report NH4+/H+ co&#8208;storage in self&#8208;assembled organic superstructures (OSs) by intermolecular interactions of p&#8208;benzoquinone (BQ) and 2, 6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (DQ) polymer through H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. BQ&#8208;DQ OSs exhibit exposed quadruple&#8208;active carbonyl motifs and super electron delocalization routes, which are redox&#8208;exclusively coupled with high&#8208;kinetics NH4+/H+ but exclude sluggish and rigid Zn2+ ions. A unique 4e&#8722; NH4+/H+co&#8208;coordination mechanism is unravelled, giving BQ&#8208;DQ cathode high capacity (299 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1), large&#8208;current tolerance (100 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong life (50,000 cycles). This strategy further boosts the capacity to 358 mAh g&#8722;1 by modulating redox&#8208;active building units, giving new insights into ultra&#8208;fast and stable NH4+/H+ storage in organic materials for better Zn batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Surface&#8208;Specific Spectroscopy of Water at a Photoexcited TiO2 Model Water&#8208;Splitting Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A critical step in photocatalytic water dissociation is the hole&#8208;mediated oxidation reaction. Molecular&#8208;level insights into the mechanism of this complex reaction under realistic conditions with high temporal resolution are highly desirable. Here, we use femtosecond time&#8208;resolved, surface&#8208;specific vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to study the photo&#8208;induced reaction directly at the interface of the photocatalyst TiO2 in contact with liquid water at room temperature. Thanks to the inherent surface specificity of the spectroscopic method, we can follow the reaction of solely the interfacial water molecules directly at the interface at timescales on which the reaction takes place. Following the generation of holes at the surface immediately after photoexcitation of the catalyst with UV light, water dissociation occurs on a sub&#8208;20 ps timescale. The reaction mechanism is similar at pH 3 and 11. In both cases, we observe the conversion of H2O into Ti&#8208;OH groups and the deprotonation of pre&#8208;existing Ti&#8208;OH groups. This study provides unique experimental insights into the early steps of the photo&#8208;induced dissociation processes at the photocatalyst&#8208;water interface, relevant to the design of improved photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass to Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphiles using a Functionalization&#8208;Defunctionalization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concerns over the sustainability and end&#8208;of&#8208;life properties of fossil&#8208;derived surfactants have driven interest in bio&#8208;based alternatives. Lignocellulosic biomass with its polar functional groups is an obvious feedstock for surfactant production but its use is limited by process complexity and low yield. Here, we present a simple two&#8208;step approach to prepare bio&#8208;based amphiphiles directly from hemicellulose and lignin at high yields (29% w/w based on the total raw biomass and &gt;80% w/w of these two fractions). Acetal functionalization of xylan and lignin with fatty aldehydes during fractionation introduced hydrophobic segments and subsequent defunctionalization by hydrogenolysis of the xylose derivatives or acidic hydrolysis of the lignin derivatives produced amphiphiles. The resulting biodegradable xylose acetals and/or ethers, and lignin&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers both largely retained their original natural structures, but exhibited competitive or superior surface activity in water/oil systems compared to common bio&#8208;based surfactants.</dc:description>

         <title>Grain&#8208;growth Inhibitor with Three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering for Highly Dispersed Single&#8208;crystal NCM90 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystallization of LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2(NCM) is currently an effective strategy to improve the cycling life of NCM cathode, owing to the reduced surface area and enhanced mechanical strength, but the application of single crystal NCM(SC&#8208;NCM) is being hindered by severe particle agglomeration and poor C&#8208;rate performance. Here, a strategy of three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering(TSS) with the presence of grain&#8208;growth inhibitor was proposed, in which, the TSS includes three sections of phase&#8208;formation, grain&#8208;growth and phase&#8208;preservation. While, the addition of MoO3 inhibits the grain growth and restrains the particle agglomeration. With the help of TSS and 1mol% of MoO3, highly dispersed surface Mo&#8208;doped SC&#8208;NCM(MSC&#8208;NCM) cubes are obtained with the average diameter of 1.3 &#956;m. Benefiting from the surface Mo&#8208;doping and the reduced surface energy, the Li+&#8208;migration preferred (1 0 4) crystalline facet is exposed as the dominant plane in MSC&#8208;NCM cubes, because of which, C&#8208;rate performance is significantly improved compared with the regular SC&#8208;NCM. Furthermore, this preparation strategy is compatible well with the current industrial production line, providing an easy way for the large&#8208;scale production of SC&#8208;NCM.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Sieving of Propyne/Propylene by a Scalable Nanoporous Crystal with Confined Rotational Shutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft nanoporous crystal has been developed that can separate propyne/propylene mixtures by sieving. This occurs by the rotational movement of pyridyl rings within this framework creating a pore with a maximum size of 4.4&#8197;&#197;, thereby facilitating the adsorption of propyne while completely excluding propylene.







Abstract
Soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have the remarkable ability to recognize similar molecules as a result of their structural dynamics. However, their guest&#8208;induced gate&#8208;opening behaviors often lead to issues with selectivity and separation efficiency, as co&#8208;adsorption is nearly unavoidable. Herein, we report a strategy of a confined&#8208;rotational shutter, in which the rotation of pyridyl rings within the confined nanospace of a halogen&#8208;bonded coordination framework (NTU&#8208;88) creates a maximum aperture of 4.4&#8197;&#197;, which is very close to the molecular size of propyne (C3H4: 4.4&#8197;&#197;), but smaller than that of propylene (C3H6: 5.4&#8197;&#197;). This has been evidenced by crystallographic analyses and modelling calculations. The NTU&#8208;88o (open phase of activated NTU&#8208;88) demonstrates dedicated C3H4 adsorption, and thereby leads to a sieving separation of C3H4/C3H6 under ambient conditions. The integrated nature of high uptake ratio, considerable capacity, scalable synthesis, and good stability make NTU&#8208;88 a promising candidate for the feasible removal of C3H4 from C3H4/C3H6 mixtures. In principle, this strategy holds high potential for extension to soft families, making it a powerful tool for optimizing materials that can tackle challenging separations with no co&#8208;adsorption, while retaining the crucial aspect of high capacity.

         <title>Dearomative Insertion of Fluoroalkyl Carbenes into Azoles Leading to Fluoroalkyl Heterocycles with a Quaternary Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general skeletal ring expansion strategy was developed for the direct conversion of azoles into various heterocyclic frameworks containing fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted quaternary centers through dearomative one&#8208;carbon insertion using fluoroalkyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones. The method is scalable, tolerates diverse functional groups, and is amenable to the synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
The skeletal ring expansion of heteroarenes through carbene insertion is gaining popularity in synthetic chemistry. Efficient strategies for heterocyclic ring expansion to access heterocycles containing a fluoroalkyl quaternary carbon center through fluoroalkyl carbene insertion are highly desirable because of their broad applications in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a general strategy for the dearomative one&#8208;carbon insertion of azoles using fluoroalkyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as fluoroalkyl carbene precursors, resulting in ring&#8208;expanded heterocycles in excellent yields with good functional&#8208;group compatibility. The broad generality of this methodology in the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutically interesting bioactive molecules and versatile transformations of the products has been demonstrated.

         <title>Acquiring Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Featured Single&#8208;Molecule Ultralong Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence via Through&#8208;Space Electronic Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy for high energy level and long&#8208;lived triplet charge transfer (3CT)&#8208;featured single&#8208;molecule phosphorescence materials was proposed. Through this strategy, a robust phosphor, NIC&#8208;DMAC, was constructed with a long lifetime (&#964;3CT) exceeding 210&#8197;ms and a 3CT energy level (E3CT) as high as 2.50&#8197;eV. Thanks to its long&#8208;lived 3CT state and high E3CT, NIC&#8208;DMAC was successfully applied in photolithography as a photoinitiator and achieved double patterning.







Abstract
Although long&#8208;lived triplet charge&#8208;transfer (3CT) state with high energy level has gained significant attention, the development of organic small molecules capable of achieving such states remains a major challenge. Herein, by using the through&#8208;space electronic coupling effect, we have developed a compound, namely NIC&#8208;DMAC, which has a long&#8208;lived 3CT state at the single&#8208;molecule level with a lifetime of 210&#8197;ms and a high energy level of up to 2.50&#8197;eV. Through a combination of experimental and computational approaches, we have elucidated the photophysical processes of NIC&#8208;DMAC, which involve sequential transitions from the first singlet excited state (S1) that shows a 1CT character to the first triplet excited state (T1) that exhibits a local excited state feature (3LE), and then to the second triplet excited state (T2) that shows a 3CT character (i.e., S1 (1CT)&#8594;T1 (3LE)&#8594;T2 (3CT)). The long lifetime and high energy level of its 3CT state have enabled NIC&#8208;DMAC as an initiator for photocuring in double patterning applications.

         <title>Sculpting Mesoscopic Helical Chirality into Covalent Organic Framework Nanotubes from Entirely Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diversification of chirality in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) holds immense promise for expanding their properties and functionality. Herein, we introduce an innovative approach for imparting helical chirality to COFs and fabricating a family of chiral COF nanotubes with mesoscopic helicity from entirely achiral building blocks for the first time. We present an effective 2,3&#8208;diaminopyridine&#8208;mediated supramolecular templating method, which facilitates the prefabrication of helical imine&#8208;linked polymer nanotubes using unprecedented achiral symmetric monomers. Through meticulous optimization of crystallization conditions, these helical polymer nanotubes are adeptly converted into imine&#8208;linked COF nanotubes boasting impressive surface areas, while well preserving their helical morphology and chiroptical properties. Furthermore, these helical imine&#8208;linked polymers or COFs could be subtly transformed into corresponding more stable and functional helical &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked and hydrazone&#8208;linked COF nanotubes with transferred circular dichroism via monomer exchange. Notably, despite the involvement of covalent bonding breakage and reorganization, these exchange processes overcome thermodynamic disadvantages, allowing mesoscopic helical chirality to be perfectly preserved. This research highlights the potential of mesoscopic helicity in conferring COFs with favourable chiral properties, providing novel insights into the development of multifunctional COFs in the field of chiral materials chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Substrate Specificity and Mechanistic Variability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogenation finds widespread application in academia and industry. And indeed, a number of processes have been implemented for the production of pharma and agro intermediates as well as flavors &amp; fragrances. Although these processes are all based on the use of late transition metals as catalysts, there is an increasing interest in the use of base metal catalysis in view of their lower cost and the expected different substrate scope. Catalysts based on cobalt have already shown their potential in enantioselective hydrogenation chemistry. This review outlines the impressive progress made in recent years on cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of different unsaturated substrates. We also illustrate the ligand dependent substrate specificity as well as the mechanistic variability in detail. This may well guide further catalyst development in this research area.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Protein Crosstalk with a Molecule that Exchanges Binding Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drawing inspiration from allosteric signaling enzymes, whose catalytic and regulatory units are non&#8208;covalently linked, we have devised a method to establish unnatural, effector&#8208;mediated enzyme activation within native cells. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by introducing a synthetic regulatory unit (sRU) onto glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK&#8208;3) through non&#8208;covalent means. Our study reveals that this synthetic regulator mediates an unnatural crosstalk between GSK&#8208;3 and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), whose expression is regulated by cellular oxygen levels. Specifically, with this approach, the constitutively active GSK&#8208;3 is transformed into an activable enzyme, whereas LDHA is repurposed as an unnatural effector protein that controls the activity of the kinase, making it unnaturally dependent on the cell's hypoxic response. These findings demonstrate a step toward imitating the function of effector&#8208;regulated cell&#8208;signaling enzymes, which play a key biological role in mediating the response of cells to changes in their environment. In addition, at the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle level, our results indicate the potential to develop a new class of protein inhibitors whose inhibitory effect in cells is dictated by the cell's environment and consequent protein expression profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Corner Engineering: Tailoring Enzymes for Enhanced Resistance and Thermostability in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), heralded for their synthesis simplicity, economic viability, and reduced volatility and flammability, have found increasing application in biocatalysis. However, challenges persist due to a frequent diminution in enzyme activity and stability. Herein, we developed a general protein engineering strategy, termed corner engineering, to acquire DES&#8208;resistant and thermostable enzymes via precisely tailoring of the transition region in enzyme structure. Employing Bacillus subtilis lipase A (BSLA) as a model, we delineated the engineering process, yielding five multi&#8208;DESs resistant variants with highly improved thermostability, such as K889E/N89K exhibited up to a 10.0&#8208;fold catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) increase in 30% (v/v) ChCl:acetamide and 4.1&#8208;fold in 95% (v/v) ChCl:ethylene glycol accompanying 6.7&#8208;fold thermal resistance improvement than wild type at ~50 &#176;C. The generality of the optimized approach was validated by two extra industrial enzymes, endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,4&#8208;glucanase PvCel5A (used for biofuel production) and esterase Bs2Est (plastics degradation). The molecular investigations revealed that increased water molecules at substrate binding sites and finetuned helix formation at the corner region are two dominant determinants governing elevated resistance and thermostability. This study, coupling corner engineering with obtained molecular insights, illuminates enzyme&#8208;DES interaction patterns and fosters the rational design of more DES&#8208;resistant and thermostable enzymes in biocatalysis and biotransformation.</dc:description>

The generality of the optimized approach was validated by two extra industrial enzymes, endo-&#946;-1,4-glucanase PvCel5A (used for biofuel production) and esterase Bs2Est (plastics degradation). The molecular investigations revealed that increased water molecules at substrate binding sites and finetuned helix formation at the corner region are two dominant determinants governing elevated resistance and thermostability. This study, coupling corner engineering with obtained molecular insights, illuminates enzyme-DES interaction patterns and fosters the rational design of more DES-resistant and thermostable enzymes in biocatalysis and biotransformation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeting Biomimetic Semiconducting Polymer Nanocomposites for Amplified Theranostics of Bone Metastasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bone metastasis is a type of metastatic tumors that involves the spreads of malignant tumor cells into skeleton, and its diagnosis and treatment remain a big challenge due to the unique tumor microenvironment. We herein develop osteoclast and tumor cell dual&#8208;targeting biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanocomposites (SPFeNOC) for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis. SPFeNOC contain semiconducting polymer and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles inside core and surface camouflaged hybrid membrane of cancer cells and osteoclasts. The hybrid membrane camouflage enables their targeting to both metastatic tumor cells and osteoclasts in bone metastasis through homologous targeting mechanism, thus achieving an enhanced nanoparticle accumulation in tumors. The semiconducting polymer mediates near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and Fe3O4 nanoparticles are used for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Because both cancer cells and osteoclasts are killed synchronously via the combinational action of SDT and CDT, the vicious cycle in bone metastasis is broken to realize high antitumor efficacy. Therefore, 4T1 breast cancer&#8208;based bone metastasis can be effectively detected and cured by using SPFeNOC as dual&#8208;targeting theranostic nanoagents. This study provides an unusual biomimetic nanoplatform that simultaneously targets osteoclasts and cancer cells for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis.</dc:description>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color&#8208;Tunable Organic Scintillators for X&#8208;Ray Imaging Through Host&#8211;Guest Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing demands of X&#8208;ray detection and medical diagnosis, organic scintillators with intense and tunable X&#8208;ray excited emission have been becoming important. To guarantee the X&#8208;ray absorption, heavy atoms were widely added in reported organic scintillators, which led to emission quenching. In this work, we propose a new strategy to realize organic scintillators&#160;through the host&#8208;guest doping strategy. Then the X&#8208;ray absorption centers (host) and emission centers (guest) are separated. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, these materials displayed intense and readily tunable emissions ranging from green (520 nm) to near infrared (NIR) regions (682&#8201;nm). Besides, the relationship between the X&#8208;ray absorption and spatial arrangement of the heavy atoms in the host matrix was also revealed. The potential application of these wide&#8208;range color tunable organic host&#8208;guest scintillators in X&#8208;ray imaging were demonstrated. This work provides a new feasible strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance organic scintillators with tunable luminescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Chiral &#946;&#8208;Double Helices from &#947;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is ubiquitous in nature, and homochirality is manifested in many biomolecules. Although &#946;&#8208;double helices are rare in peptides and proteins, they consist of alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids. No peptide double helices with homochiral amino acids have been observed. Here, we report chiral &#946;&#8208;double helices constructed from &#947;&#8208;peptides consisting of alternating achiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 4,4&#8208;dimethyl &#947;&#8208;amino acids and chiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids in both single crystals and in solution. The two independent strands of the same peptide intertwine to form a &#946;&#8208;double helix structure, and it is stabilized by inter&#8208;strand hydrogen bonds. The peptides with chiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids derived from &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;amino acids adopt a (P)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helix, whereas peptides consisting of (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids derived from &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;amino acids adopt an (M)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helix conformation. The circular dichroism (CD) signature of (P) and (M)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helices and the stability of these peptides at higher temperatures were examined. Furthermore, ion transport studies suggested that these peptides transport ions across membranes. Even though the structural analogy suggests that these new &#946;&#8208;double helices are structurally different from those of the &#945;&#8208;peptide &#946;&#8208;double helices, they retain ion transport activity. The results reported here may open new avenues in the design of functional foldamers.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonium Cation in the Service of &#960;&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While still rare, cationic ligands offer much promise as tunable electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands for &#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. Recently, we introduced pincer&#8208;type sulfonium cations into the list of available strongly &#960;&#8208;acidic ancillary ligands. However, the M&#8208;S bond in sulfonium complexes of these ligands was found highly labile, precluding their catalytic applications. Herein we demonstrate that this obstacle can be overcome by increasing the rigidity of the sulfonium pincer scaffold. X&#8208;ray analyses confirm that despite bearing a formal positive charge, the sulfur atom of this newly designed sulfonium ligand maintains its coordination to the Pt(II)&#8208;center, while DFT calculations indicate that by doing so it strongly enhances the electrophilic character of the metal. Kinetic studies carried out on three model cycloisomerization reactions prove that such a&#160;tris&#8208;cationic sulfonium&#8208;Pt(II) complex is highly reactive, compared to its thioether&#8208;based analogue. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study presents the first example of employing sulfonium&#8208;based ligands in homogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Shearing Liquid&#8208;Crystalline MXene into Lamellar Membranes with Super&#8208;Aligned Nanochannels for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;selective membranes are crucial in various chemical and physiological processes. Numerous studies have demonstrated progress in separating monovalent/multivalent ions, but efficient monovalent/monovalent ion sieving remains a great challenge due to their same valence and similar radii. Here, this work reports a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super&#8208;aligned slit&#8208;shaped nanochannels with ultrahigh monovalent ion selectivity. The MXene membrane is prepared by applying shear forces to a liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) MXene dispersion, which is conducive to the highly&#8208;ordered stacking of the MXene nanosheets. The obtained LC MXene membrane (LCMM) exhibits ultrahigh selectivities toward Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Rb+ separation (~45, ~49, and ~59), combined with a fast Li+ transport with a permeation rate of ~0.35 mol m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Theoretical calculations indicate that in MXene nanochannels, the hydrated Li+ with a tetrahedral shape has the smallest diameter among the monovalent ions, contributing to the highest mobility. Besides, the weakest interaction is found between hydrated Li+ and MXene channels which also contributes to the ultrafast permeation of Li+ through the super&#8208;aligned MXene channels. This work demonstrates the capability of MXene membranes in monovalent ion separation, which also provides a facile and general strategy to fabricate lamellar membranes in a large scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2: A New Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material Derived from KBe2BO3F2 with High Performance and Excellent Water&#8208;Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acquiring high&#8208;performance ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that simultaneously exhibit a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients, as short as possible SHG phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength and non&#8208;hygroscopic properties has consistently posed a significant challenge. Herein, through multicomponent modification of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), an excellent UV NLO crystal, Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2, was successfully synthesized in malonic system. This material possesses a unique 2D NLO&#8208;favorable electroneutral [Mg(C3O4H2)3(H2O)2]&#8734; layer, resulting in the rare coexistence of a strong SHG response of 3&#215;KDP (@1064 nm) and short PM wavelength of 200 nm. More importantly, it exhibits exceptional water resistance, which is rare among ionic organic NLO crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that its excellent water&#8208;resistant may be originated from its small available cavity volumes, which is similar to the famous LiB3O5 (LBO). Therefore, excellent NLO properties and stability against air and moisture indicate it should be a promising UV NLO crystal.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acquiring high-performance ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that simultaneously exhibit a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients, as short as possible SHG phase-matching (PM) wavelength and non-hygroscopic properties has consistently posed a significant challenge. Herein, through multicomponent modification of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), an excellent UV NLO crystal, Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2, was successfully synthesized in malonic system.

         <title>Extending Ring&#8208;Chain Coupling Empirical Law to Lithium&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With its efficient nitrogen fixation kinetics, electrochemical lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (LMNRR) holds promise for replacing Haber&#8208;Bosch process and realizing sustainable and green ammonia production. However, the general interface problem in lithium electrochemistry seriously impedes the further enhancement of LMNRR performance. Inspired by the development history of lithium battery electrolytes, here, we extend the ring&#8208;chain solvents coupling law to LMNRR system to rationally optimize the interface during the reaction process, achieving nearly a two&#8208;fold Faradaic efficiency up to 54.78&#177;1.60%. Systematic theoretical simulations and experimental analysis jointly decipher that the anion&#8208;rich Li+ solvation structure derived from ring tetrahydrofuran coupling with chain ether successfully suppresses the excessive passivation of electrolyte decomposition at the reaction interface, thus promoting the mass transfer of active species and enhancing the nitrogen fixation kinetics. This work offers a progressive insight into the electrolyte design of LMNRR system.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Role of Trapezoids in Honeycomb Self&#8208;Assembly &#8211; Pathways between a Columnar Liquid Quasicrystal and its Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Approximants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasiperiodic patterns and crystals &#8208; having long range order without translational symmetry &#8208; fascinate researchers since their discovery. In this study, we report on new p&#8208;terphenyl based T&#8208;shaped facial polyphiles with two alkyl end&#8208;chains and a glycerol&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded side&#8208;group, self&#8208;assembling into an aperiodic columnar liquid quasicrystal with 12&#8208;fold symmetry and its periodic liquid&#8208;crystalline approximants with complex superstructures. All represent honeycombs formed by self&#8208;assembly of the p&#8208;terphenyls, dividing space into prismatic cells with polygonal cross&#8208;sections. In the perspective of tiling patterns, the presence of unique trapezoidal tiles, consisting of three rigid sides formed by the p&#8208;terphenyls and one shorter, incommensurate, and adjustable side by the alkyl end&#8208;chains, plays a crucial role for these phases. A delicate temperature&#8208;dependent balance between conformational, entropic and space filling effects determines the role of the alkyl chains, either as network nodes or trapezoid walls, thus resulting in the order&#8208;disorder transitions associated with emergence of quasiperiodicity. In&#8208;depth analysis suggests a change from a quasiperiodic tiling involving trapezoids to a modified one with a contribution of trapezoid pair fusion. This work paves the way for understanding quasiperiodicity emergence and develops fundamental concepts for its generation by chemical design of non&#8208;spherical molecules, aggregates and frameworks based on reticular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Preserving Structurally Labile Peptide Nanosheets After Molecular Functionalization of the Self&#8208;Assembling Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A significant challenge in creating supramolecular materials is that conjugating molecular functionalities to building blocks often results in dissociation or undesired morphological transformation of their assemblies. Here we present a facile strategy to preserve structurally labile peptide assemblies after molecular modification of the self&#8208;assembling peptides. Sheet&#8208;forming peptides are designed to afford a staggered alignment with the segments bearing chemical modification sites protruding from the sheet surfaces. The staggered assembly allows for simultaneous separation of attached molecules from each other and from the underlying assembly motifs. Strikingly, using PEGs as the external molecules, PEG400&#8208; and PEG700&#8208;peptide conjugates directly self&#8208;associate into nanosheets with the PEG chains localized on the sheet surfaces. In contrast, the sheet formation based on in&#8208;register lateral packing of peptides does not recur upon the peptide PEGylation. This strategy allows for fabrication of densely modified assemblies with a variety of molecules, as demonstrated using biotin (hydrophobic molecule), c(RGDfK) (cyclic pentapeptide), and nucleic acid aptamer (negatively charged ssDNA). The staggered co&#8208;assembly also enables extended tunability of the amount/density of surface molecules, as exemplified by screening ligand&#8208;appended assemblies for cell targeting. This study paves the way for functionalization of historically challenging fragile assemblies while maintaining their overall morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Reversible Complexation Mediated Polymerization (RCMP) from Benzylic Alcohols for Facile Access to Polymer&#8208;Grafted Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot synthesis of methacrylic and acrylic polymers from benzylic alcohols (R&#8722;OH) used as initiating moieties was developed. R&#8722;OH was converted to alkyl iodide (R&#8722;I), and the generated R&#8722;I was used as an initiator without purification or isolation in the subsequent reversible complexation mediated polymerization (RCMP), leading to one&#8208;pot RCMP from R&#8722;OH. As a useful application, this technique was exploited for one&#8208;pot polymer&#8208;grafting from lignin that is the second most abundant renewable carbon&#8208;source on earth and bears benzylic alcohols. The direct initiation from lignin eliminates tedious initiator attachment and purification, offering a facile access to polymer&#8208;grafted lignin. The obtained polymer&#8208;grafted lignin was utilized to form an efficient UV&#8208;absorbing film with high transparency in visible region. One&#8208;pot RCMP may serve as a practical method to obtain value&#8208;added functional lignin&#8208;polymer composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanographene with a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Cavity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;doped cavities are pervasive in graphenic materials, and represent key sites for catalytic and electrochemical activity. However, their structures are generally heterogeneous. In this study, we present the synthesis of a well&#8208;defined molecular cutout of graphene featuring N&#8208;doped cavity. The graphitization of a macrocyclic pyridinic precursor was achieved through photochemical cyclodehydrochlorination. In comparison to its counterpart with pyridinic nitrogen at the edges, the pyridinic nitrogen atoms in this nanographene cavity exhibit significantly reduced basicity&#160;and selective binding to Ag+ ion. Analysis of the protonation and coordination equilibria revealed that the tri&#8208;N&#8208;doped cavity binds three protons, but only one Ag+ ion. These distinct protonation and coordination behaviors clearly illustrate the space confinement effect imparted by the cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Defect Engineering Synergistically Boost High Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Chemical Conversion Efficiency of Cerium oxide/Au Hollow Nanomushrooms for Nitrogen Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation using solar illumination under ambient conditions is a promising strategy for production of the indispensable chemical NH3.    However, due to the catalyst's limitations in solar energy utilization, loss of hot electrons during transfer, and low nitrogen adsorption and activation capacity, the unsatisfactory solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiencies of most photocatalysts limit their practical applications.   Herein, cerium oxide nanosheets with abundant strain&#8208;VO defects were anchored on Au hollow nanomushroom through atomically sharp interfaces to construct a novel semiconductor/plasmonic metal hollow nanomushroom&#8208;like heterostructure (denoted cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au). Plasmonic Au extended the absorption of light from the visible to the second near&#8208;infrared region. The superior interface greatly enhanced the transfer efficiency of hot electrons. Abundant strain&#8208;VO defects induced by interfacial compressive strain promoted adsorption and in situ activation of nitrogen, and such synergistic promotion of strain and VO defects was further confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The judicious structural and defect engineering co&#8208;promoted the efficient nitrogen photofixation of the cerium oxide&#8208;AD/Au heterostructures with a SCC efficiency of 0.1% under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination, which is comparable to the average solar&#8208;to&#8208;biomass conversion efficiency of natural photosynthesis by typical plants, thus exhibiting significant potential as a new candidate for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Luminescent Chiral Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Clusters via Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the ubiquity of chirality in nature, chiral self&#8208;assembly involving self&#8208;sorting behaviors has remained as one of the most important research topics of interests. Herein, starting from a racemic mixture of SEG&#8208;based (SEG = SEGPHOS) chlorogold(I) precursors, a unique chiral butterfly&#8208;shape hexadecanuclear gold(I) cluster (Au16) with different ratios of RSEG and SSEG ligands is obtained via homoleptic and heterochiral self&#8208;sorting. More interestingly, by employing different chlorogold(I) precursors of opposite chirality (such as RSEG&#8208;Au2 and SBIN&#8208;Au2), an unprecedented heteroleptic and heterochiral self&#8208;sorting strategy has been developed to give a series of heteroleptic chiral decanuclear gold(I) clusters (Au10) with propellor&#8208;shape structures. Heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting have also been observed between enantiomers of homoleptic chiral Au10 clusters to result in the heteroleptic chiral Au10 clusters via cluster&#8208;to&#8208;cluster transformation. Incorporation of heteroleptic ligands is found to decrease the symmetry from S4 of homoleptic meso Au10 to C2 of heteroleptic chiral Au10 clusters. The chirality has been transferred from the axial chiral ligands and stored in the heteroleptic gold(I) clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Strategy Towards Symmetry Breaking of Boron&#8208;centered Tetrahedron for Poly&#8208;fluorinated Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borate crystals can be chemically and functionally modified by fluorination strategy, which encourages the identification of emerging fluorooxoborates with a structure and set of characteristics not seen in any other oxide parents. However, the bulk of fluorooxoborates have been found accidentally, rational methods of synthesis are required, particularly for the infrequently occurring poly&#8208;fluorinated components. Herein, we reported the use of bifluoride salts as a potent source of fluorine to prepare fluorooxoborates that contain rarely tri&#8208;fluorinated [BF3X] (X = O and CH3) tetrahedra and eleven compounds were found. We identified the optical properties of the organofluorinated group [CH3BF3] and their potential for nonlinear optics for the first time. Among these, two non&#8208;centrosymmetric components hold potential for the production of 266 nm harmonic coherent light for nonlinear optics, and more crucially, have the benefit of growing large size single crystals. Our study establishes experimental conditions for the coexistence of the diverse functional groups, enabling the production of poly&#8208;fluorinated optical crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Bridged Benzazepines via Photo&#8208;Induced Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bridged benzazepine scaffolds, possessing unique structural and physicochemical activities, are widespread in various natural products and drugs. The construction of these skeletons often requires elaborate synthetic effort with low efficiency. Herein, we develop a simple and divergent approach for constructing various bridged benzazepines by a photocatalytic intermolecular dearomatization of naphthalene derivatives with readily available &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The bridged motif is created via a cascade sequence involving photocatalytic 1,4&#8208;hydroaminoalkylation, alkene isomerization and cyclization. Interestingly, the diastereoselectivity can be regulated through different reaction modes in the cyclization step. Moreover, aminohydroxylation and its further bromination have also been demonstrated to access highly functionalized bridged benzazepines. Preliminary mechanistic studies have been performed to get insights into the mechanism. This method provides a divergent synthetic approach for construction of highly functionalized bridged benzazepines, which have been otherwise difficult to access.</dc:description>

         <title>New Reaction Pathway of Superoxide Disproportionation Induced by a Soluble Catalyst in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery has attracted considerable interest for high theoretical energy density, however the disproportionation of the intermediate of superoxide (O2&#8208;) during discharge and charge leads to slow reaction kinetics and large voltage hysteresis. Herein, the chemically stable ruthenium tris(bipyridine) (RB) cations are employed as a soluble catalyst to alternate the pathway of O2&#8208; disproportionation and its kinetics in both the discharge and charge processes. RB captures O2&#8208; dimer and promotes their intramolecular charge transfer, and it decreases the energy barrier of the disproportionation reaction from 7.70 to 0.70 kcal mol&#8208;1. This facilitates the discharge and charge processes and simultaneously mitigates O2&#8208; and singlet oxygen related side reactions. These endow the Li&#8208;O2 battery with reduced discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.72 V and prolonged lifespan for over 230 cycles when coupled with RuO2 catalyst. This work highlights the vital role of superoxide disproportionation for Li&#8208;O2 battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Hot or Not? &#8211; Reassessing Mechanisms of Photocurrent Generation in Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is now widely accepted that certain effects arising from localised surface plasmon resonance, such as enhanced electromagnetic fields, hot carriers, and thermal effects, can facilitate electrocatalytic processes. This newly emerging field of research is commonly referred to as plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC) and is attracting increasing interest from the research community, particularly regarding harnessing the high energy of hot carriers. However, this has led to a lack of critical analysis in the literature, where the participation of hot carriers is routinely claimed due to their perceived desirability, while the contribution of other effects is often not sufficiently investigated. As a result, correctly differentiating between the possible mechanisms at play has become a key point of contention. In this review, we specifically focus on the mechanisms behind photocurrents observed in PEEC and critically evaluate the possibility of alternative sources of current enhancement in the reported PEEC systems. Furthermore, we present guidelines for the best experimental practices and methods to distinguish between the various enhancement mechanisms in PEEC.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanomaterials, specifically carbon dots and carbon nitrides, play a crucial role as heterogeneous photoinitiators in both radical and cationic polymerization processes. These recently introduced materials offer promising solutions to the limitations of current homogeneous systems, presenting a novel approach to photopolymerization. This review highlights the preparation and photocatalytic performance of these nanomaterials, emphasizing their application in various polymerization techniques, including photoinduced i) free radical, ii) RAFT, iii) ATRP, and iv) cationic photopolymerization. Additionally, it discusses their potential in addressing contemporary challenges and explores prospects in this field. Moreover, carbon nitrides, in particular, exhibit exceptional oxygen tolerance, underscoring their significance in radical polymerization processes and allowing their applications such as 3D printing, surface modification of coatings, and hydrogel engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual Anion Chemistry&#8208;Based Superionic Glass Enabling Long&#8208;Cycling All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glassy Na&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state electrolytes (GNSSEs) are an important group of amorphous SSEs. However, the insufficient ionic conductivity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GNSSEs at room temperature lessens their promise in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries (ASSNIBs) with high energy density and improved safety. Here we report the discovery of a new sodium superionic glass, 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5 (NTOC), based on dual&#8208;anion sublattice of oxychlorides. The unique local structures with abundant bridging and non&#8208;bridging oxygen atoms contribute&#160;to a highly disordered Na&#8208;ion distribution as well as low Na+ migration barrier within NTOC, enabling an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 4.62 mS cm&#8208;1 at 25&#8451; (more than 20 times higher than those of previously reported GNSSEs). Moreover, the excellent formability of glassy NTOC electrolyte and its high electrochemical oxidative stability ensure a favourable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, contributing to superior cycling stability of ASSNIBs for over 500 cycles at room temperature. The discovery of glassy NTOC electrolyte would reignite research enthusiasm in superionic glassy SSEs based on multi&#8208;anion chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Peptide and Protein Bromination: The BromoTrp Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions for modification of proteins and unprotected peptides are of high value in chemical biology. The combination of enzymatic halogenation with transition metal catalysed cross&#8208;coupling provides a feasible approach for modification of proteins and unprotected peptides. Using a semi&#8208;rational protein engineering approach, variants of the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal were identified that enable efficient bromination of peptides with a C&#8208;terminal tryptophan residue. The substrate scope was explored using di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrapeptide arrays leading to the identification of an optimized peptide tag we named BromoTrp tag. This tag was introduced into three model proteins. Preparative scale post&#8208;translational bromination was possible with only a single cultivation and purification step using the brominating E. coli coexpression systemBrocoli. Pd&#8208;catalysed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the bromoarene was achieved using Pd nanoparticle catalysts at 37&#160;&#176;C, highlighting the rich potential of this strategy for bioorthogonal functionalization and conjugation.</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Dynamics and Modular Peripheral Binding in Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 3:2 Host:Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Now that the chemistry of 1:1 host:guest complexes is well&#8208;established, it is surprising to note that higher stoichiometry (oligomeric) complexes, especially those with excess host, remain largely unexplored. Yet, proteins tend to oligomerize, affording new functions for cell machinery. Here, we show that cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) macrocycles combined with symmetric, linear di&#8208;viologens form unusual 3:2 host:guest complexes exhibiting remarkable dynamic properties, host self&#8208;sorting, and external ring&#8208;translocation. These results highlight the structural tunability of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) based 3:2 host:guest complexes in water and their responsiveness toward several stimuli (chemicals, pH, redox).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This report describes the development of a Zn(OTf)2&#8208;mediated method for converting&#160;&#945;&#8208;tertiary haloamides to the corresponding&#160;18F&#8208;labelled&#160;&#945;&#8208;tertiary fluoroamides&#160;with no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added&#160;[18F]tetramethylammonium fluoride. 1,5,7&#8208;Triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene&#160;is an essential additive for achieving high radiochemical conversion.&#160;Under the optimised conditions, radiofluorination proceeds at sterically hindered tertiary sites in high radiochemical conversions, yield, and purities. This method has been successfully automated and applied to access&#160;&gt;200 mCi (&gt;7.4 GBq) of several model radiofluorides.&#160;Mechanistic studies led to the development of a new, nucleophilic C&#8208;H radiofluorination process using&#160;N&#8208;sulfonyloxyamide substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free B&#8208;B Dehydrocoupling Reaction of a Simple Borane Adduct: Convenient Access to a Nucleophilic Diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective formation of homonuclear bonds is of key importance in synthetic chemistry. Especially, dehydrocoupling reactions are attractive as ecologically and economically friendly alternatives to established reductive bond forming reactions, since they do not require the use of stoichiometric amounts of a reducing reagent and produce only valuable dihydrogen as by&#8208;product. Here, we report on a metal&#8208;free B&#8208;B dehydrocoupling reaction that starts directly from a simple, easily accessible BH3 adduct, providing convenient access to a new nucleophilic dihydrodiborane in excellent yield. The dihydrodiborane in turn activates dihydrogen, allowing to obtain quantitatively the dideuteridodiborane from the dihydridodiborane by D2 activation. On the basis of detailed quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the mechanism of this unprecedented reaction is elucidated. Some key points that are essential for metal&#8208;free dehydrocoupling are disclosed, paving the way for their systematic evaluation and application.</dc:description>
