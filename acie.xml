         <title>Isotope Techniques in Chemical Wastewater Treatment: Opportunities and Uncertainties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive and in&#8208;depth analysis of reaction mechanisms is essential for advancing chemical water treatment technologies. However, due to the limitations of conventional experimental and analytical methods, the types of reactive species and their generation pathways are commonly debatable in many aqueous systems. As a highly sensitive diagnostic tool, applications of isotopes as tracers and reactive probes offers deeper insights than conventional methods with minimal interference from reaction conditions. Nevertheless, precise interpretations of isotope results remain a significant challenge. Herein, we first scrutinized the fundamentals of isotope chemistry and highlighted key changes induced by the isotope substitution. Next, we discussed the application of isotope techniques in kinetic isotope effects (KIE), presenting a roadmap for interpreting KIE in sophisticated aqueous redox systems. Furthermore, we summarized the applications of isotope techniques in qualitative and quantitative elemental tracing to pinpoint reaction sites and identify dominant reactive species in chemical treatment processes. Lastly, we propose future research directions, highlighting critical considerations for the rational design and interpretation of isotope experiments in environmental chemistry and related fields.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Ensembled Aptamers Enhance Fluid Stability in Circulating Tumor Cells Capture for Tumor Treatment Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recognition and binding via receptor&#8722;ligand interactions on cell membrane often weaken in complex environment, such as whole blood samples from cancer patients, making disease diagnosis and treatment evaluation unfavourable. Constructing multivalent ligands with sufficient fluid stability to improve affinity in complex environment remains a challenge. Herein, we develop a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) ensembled multivalent aptamer (TEAn, n=1&#8208;3) with programmable ligands size, enabling efficient capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and accurate monitoring of clinical treatment progress. The precisely structured TEAn ensures the size&#8208;matching and cooperative hybridization with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on cell membrane. Compared to traditional aptamer approach, the dissociation constants (Kd) of TEA3 exhibits ~20&#8208;fold growth in serum due to its precise size and rigid DNA framework. This high&#8208;affinity interaction significantly enhances capture efficiency by improving fluid stability of TEAn and magnetic beads complex in complex environment. In addition, this CTC detection strategy is applied for clinical tumor treatment evaluation and progress monitoring in liver cancer patient samples, achieving an accuracy of ~83.3% in classifying patients as complete or partial responses (CR/PR). Overall, this strategy will strongly promote potential clinical application of DNA framework for advancing cancer diagnosis and monitoring disease progression.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise PBAEs: A Highly Efficient Single&#8208;Molecularly Defined&#160;Gene&#8208;Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gene&#8208;delivery polymers have wide therapeutic applications. The structures (e.g., molecular weight, polymer sequence, end groups, and topology) of gene&#8208;delivery polymers are of crucial importance to their properties including transfection efficiency, toxicity, and targeting capability. Thus, precise control over the structures of gene&#8208;delivery polymers is extremely beneficial for property optimizations and manufacturing reproducibility. However, sequence&#8208;defined gene&#8208;delivery polymers with high efficiency and low toxicity are rare, limited by synthetic strategies. In this work, we developed a method that enables poly(beta&#8208;amino esters), one of the most promising gene&#8208;delivery polymers, to be synthesized with precisely controlled and vastly variable molecular weight, end group, and topology. This synthetic strategy creates a new family of gene&#8208;delivery polymers with defined structures, offering significant potentials and revealing new design principles.</dc:description>

         <title>A General and Mild Two&#8208;Step Strategy Using Bioderived Diols and CO2 for Chemically Recyclable Polycarbonates and Closed&#8208;Loop CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing chemically recyclable polymers using CO2 and sustainable co&#8208;feedstocks is an important strategy for achieving carbon&#8208;neutral production of new polymers and mitigating plastic pollution. Herein, a series of six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate monomers with different alkyl &#945;&#8208;substituents were synthesized using CO2 and bioderived 1,3&#8208;alkanediol as raw materials at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization was systematically studied using a range of common and readily available organocatalysts. Phosphazene base (t&#8208;BuP2) was identified as the most effective catalyst, offering excellent control over the entire polymerization. The regioselectivity of the synthesized polycarbonates, ranged from 0.74 to 0.99, with the highest value achieved when the side group was isopropyl (highest steric hindrance). Notably, the &#945;&#8208;substituent in the mono&#8208;mers reduced the ring strains, allowing the resulting polycarbonates to be fully recycled to the monomers without decarboxylation. The recycling process effectively traps CO2 in a closed loop between monomers and polymers, preventing its release into the atmosphere. The alkyl side groups enhanced the hydrophobicity of the polycarbonates, thereby reducing the likelihood of CO2 release through hydrolysis during their lifecycle, achieving a robust CO2 closed&#8208;loop fixation. The utility of CO2&#8208;APCs as adhesives and the ability of copolymerization with L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA) were explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Bonds Containing Hydrogen: Choices for Hydrogen Carriers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds containing B&#8211;H, C&#8211;H, N&#8211;H, or O&#8211;H bonds with high hydrogen content have been extensivley studied as potential hydrogen carriers. Their hydrogen storage performance is largely determined by the nature of these bonds, decomposition pathways and the properties of the dehydrogenation products. Among these compounds, methanol, cyclohexane, and ammonia stand out due to their low costs and established infrastructure, making them promising hydrogen carriers for large&#8208;scale storage and transport. They offer viable pathways for decarbonising society by enabling hydrogen to serve as a clean energy source. However, several challenges persist, including the high temperatures required for (de)hydrogenation, slow kinetics, and the reliance on costly catalysts. To address these isssues, strategies such as chemical modification and catalyst development are being pursued to improve hydrogen cycling performance. This review highlights recent progress in hydrogen carriers with B&#8211;H, C&#8211;H, N&#8211;H, or O&#8211;H bonds. It examines the fundamental charateristics of these bonds and carriers, as well as advances in catalyst development. Our objective is to offer a comprehensive understanding of current state of hydrogen carriers and identify future research directions, such as molecular modification and system optimisation. Innovations in these areas are crucial to advance hydrogen storage technologies for a large&#8208;scale hydrogen deployment.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of Alkenes and Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a new masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent that enables previously inaccessible radical chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of alkenes, as well as highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of heteroarenes. The method involves conversion of the weakly electrophilic bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate into a masked electrophile, significantly increasing its reactivity, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of diverse pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Structural modification of drug candidates with fluorine atoms has revolutionized drug discovery, frequently enhancing pharmacological properties. However, the strategic integration of privileged bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol moiety remains challenging, primarily due to the overreliance on closed&#8208;shell strategies typically involving toxic gaseous hexafluoroacetone. Alternative radical&#8208;based strategies exist but are constrained by the inherently weak electrophilicity of the key bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate, significantly limiting the scope of accessible transformations. Here we report the development of a novel masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent, enabling the efficient generation of bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical species with significantly enhanced electrophilicity under mild photocatalytic conditions. This approach facilitates chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of versatile alkenes, alongside highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of diverse heteroarenes, providing streamlined access to a structurally diverse array of alkyl and aryl bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols previously considered synthetically challenging.

This approach facilitates chloro- and oxy-bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of versatile alkenes, alongside highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of diverse heteroarenes, providing streamlined access to a structurally diverse array of alkyl and aryl bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols previously considered synthetically challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of the Diketopiperazine Moiety by a Distinct Condensation&#8208;Like Domain in Hangtaimycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of structural biology, genetics, biochemistry, and computational chemistry revealed a specific mechanism by which a CT domain with the &#8220;PW&#215;&#215;&#215;DG&#8221; motif stabilizes an amidate intermediate through a protonated arginine residue R2776 outside the motif to mediate nucleophilic attack. The findings expand knowledge of C domain functions in non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are key enzymes in pharmaceutical synthesis, with condensation (C) domains catalyzing amide bond formation between aminoacyl substrates. However, recent research has elucidated that the catalytic capabilities of C domains extend beyond the traditional formation of peptide bonds. In this study, we elucidate the cyclization mechanism of the NRPS&#8208;derived natural products hangtaimycin (HTM), characterized by the formation of a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine (DKP) moiety which involves an intramolecular vinylamide&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attack instead of an N&#8208;terminal amino group. This cyclization is catalyzed by a terminal condensation&#8208;like (CT) domain within the NRPS enzyme HtmB2. We investigated the evolutionary specificity of the HtmB2&#8208;CT within Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417. Employing a multidisciplinary analytical approach, we have delineated the molecular underpinnings of DKP formation within the HTM biosynthesis. This process is facilitated by residue R2776, which modulates the formation of reactive species and stabilizes the amidate through electrostatic interactions. Besides, we found a positive correlation between the alkaline strength of the residue at position 2776 and the activity of HtmB2&#8208;CT. Our study elucidates the formation mechanism of DKPs in NRPS&#8208;derived natural products, thereby bridging a critical gap in the structural and mechanistic understanding of this field.

         <title>6H&#8208;Intermediate Phase Enabled Slow Crystal Growth of Tin Halide Perovskites for Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We controlled the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. High&#8208;quality FASnI2Br perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects, which resulted in an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000&#8197;lux.







Abstract
The rapid expansion of Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) has driven significant advancements in indoor photovoltaics (IPVs), which provide power to wireless IoT devices. Tin halide perovskites (THPs) have garnered significant attention for IPVs due to their excellent optoelectronic properties without the environmental risks of lead exposure. However, THPs face challenges in controlling their fast crystallization process. Here, we introduce a novel approach to precisely control the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. The grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements indicated the formation of 6H&#8208;intermediate phase for the FASnI2Br&#8208;4APCl perovskite during the crystallization process. The in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy during the spin coating and annealing process confirmed the reduction of crystal growth rate after the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase formation. Thus, high&#8208;quality perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects. The resulting IPVs achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs.

         <title>Chemocatalytic Cell Tagging Platform for Recording Cell&#8208;Cell Interactions via Engineered Palladium&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an innovative chemocatalytic proximity labeling platform&#8208;Artificial Metalloenzyme Tagging Technology (ArM&#8208;Tag). The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a protein scaffold to catalyze a bioorthogonal O&#8208;deallylation reaction directly on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range.







Abstract
Proximity labeling platforms (PLPs) have become a powerful tool for studying spatial cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs) in living organisms. However, their effectiveness often relies on membranal catalytic modules of bait cells, such as natural enzymes or small&#8208;molecule photocatalysts, which are typically constrained by complex genetic modifications or the limited applicability of visible light. Here, we present a novel chemocatalytic approach, ArM&#8208;Tag, which utilizes an engineered artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) for cell surface&#8208;localized tagging. The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a streptavidin (SAV) scaffold to catalyze the O&#8208;deallylation reaction on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range. By integrating Biotin&#8208;SAV technology with directed evolution, we engineered a series of biotinylated Pd complexes and optimized the ArM for efficient catalysis. We demonstrate the power of this approach by applying the ArM&#8208;Tag system to selectively record antigen&#8208;specific CCIs, specifically showing how CAR&#8722;T cells interact with tumor cells through the mesothelin/anti&#8208;mesothelin axis. This versatile, non&#8208;genetic system provides a powerful tool for probing CCIs and offers exciting prospects for advancing immunotherapy, particularly in targeted cancer treatments and immune cell&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Behavior by Single&#8208;site Pt on RuO2 for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Glycolic Acid from Plastic Wastes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site Pt&#8208;doped RuO2 was developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for synthesis of GA and H2 fuels from PET wastes. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA and H2 yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1 and 2.38&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, using a membrane electrode assembly.







Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes into valuable glycolic acid (GA) is an ideal solution for resource utilization. However, simultaneously achieving high activity and selectivity remains challenging due to the over&#8208;oxidation and C&#8722;C cleavage during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate. Herein, we develop an atomically isolated Pt on RuO2 (Pt1/RuO2) catalyst composed of high&#8208;density Pt&#8722;Ru interfaces that ensure single&#8208;site adsorption of EG, enrich surface *OH coverage and weaken *CO&#8722;CH2OH intermediate adsorption, thereby synergistically promoting GA generation. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 delivers a remarkable mass activity of 8.09&#8197;A/mgPt, as well as a high GA Faradaic efficiency (95.3&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.9&#8201;%). Under membrane electrode assembly conditions, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1. In&#8208;depth theoretical and in situ spectroscopic investigations reveal the synergy between isolated Pt and oxophilic RuO2 plays a crucial role in high&#8208;efficiency EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. This study offers valuable insights for the rational design of advanced catalysts for GA synthesis from PET wastes via a single&#8208;site doped bimetallic strategy.

         <title>Achieving Highly Reversible Mn2+/MnO2 Conversion Reaction in Electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries via Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical Process Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiO2 and FeSO4 are introduced into the electrolyte to construct a colloidal electrolyte, which synergistically promotes efficient conversion of MnO2/Mn2+. During charging, SiO2 promotes efficient deposition of Mn2+ and Mn3+, while during discharge, the introduction of Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs facilitate efficient dissolution of MnO2. The synergistic effect enhances the reversibility of MnO2/Mn2+ reaction.







Abstract
Despite the widespread interest in electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries with excellent output voltage and high theoretical capacity, the spontaneous disproportionation reaction of free Mn3+ along with the disorderly deposited inactive MnO2 results in the low Mn2+/MnO2 conversion reversibility, which seriously affects their cycling stability. Here, we propose a novel aqueous SiO2 colloidal electrolyte with FeSO4 mediator (denoted as SF electrolyte) based on a bidirectional electrochemical&#8208;chemical model to achieve dual regulation of the MnO2 deposition/dissolution process. During the charging process, the SiO2 colloidal particles located at the carbon felt interface and the electrolyte bulk phase simultaneously provide sufficient disproportionation sites for the diffused Mn3+ to guide the orderly rapid deposition of MnO2. Meanwhile, the introduction of Fe2+ mediators during the discharge process can sufficiently react with MnO2 on the SiO2 particles in the electrolyte, thereby further enabling the efficient conversion of Mn2+/MnO2. Consequently, electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery with SF electrolyte can stably run for 550&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieve superior reversibility at a high area capacity of 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of colloidal electrolytes in modulating electrochemical&#8208;chemical processes to stabilize electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Activated Platform for Controlled Hydrogen Sulfide Release with Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is increasingly recognized for its critical roles in various physiological and pathological processes. The development of synthetic donors with controllable release profiles is essential for elucidating H2S's complex involvement in cellular signaling, which remains a challenge. Herein, we report a diverse collection of photocaged N&#8208;methylation thiocarbamates and thiocarbonates, designed to explore how electronic properties and the leaving efficiency of payloads affect H2S release behaviors. These compounds are engineered to release carbonyl sulfide (COS) following the removal of photoprotective group (PPG). The COS could be rapidly converted into H2S by carbonic anhydrase, and the entire reaction progression was monitored by changes in fluorescence signals originating from the detached PPG moiety. Furthermore, this H2S&#8208;releasing platform is suitable for&#160;conjugation with active pharmaceutical ingredients, facilitating the creation of H2S&#8208;releasing hybrid prodrugs. Collectively, this novel class of H2S donor not only provides valuable tools for H2S&#8208;related research but also holds significant potential as therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectively Deoxygenative Deuteration of Aldehydes by Superwetting Porous Carbon Supported Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a method of deoxygenative deuteration of aldehydes (DDA) over heterogeneously superwetting porous carbons supported palladium catalyst (Pd/SPC), which is efficient for the synthesis of deuterated aromatic compounds with &#8208;CD3 group. Exemplified by the DDA reaction of 2&#8208;naphthaldehyde (2&#8208;NAL) to 2&#8208;methylnaphthalene (2&#8208;MNE), the total deuterium incorporation radio in the resultant aromatic hydrocarbons was higher than 95% and the selectivity towards 2&#8208;MNE&#8208;d3 reached 87%. The impressed catalytic activity was found relevant to the combined effect of surface wettability and the electron&#8208;rich properties of Pd species of this kind of heterogeneous Pd/SPC catalyst. Mechanistic studies suggest a successive deuteration pathway, i.e., hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE), deuterium addition, and ultimate deoxygenative deuteration over Pd/SPC in the cost&#8208;effective D2O/H2 reaction conditions. The in&#8208;situ formed D2 from the first step HIE between H2 and D2O can be readily captured by the electron&#8208;rich Pd centers, which then boost the subsequent deuterogenolysis of C&#8208;O bonds through deuterated alcohol intermediates towards the formation of 2&#8208;MNE&#8208;d3. This work provides a design principle of heterogeneous catalysts for targeted deuterium labeling from aldehyde substrates, and may inspire the development of alternative deuterium labeling techniques beyond dominated homogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence by Knocking Out Gold Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passivating oxide formation in ideal gold electrodes reflects in weaker ECL intensity of conventional [Ru(bpy)3]2+/TPrA systems. Such hampering behavior were eliminated by selective knocking out of surface asperities and catalytic deactivation via Cu&#8208;Fenton reagent. Results exhibited 2.7&#8208;fold increase in ECL intensity with switching mechanism from direct oxidation to catalytic pathway.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of the conventional system of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore and amine&#8208;based coreactants is particularly inefficient on noble metal electrodes. This is due to the formation of a passivating oxide layer on the metal surface inhibiting the electro&#8208;oxidation of amines like tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) coreactant. Herein, we demonstrated the enhancement of ECL emission on gold surface by hydroxyl radicals attack that are chemically generated with Cu&#8208;Fenton reagent. These radicals selectively deactivate the gold active sites and knockout the metal surface asperities that counterintuitively led to an amplification of the ECL emission. Atomic force microscopy shows a massive smoothening of the surface. The electrochemical characterization proves that the involved ECL reaction mechanism switches from direct oxidation to catalytic route, where the kinetics of indirect TPrA oxidation is facilitated on deactivated gold surface. Besides, in situ smoothening of a rough electrode in presence of tandem [Ru(bpy)3]2+/TPrA enables Cu2+ sensing with good reliability and limit of detection. Such atomically smoothened and corrosion&#8208;resistant gold surface readily tuned the ECL reactivity and opened new directions on influence of topography and reactivity on ECL mechanisms, thus will be extremely useful for the future development of ECL imaging strategies and highly sensitive ECL sensors.

         <title>Bionic Hollow Porous Carbon Nanofibers for Energy&#8208;Dense and Rapid Zinc Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging electrospinning technology in combination with coordination chemistry, capillary&#8208;like hollow carbon nanofibers were synthesized. Attributable to their unique microstructure and optimized nanopore size, those nanofibers, when employed as cathodes in zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, achieve battery&#8208;level energy density at high power outputs, coupled with remarkable cycling stability.







Abstract
Suboptimal spatial utilization and inefficient access to internal porosity preclude porous carbon cathodes from delivering high energy density in zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs). Inspired by the function of capillaries in biological systems, this study proposes a facile coordination&#8208;pyrolysis method to fabricate thin&#8208;walled hollow carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with optimized pore structure and surface functional groups for ZIHCs. The capillary&#8208;like CNFs maximize the electrode/electrolyte interface area, facilitating the optimal utilization of energy storage sites. The precision&#8208;engineered pore sizes in the fiber walls are specifically tailored to accommodate solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+, thus enhancing ion storage capacity and supporting accelerated transport kinetics. The resultant ZIHCs achieve a battery&#8208;grade energy density of 132.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 (based on active material), remarkable stability (98.7&#8201;% retention after 80,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), along with practically high areal capacities. Combined in situ/ex&#8197;situ spectroscopic characterizations, kinetic analyses, and theoretical calculations revealed that the superior energy storage performance arises from the advantageous microstructure of the biomimetic CNFs and the reversible physical/chemical adsorption process. This investigation offers a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency zinc ion storage carbon nanomaterials and provides insights into the cathodic storage mechanisms essential for advancing ZIHCs.

         <title>A Highly Selective and Versatile Probe Platform for Visualization of Monoacylglycerol Lipase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a key enzyme in the endocannabinoid system. We developed a highly flexible and specific probe platform to visualize MAGL in several cell types such as neurons or primary human immune cells. These results demonstrate the potential of the probe platform to unravel the manifold (patho)physiological roles and functions of MAGL in the endocannabinoid system.







Abstract
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a key enzyme for signal termination in the endocannabinoid system (ECS). MAGL inhibition results in indirect activation of the cannabinoid receptors, which offers unique advantages for the treatment of, e.g., multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders. Molecular imaging techniques are valuable tools to overcome the current poor understanding of MAGL's distribution and role in patho&#8208; and physiological processes within ECS signaling. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and validation of highly selective versatile fluorescent and click&#8208;chemistry probes for MAGL. Structure&#8208;based design combined with a reverse&#8208;design approach allowed the development of a structural unit that selectively and effectively recognizes MAGL while offering a versatile platform to attach different fluorophores and further reporter units. In this way, labeled probes with sub&#8208;nanomolar potency carrying diverse fluorescent dyes were obtained. Probe affinity and selectivity remained invariant to changes in the fluorophore subunit, showing the remarkable robustness of this platform in delivering tailor&#8208;made probes. Highly consistent inhibition across species supports pharmacological model translatability. Extensive profiling and validation in various cellular systems shows the ability of these highly potent and selective probes to elucidate the complex role of MAGL in ECS cellular signaling, inflammatory processes, and disease progression.

         <title>Building Localized NADP(H) Recycling Circuits to Advance Enzyme Cascadetronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A consequence of the high catalytic activities and selectivities of many enzymes is that cascades enclosed within a mesoporous conducting material using NADP(H) and intermediates as internal current carriers display the almost instantaneous information&#8208;transfer properties usually associated with electronic circuits. Such collective behavior of enzymes is demonstrated by incorporating a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing pair to compete against the external potential bias.







Abstract
The catalytic action of enzymes in a cascade trapped within a mesoporous electrode material is simultaneously energized, controlled and observed through the efficient, reversible electrochemical NAD(P)(H) recycling catalyzed by one of the enzymes. In their nanoconfined state, nicotinamide cofactors are tightly channeled current carriers, mediating multi&#8208;step reactions in either direction (oxidation or reduction) with a rapid response time. By incorporating a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing enzyme pair, the internal action of which opposes the external voltage bias driving oxidation or reduction, a reduction process can be performed under overall oxidizing conditions, and vice versa. The power of the method to control and resolve complex metabolic pathways is demonstrated using a non&#8208;linear, three&#8208;enzyme cascade extended by incorporating a fourth enzyme, urease. The latter generates in situ ammonia, which is enzymatically consumed in a reductive process, but the immediate current response to each addition of urea is observed, unusually, by applying an oxidizing potential. A practical consequence is that enzyme&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical reduction reactions requiring anaerobic conditions (to avoid O2 interference) can readily be studied under ambient aerobic conditions. The results illustrate how a complex enzyme cascade confined within a porous electrode and connected to an electrical power source manifests characteristics associated with electronic circuits.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydrolysis of Nitriles to Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive hydrolysis of inexpensive and easily accessible nitriles using Ni&#8208;tripos complex allows for the synthesis of functionalized and structurally diverse benzylic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic primary alcohols including the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Nitriles are an abundant class of compounds that are widely used as versatile feedstocks to produce various chemicals including pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals as well as materials. Here we report Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydrolysis of nitriles to alcohols in the presence of molecular hydrogen. This conversion likely occurs in a domino reaction sequence that first involves the hydrogenation of nitrile to primary imine, then the hydrolysis of imine, and subsequent deamination to the aldehyde, which is finally hydrogenated to the desired alcohol. Crucial for this reductive hydrolysis process is the commercially available triphos&#8208;ligated Ni&#8208;complex that enables highly efficient and selective transformation of aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic nitriles including fatty nitriles to prepare functionalized primary alcohols. Further, the synthetic applicability of this Ni&#8208;based protocol is presented for the selective conversion of nitrile to alcoholic group in structurally diverse and complex drug molecules as well as agrochemicals. The resulting products, alcohols are indispensable chemicals commonly used in organic synthesis and life sciences as well as material and energy technologies.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Micelle&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination for Accessing Unprotected Monofluorinated Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micelles derived from non&#8208;ionic surfactants serve a dual purpose as both solvents and electrolytes, facilitating a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly hydrodefluorination reaction and thereby minimizing the environmental impact. By utilizing aqueous micelles of PS&#8208;750&#8208;M in the presence of an electric field, an efficient hydrodefluorination of diverse difluorinated indoles is accomplished. This approach reduces waste, enhances atom economy, and enables recycling of aqueous micelles.







Abstract
Toxic organic solvents and electrolytes, traditionally indispensable for electro&#8208;organic synthesis, are now being reconsidered. In developing more sustainable electro&#8208;organic synthesis, we've harnessed the aqueous micelles as solvents and electrolyte&#8208;like structures when deformed under an electric field. The technology is showcased in synthetically highly valued hydrodefluorination reactions of difluorinated indoles. This mild electrosynthetic method produces monofluorinated unprotected indole scaffolds. Our approach minimizes waste and enhances atom economy, reducing reliance on expensive and hazardous solvents and electrolytes. The surfactant's potential for recycling was verified for two cycles. Cyclic voltammetry analysis has corroborated that PS&#8208;750&#8208;M micelles in water establish a more efficient platform for hydrodefluorination. Our technology simplifies the production of monofluorinated indoles, which are crucial for many drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Esterification of Phosphoric, Phosphonic and Phosphinic Acids with Organosilicates: Phosphorus Chemical Recycling of Sewage Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical recycling of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) recovered from sewage sludge ash into valuable phosphate triesters has been achieved via a novel esterification method with tetraalkyl orthosilicate. The approach offers an innovative recycling pathway, producing key industrial phosphorus chemicals without the use of white phosphorus while addressing phosphorus resource limitations and environmental impact.







Abstract
Global concerns regarding the depletion and strategic importance of phosphorus resources have increased demand for the recovery and recycling. However, waste&#8208;derived phosphorus compounds, primarily as chemically inert phosphoric acid or its salts, present a challenge to their direct conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals. We aimed to develop an innovative technology that utilizes the large quantities of sewage waste, bypasses the use of white phosphorus, and enables esterification of phosphoric acid to produce widely applicable phosphate triesters. Tetraalkyl orthosilicates emerged as highly effective reagents for the direct triple esterification of 85&#8201;% phosphoric acid, as well as the esterification of organophosphinic and phosphonic acids. Furthermore, we achieved esterification of recovered phosphoric acid with tetraalkyl orthosilicate, thus pioneering a recycling pathway from sewage waste to valuable phosphorus chemicals. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed a novel mechanism, wherein tetraalkyl orthosilicates facilitate multimolecular aggregation to achieve alkyl transfer from tetraalkylorthosilicate to phosphoric acid via multiple proton shuttling.

However, waste-derived phosphorus compounds, primarily as chemically inert phosphoric acid or its salts, present a challenge to their direct conversion into high-value chemicals. We aimed to develop an innovative technology that utilizes the large quantities of sewage waste, bypasses the use of white phosphorus, and enables esterification of phosphoric acid to produce widely applicable phosphate triesters. Tetraalkyl orthosilicates emerged as highly effective reagents for the direct triple esterification of 85&#8201;% phosphoric acid, as well as the esterification of organophosphinic and phosphonic acids. Furthermore, we achieved esterification of recovered phosphoric acid with tetraalkyl orthosilicate, thus pioneering a recycling pathway from sewage waste to valuable phosphorus chemicals. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed a novel mechanism, wherein tetraalkyl orthosilicates facilitate multimolecular aggregation to achieve alkyl transfer from tetraalkylorthosilicate to phosphoric acid via multiple proton shuttling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imine&#8208;Based Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors Featuring Degradability and Biocompatibility for Transient Bioinspired Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a regiochemistry&#8208;regulated backbone curvature approach to achieve two novel imine&#8208;based polymeric mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors. These materials exhibit excellent electrochemical transistor performance with structural disorder&#8208;tolerance upon doping, efficient acid&#8208;degradability, and tunable film crystallinity, enabling the conversion from volatile to non&#8208;volatile operation in OECT based artificial synapses. This demonstrates great potential for advancing sustainable, bio&#8208;inspired transient electronics.







Abstract
Degradable features are highly desirable to advance next&#8208;generation organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) for transient bioinspired artificial intelligence devices. It is highly challenging that OMIECs exhibit excellent mixed ionic&#8208;electronic behavior and show degradability simultaneously. Specially, in OMIECs, doping is often a tradeoff between structural disorder and charge carrier mobilities. Here, we describe a regiochemistry&#8208;driven backbone curvature approach to prepare OMIECs, enabling doped state ordered within efficient ionic&#8208;electronic conduction in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and presenting degradable characteristics. Significantly, i&#8208;3gTIT shows an outstanding mobility (1.99&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and &#956;C* (302&#8197;F&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and presents higher disorder&#8208;tolerance upon doping and faster degradation behavior than its regioisomer, o&#8208;3gTIT. Especially, the resulting OECT&#8208;based inverter shows a high voltage gain of 31.6&#8197;V&#8201;V&#8722;1 at a low driving voltage of 0.6&#8197;V. Moreover, we demonstrate an application of transient OECT, i.&#8197;e., biodegradable solid&#8208;state electrolyte of OECT&#8208;based artificial synapses. Remarkably, the regiochemistry&#8208;driven film crystallinity modulation enables the conversion from volatile to non&#8208;volatile operation in such synapses. The transient synapse based on i&#8208;3gTIT achieves over 90&#8201;% recognition accuracy for small digit handwritten images, showing potential in security neuromorphic computing. Our work is the first presentation enabling excellent mixed conduction of OMIECs with degradable features for transient bioinspired electronics.

         <title>Bridging Electrolyte Bulk and Interfacial Chemistry: Dynamic Protective Strategy Enable Ultra&#8208;Long Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior service lifespan aqueous Zn battery was built by taking advantage of the biomass&#8208;derived chitin nanocrystals colloid electrolyte to bridge electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry for achieving dynamic protective strategy. This unique strategy not only enables continuous optimization of electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry within the battery but also facilitates self&#8208;repairing of mechanical damages both internally and externally, resulting in building comprehensive, persistent, and dynamic protection for aqueous Zn batteries.







Abstract
The main bottleneck of rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) is their limited cycle lifespans stemming from the unhealthy electrolyte bulk and fragile interface, especially in the absence of dynamic protection mechanism between them. To overcome this limitation, benefitting from their synergistic physical and chemical properties, chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) are employed as superior colloid electrolyte to bridge electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry for ultra&#8208;long lifespan AZBs. This unique strategy not only enables continuous optimization of the electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry within the battery but also facilitates self&#8208;repairing of mechanical damage both internally and externally, thereby achieving comprehensive, persistent, and dynamic protection. As a result, the modified zinc (Zn) cells present high Zn plating/stripping coulombic efficiencies of 97.71&#8201;% ~99.81&#8201;% from 5 to 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and remarkably service lifespan up to 8,200&#8197;h (more than 11&#8197;months). Additionally, the Zn//MnO2 full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 70.1&#8201;% after 3,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This dynamic protective strategy to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry may open up a new avenue for building better AZBs and beyond.

         <title>Diplatinum Single&#8208;Molecular Photocatalyst Capable of Driving Hydrogen Production from Water via Singlet&#8208;to&#8208;Triplet Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new diplatinum(II) complex Pt2(bpia)Cl3 (bpia=bis(2&#8208;pyridylimidoyl)amido) is proven to serve as a single&#8208;molecular photocatalyst enabling the H2 production from water in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor by irradiating the visible light above 500&#8197;nm. This work for the first time demonstrates that the direct singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet (S&#8208;T) transitions can be used to drive photocatalytic H2 production.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is regarded as one of the most ideal methods to achieve a sustainable society. In order to artificially establish efficient photosynthetic systems, efforts have been made to develop single&#8208;molecular photocatalysts capable of serving both as a photosensitizer (PS) and a catalyst (Cat) in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although examples of such hybrid molecular photocatalysts have been demonstrated in the literature, their solar energy conversion efficiencies still remain quite limited. Here we demonstrate that a new dinuclear platinum(II) complex Pt2(bpia)Cl3 (bpia=bis(2&#8208;pyridylimidoyl)amido) serves as a single&#8208;molecular photocatalyst for HER with its performance significantly higher than that of the PtCl(tpy)&#8208; and PtCl2(bpy)&#8208;type photocatalysts developed in our group (tpy=2,2':6&#8242;,2''&#8208;terpyridine, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine). The outstanding feature is that Pt2(bpia)Cl3 can produce H2 even by irradiating the lower&#8208;energy light above 500&#8197;nm, which is rationalized due to the direct population of triplet states via singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet transitions (i.e., S&#8208;T transitions) accelerated by the diplatinum core. To the best of our knowledge, Pt2(bpia)Cl3 is the first example of a single&#8208;molecular photocatalyst enabling hydrogen production from water via the S&#8208;T transitions using lower&#8208;energy light (&gt;580&#8197;nm).

         <title>Bias&#8208;Induced Ga&#8722;O&#8208;Ir Interface Breaks the Limits of Adsorption&#8208;Energy Scaling Relationships for High&#8208;Performing Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active Ir catalyst supported on Ga2O3 was developed through bias&#8208;induced Ga leaching, promoting dynamic migration of oxygen species. Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interfaces enhance water dissociation and OH* migration, improving catalytic activity. The catalyst showed a low overpotential (197&#8197;mV), and impressive performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) with a cell voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 1000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Rationally manipulating the in situ formed catalytically active surface of catalysts remains a significant challenge for achieving highly efficient water electrolysis. Herein, we present a bias&#8208;induced activation strategy to modulate in situ Ga leaching and trigger the dynamic surface restructuring of lamellar Ir@Ga2O3 for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. The in situ reconstructed Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interface sustains high water oxidation rates at oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials. We found that OER at the Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interface follows a bi&#8208;nuclear adsorbate evolution mechanism with unsaturated IrOx as the active sites, while GaOx atoms play an indirect role in promoting water dissociation to form OH* and transferring OH* to Ir sites. This breaks the scaling relationship of the adsorption energies between OH* and OOH*, significantly lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step and greatly increasing reactivity. The Ir@Ga2O3 catalyst achieves lower overpotentials, a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.76&#8197;V, and stable operation up to 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in scalable proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) at 1.63&#8197;V, maintaining stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 1000&#8197;hours with a degradation rate of 11.5&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work prompted us to jointly address substrate&#8211;catalyst interactions and catalyst reconstruction, an underexplored path, to improve activity and stability in Ir PEMWE anodes.

&lt;p&gt;A highly active Ir catalyst supported on Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was developed through bias-induced Ga leaching, promoting dynamic migration of oxygen species. Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interfaces enhance water dissociation and OH* migration, improving catalytic activity. The catalyst showed a low overpotential (197&#8197;mV), and impressive performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) with a cell voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 1000&#8197;hours.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rationally manipulating the in situ formed catalytically active surface of catalysts remains a significant challenge for achieving highly efficient water electrolysis. Herein, we present a bias-induced activation strategy to modulate in situ Ga leaching and trigger the dynamic surface restructuring of lamellar Ir@Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. The in situ reconstructed Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interface sustains high water oxidation rates at oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials. We found that OER at the Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interface follows a bi-nuclear adsorbate evolution mechanism with unsaturated IrO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; as the active sites, while GaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; atoms play an indirect role in promoting water dissociation to form OH* and transferring OH* to Ir sites. This breaks the scaling relationship of the adsorption energies between OH* and OOH*, significantly lowering the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step and greatly increasing reactivity. The Ir@Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst achieves lower overpotentials, a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.76&#8197;V, and stable operation up to 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in scalable proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) at 1.63&#8197;V, maintaining stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 1000&#8197;hours with a degradation rate of 11.5&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Dry&#8208;Solid&#8208;Electrochemical Synthesis: A General Method for Large Scale Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Metal loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal Dry&#8208;solid&#8208;electrochemical synthesis (DSES) method was proposed to fabricate single atom catalysts with high metal loadings. A unique redox mechanism for DSES process is proposed: metal precursors on conductive supports are reduced to individual metal atoms via a homolytic cleavage of metal precursors by the attacking of electrons flowing through the dry solid phase.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loadings are highly desirable but still challenging for large scale synthesis. Here we report a new technique named as dry&#8208;solid&#8208;electrochemical synthesis (DSES) for a general large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs with high metal loadings in an energy&#8208;conservation and environment&#8208;friendly way. With it, a series of pure carbon&#8208;supported metal SACs (Platinum up to 35.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%, Iridium 21.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%, Ruthenium 20.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% and Iron 17.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%) with high metal loadings were obtained. Particularly, a Pt SAC with Pt 23.9&#8197;wt&#8201;% and remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in fuel cells is synthesized on kilogram scale. Based on multiple control experiments, a unique redox mechanism for DSES process is proposed: metal precursors on conductive supports are reduced to metals via a homolytic cleavage of metal&#8208;halogen bonds by the attacking of electrons flowing through the dry solid phase. Such versatile technique paves a new economical and environment&#8208;friendly pathway for fabricating high&#8208;metal&#8208;loading SACs or atomic dispersion catalysts.

         <title>Non&#8208;Monotonic Variation of Potential&#8208;Dependent Surface Diffusion at Electrochemical Interfaces in the Presence of Coadsorbates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using fast scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements and complementary simulations, the diffusion of adsorbates at electrochemical interfaces is shown to depend in complex and unexpected ways on potential and coadsorbates. For the case of sulfur diffusion on halide&#8208;covered Ag(100) electrodes, first a pronounced increase in sulfur mobility with increasing halide surface density is found, followed by a strong decrease at halide saturation coverage.







Abstract
The influence of coadsorbed ions on adsorbate diffusion, an inherent effect at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces, was studied for adsorbed sulfur on Ag(100) electrodes in the presence of bromide or iodide. Quantitative in situ high&#8208;speed scanning tunnelling microscopy (video&#8208;STM) measurements were performed both in the potential regime of the c(2&#215;2) halide adlayer at its saturation coverage and in the regime of a disordered adlayer where the halide coverage increases with potential. These studies reveal a surprising non&#8208;monotonic potential dependence of Sad diffusion with an initial increase with halide coverage, followed by a decrease upon halide adlayer ordering into the c(2&#215;2) structure. Density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations only qualitatively reproduce the rise in Sad mobility with halide coverage, suggesting that many&#8208;adsorbate interactions and the presence of the electrolyte need to be considered.

         <title>Operando Nanoscale Characterization Reveals Fe Doping of Ni Oxide Enhances Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Fragmentation and Formation of Dual Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando nanoscale characterization of Ni oxide catalysts (NiOx) reveals that Fe doping enhances oxygen evolution activity by increasing the active surface area via island fragmentation and forming dual active centers of Ni and Fe atoms. Combining atomically precise growth under ultra&#8208;high vacuum and exfoliation of 2D materials for electrocatalytic studies, we uncover both the hydroxylation step and the dynamic nature of active sites under OER conditions.







Abstract
Efficient catalytic water splitting demands advanced catalysts to improve the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal oxides show promising OER activity in alkaline media. However, most experimental information available is either from post&#8208;mortem studies or in&#8197;situ space&#8208;averaged X&#8208;ray techniques in the micrometer range. Therefore, the composition of the active centers under operando conditions is still under debate. In this work, we combine nanoscopic and spectroscopic measurements on the hydroxylation of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)&#8208;prepared Ni and NiFe oxides nanoislands with operando local investigations of Ni and NiFe hydroxide electrocatalysts under OER conditions to reveal the nature of the active centers in 2D OER catalysts. Our results reveal that Fe doping increases the active surface area by island fragmentation, and boosts the intrinsic activity by creating optimized active centers consisting of both Ni and Fe atoms. In addition, our findings show that operando characterization at the nanoscale is crucial to reveal the dynamic nature of the interface of 2D catalysts under reaction conditions.

         <title>Non&#8208;Substituted Aromatic Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide Additives with an Intrinsic N&#8594;O Acceptor for Ultra&#8208;Long&#8208;Life Zn||MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;substituted aromatic pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PNO) containing an N&#8594;O acceptor is reported as a highly effective additive to the ZS electrolyte in ZIBs. This additive is distinct from previously reported organic molecules or salts. The N&#8594;O group acts as an un&#8208;ionized, appropriately polarized ligand&#8208;bonded acceptor, significantly enhancing the cyclic lifetime of ZIBs.







Abstract
Various organic and inorganic reagents containing N/O functional groups have been developed as additives to aqueous electrolytes (e.g., ZnSO4, ZS) of zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). However, finding an additive that can significantly enhance the durability of Zn anodes by inhibiting Zn dendrites and side reactions remains a considerable challenge. Herein, pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PNO), a non&#8208;substituted aromatic compound with a nitrogen positive charge&#8208;induced N&#8594;O bond, is explored as ZS additives for highly durable Zn plating/stripping electrolytes (i.e., PNO/ZS). The optimized PNO0.03/ZS mixture demonstrates exceptional stability for Zn anodes, achieving a cycle life exceeding 4200&#8197;h and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It maintains over 1000&#8197;h of life and a cumulative capacity of 2.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even when subjected to plating/stripping conditions intensified by a factor of 5. Importantly, it enables Zn||&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cells to sustain high&#8208;current charge/discharge cycles for over 5000 cycles, retaining 80&#8201;% (125&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) of the initial capacity, which is the best performance reported for similar additive systems. This exceptional stability is ascribed to the highly reversible Zn anode plating/stripping, facilitated by the suitable coordination interactions between the N&#8594;O acceptor of PNO and the Zn2+/H2O donor, effectively inhibiting side reactions.

     alt="Non-Substituted Aromatic Pyridine N-Oxide Additives with an Intrinsic N&#8594;O Acceptor for Ultra-Long-Life Zn||MnO2 Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-substituted aromatic pyridine N-oxide (PNO) containing an N&#8594;O acceptor is reported as a highly effective additive to the ZS electrolyte in ZIBs. This additive is distinct from previously reported organic molecules or salts. The N&#8594;O group acts as an un-ionized, appropriately polarized ligand-bonded acceptor, significantly enhancing the cyclic lifetime of ZIBs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various organic and inorganic reagents containing N/O functional groups have been developed as additives to aqueous electrolytes (e.g., ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ZS) of zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). However, finding an additive that can significantly enhance the durability of Zn anodes by inhibiting Zn dendrites and side reactions remains a considerable challenge. Herein, pyridine N-oxide (PNO), a non-substituted aromatic compound with a nitrogen positive charge-induced N&#8594;O bond, is explored as ZS additives for highly durable Zn plating/stripping electrolytes (i.e., PNO/ZS). The optimized PNO&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;/ZS mixture demonstrates exceptional stability for Zn anodes, achieving a cycle life exceeding 4200&#8197;h and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It maintains over 1000&#8197;h of life and a cumulative capacity of 2.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, even when subjected to plating/stripping conditions intensified by a factor of 5. Importantly, it enables Zn||&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells to sustain high-current charge/discharge cycles for over 5000 cycles, retaining 80&#8201;% (125&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the initial capacity, which is the best performance reported for similar additive systems. This exceptional stability is ascribed to the highly reversible Zn anode plating/stripping, facilitated by the suitable coordination interactions between the N&#8594;O acceptor of PNO and the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O donor, effectively inhibiting side reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Bridging intra&#8208;channel charge nature and ion transport: A tunable platform of a series of crystalline COFs with identical frameworks but different intra&#8208;pore charge microenvironments is developed to explore their charge&#8208;driven monovalent cation transport performance and mechanism. Rational tuning of charge properties optimizes host&#8208;guest interactions, enhancing ion pair dissociation, cation mobility, and carrier concentration. Order of transport efficiency: anionic COF &gt; zwitterionic COF &gt; cationic COF &gt; neutral COF. This work offers new insights into the development and structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of the next generation of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors.







Abstract
Charged channels are considered an effective design for achieving efficient monovalent cation transport; however, it remains challenging to establish a direct relationship between charge microenvironments and ionic conductivity within the pores. Herein, we report a series of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with identical skeletons but different charge microenvironments and explore their intra&#8208;pore charge&#8208;driven ion transport performance and mechanism differences. We found that the charged nature determines ion&#8208;pair action sites, modes, host&#8208;guest interaction, thereby influencing the dissociation efficiency of ion pairs, the hopping ability of cations, and the effective carrier concentration. The order of transport efficiency for Li+, Na+, and H+ follows anion &gt; zwitterion &gt; cation &gt; neutrality. Ionic COFs exhibit up to 11&#8208;fold higher ionic conductivity than neutral COFs. Notably, the ionic conductivity of anionic COF achieves 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for Li+ at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 3.8 &#215; 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for H+ at 160&#8201;&#176;C, surpassing most COF&#8208;based ionic conductors. This COF platform for efficient ion migration and stable battery cycling in lithium&#8208;metal quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries has also been verified as proof of concept. This work offers new insights into the development and structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of the next generation of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors.

         <title>Industrial&#8208;Level Paired Electrosynthesis of Valuable Chemicals over a High&#8208;Performance Heterostructural Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous Co2P@MoOx heterostructure is rationally developed as excellent bifunctional catalysts for the coupling NO2RR||GOR overall reaction, realizing excellent activity and stability towards the co&#8208;electrosynthesis of NH3 and formate products by membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer at industrial&#8208;level current density.







Abstract
Paired electrosynthetic technology is of significance to realize the co&#8208;production of high&#8208;added value chemicals. However, exploiting efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst of the concurrent electrocatalysis to achieve the industrial&#8208;level performance is still challenging. Herein, an amorphous Co2P@MoOx heterostructure is rationally designed by in situ electrodeposition strategy, which is acted as excellent bifunctional catalysts for the electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). The membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer realizes a low voltage of 1.30&#8197;V, robust stability over 200&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high Faraday efficiencies and yield of NH3 (above 95&#8201;%, 49.7&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and formate (above 95&#8201;%, 304.4&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at industrial&#8208;level current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy studies have shown that high&#8208;valence CoOOH is the main active material of GOR, and the main catalytic conversion pathway of NO2RR involves key *NH2OH reaction intermediates. In addition, theoretical calculations confirm that the Co2P@MoOx heterostructure has strong interfacial electronic interaction and optimized reaction energy barriers, which endows its intrinsically high electrocatalytic activity for the co&#8208;electrosynthesis of NH3 and formate.

         <title>CO Cryo&#8208;Sorption as a Surface&#8208;Sensitive Spectroscopic Probe of the Active Site Density of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first identification of the spectroscopic fingerprint and quantification for CO probe molecules adsorbed to Fe&#8208;N4 sites by a corroborated investigation of in situ surface X&#8208;ray spectroscopic techniques (NAP&#8208;XPS and &#8208;NEXAFS) and ab initio DFT calculations. The DFT calculations suggest explanations for the low&#8208;temperature CO adsorption.







Abstract
Quantifying the number of active sites is a crucial aspect in the performance evaluation of single metal&#8208;atom electrocatalysts. A possible realization is using adsorbing gas molecules that selectively bind to the single&#8208;atom transition metal and then probing their surface density using spectroscopic tools. Herein, using in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, we detect adsorbed CO gas molecules on a FeNC oxygen reduction single atom catalyst. Correlating XPS and NEXAFS, we develop a simple surface&#8208; and chemically&#8208;sensitive protocol to accurately and quickly quantify the active site density. Density functional theory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray spectra simulations reaffirm the assignment of the spectroscopic fingerprints of the CO molecules adsorbed at Fe&#8208;N4&#8208;C sites, and provide additional unexpected structural insights about the active site needed to explain the low&#8208;temperature CO adsorption. Our work represents an important step towards an accurate quantitative catalytic performance evaluation, and thus towards developing reliable material design principles and catalysts.

Chloride ions enhance charge dynamics and reduce energy barriers, achieving high H2 production (2.5&#8197;mmol&#8901;cm&#8722;2&#8901;h&#8722;1) and H2O2 yield (300&#8197;&#956;mol/L). The system exhibits remarkable stability and efficiency, demonstrating its potential for sustainable solar energy conversion and chemical production.







Abstract
Photocatalytic seawater splitting into hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide (2H2O&#8594;H2&#8593; + H2O2) offers an ultimate solution for simultaneously generating green fuel and value&#8208;added chemicals by the two most earth&#8208;abundant resources i.e., solar energy and natural seawater. In this study, Pd nanoparticles are integrated with one&#8208;dimensional gallium nitride nanowires (Pd NPs/GaN NWs) on a silicon wafer to produce H2 and H2O2 from seawater powered by sunlight. In situ spectroscopic characterizations combined with computational investigations reveal that in this nanohybrid, Pd NPs function as an efficient hole extractor and *OH alleviator during photocatalysis. Meanwhile, the chloride ions in seawater facilitate the H2O&#8594; H2 + H2O2 conversion by improving the charge dynamics and lowering the energy barrier of the key *OH self&#8208;coupling step over Pd sites in the catalytic system. As a result, the photocatalyst delivers an appreciable hydrogen production rate of 2.5&#8197;mmol&#8901;cm&#8722;2&#8901;h&#8722;1 with a light&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (LTH) efficiency of 4.38&#8201;% in natural seawater under concentrated light irradiation of 3&#8197;W&#8901;cm&#8722;2 without sacrificial agents and external energies. Notably, the water oxidation reaction produces 300&#8197;&#956;mol/L of valuable H2O2 over a duration of 2&#8197;hours under a light intensity of 3&#8197;W/cm2 using a 20&#8197;mL water sample, achieving a light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical efficiency of 0.53&#8201;%. The photocatalyst shows excellent stability for up to 60&#8197;hours with a considerable turnover number of 1.42&#215;107 moles H2 per mole of Pd. The outdoor test further suggests the great potential for solar&#8208;driven seawater splitting into green fuels and chemicals.

         <title>Rendering Proteins Fluorescent Inconspicuously: Genetically Encoded 4&#8208;Cyanotryptophan Conserves Their Structure and Enables the Detection of Ligand Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hiding in plain sight: 4&#8208;Cyanotryptophan (4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp) renders proteins visibly fluorescent. Replacing a Trp residue with 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp inside a protein confers fluorescence without changing the surface structure; this can be used for microscopy, to measure ligand binding with subnanomolar sensitivity, and to detect proximity to the ligand. Systems are provided for genetic encoding of CN&#8208;Trp isomers, including 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp, in high yield.







Abstract
Cyanotryptophans (CN&#8208;Trp) are privileged multimodal reporters on protein structure. They are similar in size to the canonical amino acid tryptophan and some of them exhibit bright fluorescence which responds sensitively to changes in the environment. We selected aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases specific for 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp for high&#8208;yield in vivo production of proteins with a single, site&#8208;specifically introduced nitrile label. The absorption maximum of 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp is distinct from Trp, allowing the selective excitation of its intense fluorescence. 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp fluoresces in the visible range with an intensity rivalling that of 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;coumarin. Crystal structures of maltose binding protein demonstrate near&#8208;complete structural conservation when a native buried Trp residue is replaced by 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp. Besides presenting an inconspicuous tag for live cell microscopy, the intense fluorescence of 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp enables measurements of subnanomolar ligand binding affinities in isotropic solution, as demonstrated by the complex between rapamycin and the peptidyl&#8211;prolyl isomerase FKBP12 furnished with a 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp residue in the substrate binding pocket. Furthermore, 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp residues positioned at different locations of a protein containing multiple tryptophan residues permits using fluorescence quenching experiments to detect the proximity of individual Trp residues to the binding site of aromatic ligands.

         <title>A Conductive Cu&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Ribbon with High&#8208;Density Redox&#8208;Active Centers as Cathode for Stable High&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A conductive Cu&#8208;MOF featuring a coordination ribbon with high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active centers is constructed using DDA (1, 5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;4, 8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9, 10&#8208;anthraceneedione) and double redox&#8208;active centers (Cu&#8208;O3N) via &#960;&#8208;d conjugation. As LIBs cathode, the resultant Cu&#8208;MOF could deliver a combination of high capacity (353&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), impressive high&#8208;rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability.







Abstract
Conductive Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MOF) materials hold significant potential as cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their flexible structural design, high electronic conductivity, and independence from costly resources. However, their practical application is often limited by their capacity and cyclability. In this study, we report a one&#8208;dimensional Cu&#8208;MOF (DDA&#8722;Cu, DDA=1, 5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;4, 8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9, 10&#8208;anthraceneedione) featuring extended &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination ribbon and high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active centers, making it a stable, high&#8208;capacity cathode for LIBs. The &#960;&#8208;d conjugated Cu&#8722;O3N motifs embedded within the ribbon not only serve as redox&#8208;active centers for enhanced lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity but also contribute to structural robustness, enabling resistance against electrode solubility in organic electrolytes, thus ensuring superior cyclability. Furthermore, these &#960;&#8208;d conjugated Cu&#8722;O3N units promote efficient charge transfer, leading to high electronic conductivity at room temperature. These advantageous properties allow the Cu&#8208;MOF cathode to deliver a remarkable capacity (353&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and exceptional cyclability, achieving capacity retention of 78&#8201;% after 1000 cycles, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF electrodes. Additionally, this DDA&#8722;Cu demonstrates considerable wettability with the electrolyte, achieving outstanding performance even when tested in a lean electrolyte environment (2&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1) with a high mass loading of the MOF (6.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Controlled Introduction of sp3 Quantum Defects in Fluorescent Carbon Nanotubes by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the photophysics of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) holds immense potential for their applications in sensing and imaging. By using mechanochemistry, sp3 quantum defects are introduced in fluorescent SWCNTs via a solid&#8208;state reaction within 5&#8197;min. This method allows by varying the mechanochemical energy impact to create quantum defects at extremely low defect densities and chemical control without diminishing fluorescence.







Abstract
Precise control over low&#8208;dimensional materials holds an immense potential for their applications in sensing, imaging and information processing. The controlled introduction of sp3 quantum defects (color centers) can be used to tailor the optoelectronic properties of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the tissue transparency (&gt;800&#8197;nm) and the telecommunication window. However, an uncontrolled functionalization of SWCNTs with defects leads to a loss of the NIR fluorescence. Here, we use mechanochemistry with aryldiazonium salts to create quantum defects in SWCNTs. The reaction proceeds within 5&#8197;min without solvents or illumination and can be controlled by a varied mechanochemical energy impact. By working in the solid&#8208;state, this method presents an alternative synthetic route and marks a crucial step for tailoring photophysics of SWCNTs.

By working in the solid-state, this method presents an alternative synthetic route and marks a crucial step for tailoring photophysics of SWCNTs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of oxime ethers by controlling the orientation of a directing group using electron&#8208;deficient Cp*CF3Ir(III) and a photosensitizer is reported. Switchable and successive C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H double functionalization was accomplished by manipulating the order of C&#8722;H activation to construct densely functionalized structures.







Abstract
A site&#8208;selective functionalization of a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond was achieved in the presence of an intrinsically more reactive C(sp2)&#8722;H bond by controlling the orientation of a directing group via a photo&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization of an oxime ether. By combining E/Z isomerization and an electron deficient Cp*CF3Ir(III) catalyst, the scope of oxime ethers in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization was successfully expanded. Based on this strategy, the order of C&#8722;H activation was switchable and successive C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H double functionalizations were accomplished to construct densely functionalized structures.

         <title>Electron Delocalized Ni Active Sites in Spinel Catalysts Enable Efficient Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulating the electron delocalization of Ni active sites can significantly alter the attack sites of OH&#8722; ions, modulate the dissociation pattern of urea molecules, effectively optimizing the product selectivity and enhancing the reaction efficiency in urea oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has attracted much attention as an efficient alternative reaction to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its low required overpotential. Despite significant progress in efficient nickel&#8208;based catalysts, the fundamental issues regarding product selectivity control and dissociation mechanism during the UOR process have not been clarified. Here, we report that tuning the electron delocalization strength of Ni sites significantly affects the OH&#8722; binding sites, altering urea molecule dissociation patterns in alkaline systems. Using spinel NiCo2O4 as a model catalyst, the charge delocalization strength of nickel active centers is influenced by the degree of phosphorus&#8208;substituted anions. Specifically, complete phosphorus&#8208;substituted spinel enhances N2 selectivity up to 26.8&#8201;% with a peak current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, while partial phosphorus&#8208;substituted spinel achieves a Faraday efficiency of 78.1&#8201;% for liquid products (NOx&#8722;). Experiments and theory reveal that strong charge delocalization at Ni sites favors remote&#8208;site attack on urea molecules by hydroxide ions, whereas weak delocalization prefers nearby&#8208;site attack, enhancing UOR efficiency and suppressing OER in both pathways.

         <title>Thermal Modulation of Exciton Recombination for High&#8208;Temperature Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient high&#8208;temperature afterglow (HTA) in a metal&#8208;free doping system was developed by leveraging a meticulously crafted synergy of thermally electron releasing, Dexter energy transfer, and electron&#8208;hole recombination, which marks the first instance of a tunable afterglow combining a bright blue HTA with lifetime of 1.04&#8197;s even at 150&#8201;&#176;C and a rigidity&#8208;induced yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
Developing smart materials with tunable high&#8208;temperature afterglow (HTA) luminescence remains a formidable challenge. This study presents a metal&#8208;free doping system using boric acid as matrix and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as dopants. This composition achieves dynamically tunable afterglow combining a bright blue HTA lasting for over ten seconds even at 150&#8201;&#176;C and an ultra&#8208;long yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence below 110&#8201;&#176;C. The observed HTA is attributed to the thermally released exciton recombination within the dopant molecules, which shows excellent temperature tolerance compared to traditional triplet related phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The planarity of dopants is extensively investigated playing a pivotal role in modulating Dexter electron transfer (ET) for capturing released electrons and thereby affecting the overall performance of tunable HTA. This work provides an efficient and universal doping strategy to engineer tunable HTA through the synergistic action of thermally releasing electrons, Dexter ET and exciton recombination.

         <title>Programmed Charge Transfer in Conjugated Polymers with Pendant Benzothiadiazole Acceptor for Simultaneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;donor backbone incorporating with pendant benzothiadiazole acceptor are elaborately designed to create directional charge&#8208;transfer channels in linear conjugated polymers (LCPs). This design efficiently directs electrons towards reduction centers, facilitating reactive oxygen species generation, while simultaneously guiding holes towards oxidation centers, thus significantly boosting photocatalytic H2O2 production and organic synthesis.







Abstract
While being important candidate for heterogeneous photocatalyst, conjugated polymer typically exhibits random charge transfers between the alternating donor and acceptor units, which severely limits its catalytic efficiency. Herein, inspired by natural photosystem, the concept of guiding the charge migration to specific reaction sites is employed to significantly boost photocatalytic performance of linear conjugated polymers (LCPs) with pendant functional groups via creating programmed charge&#8208;transfer channels from the backbone to its pendant moiety. The pendant benzothiadiazole, as revealed in both in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can act as electron &#8220;reservoir&#8221; that aggregates electrons at the active sites. Moreover, the presence of charge&#8208;transfer channels, evidenced by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), accelerates the electron transfer, preventing the recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, in this elaborately&#8208;designed architecture, the photogenerated electron can move smoothly towards the reduction sites, facilitating the reduction of O2 into H2O2, while remaining holes are directed to oxidation centers, simultaneously oxidizing furfuryl alcohol to furoic acid. The optimized photocatalyst LCP&#8208;BT demonstrates a competitive catalytic performance with H2O2 productivity of 868.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (9.8&#8197;times higher than conventional random charge&#8208;transfer polymer LCP&#8208;1) and furfuryl alcohol conversion over 95&#8201;% after 6&#8197;h.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Tri&#8208;Axis Naphthalenes via Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction and Dehydrative Aromatization of Isobenzofurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of naphthalenes with 1,3,4&#8208;triaxes were successfully synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities via sequential Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and TfOH&#8208;promoted dehydrative aromatization, using modular 1,3&#8208;biaryl&#8208;isobenzofurans and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles as reaction partners. Based on these novel tri&#8208;axis structural skeletons, a CPL&#8208;active dye with high values of |glum| (0.019) and &#216;FL (0.29) was obtained, demonstrating the great potential of triaxially chiral ring scaffolds in the design of chiroptical organic materials.







Abstract
Atropisomers with multiple stereogenic axes have attracted much attention due to their increasing significance in the fields of natural products, chiral materials, and drug discoveries. However, the catalytic stereoselective construction of axially chiral ring scaffolds with more than two axes on a single benzene ring remains a challenging task. Herein, we present an efficient method for synthesizing triaxially chiral polysubstituted naphthalene scaffolds via sequential Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of isobenzofurans and TfOH&#8208;promoted dehydrative aromatization reaction. Using 1,3&#8208;biarylisobenzofurans and &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles as modular reaction partners, a series of naphthalenes with 1,3,4&#8208;triaxes were synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, by attaching two pyrene chromophores to this novel triaxially chiral ring scaffold, a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active dye exhibiting a remarkable luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum=&#8722;0.019) and high fluorescence quantum efficiency (&#216;FL=0.29) was obtained, highlighting the potential applications of atropisomers with multiple stereogenic axes in the design of chiroptical organic materials.

         <title>Investigating Interaction Dynamics of an Enantioselective Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Acylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of a highly selective peptide&#8208;catalysed acetylation reaction using computations and NMR techniques sensitive to dynamics on the &#956;s to s timescale is presented. 13C&#8208;Relaxation dispersion measurements and 1H&#8208;CEST reveal differences in dynamics, providing insight into the molecular recognition of enantiomeric substrates by the peptide catalyst.







Abstract
Modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods like carbon relaxation dispersion in the rotating frame (13C&#8722;R1&#961;) and proton chemical exchange saturation transfer (1H&#8208;CEST) are key methods to investigate molecular recognition in biomacromolecules and to detect molecular motions on the &#956;s to s timescale, revealing transient conformational states. Changes in kinetics can be linked to binding, folding, or catalytic events. Here, we investigated whether these methods allow detection of changes in the dynamics of a small, highly selective peptide catalyst during recognition of its enantiomeric substrates. The flexible tetrapeptide Boc&#8208;l&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;Me)&#8722;His&#8722;AGly&#8208;l&#8722;Cha&#8722;l&#8208;Phe&#8722;OMe, used for the monoacetylation of cycloalkane&#8208;diols, is probed at natural abundance using 13C&#8208;R1&#961; and 1H&#8208;CEST. Indeed, we detected differences in dynamics of the peptide upon interaction with the diol. Importantly, these differ depending on the enantiomer of the substrate used. These enantiospecific influences of the substrates on the dynamics of the peptide are rationalized using computational techniques. We find that even though one enantiomer reacts faster, as confirmed by reaction monitoring, the other is more tightly bound in DCM (as confirmed by 1H&#8208;saturation transfer difference (STD) measurements). These findings provide insights into the recognition of the substrates and explain the selectivity differences observed between the solvents toluene and DCM.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers for Enhanced Thermal Cycling Stability in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preventing crack and delamination during thermal cycling is crucial for mechanical reliability of flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). An innovative approach, using an in&#8208;situ polymerization molecule with extended functional end groups simultaneously cross&#8208;links neighboring grains and coordinate with SnO2, allowing the device to withstand temperature fluctuations. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and thermal&#8208;mechanical stability of FPSCs, critical for commercialization of FPSCs.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) are a promising emerging photovoltaic technology, with certified power conversion efficiencies reaching 24.9&#8201;%. However, the frequent occurrence of grain fractures and interface delamination raises concerns about their ability to endure the mechanical stresses caused by temperature fluctuations. In this study, we employ an in situ polymerization molecule with extended functional end groups to preserve mechanical integrity during thermal cycling. The AMPS&#8208;DEA molecule chemically anchors to grain boundaries and cross&#8208;links neighboring grains, protecting the structure from stress accumulation. Additionally, its hydroxyl groups form bidentate chelation with SnO2, enhancing interfacial adhesion and preventing delamination. More importantly, the relaxed residual stress provided by AMPS&#8208;DEA allows the perovskite layer to adapt to temperature changes, effectively matching adjacent layers and preventing mechanical failure. Our findings demonstrate that AMPS&#8208;DEA modification not only boosts PCE to 25.78&#8201;% in rigid PSCs and 24.54&#8201;% in flexible PSCs but also improves stability, maintaining over 95&#8201;% efficiency after 10,000 bending cycles and 200 thermal cycles.

         <title>Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free In Situ Generation of Benzylic Nucleophiles Using Tetramethyldisiloxane and Potassium tert&#8208;Butoxide</title>

         <dc:description>
The combination of Lewis bases and hydrosilanes has recently emerged as a mechanistically diverse manifold to facilitate various defunctionalizations, silylations, and intramolecular rearrangements. This article presents the first example applying this remarkable reagent combination towards intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation. A transition metal&#8208;free hydroalkylation reaction is described, alongside mechanistic experiments that support a plausible pathway wherein the silane acts as both an H atom and electron donor, enabling the synthesis of highly reactive carbanions via reductive radical polar crossover.







Abstract
Hydrosilanes and Lewis bases are known to promote various reductive defunctionalizations, rearrangements, and silylation reactions, facilitated by enigmatic silicon/Lewis base&#8208;derived reactive intermediates. Despite the wide variety of transformations enabled by this reagent combination, no examples of intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) forming reactions have been reported. In this work, we've identified 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO) and KOtBu as a unique reagent combination capable of generating benzylic nucleophiles in&#8197;situ from styrene derivatives, which can subsequently react with alkyl halides to give a new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) linkage via formal hydroalkylation. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds through a key hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step from a hydrosilane reducing agent to styrene, affording a benzylic radical that undergoes reductive radical polar crossover (RRPC) and subsequent SN2 alkylation.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy Engineering on Sustainable Anionic Redox Mn&#8208;Based Cathode with Retardant Stress for High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found the high&#8208;entropy construction in the Mn&#8208;based layered oxide could provide high reversible capacity, cycle life and fast Na+ kinetic behaviors through the strong and sustainable oxygen anion redox. And the lattice framework could be greatly strengthened and the stress concentration could also be alleviated. The demonstration of this concept shed lights onto the development of long&#8208;lasting and high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;based) layered oxides have emerged as competitive cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), primarily due to their high energy density, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and potential for mass production. However, these materials often suffer from irreversible oxygen redox reactions, significant phase transitions, and microcrack formation, which lead to considerable internal stress and degradation of electrochemical performance. This study introduces a high&#8208;entropy engineering strategy for P2&#8208;type Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes (HE&#8208;NMCO), wherein a multi&#8208;ingredient cocktail effect strengthens the lattice framework by modulating the local environmental chemistry. This innovative approach fosters sustainable reversible oxygen activity, mitigates stress concentrations at grain boundaries, and accelerates Na+ transport kinetics. The resulting robust lattice framework with optimized elemental interactions significantly improves structural integrity and reduces the formation of intragranular fractures. Consequently, HE&#8208;NMCO demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, retaining 93.5&#8201;% capacity after 100 deep (de)sodiation cycles, alongside an enhanced rate capability of 134.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C. Notably, comparative studies through multimodal characterization techniques highlight HE&#8208;NMCO&#8242;s superior reversibility in oxygen anion redox (OAR) reactions over extensive cycling, contrasting sharply with conventional NMCO cathode. This work elucidates the potential for advancing high energy and power density Mn&#8208;based cathodes for SIBs through local species diversity.

         <title>A Robust Dual&#8208;Layered Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by Cation Specific Adsorption&#8208;Induced Built&#8208;In Electrostatic Field for Long&#8208;Cycling Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase is constructed through a cation specific adsorption&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electrostatic field. This dual&#8208;layered SEI consists of a mechanically flexible organic&#8208;rich surface layer and a rigid, conductive inorganic&#8208;rich bottom layer, which together effectively accommodate stress and strain while inhibiting Li dendrite formation during repeated Li plating and stripping.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (SSLMBs) are considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation battery technologies due to their high energy density and intrinsic safety. However, interfacial issues such as side reactions and Li dendrite growth severely hinder the practical application of SSLMBs. In this contribution, we proposed a cationic built&#8208;in electrostatic field to drive the generation of an anion&#8208;derived dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The specific adsorption of tributylmethyl&#8208;phosphonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TMPB) cations onto negatively charged Li anode surface significantly prevents interfacial side reactions between vulnerable polyethylene oxide (PEO) and Li metal. More importantly, the formed cationic built&#8208;in electrostatic field induces the targeted trapping of Li&#8208;salt anions onto the Li metal surface, leading to the generation of an anion&#8208;derived dual&#8208;layered SEI, composed of a mechanically flexible organic&#8208;rich surface layer and a Li&#8208;ion conductive inorganic&#8208;rich bottom layer. As a result, the Li||Li cell demonstrated an extended lifespan of over 1900&#8197;hours with the reduced polarization voltage. The Li||LiFePO4 full cell also exhibited excellent cycling stability, maintaining an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% over 200 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work provides valuable insights into mitigating interfacial degradation and promoting uniform Li deposition through surface electrostatic field regulation.

         <title>An Efficient Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Yellow Emitter Based on a Double&#8208;Boron&#8208;Embedded Tetraazacyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of two boron atoms within a tetraazacyclophane architecture by a multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence design has led to a highly efficient ultra&#8208;narrowband yellow emitter, HBN, with a maximum at 572&#8197;nm and an impressively narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 17&#8197;nm. Incorporation of HBN into an organic light&#8208;emitting diode led a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;narrowband and highly modifiable multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are crucial for realizing high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut display applications. Despite progress, most MR&#8208;TADF emitters remain confined to blue and green wavelengths, with difficulties extending into longer wavelengths without significant spectral broadening, which compromises color purity in full&#8208;color organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. In this work, we present a novel tetraazacyclophane&#8208;based architecture embedding dual boron atoms to remarkedly enhance intramolecular charge transfer through the strategic positioning of boron and nitrogen atoms. This arrangement induces a substantial redshift while maintaining structural rigidity and molecular orbital symmetry, with a hole&#8208;electron central distance of 0&#8197;&#197;, allowing for ultra&#8208;narrowband emission. The resulting MR&#8208;TADF material, HBN, delivers yellow emission peaking at 572&#8197;nm (2.168&#8197;eV) with an impressively narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 17&#8197;nm (0.064&#8197;eV) in dilute toluene. Moreover, the corresponding phosphorescent&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLED achieves yellow emission maximum at 581&#8197;nm, with a narrow FWHM of 25&#8197;nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.1&#8201;%, and a luminance exceeding 40,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These outstanding photoluminescent and electroluminescent performances validate the superiority of our molecular design strategy, highlighting its significant potential for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Bifunctional Imidazolyl Iodide Mediator of Electrolyte Boosts Cathode Kinetics and Anode Stability Towards Low Overpotential and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>

A novel bifunctional soluble catalyst of 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazole iodide (DMII) is proposed for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The anion I&#8722; enhances the cathode redox kinetics while the cation DMI+ promotes the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and reduces the shuttle effect, thus realizing narrow overpotential and long&#8208;life Li&#8208;O2 battery.







Abstract
The addition of a redox mediator as soluble catalyst into electrolyte can effectively overcome the bottlenecks of poor energy efficiency and limited cyclability for Li&#8208;O2 batteries caused by passivation of insulating discharge products and unfavorable byproducts. Herein we report a novel soluble catalyst of bifunctional imidazolyl iodide salt additive, 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), to successfully construct highly efficient and durable Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The anion I&#8722; can effectively promote the charge transport of Li2O2 and accelerate the redox kinetics of oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions on the cathode side, thereby significantly decreasing the charge/discharge overpotential. Simultaneously, the cation DMI+ forms an ultrathin stably solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase film on Li metal, greatly inhibiting the shuttle effect of I&#8722; and improving the stability of anode. Using this DMII additive, our Li&#8208;O2 batteries achieve an extremely low voltage of 0.52&#8197;V and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability over 960&#8197;h. Notably, up to 95.8&#8201;% of the Li2O2 yield further proves the reversible generation/decomposition of Li2O2 without the occurrence of side reactions. Both experimental and theoretical results disclose that DMII enables Li+ easily solvated, testifying the dominance of the solution&#8208;induced reaction mechanism. This work provides the possibility to design the soluble catalysts towards high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <dc:description>
A new chiral triangular macrocycle (NDI&#8208;&#9653;) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity in the molecular state is designed and synthesized. It can not only self&#8208;assemble into nanoscale helices with inversion of CPL signals and enhancement of CPL properties, but also co&#8208;assemble with anthracene via its outer &#960;&#8208;surface to form a macrocycle&#8208;based charge transfer (CT) complex exhibiting CT&#8208;CPL emission.







Abstract
Here, we report the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of a novel chiral 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;naphthalenediimide&#8208;based triangular macrocycle (NDI&#8208;&#916;) and its chiroptical properties. The enantiomeric NDI&#8208;&#916; is synthesized by condensation of (RR) or (SS)&#8208;trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine and 2,3,6,7&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylic 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;dianhydride, in which the chirality of the macrocycles is controlled by the diamine. With the rigid outer &#960;&#8208;surface, the macrocycle exhibits unique chiroptical properties and self&#8208;assembly modes. The NDI&#8208;&#916; shows circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in solution and can self&#8208;assemble into helical structures with the inversion of CPL signal and the enhancement of |glum|. Moreover, the NDI&#8208;&#916; has a tailored electron&#8208;deficient outer &#960;&#8208;surface, which can co&#8208;assemble with an electron&#8208;rich anthracene (AN) to form an intermolecular charge transfer (CT) complex, generating a yellow&#8208;green CT&#8208;CPL.

         <title>Red Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining lignin with Upy, results in a red RTP material (Lig&#8208;Upy) with emission centered at 625&#8197;nm and a lifetime of 24.2&#8197;ms. Materials exhibiting time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent colors could be prepared using the multiple hydrogen bonding interactions within Lig&#8208;Upy when embedded into different polymer matrices.







Abstract
Materials with red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) derived from sustainable resources are crucial but rarely reported. Here, we produced red RTP materials from lignin. Lignin was covalently modified with Upy (1&#8208;(6&#8208;isocyanatohexyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) urea) to obtain Lig&#8208;Upy. The Upy in the Lig&#8208;Upy promoted the interaction between the aromatic units of lignin and reduced energy gaps of these molecules. As a result, Lig&#8208;Upy exhibited red RTP centered at 625&#8197;nm with a lifetime of 24.2&#8197;ms. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding interactions in Lig&#8208;Upy varied when embedded into different matrices, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or sodium montmorillonite (MTM), inducing a change in RTP wavelength and lifetime. Utilizing these properties, Lig&#8208;Upy was used as building blocks for producing materials exhibiting time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent colors (TDPCs). Such TDPCs materials have exhibited great potential for visual decorations, information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting logos for medicine bottles.

         <title>High&#8208;Nuclearity Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks were constructed from giant {W58} and {W64} via controlled stepwise assembly from {W48} precursor, and the nanosheets derived from exfoliation of 2D layer&#8208;like {W64}&#8208;based MOF exhibited much enhanced activity towards photocatalytic oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond.







Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate (POM) clusters are attractive building blocks (BBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their high connectivity and inherently multiple metal centers as functional sites. This work demonstrates a strategy of step&#8208;wise growth on ring&#8208;shaped [P8W48O184]40&#8722; precursor, which produced two new high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxotungstates, a half&#8208;closed [H16P8W58O218]32&#8722; {W58} and a fully&#8208;closed [H16P8W64O236]32&#8722; {W64}. By in situ synthesis, unique MOFs of copper triazole&#8208;benzoic acid (HL) complexes incorporating the negatively&#8208;charged {W58} and {W64} as nodes, {Cu11(HL)9W58} HNPOMOF&#8208;1 and {Cu9(HL)9W64} HNPOMOF&#8208;2, were constructed by delicately tuning the reaction conditions, mainly solution pH, which controls the formation of {W58} and {W64}, and at the same time the protonation of triazole&#8208;benzoic acid ligand thus its coordination mode to copper ion that creates the highest nuclearity POM&#8208;derived MOFs reported to date. HNPOMOF&#8208;1 features 3D framework possessing cage&#8208;like cavities filled with exposed carboxyl groups, while the inherent 2D layer&#8208;like HNPOMOF&#8208;2 allows for facile exfoliation into ultrathin nanosheets, and the resulted HNPOMOF&#8208;2NS exhibits superior activity towards photocatalytic oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C bond for a series of lignin models. This work not only provides a strategy to build high&#8208;nuclearity POM cluster&#8208;based frameworks, but also demonstrates their great potential as functional materials for green catalysis.

         <title>Chiral Pd2L4 Capsules from Readily Accessible Tr&#246;ger's Base Ligands Inducing Circular Dichroism on Fullerenes C60 and C70</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Pd2L4 capsule based on Tr&#246;ger's base is reported and shown to bind several polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). It shows strong affinity for fullerenes C70 and C60 and is able to extract the latter from complex mixtures. Host&#8208;to&#8208;guest chirality transfer onto the fullerenes is observed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and theoretically analyzed by sTDA time&#8208;dependent DFT methods.







Abstract
The induction of chirality on pristine fullerenes through non&#8208;covalent embedding in an asymmetric nano&#8208;confinement has only been rarely reported. Bringing molecules with such a unique electronic structure and broad application range into a chiral environment is particularly appealing for the development of chiroptical materials, enantioselective photoredox catalysts and systems showing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this study, we report the formation of a chiral, configurationally stable Pd2L4 capsule assembled from a C2&#8208;symmetric, &#8216;ribbon&#8208;shaped&#8217; ligand with a Tr&#246;ger's base naphthalimide (TbNaps) backbone, easily synthesized in three steps from commercially available compounds. Embedding chirality directly into the ligand backbone ensures a relatively lightweight receptor design whose aromatic panels create a strongly shielded inner cavity of about 700&#8197;&#197;3 volume. Fullerenes C60 and C70, as well as a pair of corannulenes, can be bound in acetonitrile (where unsubstituted fullerenes are insoluble) and X&#8208;ray structures of host&#8208;guest complexes were obtained.

     alt="Chiral Pd2L4 Capsules from Readily Accessible Tr&#246;ger's Base Ligands Inducing Circular Dichroism on Fullerenes C60 and C70"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; capsule based on Tr&#246;ger's base is reported and shown to bind several polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). It shows strong affinity for fullerenes C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and is able to extract the latter from complex mixtures. Host-to-guest chirality transfer onto the fullerenes is observed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and theoretically analyzed by sTDA time-dependent DFT methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The induction of chirality on pristine fullerenes through non-covalent embedding in an asymmetric nano-confinement has only been rarely reported. Bringing molecules with such a unique electronic structure and broad application range into a chiral environment is particularly appealing for the development of chiroptical materials, enantioselective photoredox catalysts and systems showing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this study, we report the formation of a chiral, configurationally stable Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; capsule assembled from a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric, &#8216;ribbon-shaped&#8217; ligand with a Tr&#246;ger's base naphthalimide (TbNaps) backbone, easily synthesized in three steps from commercially available compounds. Embedding chirality directly into the ligand backbone ensures a relatively lightweight receptor design whose aromatic panels create a strongly shielded inner cavity of about 700&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; volume. Fullerenes C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as a pair of corannulenes, can be bound in acetonitrile (where unsubstituted fullerenes are insoluble) and X-ray structures of host-guest complexes were obtained. Tight interactions between the chiral host and the fullerene guests leads to the induction of a circular dichroism (CD) on the characteristic absorption bands of the forbidden &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transitions of the fullerenes, backed up by sTDA TD-DFT calculations and detailed investigation of the electronic excited states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Electroreduction of CO2 to CO over Ultrawide Potential Window via Implanting Active Site with Long&#8208;Range P Regulation on Periodic Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implanting bismuth atomic site with long&#8208;range P regulation on an ordered macroporous carbon skeleton with mesoporous &#8220;wall&#8221; is able to establish an electronic transport bridge for the activation of CO2 and an unblocked channel for the delivery of CO, thus enabling a high&#8208;efficiency electroreduction of CO2 to CO over ultrawide potential window.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to CO represents a highly promising way for artificial carbon cycling, but obtaining high selectivity over a wide potential window remains a challenge due to the sluggish CO generation and diffusion kinetics. Here we report an integration of long&#8208;range P modified bismuth atomic site on an ordered macroporous carbon skeleton with mesoporous &#8220;wall&#8221; (MW&#8208;BiN3&#8208;POMC) for efficient electroreduction of CO2. In&#8208;depth in situ investigations with theoretical computations reveal that the incorporation of long&#8208;range P atom is able to strengthen the orbital interaction between the C 2p of CO2 and Bi 6p, thereby establishing an electronic transport bridge for the activation of CO2 molecule. Additionally, the ordered macropore with mesoporous wall effectively facilitates the diffusion of CO. As a result, MW&#8208;BiN3&#8208;POMC exhibits an ultrawide potential window of 1000&#8197;mV for high CO selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;%) and a maximal CO partial current density of 414&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, MW&#8208;BiN3&#8208;POMC can also be employed as the cathode to integrate the solar&#8208;driven electrolytic cell (anode of Co3O4&#8208;OMC) toward CO2 reduction coupled with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation to simultaneously yield CO and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid.

         <title>Synergistic Pathways in PLA Breakdown and PTMC Formation: A One&#8208;Pot Eutectic&#8208;Driven Recycling Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PLA is efficiently depolymerized in a one&#8208;pot process. LA formed during degradation creates an eutectic mixture with TMC, enabling milder recycling conditions without extensive drying. The 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;phenolate of potassium catalyzes selective depolymerization, followed by TMC polymerization, yielding lactic acid end&#8208;capped PTMC with high efficiency.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel one&#8208;pot strategy for the chemical valorization of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), coupling its base&#8208;catalyzed depolymerization with the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of trimethylene carbonate (TMC). The process exploits an eutectic mixture of lactide (LA) and TMC, which lowers the thermal input required for PLA degradation. Using potassium aryloxide (KOArtBu) as a bifunctional catalyst, the PLA is first quickly hydrolyzed into oligomers or lactic acid, which subsequently initiate the slower polymerization of TMC. Notably, this transformation operates in the presence of residual water, eliminating the need for tedious drying steps. The method achieves selective PLA breakdown conversion and produces (oligo)lactic acid end&#8208;capped poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) with tunable molar mass, depending on water content.

         <title>High&#8208;Valent Cobalt&#8208;Difluoride in Oxidative Fluorination of Saturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyamine&#8208;supported CoII complexes catalyzed the oxidative fluorination of saturated hydrocarbons, in some instances selectively, when combined with Selectfluor and CsF, producing fluorinated products in near&#8208;quantitative yields. Mechanistic analysis supported the involvement of a CoIV&#8208;(F)2 oxidant in C&#8722;H activation and a CoIII&#8722;F F&#8208;atom donor for radical rebound.







Abstract
The heme paradigm where Fe=O acts as the C&#8722;H oxidant and Fe&#8722;OH rebounds with the formed carbon&#8208;centered radical guides the design of the prototypical synthetic hydroxylation catalyst. We are exploring methods to evolve beyond the metal&#8208;oxo oxidant and hydroxide rebound, to incorporate a wider array of functional group. We have demonstrated the application of CoII(OTf)2 (10&#8197;mol% catalyst; OTf=trimfluoromethanesulfonate) in combination with polydentate N&#8208;donor ligands (e.&#8201;g. BPMEN=N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) and Selectfluor in the oxidative fluorination of saturated hydrocarbons in high yields. The addition of CsF to the reaction mixture induced near&#8208;quantitative yields of fluorinated saturated hydrocarbons (&gt;90&#8201;% yield of fluorinated product). For 1&#8208;hydroxy, 1&#8208;acetyl, 1&#8208;carboxy&#8208;, and 1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;adamantane, we demonstrated selective fluorination at the 3&#8208;position. We propose two mechanisms for the CoII&#8208;catalyzed reaction: either (i)&#8197;an N&#8208;radical, derived from Selectfluor, acted as the C&#8722;H oxidant followed by radical rebound with CoIII&#8722;F; or (ii)&#8197;a CoIV&#8722;(F)2 species was the C&#8722;H oxidant followed by radical rebound with CoIII&#8722;F. Our combined spectroscopic, kinetic, and chemical trapping evidence suggested that an N&#8208;radical was not the active oxidant. We concluded that a CoIV&#8722;(F)2 species was the likely active oxidant and CoIII&#8722;F was the likely F&#8208;atom donor to a carbon centered radical producing a C&#8722;F bond.

         <title>4D Printing of Liquid Crystal Emulsions for Smart Structures with Multiple Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel 4D printing approach using digital light processing (DLP) to fabricate complex, multifunctional 3D structures from liquid crystal (LC) emulsions. This method preserves LC ordering, imparting tunable shape memory, light responsiveness, and porosity. The addition of chiral nematic LCs enables adjustable reflective properties, offering potential for applications in adaptive optics, robotics, and photonics.







Abstract
3D printing, and more recently 4D printing, has emerged as a transformative technology for fabricating structures with complex geometries and responsive properties. However, employing functional colloidal solutions as inks for printing remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel and versatile 4D printing approach for fabricating functional and complex&#8208;shaped objects using polymerizable liquid crystal (LC) emulsion droplets. Leveraging a digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technique, we achieve rapid production of intricate 3D geometries with high resolution. The printed structures retain the LC ordering from the precursor droplets, imparting the final objects with shape memory properties, including shape fixation and recovery upon heating or light exposure.

&lt;p&gt;We present a novel 4D printing approach using digital light processing (DLP) to fabricate complex, multifunctional 3D structures from liquid crystal (LC) emulsions. This method preserves LC ordering, imparting tunable shape memory, light responsiveness, and porosity. The addition of chiral nematic LCs enables adjustable reflective properties, offering potential for applications in adaptive optics, robotics, and photonics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D printing, and more recently 4D printing, has emerged as a transformative technology for fabricating structures with complex geometries and responsive properties. However, employing functional colloidal solutions as inks for printing remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel and versatile 4D printing approach for fabricating functional and complex-shaped objects using polymerizable liquid crystal (LC) emulsion droplets. Leveraging a digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technique, we achieve rapid production of intricate 3D geometries with high resolution. The printed structures retain the LC ordering from the precursor droplets, imparting the final objects with shape memory properties, including shape fixation and recovery upon heating or light exposure. Light-responsive behavior is introduced post-printing by embedding an azo dye into the 3D structures. Additionally, we explore the potential to create intrinsically porous 3D structures by selectively removing non-reactive components from the printed geometries, adding an extra level of functionality to the printed objects. Furthermore, we incorporate chiral nematic LCs into the emulsion droplets, producing 3D objects with tunable reflective properties. To our knowledge, this is the first example of DLP 3D printing with emulsions, offering an effective and versatile pathway for developing 4D-printed materials with potential applications in optics, robotics, microfluidics, and biomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe2 and Ni Sites for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ternary&#8208;atom catalyst Fe2/Ni&#8722;N&#8722;HCMs composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (Fe2&#8722;N6 and Ni&#8722;N4) coordinated onto hollow N&#8208;doped carbon microspheres is synthesized by a simple process. Because of the synergistic effects of the two groups, the catalysts electrocatalyze the oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions effectively through a dual&#8208;site mechanism, promoting direct O&#8722;O radical breakage without going through *OOH intermediates, enabling a zinc&#8208;air battery to perform superbly.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of renewable fuel cells and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, a new ternary&#8208;atom catalyst that is composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (as Fe2&#8722;N6 and Ni&#8722;N4) coordinated onto hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon microspheres is developed. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst exhibits remarkable activities toward both the ORR and OER in alkaline media, with superior performances to those of the control materials that contain only Fe2&#8722;N6 or Ni&#8722;N4 sites. Density functional theory calculations and in&#8197;situ infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies clearly reveal that the Fe2&#8722;N6 centers are the active sites for both ORR and OER, and their electrocatalytic activities are synergistically enhanced through optimization of their d&#8208;band centers by the Ni&#8722;N4 sites. This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst can potentially be a promising, alternative, sustainable catalyst to commercially used Pt&#8208; and Ru&#8208;based catalysts to drive both the ORR and the OER in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries and other related applications.

         <title>Discovering Cell&#8208;Targeting Ligands and Cell&#8208;Surface Receptors by Selection of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries against Cancer Cells without Predefined Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unbiased DEL selection method against cancer cells without predefined targets has been developed. Small&#8208;molecule ligands targeting aggressive cancer cells have been identified and applied in targeted delivery applications, including cancer photodynamic therapy and drug delivery. It is shown that DELs can be a useful tool to identify specific surface receptors on cancer cells.







Abstract
Small molecules that can bind to specific cells have broad application in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Screening large chemical libraries against live cells is an effective strategy for discovering cell&#8208;targeting ligands. The DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL or DECL) technology has emerged as a robust tool in drug discovery and has been successfully utilized in identifying ligands for biological targets. However, nearly all DEL selections have predefined targets, while target&#8208;agnostic DEL selections interrogating the entire cell surface remain underexplored. Herein, we systematically optimized a cell&#8208;based DEL selection method against cancer cells without predefined targets. A 104.96&#8208;million&#8208;member DEL was selected against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells, representing high and low metastatic properties, respectively, which led to the identification of cell&#8208;specific small molecules. We further demonstrated cell&#8208;targeting applications of these ligands in cancer photodynamic therapy and targeted drug delivery. Finally, leveraging the DNA tag of DEL compounds, we identified &#945;&#8208;enolase (ENO1) as the cell surface receptor of one of the ligands targeting the more aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells. Overall, this work offers an efficient approach for discovering cell&#8208;targeting small molecule ligands by using DELs and demonstrates that DELs can be a useful tool to identify specific surface receptors on cancer cells.

         <title>In situ Polymerization Induced Seed&#8208;Root Anchoring Structure for Enhancing Stability and Efficiency in Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells, we used thiol&#8208;functionalized particles as a &#8220;seed&#8221; for in situ polymerization of 2,2,3,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobutyl methacrylate as a &#8220;root&#8221; at the bottom of the perovskite layer. This design prevents void formation under high temperatures and vacuum, enhancing the operational stability of perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
The escape of organic cations over time from defective perovskite interface leads to non&#8208;stoichiometric terminals, significantly affecting the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). How to stabilize the interface composition under environmental stress remains a grand challenge. To address this issue, we utilize thiol&#8208;functionalized particles as a &#8220;seed&#8221; and conduct in situ polymerization of 2,2,3,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobutyl methacrylate (HFMA) as a &#8220;root&#8221; at the bottom of the perovskite layer. In this process, the thiol group acts as the initiation site for the polymerization of HFMA, while the fluorine groups in HFMA firmly anchor the organic cations of the perovskite through multiple hydrogen bonds. This strategy resembles how seeds take root in soil to prevent soil erosion. This bionic seed&#8208;rooting structure effectively stabilizes the stoichiometry of the perovskite, thus suppressing the escape of organic cations. As a result, the perovskite films with seed&#8208;rooting structures exhibit enhanced stability under harsh vacuum thermal conditions (150&#8201;&#176;C, &lt;10&#8197;Pa). The resulting PCS achieves an efficiency of 25.64&#8201;% and a 22.4&#8197;cm2 module efficiency of 22.61&#8201;%. After 1300&#8197;hours of 1&#8208;sun illumination at 85&#8201;% relative humidity and 65&#8201;&#176;C (ISOS&#8722;L&#8208;3 protocol), the perovskite solar module maintains 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency.

         <title>Photoswitchable Topological Regulation of Covalent Macrocycles, Molecular Recognition, and Interlocked Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic macrocycles are distinguished by their reversible and adaptable formation, and potential topological transformation. A concept of photoswitchable topological regulation of dynamic macrocycles was developed and used to modulate molecular recognition and the formation of various mechanically interlocked molecules, including rotaxanes and catenanes, offering a versatile platform for complex structures and functions.







Abstract
Macrocycles represent one important class of functional molecules, and dynamic macrocycles with the potential of cleavability, adaptability, and topological conversion are challenging. Herein we report photoswitchable allosteric and topological control of dynamic covalent macrocycles and further the use in guest binding and mechanically interlocked molecules. The manipulation of competing ring&#8208;chain equilibria and bond formation/scission within reaction systems enabled light&#8208;induced structural regulation over dithioacetal and thioacetal dynamic bonds, accordingly realizing bidirectional switching between crown ether&#8208;like covalent macrocycles and their linear counterparts. The on&#8208;demand photoswitchable topological transformation of macrocycles further allowed guest recognition/release exhibiting controllable binding affinity and selectivity. To showcase the capability light&#8208;triggered assembly/disassembly of diverse mechanically interlocked structures, such as rotaxanes and catenanes, was achieved. The realization of photoswitchable topological conversion of covalent macrocycles, which has been rarely reported before, demonstrates the potential of light&#8208;triggered reactivity control and structural reconfiguration for enhanced complexity and sophisticated function. The strategies and results should be appealing to endeavors in molecular recognition, dynamic assemblies, molecular machines, and intelligent materials.

&lt;p&gt;Macrocycles represent one important class of functional molecules, and dynamic macrocycles with the potential of cleavability, adaptability, and topological conversion are challenging. Herein we report photoswitchable allosteric and topological control of dynamic covalent macrocycles and further the use in guest binding and mechanically interlocked molecules. The manipulation of competing ring-chain equilibria and bond formation/scission within reaction systems enabled light-induced structural regulation over dithioacetal and thioacetal dynamic bonds, accordingly realizing bidirectional switching between crown ether-like covalent macrocycles and their linear counterparts. The on-demand photoswitchable topological transformation of macrocycles further allowed guest recognition/release exhibiting controllable binding affinity and selectivity. To showcase the capability light-triggered assembly/disassembly of diverse mechanically interlocked structures, such as rotaxanes and catenanes, was achieved. The realization of photoswitchable topological conversion of covalent macrocycles, which has been rarely reported before, demonstrates the potential of light-triggered reactivity control and structural reconfiguration for enhanced complexity and sophisticated function. The strategies and results should be appealing to endeavors in molecular recognition, dynamic assemblies, molecular machines, and intelligent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Anions Suppress Hydrogen Generation in Electrochemical CO Reduction on Cu</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the role of halide anions in Cu catalyzed electrochemical CO reduction (eCOR). Our findings show that anions suppress the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By pairing our experimental results with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we propose a model wherein anions modulate the interplay between adsorbed CO* and H* at the catalyst surface, controlling the outcome of the CO reduction reaction.







Abstract
In this study, we employed electrochemical&#8208;mass spectrometry (EC&#8208;MS) to elucidate the role of halide anions in electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction. We found that the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was significantly suppressed by the anion used. Specifically, the rates of H2 production decreased in the order KF &gt; KCl &gt; KI, meaning that I&#8722; most strongly suppressed HER. Interestingly, CO reduction products showed an inverse relationship to HER, with KI leading to the highest rate of CO reduction. By pairing our experimental findings with classical molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism wherein halide anions influence the dynamic interplay between CO reduction and HER by modulating the competition of H* and CO* for active sites on the Cu surface. We propose that this interaction is enabled by the interfacial concentration of K+ being greater in the presence of F&#8722; than in I&#8722;. Our results highlight the need to more broadly consider the properties of ions at electrocatalytic interfaces and they point to thus far underappreciated avenues to optimize hydrocarbon production while suppressing hydrogen evolution.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Tiered Golf Anode towards Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8722;Mn Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly conductive and three&#8208;tiered golf anode was developed to simultaneously enhance the reversibility of Zn and Mn metals. The experiment characterizations and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the three&#8208;tiered golf anode is achieved by inner zinc powder, intermediate carbon and outer bismuth layer, which can effectively enhance the Gibbs free energy and mitigate the volume change of the anode.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs) are widely recognized as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of ZMABs is hindered by inherent electrical contact loss, hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth on traditional anodes. Here, a three&#8208;tiered golf anode with high conductivity is developed to simultaneously enhance the reversibility of Zn and Mn metals. The three&#8208;tiered golf anode is achieved by inner zinc powder, intermediate carbon and outer bismuth layer, which can effectively enhance the Gibbs free energy and mitigate the volume change of the anode, thus enabling stable Zn&#8722;Mn cycling. As a proof of concept, Zn&#8722;Mn full cells (coupled to CNT@MnO2) achieve an ultralong cycle life with 94.6&#8201;% capacity retention at 2&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 16,000&#8197;cycles. This study presents valuable insights into the structural design of anodes aimed at enhancing the stability and durability of ZMABs.

         <title>Highly Durable Rh Single Atom Catalyst Modulated by Surface Defects on Fe&#8208;Ce Oxide Solid Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh single atom catalysts were prepared by anchoring Rh atoms on the defect sites of Fe&#8722;Ce oxide solid solution. Upon reduction at 500&#8201;&#176;C, the Rh single atom catalyst with oxygen&#8208;deficient coordination presented high activity and durability for selective catalytic reduction of NO with CO. Rh single atoms with oxygen&#8208;rich coordination suffered from surface poisoning more.







Abstract
Forming defect sites on catalyst supports and immobilizing precious metal atoms at these sites offers an efficient approach for preparing single&#8208;atom catalysts. In this study, we employed an Fe&#8722;Ce oxide solid solution (FC), which has surface oxygen that reduces more readily than that of ceria, to anchor Rh single atoms (Rh1). When utilized in the selective catalytic reduction of NO with CO (CO&#8208;SCR), Rh1/FC reduced at 500&#8201;&#176;C&#8212;characterized by less oxidic Rh state induced by an oxygen&#8208;deficient coordination&#8212;exhibited superior activity and durability compared to Rh1/ceria and Rh1/FC reduced at 300&#8201;&#176;C. This Rh single&#8208;atom structure was sustained after 100&#8197;hours of CO&#8208;SCR at 400&#8201;&#176;C. Reaction intermediates formed on the catalyst surface were analyzed using in&#8197;situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) under NO and CO flow conditions. Additionally, the catalyst structure and the CO&#8208;SCR reaction mechanism were investigated using density functional theory (DFT). While Rh atoms located near surface Fe sites were found to be thermodynamically most stable, both NO and CO preferentially adsorbed on Rh sites. Fe plays a role in stabilizing Rh sites and facilitating oxygen transfer. This work provides valuable insights into the design of highly active and durable single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of Iron(IV) Alkynylide Complexes and Their Reactivity to Form 1,3&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;electron oxidation of alkynylferrates(III) enables the synthesis of the corresponding high&#8208;valent Fe(IV) alkynylides. These organoiron complexes have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies and theoretical calculations (DFT and CASSCF). The isolated Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes react at room temperature to form 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
The isolation of thermally unstable and highly reactive organoiron(IV) complexes is a challenge for synthetic chemists. In particular, the number of examples where the C&#8208;based ligand is not part of the chelating ligand remains scarce. These compounds are of interest because they could pave the way to designing catalytic cycles of bond forming reactions proceeding via organoiron(IV) intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, of a family of alkynylferrates(III) and Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes. The alkynylferrates(III) are formed by transmetalation of the Fe(III) precursor [(N3N&#8217;)FeIII] (N3N&#8217;3&#8722; is tris(N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl&#8208;2&#8208;amidoethyl)amine) with lithium alkynylides, and their further one&#8208;electron oxidation enables the synthesis of the corresponding Fe(IV) alkynylides. The electronic structure of this family of organometallic Fe(III) and Fe(IV) complexes has been thoroughly investigated by spectroscopic methods (EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies) and theoretical calculations. While alkynylferrates(III) are sluggish to engage into C&#8722;C bond forming processes, the Fe(IV) alkynylides react to afford 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature. A bimolecular reductive elimination from a bimetallic Fe(IV) intermediate to form the 1,3&#8208;diynes is proposed based on the mechanistic investigations performed.

         <title>Employing Octahedral Net Charge Descriptors for Designing High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the octahedral net charge descriptor to design high&#8208;performance aqueous MXene proton batteries. By influencing electron transfer and distribution, this descriptor correlates well with HER, capacity and proton transfer processes. This research provides a theoretical foundation for optimizing MXene electrodes in sustainable energy storage.







Abstract
Recently, aqueous proton batteries have shown promise for electrochemical energy storage using MXene electrodes. However, designing high&#8208;performance MXene proton batteries remains challenging due to the inevitable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the vast chemical composition space of MXene, and the unclear proton transport mechanism. To tackle these challenges, we established a general descriptor based on structural units of MXenes, termed the octahedral net charge descriptor (Qoct). This descriptor correlates well with HER activity, capacity, and proton transport performance. Based on the descriptor, prediction reveals a dual&#8208;proton storage mechanism per site in N&#8208;functionalized MXene. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the descriptor is verified across a broader MXene chemical space. Additionally, the kinetic process shows the topological transformation energy barrier of the interfacial solution is profoundly influenced by Qoct, thereby impacting the proton transfer performance. This universal descriptor originates from the different electron filling states on the molecular orbitals of the octahedron. Overall, this work provides an efficient strategy for designing MXene proton batteries and can be extended to other battery and catalysis fields.

         <title>Initiator&#8208;Free Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Photo Polycondensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo polymerizations are normally promoted by a photo&#8208;catalyst and few cases create degradable chemical bonds. The polycondensation between aldehyde monomers and polymercaptans was discovered to proceed well under direct photo irradiation without a catalyst, producing linear polymers and hydrolytic&#8208;resistant dynamic networks, which undergo cation&#8208;triggered rapid degradation to recover the aldehyde monomers.







Abstract
Traditional photopolymerizations generally require an initiator for initiating the polymerization while few cases have created degradable chemical bonds. Moreover, the migration instability and cytotoxicity of photo initiators are posing issues to human health and the environment. In this work, we discovered an initiator&#8208;free photo polycondensation system (IFPPC) between polymercaptans and aldehyde monomers, producing elastic and high strength plastic materials with exchangeable and degradable dithioacetal groups. IFPPC proceeds through a radical mechanism and is applicable in producing linear polymers and crosslinked networks. Nano&#8208;composites can also be obtained via an organic solvent&#8208;free Pickering emulsion polymerization using cellulose nanofibers as the stabilizer. The dithioacetal groups afford excellent stability under hydrolytic conditions and repeated thermal processing of cross&#8208;linked polymers, while their cleavage in aqueous solution of salts (silver nitrate, zinc iodide, copper bromide, etc.) results in fast degradation for recovering the aldehyde monomer. This is a successful demonstration of producing recyclable and degradable plastics through photo irradiation while avoiding the problematic issues of photo initiators.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Topology&#8208;Controlled BODIPY and CO2&#8208;Based Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first successful direct synthesis of topology&#8208;controlled BODIPY&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOFs with distinct fcu and hcp topologies, utilizing CO2 as a feedstock. Both materials exhibited excellent crystallinity and demonstrated suitable photocatalytic redox potentials for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO, using H2O as the electron donor, achieving the high CO yields up to 16.72&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity.







Abstract
Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based zirconium metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) possess strong light&#8208;harvesting capabilities and great potential for artificial photosynthesis without the use of sacrificial reagents. However, their direct preparation has not yet been achieved due to challenges in synthesizing suitable ligands. Herein, we reported the first successful direct synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOFs, utilizing CO2 as a feedstock. By controlling synthetic conditions, we successfully obtained two distinct Zr&#8208;MOFs. The first, CO2&#8208;Zr6&#8208;DEPB, exhibits a face&#8208;centered cubic (fcu) topology based on a Zr6(&#956;3&#8208;O)4(&#956;3&#8208;OH)4 node, while the second, CO2&#8208;Zr12&#8208;DEPB, features a hexagonal closed packed (hcp) topology, structured around a Zr12(&#956;3&#8208;O)8(&#956;3&#8208;OH)8(&#956;2&#8208;OH)6 node. Both MOFs demonstrated excellent crystallinity, as verified through powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses. These MOF catalysts displayed suitable photocatalytic redox potentials for the reduction of CO2 to CO using H2O as the electron donor in the absence of co&#8208;catalyst or toxic sacrificial reagent. Under light irradiation, CO2&#8208;Zr12&#8208;DEPB and CO2&#8208;Zr6&#8208;DEPB offered high CO yields of 16.72 and 13.91&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity. CO2 uptake and photoelectrochemical experiments revealed key insights into the mechanisms driving the different catalytic activities of the two MOFs. These BODIPY and CO2&#8208;based, light&#8208;responsive Zr&#8208;MOFs represent a promising platform for the development of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Preparation of High&#8208;Crystalline Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Triazine Frameworks via Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular confined Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction strategy is developed to achieve rapid and kilogram&#8208;scale preparation of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with tailorable functionality for the first time. The obtained functionalized CTFs exhibited excellent aqueous dispersibility and micropollutant removal efficiency as well as superior solution processability.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction has been extensively applied to the preparation of various porous organic polymers because of its simple operation and abundant building blocks. However, due to its poor reversibility and excessive random reactive sites, the synthesis of crystalline organic polymers/frameworks by Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction has never been realized so far. Herein, we develop a molecular confined Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction strategy to achieve rapid preparation (within only 30 minutes) of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with tailorable functionality for the first time. Theoretical calculations and detailed experiments revealed the critical role of carboxyl groups in aromatic benzene monomer during the CTFs crystallization, which can not only effectively cause a suitable activation barrier for the electrophilic attack of 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine through their electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, but also introduce anchoring effects (molecular confinement effects) to facilitate the ordered polymerization at specific sites in 2D planar direction. Benefiting from the convenient synthetic route and low&#8208;cost raw materials, we could unprecedentedly realize the kilogram&#8208;scale fabrication of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized high&#8208;crystalline CTFs. Moreover, thanks to the hydrophilic and ionizable properties of carboxyl groups, the obtained functionalized CTFs exhibited excellent aqueous dispersibility and superior solution processability.

         <title>Heterocoupling Two Similar Benzyl Radicals by Dual Photoredox/Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective catalytic synthesis method comprising dual photoredox and cobalt catalysis is established for heterocoupling two similar benzyl radicals from abundant methylarenes and benzyl NHPI esters. The results showed successful 1&#176;&#8211;1&#176;, 1&#176;&#8211;2&#176;, 1&#176;&#8211;3&#176;, 2&#176;&#8211;2&#176;, 2&#176;&#8211;3&#176; and 3&#176;&#8211;3&#176; benzyl couplings, benzylation of drug structure&#8208;containing molecules, scale&#8208;up experiments, continuous photochemical flow synthesis, and a one&#8208;pot procedure.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;regulated radical cross coupling enables the selective bonding of two distinct transient radicals, whereas the catalytic method for sorting two almost identical transient radicals, especially similar benzyl radicals, is still rare. Herein, we show that leveraging dual photoredox/cobalt catalysis can selectively couple two similar benzyl radicals. Using easily accessible methylarenes and phenylacetates (benzyl N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters) as benzyl radical sources, a range of unsymmetrical 1,2&#8208;diarylethane classes via the 1&#176;&#8211;1&#176;, 1&#176;&#8211;2&#176;, 1&#176;&#8211;3&#176;, 2&#176;&#8211;2&#176;, 2&#176;&#8211;3&#176; and 3&#176;&#8211;3&#176; couplings were obtained with broad functional group tolerance. Besides the photochemical continuous flow synthesis, the one&#8208;pot procedure that directly uses phenylacetic acids and NHPI as the starting materials to avoid the pre&#8208;preparation of benzyl NHPI esters for the gram&#8208;scale synthesis is also feasible and affords good yields, showcasing the synthetic utility of our protocol.

         <title>Sequential Infiltration Synthesis of Cadmium Sulfide Discrete Atom Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) method to form cadmium sulfide discrete atom clusters within poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) polymer thin films. By alternating exposures to dimethyl cadmium and hydrogen sulfide, researchers synthesized cubane&#8208;type Cd4S4 core clusters. The clusters, capped with methyl, thiol, and hydroxy groups, were structurally validated through spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray scattering, and simulations. This SIS technique offers a new pathway for creating precisely structured materials with potential applications in light&#8208;absorbing technologies, including solar energy harvesting.







Abstract
Exposure of soft material templates to alternating volatile chemical precursors can produce inorganic deposition within the permeable template (e.g. a polymer thin film) in a process akin to atomic layer deposition (ALD). While such sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) processes have now been demonstrated for many metal oxides, we report an SIS process for a transition metal sulfide &#8211; CdS. Gas phase dimethyl cadmium and hydrogen sulfide precursors infiltrated into poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) thin films result in the 3D&#8208;nucleation of clusters consistent with a cubane&#8208;type Cd4S4 core that are variably terminated with methyl, thiol and hydroxy capping ligands. First principles models and simulation of few&#8208;atom Cd&#8208;based clusters are consistent with electronic and vibrational spectroscopy and grazing&#8208;incidence total X&#8208;ray scattering measurements of 3D&#8208;cluster&#8208;arrays synthesized at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The direct synthesis of few&#8208;atom transition metal sulfide clusters within polymer thin films will provide a versatile new route to precision architectures for light&#8208;absorbing materials including solar energy harvesting and conversion applications.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Strategy to Enhance Long&#8208;Range Order of Poly(Heptazine Imide) Nanorods for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(heptazine imide) nanorods with improved long&#8208;range order was prepared by a bottom&#8208;up strategy. The improvement of long&#8208;range order greatly enhances the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges as well as the adsorption for *CO intermediate, resulting in excellent activity for photocatalytic CO2 methanation.







Abstract
Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), one of the crystalline or long&#8208;range ordered allotropes of polymeric carbon nitride, is a promising polymeric photocatalyst; however, preparation of highly crystalline PHI remains a challenge. Herein, through a bottom&#8208;up strategy involving repair of structural defects and increase of specific surface area of melon precursor, we prepared PHI nanorods with dramatically improved long&#8208;range order. The resulting PHI exhibited a shift of product selectivity in CO2 photoreduction from CO to CH4 with a high methanation activity in contrast to the pristine PHI with relatively low long&#8208;range order. The improvement of long&#8208;range order for PHI remarkably enhanced the separation efficiency and transfer kinetics of photogenerated charges as well as the adsorption for *CO intermediate. This study revealed the relationship between the precursor structure and PHI crystal growth in ionothermal synthesis, and also showcased the great potential of highly crystalline PHI in artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Remote Carbon Monoxide Spillover Improves Tandem Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>

Palladium&#8208;gold alloys are paired with ruthenium dioxides to facilitate efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO* and NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2* conversions, respectively. The minimization of the work function difference between Pd2Au1 and RuO2 promotes the remote spillover of CO* from Pd2Au1 to RuO2, improving effective coupling with spatially isolated NH2* for urea production. As a result, a high&#8208;efficiency urea production efficiency was achieved at record&#8208;low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) offers a promising alternative to traditional industrial methods. However, current catalysts face limitations in the supplies of CO* and Nrelated* intermediates, and their coupling, resulting in unsatisfactory urea production efficiency and energy consumption. To overcome these challenges, we carried out tandem electrosynthesis approach using ruthenium dioxide&#8208;supported palladium&#8208;gold alloys (Pd2Au1/RuO2). This catalyst system effectively catalyzes CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO* conversion on Pd2Au1 and NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2* conversion on RuO2. Crucially, the minimized work function difference between two components promotes remote CO* spillover from Pd2Au1 to RuO2, improving effective coupling of CO* and NH2* for urea production. Our catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving a record&#8208;high Faradaic efficiency for urea (FEurea) of 75.6&#177;0.5&#8201;% and a urea production rate (rurea) of 73.5&#177;0.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Notably, this was accomplished with an ultralow energy consumption of 18.9&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgurea&#8722;1. We also successfully demonstrate the long&#8208;term stability of our catalyst in a flow cell, achieving over 160&#8197;h of uninterrupted urea and formate production with consistent profitability. This achievement represents a significant step towards the large&#8208;scale practical application of sustainable urea electrosynthesis.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Drug for the Self&#8208;Checking of Mitophagy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a innovative &#8220;one&#8208;two punch&#8221; drug design strategy, exemplified by the mitophagy self&#8208;check drug. This strategy integrates both target&#8208;zone drug functionality and non&#8208;target zone biological reporting into a single small&#8208;molecule drug, effectively addressing the challenges associated with conventional marker interference in drug evaluation.







Abstract
Mitophagy, particularly in the context of drugs that disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), represents a critical focus in pharmacology. However, the discovery and evaluation of MMP&#8208;disrupting drugs are often hampered using commercially available marker molecules that target similar or identical zones. These markers can significantly interfere with, obscure, or amplify the functional effects of MMP&#8208;targeting drugs, frequently leading to clinical failures. In response to this challenge, we propose a &#8220;one&#8208;two punch&#8221; drug design strategy that integrates both target&#8208;zone drug functionality and non&#8208;target zone biological reporting within a single small&#8208;molecule drug. We have developed a novel proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept mitophagy self&#8208;check drug (MitoSC) that exhibits dual&#8208;color and dual&#8208;localization properties. The functional component of this system is a variable MitoSC that disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) homeostasis, thereby inducing mitophagy. Upon activation, this component transforms into a blue&#8208;fluorescent monomer (MitoSC&#8208;fun) specifically within the mitochondrial target zone. Concurrently, the biological reporting component is represented by a red&#8208;fluorescent monomer (MitoSC&#8208;rep) that localizes to lysosomes, the non&#8208;target zone. As mitophagy progresses, the fluorescent signals from MitoSC&#8208;rep (lysosomes) and MitoSC&#8208;fun (mitochondria) converge, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of the mitophagic process. This strategy combines potent drug functionality with robust biological reporting, thereby minimizing interference and eliminating the complexities associated with external detection. Our findings underscore the potential of a single&#8208;molecule drug to exert target&#8208;zone specific actions while simultaneously providing non&#8208;target zone self&#8208;checking, offering a new perspective for drug design.

         <title>Supramolecular Rotor Assembly for the Design of a Hybrid Ferroelectric&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Multiferroic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first crown ether&#8208;based hybrid ferroelectric&#8208;antiferromagnetic multiferroic material with excellent X&#8208;ray radiation detection response was prepared by the self&#8208;assembly of a supramolecular rotor and a magnetic module. This study demonstrates the great advantages this approach in the design of multiferroic materials and provides a new avenue for developing ferroic functional materials.







Abstract
Ferroelectric (FE)&#8208;antiferromagnetic (AFM) multiferroic materials have sparked growing interest due to their huge possibilities in energy&#8208;saving, photoelectric devices, nonvolatile storage, and switches. However, realizing FE&#8208;AFM properties in a hybrid molecular material is difficult because ferroelectric and magnetic orders are commonly mutually exclusive. Here, we report an FE&#8208;AFM multiferroic semiconductor [NH4(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]2[Mn(SCN)4] (NCMS) by supramolecular assembly approach via molecular rotor synthon [NH4(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] and inorganic magnetic module [Mn(SCN)4]. Interestingly, NCMS shows good ferroelectricity with a spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 5.94&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 higher than most crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based ferroelectrics. Especially, the realization of antiferromagnetism is for the first time in the crown ether hybrid perovskite ferroic systems. Additionally, semiconductor NCMS displays an X&#8208;ray radiation detection response with a large photo/dark current on&#8208;off ratio (197). Our study not only gives a deep insight into understanding multiferroic properties but also provides a novel and efficient approach to realizing high&#8208;performance hybrid multiferroic materials.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;mediated Assembly of New Heterocycles: From Borylenes to Oxaboroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;stabilized rhodium borylene, generated by metal&#8208;ligand cooperative dehydrogenation of H2BMes (Mes=mesityl), regioselectively adds a series of alkynes (R=Ph, Me, H, CO2Et) across boron and the carbon atom of a CO ligand. Subsequent reaction with CO(g) releases a highly functionalized oxaborole.

         <title>Coaxial Helices in Chiral Supramolecular Aggregates from Highly Hindered Chiral Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular helical aggregates describing two coaxial helices rotating in the same or opposite direction are obtained from the self&#8208;assembly of chiral allenes. The internal helix is described by the allene stack, while the external one, a 4&#8208;helix, is described by the four allene substituents. The two coaxial helices can rotate in the same or opposite direction depending on the magnitude of the tilting degree between allenes along the supramolecular aggregate.







Abstract
Chiral allenes self&#8208;assembly following a cooperative mechanism into a supramolecular chiral aggregate consisting of two coaxial helices: the internal helix described by the allene stack and the external helix which consist in a 4&#8208;helix described by the four allene substituents. More precisely, this supramolecular aggregate possesses six axially chiral elements within its structure&#8212;the allene, the allene stack (internal helix) and the stacks of the four allene substituents (external 4&#8208;helix)&#8212;. Interestingly, slight variations in the magnitude of the tilting degree while keeping its P&#8208; or M&#8208; orientation (internal helix) can vary the orientation of the 4&#8208;axial motifs at the external helix. Thus, while (P)&#8208;1 produces a supramolecular helix with a &#920; ca. 15&#176; (Pint) and a M1/P2/M1&#8217;/P2&#8217; orientation of the four axial motifs at the periphery, (P)&#8208;2 produces a supramolecular helix with a &#920; ca. 23&#176; (Pint) and a P1/P2/P1&#8217;/P2&#8217; orientation of the four axial motifs at the external helix. As a result, the ECD spectra and the AFM images of the (P)&#8208;1 and (P)&#8208;2 supramolecular aggregates dominated by the 1 and 1&#8217; substituents of the chiral allene indicate opposite handedness although the chirality of the building block and the orientation of the allene stack are the same

Thus, while (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; produces a supramolecular helix with a &#920; ca. 15&#176; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;) and a &lt;i&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;1&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; orientation of the four axial motifs at the periphery, (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; produces a supramolecular helix with a &#920; ca. 23&#176; (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;) and a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;1&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;/sub&gt; orientation of the four axial motifs at the external helix. As a result, the ECD spectra and the AFM images of the (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; supramolecular aggregates dominated by the 1 and 1&#8217; substituents of the chiral allene indicate opposite handedness although the chirality of the building block and the orientation of the allene stack are the same&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable and Precise Synthesis of Structurally Colored Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: Enabling Refined Color Calibration for Sustainable Photonic Pigments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel, scalable, precise, and sustainable strategy for synthesizing structural colored bottlebrush block copolymers, effectively bridging the gap between laboratory research and practical applications. This approach may be extended to the synthesis of diverse block copolymers with various functions, opening up new possibilities across multiple fields, including supersoft elastomers, organic optoelectronics, photolithography, energy storage, and biomedical devices.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) offer a vibrant, eco&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional toxic pigments and dyes, providing vivid structural colors with significantly reduced environmental impact. Scaling up the synthesis of these polymers for practical applications has been challenging with conventional batch methods, which suffer from slow mass and heat transfer, inadequate mixing, and issues with reproducibility. Precise control over molecular weight and dispersity remains a significant challenge for achieving finely tuned color appearances. Here, we present an alternative strategy to overcome the challenges by integrating a rapid continuous flow technique with an in&#8208;line self&#8208;assembly procedure. This strategy enables the rapid, stable and large&#8208;scale synthesis of narrow&#8208;dispersed BBCPs, exceeding 2&#8197;kg/day, a significant improvement over conventional gram&#8208;scale methods. Furthermore, precise control over the degree of polymerization is achieved with an unprecedented interval accuracy of four repeat units. This level of precision enables refined color calibration in the resulting photonic pigments, effectively eliminating the need for labor&#8208;intensive and costly multiple batch syntheses.

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry to Probe Sequences in Supramolecular Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility &#8208; mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS) allows discrimination of isomers of a supramolecular copolymer based on their collision cross&#8208;section (CCS). Our study carried out with benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide co&#8208;assemblies opens the door to the identification and quantification of sequences in the field of supramolecular copolymers.







Abstract
The analysis of the microstructure of supramolecular copolymers is difficult because of their dynamic character. Here, benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) co&#8208;assemblies are analysed by ion mobility &#8211; mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS) to reveal the presence of various sequences. For example, the IM&#8211;MS mobilogram for hexamers composed of 4&#8197;units from a first monomer and 2&#8197;units from a second monomer is a broad distribution due to the presence of 9 possible isomeric sequences, which can be sorted out based on calculated collision cross&#8208;sections. This approach gives unprecedented information on supramolecular copolymer sequences.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Layer Pickering Emulsion: Molecular&#8208;Level Gating of Water Delivery at Water&#8208;Oil Interface for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogenation Using H2O as a Hydrogen Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the as&#8208;prepared MOF&#8208;CdS dual&#8208;layer Pickering emulsion, the molecularly regulated hydrophobicity of MOF layer acted as a gate to control the mass transfer (e.g., water delivery) at water&#8208;oil interface. Hence, the water&#8208;phase hydrogenation was effectively coupled with oil&#8208;phase photocatalytic HER. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, our work boosts the development of biphasic catalytic system and paves a novel avenue for tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Biphasic system not only presents a promising opportunity for complex catalytic processes, but also is a grand challenge in efficient tandem reactions. As an emerging solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and water&#8208;donating hydrogenation combines the sustainability of photocatalysis and economic&#8208;value of hydrogenation. However, the key and challenging point is to couple water&#8208;soluble photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with oil&#8208;soluble hydrogenation. Herein, we employed metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and CdS nanorods to construct a MOF&#8208;CdS dual&#8208;layer Pickering emulsion (water in oil, W/O), which compartmented aqueous phase for photocatalytic HER and oil phase for hydrogenation. The hydrophobic MOF and hydrophilic CdS were isolated at the inner and outer layers of W/O emulsion, respectively. The molecularly regulated hydrophobicity of MOF controlled the water delivery onto CdS photocatalysts, which realized the synergistic regulation of HER and hydrogenation. In the photocatalytic hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, the highest yield of MOF&#8208;CdS Pickering emulsion reached 187.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, 30&#8197;times that of the counterpart without emulsion (6.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1). Its apparent quantum yield reached 43.24&#8201;% without co&#8208;catalysts. To our knowledge, this performance is at a top&#8208;level so far. Our work realized the precise regulation of water&#8208;oil interface to effectively couple two reactions in different phases, providing new perspective for challenging tandem catalysis.

         <title>Anomalous Role of Carbon in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface carbonaceous species can frustrate ethylene adsorption on catalyst surfaces by confinement effect, thus facilitating its desorption as opposed to overhydrogenation to form undesired ethane. This mechanism for selectivity control is analogous to enzyme catalysis, where the active centers selectively attract reactants and release products. Similar mechanism might be present in CO/CO2 hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Carbonaceous species, including subsurface carbidic carbon and surface carbon, play crucial roles in heterogeneous catalysis. Many reports suggested the importance of subsurface carbon in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over Pd&#8208;based catalysts. However, the role of surface carbon has been largely overlooked. We demonstrate that subsurface carbon in Pd is not responsible for the selectivity in acetylene hydrogenation. In contrast, the structure of surface carbonaceous species plays a decisive role in hydrogenation selectivity. Electron microscopy and spectroscopy evidence, along with theoretical modelling, reveal that partial graphitization of surface carbonaceous species results in unique spatial confinement of surface reaction intermediates, thus altering the reaction energy landscape in favour of ethylene desorption as opposed to over&#8208;hydrogenation. This mechanism for selectivity control is analogous to enzyme catalysis, where the active centers selectively attract reactants and release products. Similar mechanism may be present in CO/CO2 hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Induced C&#8722;C Coupling for C2H4 Photosynthesis from Atmospheric&#8208;Concentration CO2 Reduction</title>

Loading highly active metal clusters on a semiconductor nanosheet can enable the introduced metal atom and the metal atom in substrate materials to construct the heteroatom pair sites. Having two different metal atoms on the interface as active sites may effectively accelerate C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4 for CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
Producing ethylene (C2H4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction under mild conditions is primarily restricted by the difficulty of C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we designed highly active metal atom clusters anchored on semiconductor nanosheets, which established heteroatom sites on the interface to steer C&#8722;C coupling, realizing air&#8208;concentration CO2 photoreduction into C2H4 in pure water. As an example, the Pd nanoclusters loaded on ZnO nanosheets are prepared, demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field image. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the C&#8722;C coupling step over the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets, while quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy illustrates the active sites of Pd and Zn atoms on the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets during CO2 photoreduction. Density functional theoretical calculations unveil the transition state energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling of CO* and COH* intermediates are only 0.998&#8197;eV, hinting the easy C&#8722;C coupling to produce C2 fuels. Therefore, the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets realize C2H4 photosynthesis by atmospheric&#8208;concentration CO2 reduction with the formation rate of 1.03&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, while the ZnO nanosheets only acquired the carbon monoxide product.

         <title>Conformationally Restricted Macrocycles as Improved FKBP51 Inhibitors Enabled by Systematic Linker Derivatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic linkerology: Linking two positions is the key step of macrocyclization, i.e. the transformation of &#8216;linear&#8217; protein ligands to macrocycles. Here we show that longer linkers can be remarkable flexible, with the same backbone giving rise to multiple series with distinct conformations and binding modes. Derivatization of these linkers is highly efficient to control conformations and to improve multiple drug&#8208;like properties in macrocycles.







Abstract
Macrocycles are increasingly considered as promising modalities to target challenging intracellular proteins. However, strategies for transitioning from active linear starting points to improved macrocycles are still underdeveloped. Here we explored the derivatization of linkers as an approach for macrocycle optimization. Using the FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) as a model system we prepared &gt;140 macrocycles with systematically derivatized linkers. Two backbones were identified as promising frameworks for subsequent optimization. Surprisingly, co&#8208;crystal structure analyses revealed that these chemical templates represent an ensemble of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) conformations that can give rise to several distinct 3D&#8208;scaffolds. This resulted in a set of macrocycles with consistently improved affinity, plasma stability, and aqueous solubility compared to the linear precursors or the non&#8208;functionalized macrocycles. Our results highlight linkers as an opportunity for macrocyclic drug development, show how linker derivatization can improve the performance of macrocycles, and emphasizes the need to track macrocyclic scaffold evolution at a three&#8208;dimensional level.

         <title>Conformational Plasticity and Binding Affinity Enhancement Controlled by Linker Derivatization in Macrocycles</title>

A link to success: Nature repeatedly used highly functionalized macrocycles to create sophisticated bioactive small molecules. Non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles are also emerging as drug modalities to tackle challenging, intracellular drug targets but guidelines for their design are still premature. Here we show how subtle linker modifications in macrocycles can refine and improve their conformational plasticity and their properties simultaneously.







Abstract
Macrocycles are abundantly used by nature to enable cell&#8208;permeable bioactive molecules. Synthetic non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles are also increasingly considered as modalities for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;bind proteins but guidelines for macrocyclization are only beginning to emerge. Macrocycles are thought to constrain the available conformations but also to allow for residual flexibility, the latter being poorly understood. Here we show that even medium&#8208;sized macrocycles display an unexpected high conformational plasticity, even when bound to their protein target. Minor modification of the linker region of macrocycles can shift the conformational ensemble to distinct conformational subclasses, each constituting distinct three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds for further optimization. This led to several new ligands with improved affinity and beneficial physicochemical parameters for the FK506&#8208;binding protein&#8197;51, a promising target for depression, obesity and chronic pain. Importantly, none of the beneficial modifications could have been identified by classical medicinal chemistry as they only work in the macrocyclic context.
Our results show that macrocyclization can do more than keeping loose ends together but rather provide a platform for multiple series of macrocycles with distinct binding modes.

         <title>Unconventional Interconnected High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanodendrites for Remarkably Efficient C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage toward Complete Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional PtIrRhCoFeNiCu high&#8208;entropy alloy nanodendrites are successfully designed and show excellent ethanol oxidation activity, long&#8208;term stability, resistance to CO poisoning and efficient C1 pathway. The combined effect of intrinsically active Pt, Fe/Co/Ni/Cu in synergy for OHads formation, and Ir/Rh for C&#8722;C bond scission serves to favor C1 pathway over sluggish C2 pathway.







Abstract
Developing ethanol oxidation electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity, durability, and resistance to CO poisoning remains a major challenge. In recent years, high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with unique physical and chemical properties have garnered substantial attention. Herein, a class of HEA nanodendrites are designed by a simple wet&#8208;chemical method. The mass activity and specific activity of the septenary PtIrRhCoFeNiCu high&#8208;entropy alloy catalyst are 2.13&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1/1.05&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt+Ir+Rh&#8722;1 and 2.95&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which reach 5.76&#8208;/2.84&#8208;fold and 5.57&#8208;fold improvements relative to commercial Pt/C (0.37&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and 0.53&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively. Remarkably, after the i&#8208;t test of up to 100,000&#8201;s and the accelerated durability test of 1500&#8197;cycles, 81.22&#8201;% and 68.54&#8201;% of the initial mass activity are well retained, respectively. The lattice distortion&#8208;associated local tensile strain as demonstrated by increased Pt&#8722;Pt bond length enhances ethanol adsorption and reduces reaction barriers. Moreover, hysteresis diffusion effect induced by lattice distortion in the HEA nanodendrites contributes to their superb ethanol oxidation stability. In situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the three HEA nanodendrites mainly follow C1 pathway with C&#8722;C bond breaking to form CO followed by CO oxidation especially at a wide range of high potentials. Theoretical calculations reveal that among these HEAs, PtIrRhCoFeNiCu possesses the lowest energy barrier for C&#8722;C bond scission due to synergy among Pt/Ir/Rh and water dissociation due to synergy among Co/Fe/Ni/Cu. This work provides insights to design unique HEA nanostructures with extraordinary catalytic performances and selectivity compared to conventional nanoparticles.

         <title>How Carbene Ligands Transform AuAg Alloy Nanoclusters for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we prepare an AuAg alloy nanocluster ligated by carbene, [Au13Ag12(PPh3)8(BMIm)2I8]SbF6, which is the first of its kind to show higher thermostability and higher sensitivity to light. It is attributed to a unique delocalization of electrons within the frontier orbitals. The Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm anchored on NiFe&#8208;LDH exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the electrosynthesis of urea.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have attracted increasing interest for their special structures and diverse applications. However, developing synthetic strategies and extending the database of NHC&#8208;protected nanoclusters are still challenging tasks. In this work, a novel and rapid synthetic method is developed to prepare AuAg alloy nanocluster ligated by carbene based on the reactivity of nanoclusters. The rod&#8208;like carbene&#8208;capped bimetal nanocluster, [Au13Ag12(PPh3)8(BMIm)2I8]SbF6 (Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm), was achieved and characterized by a series of techniques. The alloy nanocluster consists of two vertex&#8208;sharing icosahedrons and carbene ligands, phosphine ligands, and I atoms. Interestingly, the introduced carbene ligands show strong coordination capabilities with Au, enhancing the interaction between metal core and ligands. To the best of our knowledge, the carbene&#8208;capped Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm nanocluster is the first of its kind to show higher thermostability and higher sensitivity to light compared with the homogeneously capped analogue nanocluster ([Au13Ag12(PPh3)10I8]SbF6). Density functional theory calculations attribute these properties to a unique delocalization of electrons within the frontier orbitals. Finally, the Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm anchored on NiFe&#8208;LDH exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2, achieving a urea production rate of 29.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 34&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V (vs. RHE).

         <title>Polymer&#8208;MOF Network Enabling Ultrathin Coating for Post&#8208;Combustion Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategy to create CO2 highways by chemically linking UiO&#8208;66&#8208;MA to form MOF&#8208;polymer networks, enabling sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm thin layer coating with an MOF content of up to 40&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Theses MOFs help maintain high diffusivity selectivity at elevated temperatures, achieving a CO2 permeance of 2793 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 21.6 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 83&#8201;% relative humidity with mixed gases.







Abstract
Permeance&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off and high temperature resilience are key challenges in development of membranes for post&#8208;combustion carbon capture. While mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) consisting of polymers and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer the potential to address the challenges, they are limited by the low loading of MOFs in the thin film layer. Herein, we propose an inverse synthesis strategy to form polymer&#8208;MOF networks by copolymerizing monomers with functionalized UiO&#8208;66 nanoparticles. This process yields a finely dispersed, easily processable solution, enabling defect&#8208;free, thin polymer&#8208;MOF coatings with up to 40&#8197;wt&#8201;% MOF loading within the polyethylene oxide&#8208;based polymers on polyacrylonitrile supports. The membrane with 40&#8197;wt&#8201;% MOF demonstrated a 212&#8201;% increment in CO2 permeance at 25&#8201;&#176;C and maintained a selectivity of 20 at 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is attributed to the stable diffusivity selectivity of MOFs at high temperature. Furthermore, the membrane was evaluated with mixed gas and 83&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) at 60&#8201;&#176;C, achieving a CO2 permeance up to 2793 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 21.6. This work offers insights into the design of practical mixed matrix membranes, which not only paves the way towards energy efficient carbon capture from flue gas, but also provides more possibilities for other applications.

         <title>Radar&#8208;Terahertz&#8208;Infrared Compatible Stealth Coaxial Silver Nanowire@Carbon Nano&#8208;Cable Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elaborately designed silver nanowire@amorphous&#8208;graphitized carbon composite aerogel (AgNW@C) with regular coaxial nano&#8208;cable structure has been facilely fabricated, applying radar&#8208;terahertz&#8208;infrared multi&#8208;spectrum compatible stealth. This material system addresses the long&#8208;standing challenge in the field of material science, specifically the contradictory in materials properties for radar and infrared stealth. The AgNW@C aerogels offer practical solutions for enhancing the performance of electromagnetic protection, military camouflage materials and thermal management devices.







Abstract
Achieving multi&#8208;spectrum compatible stealth in radar&#8208;terahertz&#8208;infrared bands with robust performance has great prospects for both military and civilian applications. However, the progress of materials encounters substantial challenges due to the significant variability in frequency coupling properties across different electromagnetic wave bands. Here, this work presents the design of a multi&#8208;scale structure and fabricates a lightweight aerogel (silver nanowire@carbon, AgNW@C) consisting of a regular coaxial nano&#8208;cable, with silver nanowire as the core and amorphous&#8208;graphitized hybrid carbon as the outer&#8208;layer. The design utilizes the one&#8208;dimensional conductive network and electric coupling heterogeneous interface, the low infrared emission of silver nanowires, and the thermal insulation caused by three&#8208;dimensional pore structure found in aerogels. This conception achieves the long&#8208;standing goal of multi&#8208;spectrum compatible stealth in an integrated material. The AgNW@C aerogel exhibits an optimal reflection loss of &#8722;66.50&#8197;dB and an effective absorption bandwidth of 8.80&#8197;GHz in the gigahertz band, while an average total shielding performance of 71.92&#8197;dB and over 50.00&#8197;dB reflection loss in the terahertz band. Furthermore, the AgNW@C aerogel demonstrates remarkable thermal infrared stealth capabilities with a low infrared emissivity of 0.28 and thermal insulation up to 150&#8201;&#176;C under 200&#8201;&#176;C. These exceptional multispectral stealth properties allow the aerogel for potential applications in military camouflage technology and electromagnetic protection.

         <title>Precisely Tailoring the Second Coordination Sphere of a Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Halogenated Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co single&#8208;atom catalyst with an unsymmetric Co&#8208;N4P1 coordination configuration is developed by tailoring second coordination sphere. Due to the greatly improved H2 dissociation and product desorption, the catalyst exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &gt;99&#8201;% yields) at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 0.5&#8197;MPa H2 pressure.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective nonprecious metal catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes is very appealing yet challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) can be tuned by tailoring the structure of second coordination sphere via P doping. As revealed by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations, such a P doping on N&#8208;coordinated Co SAC results in the unsymmetric Co&#8208;N4P1 coordination structure. With a combination of experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, we find that tailoring the second coordination sphere can greatly improve H2 dissociation and product desorption. As a result, the Co&#8208;N4P1 SAC exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &gt;99&#8201;% yields) at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 0.5&#8197;MPa H2 pressure, significantly outperforming most heterogeneous catalysts reported in the literature. We expect that this work opens a new avenue for the design of highly efficient nonprecious metal SACs for important hydrogenation reactions.

     alt="Precisely Tailoring the Second Coordination Sphere of a Cobalt Single-Atom Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Halogenated Nitroarenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co single-atom catalyst with an unsymmetric Co-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; coordination configuration is developed by tailoring second coordination sphere. Due to the greatly improved H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation and product desorption, the catalyst exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &amp;gt;99&#8201;% yields) at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 0.5&#8197;MPa H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of highly efficient and cost-effective nonprecious metal catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes is very appealing yet challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of Co single-atom catalyst (SAC) can be tuned by tailoring the structure of second coordination sphere via P doping. As revealed by synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations, such a P doping on N-coordinated Co SAC results in the unsymmetric Co-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; coordination structure. With a combination of experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, we find that tailoring the second coordination sphere can greatly improve H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation and product desorption. As a result, the Co-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; SAC exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &amp;gt;99&#8201;% yields) at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 0.5&#8197;MPa H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure, significantly outperforming most heterogeneous catalysts reported in the literature. We expect that this work opens a new avenue for the design of highly efficient nonprecious metal SACs for important hydrogenation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unsymmetric Protonation Driven Highly Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis in Supramolecular Photocatalysts via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst (SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+) with an unsymmetric protonation structure significantly boosts H2O2 production from water and air. This design enhances charge separation and promotes dual active sites for Yeager&#8208;type O2 adsorption, enabling a selective one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron ORR pathway. SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ shows an H2O2 rate of 4666.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 100&#8201;% antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. However, its performance is often hindered by low selectivity and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report an anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+, featuring an unsymmetric protonation structure for H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air. The introduction of unsymmetric protonation disrupts the initial mirror symmetry of SADF, significantly enhancing the molecular dipole and facilitating efficient charge separation and electron transfer. Additionally, this modification increases the hydrophilicity of SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+, enabling the interaction of water and dissolved oxygen with the catalytic sites. The altered electron density distribution creates numerous dual active sites for Yeager&#8208;type O2 adsorption, facilitating an efficient ORR towards H2O2 via a direct one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ achieves an outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production at a rate of 4666.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, with a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) of 1.35&#8201;%, surpassing most organic photocatalytic systems. Furthermore, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic antibacterial activity, achieving 100&#8201;% antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus within 60&#8197;min.

         <title>Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Stereotactic Anchoring and Spatial Separation of Porphyrins for Amplified Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Pyroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;solvent strategy was employed to synthesize a porphyrin&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF) with novel crystal structure and unique morphology. The exquisite configuration ensured the orderly anchoring and precise spatial separation of porphyrin molecules, effectively circumventing the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions. This unique structural design endows Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF with excellent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capabilities, and under ultrasound activation, it can effectively induce tumor cell pyroptosis and activate immune responses.







Abstract
Ultrasound&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is pivotal in specifically inducing pyroptosis of tumor cells. However, the effectiveness of pyroptosis is generally hindered by the constraints of ROS generation efficiency. Herein, a new porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF) was rationally designed via an innovative dual&#8208;solvent strategy to amplify ROS generation for ultrasound&#8208;controlled pyroptosis. The crystal structure of Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF was elucidated by continuous rotation electron diffraction technique, revealing its regular and rigid conformation. The porphyrin molecules were precisely oriented and firmly confined within the scaffold, effectively restricting intramolecular motion. The ample distance of 6.8&#8197;&#197; between two porphyrin molecules, combined with the interaction region indicator visualization, confirmed the absence of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in the Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF framework, thereby avoiding the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. Furthermore, the permanent porosity and expansive surface area of Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF enhanced its interaction with oxygen. These ingenious structural features endowed Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF with a unique ability to generate a large amount of singlet oxygen under ultrasound activation. Meanwhile, the impetus of ultrasound also accelerated the rate of the Fenton reaction catalyzed by iron ions, significantly boosting the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Benefiting from the dual amplification of ROS, Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF could efficiently induce tumor cells pyroptosis under ultrasound stimulation, thereby intensifying the potency of cancer immunotherapy.

Sulfation, spanning the fields of biology and chemistry, is still in its early stages compared to other important post&#8208;translational modifications. The lack of efficient synthetic methods for sulfation poses a significant obstacle to its application, which is both thermodynamically and kinetically challenging transformation. In their Communication (e202413847), Jiakun Li and co&#8208;workers leverage modular control over reactivity of persulfate and the stability of radical sulfate anion to achieve C&#8211;H sulfation via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) process.

The chemical recycling of phosphorus, showcasing the transformation of waste&#8208;derived phosphoric acid into valuable phosphate triesters using organosilicate, is illustrated on the cover picture. The golden liquid from sewage symbolizes renewable resource flow, while the circular platform highlights the precise chemical reactions. Molecules on the manhole emphasize innovative phosphorus recovery and recycling, contributing to sustainable and circular chemical systems, as reported by Yuki Naganawa, Yumiko Nakajima et al. in their Research Article (e202416487).

         <title>Inside Cover: Bridging Electrolyte Bulk and Interfacial Chemistry: Dynamic Protective Strategy Enable Ultra&#8208;Long Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Batteries (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 10/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main bottleneck of rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) is their limited cycle lifespans stemming from the unhealthy electrolyte bulk and fragile interface. In their Research Article (e202418524), Jun Huang, Yiwang Chen et al. report a dynamic protective strategy to bridge electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry for ultra&#8208;long lifespan AZBs, which greatly unlocks the potential for an extended service lifespan for advanced AZBs.

Non&#8208;ionic designer aqueous micelles hold significant promise as versatile media, functioning as solvents, electrolytes, and reaction boosters in electrocatalysis. Their unique structures and properties enhance the efficiency of transition metal&#8208;free hydrodefluorination of geminal difluorinated indoles, thereby eliminating the need for toxic organic solvents and supporting electrolytes. This process sustainably and selectively removes a fluorine atom, producing valuable monofluorinated indoles, as reported by Sachin Handa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202416132).

Amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers with hydrophobic brush segments self&#8208;assemble into nanodiscs in water. Their size, pH&#8208;responsiveness, and drug loading capacity can be controlled. Different hydrolysis rates enable time&#8208;dependent degradation and drug release. In their Communication (e202424269), Markus M&#195;1/4llner et al. show how the functional nanodisc core can switch from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, allowing loaded cargo to be released.

         <title>Fighting Antimicrobial Resistance: Innovative Drugs in Antibacterial Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article provides an overview over antibacterial drugs investigated in the past three decades. Aspects of the compound's origins, their cellular targets, the antibacterial spectrum and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in animal studies are covered and current trends are highlighted.







Abstract
In the fight against bacterial infections, particularly those caused by multi&#8208;resistant pathogens known as &#8220;superbugs&#8221;, the need for new antibacterials is undoubted in scientific communities and is by now also widely perceived by the general population. However, the antibacterial research landscape has changed considerably over the past years. With few exceptions, the majority of big pharma companies has left the field and thus, the decline in R&amp;D on antibacterials severely impacts the drug pipeline. In recent years, antibacterial research has increasingly relied on smaller companies or academic research institutions, which mostly have only limited financial resources, to carry a drug discovery and development process from the beginning and through to the beginning of clinical phases. This review formulates the requirements for an antibacterial in regard of targeted pathogens, resistance mechanisms and drug discovery. Strategies are shown for the discovery of new antibacterial structures originating from natural sources, by chemical synthesis and more recently from artificial intelligence approaches. This is complemented by principles for the computer&#8208;aided design of antibacterials and the refinement of a lead structure. The second part of the article comprises a compilation of antibacterial molecules classified according to bacterial target structures, e.g. cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, as well as more recently emerging target classes, e.g. fatty acid synthesis, proteases and membrane proteins. Aspects of the origin, the antibacterial spectrum, resistance and the current development status of the presented drug molecules are highlighted.

         <dc:description>
Stable luminescent diradicals, each containing two unpaired electrons, exhibit highly sensitive spin states and luminescence under external stimuli such as temperature, magnetic fields and microwaves, setting them apart from traditional closed&#8208;shell luminophores and monoradicals. This minireview highlights recent advances in their design, synthesis, photophysical properties and potential applications, as well as challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Stable luminescent diradicals, characterized by the presence of two unpaired electrons, exhibit unique photophysical properties that are sensitive to external stimuli such as temperature, magnetic fields, and microwaves. This sensitivity allows the manipulation of their spin states and luminescence, setting them apart from traditional closed&#8208;shell luminescent molecules and luminescent monoradicals. As a result, luminescent diradicals are emerging as promising candidates for a variety of applications. This minireview discusses recent advances in the design and synthesis of luminescent diradicals, explores their photophysical properties and potential applications. It also examines the challenges and prospects in the development of these materials, shedding light on their potential to drive technological innovation.

         <title>Kauzmann Paradox, Supercooling, and Finding Order in Chaos</title>

80&#8201;years later: Kauzmann temperature (Tk), and associated entropy catastrophe/paradox remains an enigma for nearly 80&#8197;years without any unifying resolution. Potential resolutions to the Kauzmann paradox, however, have so far been limited in the existence of an equilibrium ideal glass transition and traditional description of phase transition. Continued evolution of our understanding in thermodynamics, however, has revealed more knowledge on the subject matter, leading us closer to the resolution of this paradox. This review undergoes a historical perspective of the journey from Kauzmann's day until now.







Abstract
Prediction of a liquidus state with lower entropy than the corresponding solid at Kauzmann temperature (Tk), and associated entropy catastrophe/paradox, remains an enigma. Despite efforts to resolve this paradox for nearly 80&#8197;years, no unifying resolution has been reported. Potential resolutions to the Kauzmann paradox rely on an ideal glass transition, however, this limits the interpretation of Tk as an equilibrium critical point rather than an instability. Focusing on entropy, statistical mechanics and non&#8208;equilibrium dynamics becomes a key tenet in resolving this paradox. Expansion in phase space beyond 2D and consideration of Tk as a non&#8208;equilibrium critical point is necessary to understand the extent of liquid relaxation beyond Tk. In this review, we provide an entropic perspective of the relaxation behavior of supercooled liquids, associated expanded phase diagram, and the potential resolution to the Kauzmann paradox. This work integrates the historical evolution of our understanding of entropy/thermodynamics with modern interpretation of quantum states through renormalization group and thermodynamic speed limits.

         <title>Benzylic C&#8722;H Radical Sulfation by Persulfates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical sulfation with persulfates via C&#8722;O bond formation facilitates the introduction of sulfate functional groups onto readily&#8208;available C&#8722;H compounds. The modular control over reactivity of persulfate, along with the generation of radical sulfate anion, enables the radical C&#8722;O sulfation via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) process.







Abstract
Sulfation is a highly valuable pathological and physiological process, yet it is often underappreciated considering the rather difficult accessibility of organosulfates. O&#8208;sulfonation (O&#8722;SO3), a conventional and still common way to make organosulfates, restricts its applicability to hydroxyl compounds and therein lies a major challenge of library construction. Here, we describe a benzylic C&#8722;H radical sulfation with persulfates via C&#8722;O bond formation. This strategy leverages modular control over the reactivity of persulfates and the stability of sulfate radicals by coutercations. K+/NH4+ stabilized sulfate radicals act as the oxidant to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals from substrates, and activation of persulfates by n&#8208;NBu4+ provides O&#8722;O resource pool to facilitate C&#8722;OSO3&#8722; bond formation via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) process.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Discobahamin A and Putative Structure of Discobahamin B via an Isocyanide&#8208;based Macrocyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isocyanide&#8208;based macrocyclization, involving the formation of a C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) bond and the concurrent generation of an &#945;&#8208;acyloxy amide functional group, has been developed and successfully applied to the total synthesis of discobahamin A, a 24&#8208;membered macrocyclopeptide.







Abstract
We report in this paper the first total synthesis of discobahamin A, a 24&#8208;membered macrocyclopeptide containing an &#945;&#8208;keto amide functional group. We assign the absolute configuration of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methylpentanoic acid (Hmp), the side chain capping the N&#8208;terminus of the macrocycle, as the (2S, 3S) stereoisomer. A novel macrocyclization strategy was developed, utilizing an intramolecular Passerini reaction between &#969;&#8208;isocyano aldehyde and acetic acid. Notably, this macrocyclization proceeds via C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) bond formation and de novo generation of an &#945;&#8208;keto amide functional group. Furthermore, we synthesized both the proposed structure of discobahamin B and its diastereomer. However, the spectroscopic data for these two compounds do not fully align with those reported for discobahamin B.

         <title>Cationic Polyhedral Chalcogenaboranes: Activation without breaking Wade's Rules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents the first cationic chalcogenaboranes having the same skeletal electron pair count as their neutral precursors but bearing a positive charge. This is in contrast with Wade's rules, which claim that a change in the shape or number of skeletal electron pairs is inevitable. The enhanced electrophilicity of these compounds is demonstrated by their reactivity with weak bases.







Abstract
Wade's rules are a well&#8208;established tool for the description of the geometry of inorganic clusters. Among others, they state that a decrease or increase in charge is always accompanied by a change in the number of skeletal electron pairs (SEPs). This work reports the synthesis of the first cationic chalcogenaboranes closo&#8208;[12&#8208;X&#8208;2&#8208;IPr&#8208;1&#8208;EB11H10]BF4 (IPr=1,3&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; X=H, I; E=S, Se 3&#8201;a/b, 4&#8201;a/b) featuring the same SEP count as their neutral precursors, EB11H11, but bearing a positive charge. This ionisation significantly enhances the activity towards the electrophiles. It unlocks reactivity with very weak bases and offers the control of the regioselectivity towards hard/soft bases by the modulation of LUMO. The localisation of the positive charge within the borane cluster has been confirmed experimentally, spectroscopically and theoretically.

It unlocks reactivity with very weak bases and offers the control of the regioselectivity towards hard/soft bases by the modulation of LUMO. The localisation of the positive charge within the borane cluster has been confirmed experimentally, spectroscopically and theoretically.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room Temperature Ethene to Propene (ETP) Tandem Catalysis using Single Crystalline Solid&#8208;State Molecular Pre&#8208;Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular, molecular, in crystallo tandem catalysis approach, that sequentially combines three crystalline organometallic catalysts, delivers ethene to propene (ETP) by a combination of ethene dimerization, butenes isomerization and cross&#8208;metathesis under flow rector conditions at ambient temperature and low pressure.







Abstract
A tandem catalytic ensemble of solid&#8208;state molecular organometallic (SMOM) crystalline pre&#8208;catalysts are deployed under batch or flow conditions for the ethene to propene process (ETP). These catalysts operate at ambient temperature and low pressure, via sequential ethene dimerization, butenes isomerization and cross&#8208;metathesis. Under flow conditions the on&#8208;stream ethene conversion (55&#8201;%), initial propene selectivity (92&#8201;%), stability (71&#8201;% selectivity after 7&#8197;h) and low temperature/pressures are competitive with the best&#8208;in&#8208;class heterogeneous systems, marking a new, in crystallo, approach to ETP.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Free Synthesis of High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Y with Aluminophosphate as the Aluminum Carrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum Carrier for High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Synthesis. Inspired by the kinetical&#8208;controlled drug delivery, a unique approach based on the controlled aluminum&#8208;incorporation mechanism is proposed to synthesize the most siliceous zeolite Y under organic&#8208;free condition. The introduction of aluminophosphate as Al carrier regulates crystallization kinetics of zeolite Y, which exhibits an improved hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance in benchmark reaction.







Abstract
The wide application of zeolite Y in petrochemical industry is well&#8208;known as one of the milestones in zeolite chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. However, the traditional organic&#8208;free synthesis typically produces (hydro)thermally unstable zeolite Y with Si/Al atomic ratio (SAR) less than 2.5. Inspired by drug delivery process in which active components are kinetically controlled released, we develop a unique approach based on the pre&#8208;synthesized aluminum carrier to prepare one of the most siliceous zeolite Y with SAR up to 3.44 without using organics. The crystalline or amorphous aluminophosphates serve as the ideal carrier for the controlled incorporation of Al into zeolite framework during zeolite Y crystallization. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the partial introduction of aluminophosphate as Al source would rationally regulate the crystallization kinetics, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;silica zeolite Y with random Al distribution. This approach enhances the hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance of zeolite Y in benchmark reaction.

         <title>Enantioselective Borylcupration/Cyclization of Alkene&#8208;Tethered Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric synthesis of boryl&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;pyrrolines is reported. A range of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters are compatible in the reaction and the borylated products are shown to be used in the synthesis of novel prolinol derivatives through a directed reduction of the cyclic imines. Experimental and computational investigations reveal that the reaction likely proceeds via a stereoretentive cyclization of the benzylic copper intermediates.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of borylated 1&#8208;pyrrolines from &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters is reported. Twenty&#8208;four novel 1&#8208;pyrroline derivatives are reported in yields ranging from 26% to 96% and enantioselectivities from 74.5:25.5 er to 99:1 er. Examples derived from &#945;&#8208;unsubstituted, non&#8208;fluorinated oxime esters are reported. The hydroxyl group following oxidation of the Bpin moiety acts as a directing group in highly diastereoselective reductions of the pyrrolines to the corresponding prolinol derivatives. Additionally, the Bpin group can be retained in the products following a simplified, chromatography&#8208;free workup procedure. DFT supports a reaction mechanism which proceeds through the formation of an (R)&#8208;benzylic copper intermediate, followed by stereoretentive cyclization with respect to the configuration at the metalated carbon. The conclusions of the computational data are corroborated through control experiments and deuterium&#8208;labelling studies.

         <title>Access to Quaternary&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutylsilanes by Ring Opening of Arylbicyclobutanes with Silyllithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the silyllithium&#8208;mediated generation and in&#8208;situ cleavage of quaternary&#8208;substituted bicyclobutanes to diastereoselectively afford cyclobutylsilanes. Formally, this reaction is a nucleophilic substitution at a tertiary or quaternary carbon atom with a carbon leaving group. The utility of the generated products was demonstrated by a Tamao&#8722;Fleming oxidation to prepare a substituted cyclobutanol.







Abstract
Disclosed herein is the reaction of silyllithium reagents with quaternary&#8208;substituted arylbicyclobutanes to diastereoselectively form polysubstituted cyclobutylsilanes by C&#8722;C bond cleavage. The bicyclobutanes are generated in&#8197;situ, by lithium&#8208;halogen exchange, from readily accessible (bromomethyl)iodocyclopropane precursors, rendering this a one&#8208;pot transformation. The trapping of a generated cyclobutyllithium intermediate with an electrophile was also demonstrated, providing a cyclobutane product with vicinal quaternary stereocenters. The utility of the cyclobutylsilane products was showcased by Tamao&#8722;Fleming oxidation to prepare a quaternary&#8208;substituted cyclobutanol.

         <title>Radical Homopolymerization of Arylsulfonylated &#945;&#8208;Olefins to Synthesize Polysulfones &#8211; a &#8220;SO2&#8208;free&#8221; Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here: Radical homopolymerization of sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;olefins has been developed. The success of this polymerization relies on the high efficiency of aryl migration. This &#8220;SO2&#8208;free&#8221; approach enables us to synthesize ABC sequenced regulated polysulfones.







Abstract
Traditionally, &#945;&#8208;olefins have been regarded as non&#8208;homopolymerizable substrates in textbook examples.

     alt="Radical Homopolymerization of Arylsulfonylated &#945;-Olefins to Synthesize Polysulfones &#8211; a &#8220;SO2-free&#8221; Approach"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insert text for Table of Contents here&lt;/b&gt;: Radical homopolymerization of sulfonyl &#945;-olefins has been developed. The success of this polymerization relies on the high efficiency of aryl migration. This &#8220;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-free&#8221; approach enables us to synthesize ABC sequenced regulated polysulfones.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, &#945;-olefins have been regarded as non-homopolymerizable substrates in textbook examples. However, they have the ability to copolymerize with sulfur dioxide, leading to the creation of alternating copolymers. These commodity poly(olefin sulfone)s exhibit a wide array of applications. Nevertheless, the synthesis process involving sulfur dioxide pose considerable hazards and practical difficulties. In this study, we report on the &#8220;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-free&#8221; radical homopolymerization of sulfonyl &#945;-olefin monomers, resulting in the production of ABC sequence-controlled poly(vinylbenzothiazole-olefin-sulfone)s. This unique radical polymerization process is enhanced by 1,4/1,5-aryl migration, facilitated by the sulfonyl radicals involved in propagation. This demonstrated aryl group migration radical polymerization opens up new possibilities for synthesizing polysulfones with unprecedented main chain sequences and structures, which hold great promise as candidates for innovative polymeric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ph3PC &#8211; A Monosubstituted C(0) Atom in Its Triplet State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to divalent C(0) compounds, such as carbodiphosphoranes, monovalent C(0) compounds are largely underrepresented in chemistry. Now the first monovalent C(0) compound, Ph3P&#8594;C, has been characterized, in which triphenylphosphine forms a bond to a carbon atom in its electronic 3P ground state. Owing to its diradical nature, EPR and ENDOR studies clearly confirm this assignment with support from quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel class of carbon&#8208;centered diradicals: a monosubstituted C atom stabilized by a phosphine. The diradical Ph3P&#8594;C was photochemically generated from a diazophosphorus ylide precursor (Ph3PCN2) and characterized by EPR and isotope&#8208;sensitive ENDOR spectroscopy at low temperatures. Ph3P&#8594;C features an axial zero&#8208;field splitting parameter D=0.543&#8197;cm&#8722;1 with a vanishingly small rhombicity |E|/D=0.002. Time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent measurements confirm a triplet ground state with a lifetime of approximately 10&#8197;min at 127&#8197;K in toluene&#8208;d8. Multireference electronic structure calculations predict a clear triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet gap greater than 20&#8197;kcal/mol. In contrast to divalent C(0) compounds, such as Ph3P&#8594;C&#8592;PPh3, in which carbon needs excitation into a highly&#8208;excited closed&#8208;shell 2s02p4 configuration, Ph3P&#8594;C can be explained by direct involvement of carbon in its natural 3P state arising from the 2s22p2 configuration.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Amorphous 2D Polymer Nanodiscs with Tuneable Size, pH&#8208;Responsive Degradation and Controlled Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tadpole&#8208;like amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCs) with pH&#8208;responsive side chains are synthesized to prepare self&#8208;assembled nanodiscs, with sizes from 200&#8197;nm to over 1&#8197;&#956;m controlled by sidechain compositions. These nanodiscs enter cancer cells, degrade in acidic conditions, with different hydrolysis kinetics, enabling targeted drug release, demonstrating significant potential for therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCs) with tadpole&#8208;like, coil&#8208;rod architecture can be used to self&#8208;assemble into functional polymer nanodiscs directly in water. The hydrophobic segments of the BBC were tuned via the ratio of ethoxy&#8208;ethyl glycidyl ether (EE) to tetrahydropyranyl glycidyl ether (TP) within the grafted polymer sidechains. In turn, this variation controlled the sizes, pH&#8208;responsiveness, and drug loading capacity of the self&#8208;assembled nanodiscs. Notably, as EE exhibited faster hydrolysis than TP, the nanodiscs featured variable degradation rates under mild acidic conditions, aiding small molecule release and time&#8208;dependent and complete degradation of discs into fully water&#8208;soluble copolymers. The nanodiscs demonstrated biocompatibility and cellular uptake by breast cancer cells, underscoring their potential development into drug delivery systems.

         <title>Axially Chiral TADF Imidazolium Salts for Circularly Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) imidazolium compounds are synthesized by attaching imidazolium hexafluorophosphate to an axially chiral TADF framework. The chiral imidazolium salts showed small &#916;EST, high PLQY, strong CPL and excellent redox properties. Moreover, circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (CP&#8208;LECs) prepared with this compound, without additional ionic liquids, exhibit CPEL signals with |gEL| of 3.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and EQEmax of 5.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
A pair of axially chiral thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) enantiomers, R&#8208;TCBN&#8208;ImEtPF6 and S&#8208;TCBN&#8208;ImEtPF6, with intrinsic ionic characteristics were efficiently synthesized by introducing imidazolium hexafluorophosphate to chiral TADF unit. The TADF imidazolium salts exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 92&#8201;%, a small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#9653;EST) of 0.04&#8197;eV, as well as reversible redox properties. Furthermore, the enantiomers showed distinct mirror&#8208;image CD and CPL activities with glum values of &#8722;3.7&#215;10&#8722;3 and +3.4&#215;10&#8722;3. Notably, by doping the axial TADF imidazolium salts into achiral TADF sensitizer, sandwich&#8208;structured light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) without the addition of ionic liquids (ILs) or ionic transition&#8208;metal compounds (iTMCs) were fabricated. When driven at 50&#8197;A m&#8722;2, the LECs displayed an EQE of up to 5.2&#8201;% and strong circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with gEL values of +3.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. This represents the first CP&#8208;LEC based on TADF materials and offers a promising strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance CPEL devices.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonance 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;Heteroarene for Filterless Narrowband Photodetector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;heteroarene has been employed for narrowband photodetectors with a phototransistor configuration for the first time by anchoring narrowband&#8208;absorption MR molecules onto a high&#8208;mobility indium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IZO) semiconductor. Such a device enables excellent photodetection performance and a record&#8208;small detecting full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33&#8197;nm among intrinsic narrowband absorbing materials.







Abstract
As an emerging class of optoelectronic materials, multi&#8208;resonance (MR) 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;heteroarenes have been extensively employed as narrowband electroluminescence materials, whereas their absorption feature has largely been neglected. Here we construct the first MR&#8208;molecule&#8208;based phototransistor for filterless narrowband photodetectors (NBPDs) by anchoring narrowband absorption MR molecules on a high&#8208;mobility semiconductor indium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IZO) film. The resulting device exhibits high&#8208;performance photodetection with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33&#8197;nm, which represents a new record for NBPDs based on intrinsic narrowband absorbing materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of MR materials as a new molecular platform for developing high&#8208;performance NBPDs.

&lt;p&gt;Multi-resonance (MR) 1,4-BN-heteroarene has been employed for narrowband photodetectors with a phototransistor configuration for the first time by anchoring narrowband-absorption MR molecules onto a high-mobility indium-zinc-oxide (IZO) semiconductor. Such a device enables excellent photodetection performance and a record-small detecting full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 33&#8197;nm among intrinsic narrowband absorbing materials.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Enhanced Spleen&#8208;Targeted mRNA Delivery via Fluorinated PEGylated Lipid Nanoparticles for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel approach combining fluorinated PEG lipids and ultrasound to enhance spleen&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery. Ultrasound&#8208;induced rapid PEG lipid shedding promotes membrane fusion and efficient mRNA translation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells, significantly improving organ&#8208;specific delivery and transfection. This strategy holds great promise for advancing mRNA&#8208;based immunotherapy.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) based messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics hold immense promise for treating a wide array of diseases, while their nonhepatic organs targeting and insufficient endosomal escape efficiency remain challenges. For LNPs, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids have a crucial role in stabilizing them in aqueous medium, but they severely hinder cellular uptake and reduce transfection efficiency. In this study, we designed ultrasound (US)&#8208;assisted fluorinated PEGylated LNPs (F&#8208;LNPs) to enhance spleen&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery and transfection. Through liquid&#8208;to&#8208;gas phase transition, we enabled the controlled shedding of fluorinated PEG lipids from F&#8208;LNPs, facilitating cellular uptake, membrane fusion, and mRNA release. In vivo results demonstrated that US&#8208;assisted F&#8208;LNPs increased mRNA transfection approximately 4.0&#8208;fold in the spleen following intravenous administration. Notably, the F&#8208;LNPs achieved effective mRNA delivery to antigen&#8208;presenting cell subsets, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. The targeted delivery of full&#8208;length ovalbumin&#8208;encoding mRNA vaccine induced significant CD8+ T cell response and exhibited excellent therapeutic effect against the ovalbumin&#8208;transduced B16F10 tumor model. These findings establish a novel strategy for spleen&#8208;specific mRNA delivery through the combination of fluorinated PEG lipids and US treatment, which holds substantial promise for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy, potentially broadening the scope of clinical applications for mRNA&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly for Bimodal in Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contrast agents (CAs) are essential in biomedical imaging to aid in the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of disease. However, they are typically restricted to one imaging modality and have fixed properties such as size, shape, toxicity profile or photophysical characteristics, which hampers a comprehensive view of biological processes. Herein, we introduce rationally designed dye assemblies as a unique CA platform for simultaneous multimodal and multiscale biomedical imaging. To this end, we synthesized a series of amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes with varying hydrophobic domain (C1, C8, C12 and C16) that self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media into nanostructures of tunable size (50 nm&#8208;1 &#181;m) and photophysical properties. While C1 exhibits oblique&#8208;type exciton coupling and negligible emission, C8&#8208;C16 bearing longer alkyl chains undergo J&#8208;type aggregation with NIR absorption and emission and excellent photoacoustic properties. Given these advantageous features, we established aza&#8208;BODIPY specific, semi&#8208;quantitative fluorescence reflectance and photoacoustic imaging both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, in vitro cell viability as well as murine in vivo biodistribution analysis with ex vivo validation showed excellent biocompatibility and a size&#8208;dependent biodistribution of nanostructures to different organ beds. Our results broaden the scope of aqueous self&#8208;assembly to multimodal imaging and highlight its great potential for rationalizing numerous biomedical questions.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Driven Cooperative Photocatalytic Coupling of Biomass Valorization and Hydrogen Peroxide Production Using Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional H2O2 photocatalysis primarily depends on photoexcited electrons and holes to drive oxygen reduction and water oxidation, respectively. However, singlet oxygen (1O2), often underappreciated, plays a pivotal role in H2O2 production. Meanwhile, photocatalytic biomass conversion has attracted attention, yet studies combining H2O2 synthesis with biomass valorization remain rare and typically yield low&#8208;value products. Herein, we report a strategy of photocatalytic valorization of furfuryl alcohol (FFA) coupled with the efficient co&#8208;production of H2O2, enabled by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) induced, 1O2&#8208;participated Achmatowicz rearrangement. This study introduces polyimide&#8208;based COF&#8208;N0&#8208;3 with tailored nitrogen content, representing an unprecedently efficient platform for 1O2 production. Remarkably, reducing the nitrogen content of the COF enhances 1O2 production, significantly boosting the H2O2 generation rate. In FFA, the primary pathway for H2O2 production is Achmatowicz rearrangement, achieving a rate ten times higher than that reliant on oxygen reduction reaction in pure water, reaching 4549 &#956;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;. Mechanism studies revealed 1O2 selectively engaged FFA, bypassing hole oxidation to trigger the Achmatowicz rearrangement, producing valuable 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;(2H)&#8208;pyranone with 99% conversion and 92% selectivity. This work establishes a coupling strategy for simultaneoues synthesis of H2O2 and biochemicals, offering a transformative approach to sustainable photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Gold Recycling from Electronic Waste Using a Highly Stable Porous Aromatic Framework/Polymer and Its Application for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous aromatic framework/polymer composite, PAF&#8208;147/polydopamine (PDA), is constructed via a mild in situ polymerization method for rapid and selective gold recovery from electronic waste leachate. Leveraging the redox adsorption mechanism and the unique microenvironment of PAF&#8208;147/PDA, the adsorbent post&#8208;adsorption is directly applicable for highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Recycling gold from electronic waste represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy for both resource recovery and waste reduction. In this study, we designed an innovative and highly stable porous aromatic framework (PAF)/polymer composite, PAF&#8208;147/polydopamine (PDA), as an efficient adsorbent for selective gold recovery for the first time. The maximum gold adsorption capacity of PAF&#8208;147/PDA reached 1700&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, it could rapidly extract over 95&#8201;% of gold from solutions in a pH range of 0&#8211;10 within just 2&#8197;minutes. Importantly, as a real application demonstration, the PAF&#8208;147/PDA composite selectively recovered 99&#8201;% of gold from the leachate of discarded central processing units. When the recovered Au&#8208;containing composite was applied to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, the Faradaic efficiency for CO production exceeded 95&#8201;% across acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, outperforming most reported gold&#8208;based catalysts due to the cooperation effect of the composite and Au. This work opens a new way for the combination of selective gold recovery from electronic waste with highly efficient CO2 conversion.

         <title>Nanofabrication via SEM Electron&#8208;Beam Stimulated Suzuki&#8211;Miyura Type Reaction: Fingerprints of Carbazole Derivative Revealed by Synchrotron&#8208;IR Nanospectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry</title>

         <dc:description>
This study investigates the conditions under which 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole can be formed in solid state by using a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura type reaction triggered by electron beam irradiation. Synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and mass spectrometry revealed signatures of the target product, suggesting a potential palladium&#8208;free reaction pathway and offering a direct route to the fabrication of nanodevices.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based compounds have demonstrated interesting physical and chemical properties for OLED devices. 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole has a direct application in the composition of structures with potential to suppress the loss of efficiency under high luminance conditions along with its use in the emitting layer. In this study, we reveal and explore the conditions in which a triggered electron beams (e&#8208;beams) solid state Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura type reaction between 3,6&#8208;diiodocarbazole and phenylboronic acid could be carried out. Applying typical SEM acceleration voltage (30&#8197;keV), sufficient energy transfer enabled the activation of the reaction. Synchrotron Infrared Nano Spectroscopy (SINS) was used to acquire nanoscale molecular vibrational spectra and compare with conventional FTIR absorption spectra for chemical characterization. Evidences obtained by mass spectrometry confirmed the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole under higher e&#8208;beam dose (30&#8197;keV, 10&#8197;minutes), when compared to 5 and 10&#8197;keV. In addition, the phenylboronic acid seems to have a role in the reaction outcome. Both samples irradiated in the presence and in the absence of palladium exhibited the fingerprints of the expected product 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole shedding light on possible alternative mechanisms and the straightforward construction of nanodevices.

         <title>Unveiling the Intrinsic Superior SHG Performance of Ce4+ Fluoride Masked by Subtle Ce3+ Impurity and Its Effective Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high performance pure Ce4+&#8208;fluoride, Na2(Ce4+)F6, and demonstrate that the presence of subtle Ce3+ impurity significantly reduces the properties. Being aware of this fact and carefully controlling the synthetic conditions are the key to ensuring the successful synthesis of superior Ce4+&#8208;compounds.







Abstract
Owing to its unique electronic configuration [Xe]4f0, Ce4+&#8208;compound is a highly desired in the field of advanced nonlinear optical materials, yet its synthesis remains a great challange. Herein, we report a series of cerium fluorides, including a pure Ce4+&#8208;fluoride, high&#8208;performance Na2(Ce4+)F6; three mixed valance state samples, (Mix1&#8211;3, with increasing Ce3+ concentration); and a fully reduced pure Ce3+&#8208;fluoride Na1.5(Ce3+)1.5F6. In particular, Na2(Ce4+)F6, shows an SHG response (4&#215;KDP), and a wide band gap (4.77&#8197;eV), which are the strongest and widest among all Ce&#8208;containing materials to date. With systematic studies, we demonstrate that the subtle Ce3+ impurity significantly reduces performance. By being aware of this fact and consciously controlling experimental conditions, we can ensure the synthesis of pure Na2(Ce4+)F6, which exhibits excellent overall performance and shows great potential for future applications. This work not only reinforced the crucial role of Ce4+ in significantly enhancing the key performance, but also provided invaluable experimental evidence and theoretical support for the future design of more efficient and superior functional materials.

         <title>Enabling Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation Prior to Water Reduction in Aqueous Zinc Batteries by Mild Protic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and introduces mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) for aqueous zinc batteries according to thermodynamics. MMI is reduced prior to water, forming an organic&#8208;dominated SEI that effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and enables dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition. Hence, zinc anodes exhibited exceptional reversibility and cycle stability in electrolyte with 20&#8197;mM MMI.







Abstract
Challenges like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite formation on zinc anodes hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs), primarily due to the lack of an exceptional passivating solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). To effectively prevent water decomposition, it is essential to in situ construct SEI prior to water reduction. This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and predicts reduction potentials of mild protic compounds using thermodynamics. Based on this insight, mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) is introduced and found to be reduced prior to water at higher electrode potentials, as MMI exhibits slightly higher proton activity than water due to its thiol group. The reduction of MMI produces isothiocyanate species via a proposed electrocatalytic ring cleavage mechanism, which deposit on zinc anodes to form an SEI predominantly composed of organic compounds supplemented with Zn(OH)2. Benefiting from the unique advantage of preferential reduction before water, the MMI&#8208;derived SEI exhibits a superior passivating effect, as evidenced by a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in corrosion current of zinc anodes from 1170&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 13.6&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The SEI effectively suppresses HER, and ensures dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition, leading to high reversible zinc anodes with exceptional electrochemical performances.

         <title>Quantum Mechanical Tunnelling Probes with Redox Cycling for Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Detection of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we develop&#160;a redox cycling&#8208;coupled&#160;electrochemical tunnelling biosensors&#160;with&#160;quantum mechanical tunnelling probes&#160;containing&#160;sub&#8208;2 nm gap distances and demonstrate their application for direct protein detection in biofluids.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical tunnelling sensors (QMTs) have emerged as a promising technology for next&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule detection. Furthermore, QMT sensors can be combined with redox species resulting in repeated oxidation and reduction (redox cycling).. We developed robust QMT probes with electrode gap distances below 2&#8197;nm. Using the generator&#8208;collector (GC) mode, we verified that redox cycling of the ferrocyanide/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722;) couple occurs both in the tunnelling regime and on the electrode surface. Our findings indicated that the current enhancement is affected by both the gap distance and surface modifications of the probes. These QMT probes exhibited remarkable sensitivity, capable of detecting Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722; concentrations down to sub&#8208;picomolar levels. Utilising this ability to modulate redox reactions, we adapted the QMT probes to serve as electrochemical sensors for detecting viral proteins. By modifying the electrode surfaces, our functionalised QMT probes achieved sub&#8208;pM detection limits with high selectivity in biofluids such as nasopharyngeal secretions.

     alt="Quantum Mechanical Tunnelling Probes with Redox Cycling for Ultra-Sensitive Detection of Biomolecules"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we develop&#160;a redox cycling-coupled&#160;electrochemical tunnelling biosensors&#160;with&#160;quantum mechanical tunnelling probes&#160;containing&#160;sub-2 nm gap distances and demonstrate their application for direct protein detection in biofluids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanical tunnelling sensors (QMTs) have emerged as a promising technology for next-generation single-molecule detection. Furthermore, QMT sensors can be combined with redox species resulting in repeated oxidation and reduction (redox cycling).. We developed robust QMT probes with electrode gap distances below 2&#8197;nm. Using the generator-collector (GC) mode, we verified that redox cycling of the ferrocyanide/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;/4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) couple occurs both in the tunnelling regime and on the electrode surface. Our findings indicated that the current enhancement is affected by both the gap distance and surface modifications of the probes. These QMT probes exhibited remarkable sensitivity, capable of detecting Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;/4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations down to sub-picomolar levels. Utilising this ability to modulate redox reactions, we adapted the QMT probes to serve as electrochemical sensors for detecting viral proteins. By modifying the electrode surfaces, our functionalised QMT probes achieved sub-pM detection limits with high selectivity in biofluids such as nasopharyngeal secretions. These findings highlight the potential of QMT probes to develop into a new class of electrochemical tunnelling sensors, offering significant advancements in biomedical diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Polar&#8208;Functionalized Polyolefin Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silane protection strategy is developed to enable early&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed efficient terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene and polar monomers. A series of polar functionalized polyolefin elastomers with high molecular weight and high 1&#8208;octene incorporation are successfully synthesized. This strategy shows comprehensive better performances than previously wide practiced aluminum protection strategy, leading to products with excellent mechanical and elastic properties, along with great practical applications.







Abstract
Polyolefin elastomers (POEs) are widely used for many applications including plastic toughening and encapsulating photovoltaic modules. The introduction of polar groups into POEs improves their compatibility and adhesion with polar components, but it is challenging to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polar&#8208;functionalized POEs (P&#8208;POEs) via copolymerization. Here, we report a silane protection strategy to enable the production of P&#8208;POEs (including an ethylene&#8208;based P&#8208;EPOE and a propylene&#8208;based P&#8208;PPOE) with widely tunable 1&#8208;octene incorporation ratios (7.4&#8211;19.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%), appropriate polar monomer incorporation ratios (0.7&#8211;2.7 mol&#8201;%), melting points (63.8&#8211;99.8&#8201;&#176;C), and high molecular weights (up to 43.8&#215;104&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). This approach involved the early transition metal&#8208;catalyzed terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene, and protected polar monomers. This silane protection strategy is superior to the previously widely practiced aluminum&#8208;based protection strategies in terms of polymerization activity, polymer molecular weight, comonomer incorporation, and product processibility. Most importantly, the P&#8208;POE products exhibited excellent mechanical properties and elasticity and served as high&#8208;performance compatibilizers and adhesives to enhance the functional applications of POEs.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Closed Four&#8208;Link Chains and Borromean Links</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (841links) and Borromean links (632 links) have been successfully synthesized in one&#8208;step processes. The interlocked molecules were generated by the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions of bis&#8208;dentate benzothiadiazole ligands and binuclear Cp*Rh/Ir&#8208;based precursors.







Abstract
Despite substantial advancements in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), the efficient construction of higher order links remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the highly efficient one&#8208;step directed construction of a series of unprecedented molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (84 1 metalla&#8208;links), achieved through the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions involving binuclear rhodium/iridium precursors and bis&#8208;dentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligands. Meanwhile, modulating the substituent positions of the pyridine groups in the ligand resulted in a change in topological structure, leading to the formation of two molecular Borromean links (

metalla&#8208;links). The molecular configurations of the abovementioned metalla&#8208;links were clearly identified through mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, structural transformation between the molecular Borromean links and corresponding monocycles was achieved through concentration effects, as validated by solution&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy investigations.

         <title>Catalysis&#8208;driven Active Transport Across a Liquid Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe how a small&#8208;molecule catalyst can be transported against its concentration gradient, thanks to the energy provided by the chemical reaction it catalyzes. This non&#8208;equilibrium process builds macroscopic concentration gradients and can be triggered by the localized presence of co&#8208;catalysts. Spatial separation leads to simultaneous autocatalysis and negative feedback, connecting the worlds of molecular ratchets and nonlinear phenomena.







Abstract
Biology has mastered energy transduction, converting energy between various forms, and employing it to drive its vital processes. Central to this is the ability to use chemical energy for the active transport of substances, pumping ions and molecules across hydrophobic lipid membranes between aqueous (sub)cellular compartments. Biology employs information ratchet mechanisms, where kinetic asymmetry in the fuel&#8208;to&#8208;waste (i.&#8197;e., substrate&#8208;to&#8208;product) conversion results in catalysis&#8208;driven active transport. Here, we report an artificial system for catalysis&#8208;driven active transport across a hydrophobic phase, pumping a maleic acid cargo between aqueous compartments. We employ two strategies to differentiate the conditions in either compartment, showing that active transport can be driven either by adding fuel to a single compartment, or by differentiating the rates of activation and/or hydrolysis when fuel is present in both compartments. We characterize the nonequilibrium system through complete kinetic analysis. Finally, we quantify the energy transduction achieved by the catalysis&#8208;driven active transport and establish the emergence of positive and negative feedback mechanisms within the system.

         <title>Water in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in &#8220;water science&#8221; within the field of electrocatalysis, which covers the fundamental understanding of the dynamic structure and nature of water under electrochemical conditions, the specific roles of water in typical electrocatalytic reactions, and effective strategies for manipulating water to optimize the performance of electrocatalytic systems.







Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered electrocatalysis technologies occupy a central position in clean energy conversion and the pursuit of a net&#8208;zero carbon emission future. Water can serve multiple roles in electrocatalytic reactions, for instance, as a reaction medium, reactant, modifier, promoter, etc. This significantly influences the mass transport, active site, intermediate adsorption and reaction kinetics, ultimately determining the electrocatalytic performance (e.g., activity, selectivity, and stability) as well as device efficiency. As the heart location where electrocatalytic reactions occur, the typical electrical&#8208;double layer is established at a water&#8208;electrode interface. Therefore, the comprehension and regulation of water are crucial topics in electrocatalysis, which encourages us to organize this review. We begin with the fundamental understanding on structure of water and its behavior under electrochemical conditions. Subsequently, we delve into the &#8220;water effect&#8221; by elucidating specific functions of water in electrocatalysis. Recent advances in manipulating water to enhance electrocatalytic efficiency of representative reactions such as hydrogen evolution/oxidation, oxygen evolution/reduction, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction and organic electrosynthesis, are also highlighted. We finally discuss the remaining challenges and future opportunities in this field.

         <title>Stefan&#8208;Boltzmann Water Catalyzed Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the catalytic role of water molecule and the inherent thermal radiation in gaseous homogeneous high&#8208;temperatue propane dehydrogenation, in which the water molecule could generate hydroxyl radicals with the help of thermal radiation and thus facilitate the reaction. Consequently, the proposed system could achieve a 37.93&#8201;% olefin yield and a 51.14&#8201;% single&#8208;pass propane conversion, and an excellent stability for over 2,000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The traditional wisdom of utilizing water in practical olefin synthesis has been viewed as a means to reduce alkane partial pressure and assist in coke removal. However, under such harsh reaction conditions, the potential catalytic role of the water molecule remains unclear. This study explores the intriguing concept that the water molecule, through the selective excitation of molecular vibrations and collisions induced by thermal energy and thermal radiation, could act as a catalyst in homogeneous gaseous propane dehydrogenation. This occurs via the generation of the OH&#8901; radicals, resulting in an olefin yield of 37.93&#8201;%, a single pass propane conversion of 51.14&#8201;%, and an excellent stability of more than 2000&#8197;hours.

&lt;p&gt;This study explores the catalytic role of water molecule and the inherent thermal radiation in gaseous homogeneous high-temperatue propane dehydrogenation, in which the water molecule could generate hydroxyl radicals with the help of thermal radiation and thus facilitate the reaction. Consequently, the proposed system could achieve a 37.93&#8201;% olefin yield and a 51.14&#8201;% single-pass propane conversion, and an excellent stability for over 2,000&#8197;hours.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional wisdom of utilizing water in practical olefin synthesis has been viewed as a means to reduce alkane partial pressure and assist in coke removal. However, under such harsh reaction conditions, the potential catalytic role of the water molecule remains unclear. This study explores the intriguing concept that the water molecule, through the selective excitation of molecular vibrations and collisions induced by thermal energy and thermal radiation, could act as a catalyst in homogeneous gaseous propane dehydrogenation. This occurs via the generation of the OH&#8901; radicals, resulting in an olefin yield of 37.93&#8201;%, a single pass propane conversion of 51.14&#8201;%, and an excellent stability of more than 2000&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Switch&#8208;Triggered On&#8208;Demand Synthesis of Aromatic Amines in High Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a tandem switch strategy that transforms the site and component incompatibilities commonly observed in tandem synthesis into strengths. By using a kinetic switch with phosphotungstic acid&#8208;modified Ni&#8722;Ni(Al)O heterojunction catalyst and a thermodynamic switch via competitive adsorption of ethanol, hydrogen, and acrylonitrile, we achieve on&#8208;demand synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary aromatic amines, all with yields over 96&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tandem catalysis stands as a beacon of chemical sustainability. Although bifunctional catalysts have achieved wide success in two&#8208;step tandem reactions, achieving multi&#8208;step catalysis with three or more distinct and potentially incompatible catalytic sites and components remains an ambitious challenge. Here, we present a &#8220;tandem switch&#8221; strategy that transforms these incompatibilities into functional advantages, enabling on&#8208;demand production of primary, secondary, and tertiary aromatic amines, all with yields exceeding 96&#8201;%. A kinetic switch, enabled by phosphotungstic acid functionalization of the Ni&#8722;Ni(Al)O heterojunction catalyst, modulates the Ni&#8722;Ni and Ni&#8722;O boundary microenvironment to simultaneously accelerate the rate&#8208;determining steps in nitrobenzene hydrogenation, N&#8208;alkylation, and aza&#8208;Michael addition. Meanwhile, a thermodynamic switch, controlled by the competitive adsorption of ethanol, hydrogen, and acrylonitrile, stepwise minimizes Gibbs free energy to ensure a seamless reaction cascade. Hence, by toggling these tandem switches on or off, we achieve selective regulation of nitrobenzene conversion pathways into the production of targeted aromatic amine. Techno&#8208;economic analysis shows the developed process significantly reduces material and energy consumption for sustainable amine production.

         <title>Cascade Lanthanide&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer for Nanocrystal&#8208;Sensitized Organic Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide nanocrystal&#8208;sensitized organic upconversion is reported, which produced various upconversion luminescence with wavelength ranging from 600&#8197;nm to 475&#8197;nm under 808&#8197;nm excitation. The crucial energy transfer step from lanthanides to organic triplet states has been extensively investigated, demonstrating the promise of nanocrystal&#8208;sensitization for upconversion applications.







Abstract
Sensitized organic photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) shows significant potential for energy conversion and photocatalysis, but achieving efficient upconversion across multiple wavelengths with single&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitation remains a daunting challenge. Here, we report a strategy utilizing lanthanide&#8208;doped nanocrystals (LnNCs) to sensitize TTA upconversion in multiple organic emitters under NIR excitation, achieving an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of up to 1.1&#8197;eV. This approach leverages a cascade lanthanide&#8208;triplet energy transfer design, adopting an interfacial energy transfer pathway via lanthanide ions to surface energy relay molecules for extended triplet sensitization. It allows consecutive transfer of photon energy from LnNCs to TTA emitters, mitigating energy mismatch between the triplet levels of emitters and excitation photon energies. The use of LnNCs enhances energy transfer efficiency through the unique spin&#8208;orbital coupling and narrow&#8208;band absorption properties of lanthanide ions. Our approach offers tunable upconversion emission, minimized energy loss during sensitization, and improved chemical stability of LnNCs. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of this system in NIR&#8208;induced photopolymerization, showcasing its potential for applications such as 3D printing and photocatalysis.

         <title>Preparation of Peapod&#8208;Like Nano&#8208;Copolymers with Periodic Sequence via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Morphology Differentiation and Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel strategy for constructing peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence through fusion of vesicles and porous spheres. The generation and assembly of vesicles and porous spheres are achieved via polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) in one&#8208;pot. The aggregation unit numbers of peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers are affected by the length of solvophobic block and collision probability of vesicles and porous spheres.







Abstract
Inorganic nanoparticles have so far dominated the field of nanoparticle assembly, and assembly of pure organic nanoparticles (such as block copolymer nanoparticles) has rarely been examined in colloidal systems. Expanding the scope of nanoparticles is of great significance for the study of nanoparticle assembly. Herein, a paradigm for the copolymerization of organic nanoparticles into peapod&#8208;like linear nanostructures with periodic sequence is introduced. Vesicles and porous spheres are generated in situ during polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and can be viewed as nanoscale monomers (&#8220;nanomers&#8221;). The subsequent copolymerization of these nanomers is completed in one&#8208;pot, which greatly simplifies the preparation of nanomers and peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers. It is demonstrated that appropriate &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions are crucial to the formation of nanomers and their copolymerization progress. Notably, the research subjects in nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence have expanded to organic nanoparticles, which is beneficial to further expand the horizons of nanoparticle assembly. Moreover, the multiple separated compartments in the peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers will open new directions toward development of artificial organelle and on&#8208;demand catalysis in different compartments within the same nano&#8208;object.

         <title>&#8216;Tearing Effect&#8217; of Alloy&#8211;Support Interaction for Alloy Redispersion in NiRu/TiO2 Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a subversive &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; of alloy&#8208;support interaction on the interface of TiO2&#8208;supported NiRu alloy nanoparticles, where the NiRu nanoparticles on the interface redisperse to smaller ones like to be torn apart.







Abstract
Supported alloy catalysts have been extensively applied to many significant industrial chemical processes due to the abundant active sites with distinguishable geometry and electron states. However, a detailed in situ investigation of the interaction between support and alloy nanoparticles is still lacking. Here, a subversive &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; on the interface of TiO2&#8208;supported NiRu alloy nanoparticles is in situ discovered by environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) with a dramatic redispersion process of alloy nanoparticles from ~25&#8197;nm to 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm under the repeated hydrogen reduction. Dual&#8208;driven by the distinct alloy&#8208;support interaction involving the restructuring of alloy nanoparticles and growth of TiOx overlayer, larger NiRu alloy nanoparticles spontaneously disintegrate into atoms migrating on support. Atoms are finally captured by the defects generated on TiO2 during the repeat reduction, which also confines the further growth of the newly alloy nanoparticles. Owing to this specific alloy&#8208;support interaction, smaller alloy nanoparticles on TiO2 support are much more stable than the bigger ones, which holds promise for industrial applications as durable catalysts. This novel metal&#8208;support interaction with the &#8216;tearing effect&#8217; revealed on supported alloy catalysts provides new knowledge on the structure&#8208;performance relationships in all the alloy catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

The incorporation of 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole as a bio&#8208;isostere of the ester group in Fer&#8208;1 not only provides druglike Ferfluor&#8208;1 with high potency and favorable blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeability for a significant anti&#8208;ferroptosis effect in vivo, but also creates a unique ratiometric photoluminescent probe sensitive to the fluctuation of ferroptosis by an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) mechanism.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;based diagnostic and therapeutic applications have long suffered from a shortage of suitable drugs and probes of high specificity. In the context of anti&#8208;ferroptosis research for neurological diseases, the inaccessibility of a blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) permeable small molecular ferroptosis inhibitor, and the lack of specific ferroptosis probes, seriously impeded a deeper understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis and the development of clinically applicable drugs. We report herein a novel 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole&#8208;functionalized druglike ferrostatin analogue entitled Ferfluor&#8208;1 with superior anti&#8208;ferroptosis potency, favorable BBB permeability and in vivo activity against stroke and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the exclusive pseudo&#8208;excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) property of Ferfluor&#8208;1 via a long&#8208;distance hydrogen&#8208;bonding network makes it the first sensitive ratiometric photoluminescent probe to detect phospholipid hydroperoxides and a specific indicator for the fluctuation of ferroptosis. These unprecedented advantages not only make Ferfluor&#8208;1 a potential tool for ferroptosis&#8208;related diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the central nervous system, but also pave the way to developing new theragnostic agents for precision redox detection and regulation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Triple&#8208;Targeted Radiosensitizer Enhances Hypoxic Tumor Targeting and Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;targeted, nitroimidazole&#8208;bearing radiosensitizer that self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles (A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs) has been developed for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging&#8208;guided on&#8208;demand radio&#8208;immunotherapy of hypoxic tumors.







Abstract
Targeted delivery of radiosensitizers and real&#8208;time monitoring of hypoxia are crucial for overcoming radiotherapy resistance in hypoxic tumors. Here, we report A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD, a triple&#8208;targeted nitroimidazole (Ni)&#8208;linked radiosensitizer that self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles (A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs) for bimodal near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR FL) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided radio&#8208;immunotherapy. A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs specifically accumulate in &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;positive tumors, where they are hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to form Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs, with enhanced FL at 710&#8197;nm and dual PA signals at 680 and 730&#8197;nm. Under hypoxic conditions, nitroreductase (NTR) further reduces these NPs, covalently labeling endogenous proteins and increasing NP size. This process partially alleviates aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, increasing the FL710 signal and decreasing the PA730 signal, enabling real&#8208;time tracking of tumor&#8208;specific delivery and hypoxia. Following low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation (2&#8197;Gy), elevated NTR expression promotes further Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs reduction, enhancing proteins labeling and causing DNA damage. Moreover, radiosensitization with A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs triggers robust immunogenic cell death, stimulating antitumor immunity that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, significantly prolonging survival in mice with orthotopic 4T1 tumors. This work underscores the potential of self&#8208;assembling, triple&#8208;targeted radiotheranostic agents for improving tumor targeting, imaging, and radiotherapy efficacy in hypoxic tumors.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ionogels from Dynamic Polyrotaxane&#8208;Based Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes were designed by introducing ionic liquid to dynamically crosslinked polyrotaxane networks. The competitive coordination of lithium ions between the polymer chain segments and the ionic liquid molecular clusters facilitates lithium&#8208;ion migration. The ionogel electrolyte enables lithium symmetrical cells with stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours and the NMC622||Li battery with excellent rate and cycling performance at 20&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The swelling of a polymer matrix by ionic liquids and additional lithium salts may lead to the formation of ionogel electrolytes. However, the introduction of additional ions usually results in a decreased lithium&#8208;ion transference number, because of the trapping of the lithium ions in clusters and polymer&#8208;ion complexes. Achieving highly efficient lithium&#8208;ion migration and increasing lithium&#8208;ion transference number (tLi+) are however crucial for the successful application of ionogel electrolytes. Herein, we design a crosslinked polyrotaxane network and then introduce ionic liquid and a lithium salt to obtain an ionogel electrolyte based on the principle of competitive coordination with the lowest binding energy for lithium ions coordinated with both the polymer network and ionic liquid clusters. This facilitates their migration within the ionogel and their release from the coordination environment, thereby improving lithium&#8208;ion transport efficiency (ionic conductivity of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and tLi+=0.45 at 20&#8201;&#176;C). As proof of concept, the lithium&#8208;lithium symmetrical cells achieve stable cycling for 2000&#8197;hours, while the NMC622||Li battery demonstrates good rate performance and excellent cycling stability at 20&#8201;&#176;C (theoretical initial capacity, 300 cycles with a single cycle capacity loss of 0.03&#8201;%). This work provides new insights for the design and synthesis of ionogel electrolytes, facilitating lithium ion migration within the electrolytes.

         <title>Super&#8208;Assembled Lamellar Conductive Heterochannels with Optical&#8208;Electrical Coupling Sensitivity for Smart Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing PyGO conductive heterochannel with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity were fabricated through super&#8208;assembly strategy for smart ion transport. Benefiting from the coupling conductivity and photosensitivity of the PPy conductive network, the output power density of salinity gradient energy device with this lamellar photoelectric membrane could achieve 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under illumination.







Abstract
Artificial nanofluidic devices inspired bylight&#8208;driven ion transport in biological systems, leveraging the photoelectric effect, have attracted extensive attention for their potential in signal transduction and smart ion transport applications. However, effective separation of photogenerated carriers in traditional p&#8208;n junction interface can be hindered by energy band structure of different semiconductor materials. Here, we present a novel approach using conductive polypyrrole (PPy) to modify graphene oxide (GO), creating polypyrrole&#8208;graphene oxide (PyGO) functional lamellar conductive nanochannels with tailored channel&#8208;sized gradients and inherent optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity via a facile super&#8208;assembly strategy. This design facilitates the PyGO own conductive lamellar channels and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, resulting in significantly enhanced selective ion transport behavior. Coupling the conductivity and photosensitivity of PPy contributes to a peak power density of 14.1&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 under a salinity differential of 0.5/0.01&#8197;M NaCl, which is 35.6&#8201;% higher than that under dark conditions. Additionally, combing the salinity gradients with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity of the nanofludic devices, we demonstrate the application of PyGO in a real&#8208;time detection device for monitoring ion concentrations in nutrient solutions, paving the way for smart irrigation systems in agriculture. This work presents a novel and effective strategy for light&#8208;driven ion transport with potential applications in energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selectively Accelerating the Generation of &#946;&#8208;Linked Residue Isoaspartate in Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoaspartate (isoAsp) is a &#946;&#8208;linked residue in proteins spontaneously generated via Asn deamidation or Asp dehydration and significantly affects protein properties. However, the sluggish and site&#8208;nonselective generation of isoAsp residues in proteins severely impedes the in&#8208;depth biological investigations as well as the exploitation of its unique &#946;&#8208;linkage features. Herein, we introduced a method that allows site&#8208;selective and rapid generation of isoAsp residues in proteins. This method leverages the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain esterified Asp derivative (BnD), which undergoes facile intramolecular arrangement to form the key intermediate, aspartyl succinimide (Suc); subsequent hydrolysis of Suc gives rise to isoAsp as the major product. On native sites of proteins including Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and calmodulin, we demonstrated that BnD&#8208;mediated isoAsp formation is faster than Asn deamidation generally by three orders of magnitude.</dc:description>

On native sites of proteins including Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and calmodulin, we demonstrated that BnD-mediated isoAsp formation is faster than Asn deamidation generally by three orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Carbon Neutrality through Aprotic CO2 Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Global climate change mitigation necessitates global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. Natural photosynthesis exemplifies an ingenious approach for carbon neutrality, converting CO2 into O2 and glucose through light and dark reactions. Inspired by the hydrogen&#8208;involved processes in photosynthesis, we present an aprotic electrochemical strategy for CO2 splitting into O2 and carbon using lithium as a reducing mediator. The designed electrochemical device features a gas cathode with nanoscale Co catalyst and a metallic lithium anode. When CO2 is introduced to the cathode, it undergoes a two&#8208;step lithium&#8208;related electrochemical reduction, converting it sequentially into Li2CO3 and Li2O. Li2O is then oxidized to produce O2 gas at the expense of renewable electrical energy. This process achieves an impressive O2 yield exceeding 94.7%, significantly outperforming the efficiency of natural photosynthesis. Moreover, the O2 yield can be further increased to 98.6% by employing an optimized RuCo catalyst. Our study offers a new practical and controllable pathway to produce O2 from CO2, strongly promoting the sustainable development of human society for realizing carbon neutral as well as exploring and conquering nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecule Differentiation Encoding Microscopy to Dissect Dense Biomolecules in Cellular Nanoenvironments Below Spatial Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular biomolecules may exhibit dense distribution and organization at the nanoscale to govern vital biological processes. However, it remains a common challenge to digitize the spatially dense biomolecules under spatial resolution of microscopies. Here, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle method, molecule differentiation encoding microscopy by orthogonal tandem repeat DNA identifiers, to resolve the copy numbers of dense biomolecules in cellular nanoenvironments. The method encodes each copy of same biomolecules into different types of DNA barcodes based on stochastic multiplexed reactions. It can transform the overlap of the same spectrum into the overlap of different spectra. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed to automatically quantitate overlapping spots and individual spots. Using this method, we dissected RNAs in the cytoplasm, DNA epigenetic modifications in the cell nucleus, and glycans and glycoRNAs on the cell surface, respectively. We found that all these biomolecules presented dense distribution with diverse degrees in crowded cellular nanoenvironments. Especially, averaged 17% copies of U1 glycoRNA of single cells are gathered in various nanoenvironments on cell surface. Our strategy provides a powerful tool for digitally quantitative visualization of dense biomolecules below spatial resolution of microscopies, and could provide insights into underlying functions and mechanisms of the dense distribution information.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing Propylene Epoxidation: The Role of Ethyl Acetate Autoxidation via Cobalt&#8208;Nickel Catalyzed C(acyl)&#8208;O Bond Scission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective autoxidation for the synthesis of valuable oxygenates has provoked keen interest from both academic and industrial sectors. Although the generation of reactive oxygen species via oxygen attack on C&#8208;H bonds near ester linkages is well&#8208;established, research into aliphatic ester oxidation has primarily focused on combustion, neglecting their potential utility in oxidation processes. Herein, we demonstrated a protocol for producing propylene oxide through the autoxidation of ethyl acetate in tandem with propylene epoxidation. The ethoxy radical, generated by ester C(acyl)&#8211;O bond cleavage in situ, subsequently underwent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with the Co(OAc)(&#956;&#8208;H2O)2Ni, followed by the formation of the peracetic acid optimally suited for the epoxidation reaction. Our research not only eliminates the need for co&#8208;substrates in the epoxidation process but also fills the application gap in the bulk&#8208;ester autoxidation, offering insights into the effective utilization of oxy&#8208;intermediates in autoxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Inter&#8208;Site Distance Effect in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inter&#8208;site distance effect (ISDE) has gained significant attention in heterogeneous catalysis, challenging classical models that treat adjacent non&#8208;bonded sites as isolated. Recent studies demonstrate that these sites can exhibit long&#8208;range cooperative interactions, enhancing reaction efficiencies. Fully leveraging the ISDE to overcome limitations in site reactivity requires a multidisciplinary approach and advanced techniques. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ISDE in electrocatalysis, starting with strategies for synthesizing materials with tunable inter&#8208;site distances. It examines ISDE across various catalyst models, including monometallic and heteronuclear atomic sites, active sites within clusters, and the lattice of nanocatalysts, focusing on their electronic structures, spatial geometries, and synergistic interactions. Advanced characterization and computational methods are highlighted as essential for identifying inter&#8208;site structures and distances, providing a systematic framework for understanding ISDE&#8217;s role in electrocatalysis. The review also proposes best practices for studying ISDE, addressing current challenges, and offering future perspectives. These insights aim to inform the design of highly efficient catalysts, enhance the understanding of catalytic mechanisms, and contribute to the development of more efficient energy conversion technologies, providing a foundation for further research into optimizing electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Polychromatic Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single Hetero&#8208;Ligand Metal Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional polychromatic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging is realized with the several separated luminophores at the different potentials. In this study, an emerging polychromatic ECL imaging system was constructed based on single hetero&#8208;ligand metal organic framework (MOF) crystals as nanoemitters through an intrareticular energy transfer process. The hetero&#8208;ligand MOF crystals, named h&#8208;NJU&#8208;241, were co&#8208;assembled of meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) with 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8208;benzoic acid)pyrene (TBAPy) ligand using benzoic acid catalyst with coordination ability, leading to the conjugated spacing of 0.624 nm between two ligands. Remarkably, an energy transfer efficiency of 92.2% was achieved when the coordination weight ratio of TCPP acceptor and TBAPy donor was only 1.87&#8240;. Different from monoligand MOFs, the hetero&#8208;ligand h&#8208;NJU&#8208;241 exhibits dual ECL emissions in both blue and red regions at one step applied potential, which is first example of polychromatic ECL imaging for single MOF crystals. Furthermore, by adjusting the reaction conditions, the morphology distribution of porphyrin within the crystal can be dynamically controlled, providing a tailored crystal platform for decoding fundamentals in polychromatic ECL imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Pilot H2O2 Production via Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Reactor: Insights from a 2&#8208;electrons ORR Hybrid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers an alluring and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process for hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) synthesis. However, challenges remain in developing scalable electrocatalysts and cost&#8208;effective reactors for high&#8208;purity H&#8322;O&#8322; production. This study introduces a simple yet effective mechanical mixing method to fabricate a hybrid electrocatalyst from oxidized carbon nanotubes and layered double hydroxides (LDHs). This easily accessible and low&#8208;cost catalyst achieves near&#8208;perfect Faradaic efficiency (~100%) with low overpotentials of 73 mV at 10 mA cm&#8315;&#178; and 588 mV at 400 mA cm&#8315;&#178; in a solid electrolyte cell. Through theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ analyses, we uncover the pivotal role played by the LDH co&#8208;catalyst in fine&#8208;tuning the local pH at the catalyst/solid&#8208;electrolyte interface that drives both the activity and selectivity. We also design a low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state reactor using cation&#8208;exchange resin (CER) as both a proton conductor and a microchannel for efficient mass transfer, achieving a production rate of 5.29 mmol cm&#8315;&#178; h&#8315;&#185; and continuous output concentrations of 11.8 wt.% H&#8322;O&#8322;. Scaled to an industrial area of 2 &#215; 100 cm&#178;, the pilot reactor achieves an impressive H&#8322;O&#8322; production rate of approximately 127.0 mmol h&#8315;&#185; at 15 A, marking a significant advancement in sustainable H&#8322;O&#8322; production.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Fast Photochemical Oxidation Interrogates the Native Structure of Integral Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are pivotal for cellular functions but challenging to investigate. Here, we introduce IC&#8208;FPOMP (in&#8208;cell fast photochemical oxidation of MPs), a method enabling in situ footprinting of IMPs within live cells. IC&#8208;FPOMP generates reactive oxygen radicals from various precursors (TiO2 nanoparticles or H2O2) nearby the membrane. Leveraging a laser and a 96&#8208;well plate platform, we achieve high&#8208;throughput and rapid footprinting of IMPs. IC&#8208;FPOMP of two human IMPs (human glucose transporter&#8208;hGLUT1 and human gamma glutamyl carboxylase&#8208;hGGCX) were successful, providing footprinting of both the transmembrane and extramembrane regions. Comparative analysis of hGLUT1 in liposomes versus cells shows that the membrane impacts the transporter&#8216;s conformation differently. In&#8208;cell drug screening targeting hGLUT1 reveals drug binding behavior in vivo. In summary, IC&#8208;FPOMP offers insights on IMP structure&#8208;function relationships in cell and facilitates drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Electron Transfer via Cerium Photocatalysis for Alkoxy Radical&#8208;Mediated Selective Hydroetherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;enabled catalytic platform utilizing cerium(IV) benzoate complexes to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of directly coupling free alcohols with electron&#8208;rich alkenes, overcoming inherent polarity mismatches. This approach effectively circumvents the typical selectivity in single&#8208;electron transfer processes, enabling the selective generation of electrophilic alkoxy radicals from free alcohols in the presence of redox&#8208;labile electron&#8208;rich alkenes. The Ce&#8208;benzoate&#8208;based photocatalytic protocol promotes regioselective hydroetherification via both intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular addition pathways, showcasing broad functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, and versatility across a diverse array of alkenes, including silyl enol ethers and enamides/enecarbamates. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate the structure of the active Ce(IV) benzoate catalyst, highlighting its unique selectivity for alkoxy radical generation, thereby establishing a practical and atom&#8208;economical framework for hydroetherification.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd Ensemble Sites Tuned Local Environment of Cu Catalysts for Matching Propyne Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailoring local environments of active sites to match targeted configuration of key species is significant for controlling reaction pathways in selective hydrogenations. Herein, differently typed Pd sites are introduced onto Cu catalysts to tune the local environment of Cu sites for controlling the configuration of semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway of propyne hydrogenation used in production of polymer&#8208;grade propylene. Detailed structure characterizations demonstrate the controllable construction of Pd single&#8208;atom and Pd ensemble sites modified Cu surfaces and PdCu alloy via fine tuning the Pd/Cu ratios. Catalytic tests, kinetics analysis, and temperature&#8208;programmed experiments demonstrate that the presence of Pd ensemble sites on Cu surface directly catalyzes the hydrogenation of propyne that occurs on the Cu sites in other cases, and enables a facile activation for hydrogen and simultaneously promotes the desorption of propylene against its hydrogenation. Accordingly, the selectivity to target propylene is up to 95.3% at the full conversion of propyne on the corresponding Pd0.1Cu catalyst. In contrast, the C&#8208;C coupling pathway is quite facile on the Cu surface tuned by single&#8208;atom Pd sites, which is similar to that on the pristine Cu sites on the Cu catalyst, and the well&#8208;defined Pd&#8208;Cu coordination on PdCu alloy catalyst leads to facile over&#8208;hydrogenation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Activated Near Infrared/Short&#8208;Wave Infrared&#160;Emissive Chromophores: Synthesis of Triphenylamine&#8208;Appended Pyrazinacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic dyes showing absorbance and fluorescence in the near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared regions are attractive for a variety of applications. Redox&#8208;coupled reversible switching of absorbance or fluorescence implies enhanced functionality of such dyes, especially where large changes in photophysical properties across the redox process can be realized. Here, we report the synthesis of two new pyrazinacenes containing four and five fused pyrazine units, appended with electron&#8208;donor triphenylamine groups, and redox&#8208;coupled switching of their photophysical properties. In their reduced state, the compounds show absorbance and fluorescence in the visible region. Reversible shifts in absorbance and fluorescence from the visible to the near infrared or even short&#8208;wave infrared regions are observed upon chemical and electrochemical oxidations. Such large redox&#8208;coupled shifts in photophysical properties are unprecedented for a redox process that affects only a single, six&#8208;membered ring in which both reduced and oxidized states consist of neutral, closed&#8208;shell species. The compounds show high fluorescence quantum yields in their reduced states, and oxidized species show fluorescence quantum yields that compare well with existing near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared active fluorescent dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Blocking Orbital &#960;&#8208;Conjugation to Boost Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling in Carbonyl&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both reducing singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES1T1) and enhancing spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOCs) are key to improving reverse intersystem crossings rates (kRISC) in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. While considerable efforts have focused on reducing &#916;ES1T1, investigations on SOCs remain limited. Here, we propose blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroaromatic (PHA) molecules as potential approach to elevate &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, allowing its hybridization with n&#960;* excitation, thereby increasing SOCs. We synthesized two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept isomers, DNDK&#8208;1 and DNDK&#8208;2, with different orientations of carbonyl units. DNDK&#8208;1 adopts heavily twisted structure that hinders &#960;&#8208;conjugation, while DNDK&#8208;2 remains quasi&#8208;planar, maintaining stronger &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Experimental measurements revealed stark differences in their photophysical properties, with DNDK&#8208;1 exhibiting faster kRISC and much higher electroluminescence efficiency. The ab&#8208;initio calculations elucidate that hindered conjugation in DNDK&#8208;1 elevates &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, enabling n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing, thus significantly boosting SOCs. In contrast, smooth &#960;&#8208;conjugation in DNDK&#8208;2 leads to marginal n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing. In addition, utilizing groups composed of meta&#8208;arranged carbonyl&#8208;Ar&#8208;carbonyl and meta&#8208;arranged N&#8208;Ar&#8208;N units emerges as another approach to block &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhance SOCs. This joint experimental and theoretical work provides promising pathways to enhance SOCs by blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation, offering crucial insights for designing carbonyl&#8208;embedded PHA emitters with larger SOCs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective functionalization of alkenes to create nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles remains a significant challenge in organic synthesis. Due to their unique electronic and biological properties, these heterocycles are crucial in pharmaceuticals and materials. Herein, we present an electrochemical amino&#8208;oxygenation of alkenes using alkene radical cations and bisnucleophiles, enabling the synthesis of saturated N/O&#8208;heterocycles in an undivided cell. This method employs readily available amides and alkenes, eliminating the need for additional oxidants or redox catalysts. The in situ generation of alkene radical cations results in high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. Our approach offers a direct route to six&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered N/O&#8208;heterocycles from simple starting materials, broadening access to complex molecules essential for medicinal chemistry and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Size Effect of Surface Defects Dictates Reactivity for Nitrogen Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) offers a sustainable pathway for ammonia (NH3) production. Defect engineering has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance eNRR activity; however, it can concurrently amplify the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), posing challenges for achieving high selectivity. Herein, VOx with systematically tuned defect sizes was engineered to establish a structure&#8211;activity relationship between defect size and eNRR performance. In&#8208;situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that medium&#8208;sized defects (VOx&#8208;MD, 1&#8208;2 nm) provide an optimal electronic environment for enhanced N2 adsorption and activation while maintaining sufficient spatial flexibility to facilitate efficient hydrogenation and suppress HER. Consequently, VOx&#8208;MD exhibits outstanding eNRR performance, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 81.94 &#177; 1.45 &#956;g h&#8211;1 mg&#8211;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 31.97 &#177; 0.75% at &#8208;0.5 V (vs. RHE). These findings highlight the critical role of defect size in governing eNRR activity and selectivity, offering a scalable strategy for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

Herein, VOx with systematically tuned defect sizes was engineered to establish a structure&#8211;activity relationship between defect size and eNRR performance. In-situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that medium-sized defects (VOx-MD, 1-2 nm) provide an optimal electronic environment for enhanced N2 adsorption and activation while maintaining sufficient spatial flexibility to facilitate efficient hydrogenation and suppress HER. Consequently, VOx-MD exhibits outstanding eNRR performance, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 81.94 &#177; 1.45 &#956;g h&#8211;1 mg&#8211;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 31.97 &#177; 0.75% at -0.5 V (vs. RHE). These findings highlight the critical role of defect size in governing eNRR activity and selectivity, offering a scalable strategy for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into H2O Dissociation in Overall Photo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction with H2O to produce fuels and chemicals offers a dual solution to address both environmental and energy challenges.&#160;For a long time, catalyst design in this reaction system has primarily focused on optimizing reduction sites to improve the efficiency or guide the reaction pathway of the CO2 reduction half&#8208;reaction. However, less attention has been paid to designing activation sites for H2O to modulate the H2O dissociation half&#8208;reaction. Yet, the rate&#8208;determining step in overall CO2 reduction is the latter, as it influences the evolution direction and formation energy of carbon&#8208;containing intermediates through the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Herein, we summarize the mechanism of the H2O dissociation half&#8208;reaction in modulating CO2 reduction performance based on cutting&#8208;edge research. These analyses aim to uncover the potential regulatory mechanisms by which H2O activation influences CO2 reduction pathways and conversion efficiency, and to establish a mechanism&#8208;structure&#8208;performance relationship that can guide the design and development of high&#8208;efficiency catalytic materials. A summary of advanced characterization techniques for investigating the dissociation mechanism of H2O is presented. We also discuss the challenges and offer perspectives on the future design of activation sites to improve the performance of photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Homochiral Helical Poly(thiophene)s Accessed via Living Catalyst&#8208;Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic helical polymers form compact, ordered, and inherently chiral structures, enabling their uses in biomimetic applications as well as catalysis. A challenge in using synthetic helical polymers, however, is their tendency to be sensitive to pH and the presence of nucleophiles, Lewis&#8208;acids, or metal ions. We report a strategy to overcome these shortcomings by adapting catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization, a living chain&#8208;growth polymerization typically used to access linear conjugated polymers, for the synthesis of helical poly(thiophene)s. We demonstrate that the helical poly(thiophene)s can be synthesized with a single helicity, incorporated into block copolymers, and functionalized at the chain&#8208;ends, enabling further conjugation and functionalization. The helical poly(thiophene)s are stable to a variety of conditions, providing benefits over other helical polymers which contain sensitive imine or carbonyl&#8208;based functional groups. We anticipate that the ability to access homochiral, heterotelechelic helical conjugated polymers and copolymers will enable new uses of these materials in optoelectronics as well as in applications for mimicking biomacromolecules and other polymers with precisely defined sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveil the Failure of Alkali Ion&#8208;Sulfur Aqueous Batteries: Resolving Water Migration by Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur aqueous battery (SAB) is promising owing to its high theoretical capacity and cost competitiveness. Although decoupled electrolyte design has successfully endowed transition metal ion&#8208;SABs with customizability to achieve high energy density, its effectiveness in alkali ion&#8208;SABs remains problematic. Here, we identify for the first time an intractable phenomenon of alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;driven water migration between decoupled electrolytes through ex&#8208;situ NMR, which is recognized as the origin of the irreversible sulfur redox reactions. To address the challenge, we propose an alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy to effectively regulate water migration by incorporating low molecular polarity index (MPI) anions. In&#8208;situ Raman, synchrotron spectroscopy, and molecule dynamic simulations reveal that the repulsion of low MPI anions to water effectively disrupts the hydration patterns around the alkali cations, and thereby minimizes the concomitant water migration. The elaborated Na+&#8208;SAB achieved an ultrahigh capacity of 1634 mAh g&#8722;1 (97.7% sulfur utilization) and prolonged stability over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the versatility of alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy is further substantiated in Li+&#8208;SAB and K+&#8208;SAB batteries, boosting the scope of following SAB systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Linking Sites&#160;Constructed Non&#8208;Fully&#160;Conjugated Asymmetric Dimerized Giant Molecule Acceptors&#160;for Organic Solar Cells&#160;with an Efficiency of ~20%</title>

         <dc:description>Linking&#8208;site engineering, used to graft two or more monomers, are crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;series giant molecule acceptors (Y&#8208;GMAs). However, the reported Y&#8208;GMAs all use a single&#8208;typed linking site, making it difficult to finely&#8208;tune their optoelectronic properties. Herein, we develop a non&#8208;fully conjugated Y&#8208;GMA (named 2Y&#8208;we), with hybrid linking sites&#160;at the wing and end&#8208;group of monomers, to combine the respective advantages of the wing and end&#8208;group site linked counterparts. Compared to its parental monomer, 2Y&#8208;we shows different intermolecular interaction, crystallinity, packing, and glass transition temperature, allowing optimized active layer morphology (including appropriate phase separation and ordered molecular packing) and stability. Consequently, the D18/2Y&#8208;we&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs) obtain an improved power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE)&#160;of 17.4% with both higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC)&#160;and short&#8208;circuit current density&#160;(JSC), due to the reduced energy loss and efficient exciton dissociation. Inspired by its high VOC&#215;JSC, 2Y&#8208;we is introduced into D18:L8&#8208;BO to fabricate ternary devices. Thanks to the further optimized morphology and improved charge transport, the ternary OSCs achieve a superior PCE of 19.9%, which is the highest value among the reported non&#8208;fully conjugated Y&#8208;GMAs. Our developed hybrid linking&#8208;site engineering for constructing high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;GMAs&#160;offers an approach to boost device efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Body Heat&#8208; and Sunlight&#8208; Driven Self&#8208;Sustaining Motion via Material&#8208;Structure Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diels&#8211;Alder bond&#8208;crosslinked liquid crystal elastomers with low nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures and high reprogrammability were developed, enabling low&#8208;energy, self&#8208;sustained actuators through material&#8208;structure synergy. These actuators achieve high strain rates around 30&#8201;&#176;C, facilitating self&#8208;sustaining motion powered by ambient/body heat or solar energy, with potential in biomedical and environmentally powered applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;sustained actuators powered by natural, low&#8208;energy sources based on liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are attractive as they offer high safety, abundant energy availability, and practicality in applications. However, achieving stable self&#8208;sustaining motion with low&#8208;energy sources requires high actuation strain rates within a narrow temperature range near ambient conditions &#8211; a great challenge as LCEs with low nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures (Tni) generally exhibit reduced actuation strain and strain rates. To address this, we synthesized a carbon nanotube&#8208;doped LCE with a low Tni and reversible Diels&#8211;Alder crosslinks, termed DALCE, and readily (re)fabricated it into specific structures (e.g., twisted&#8208;and&#8208;coiled or bimorph shapes). By leveraging material&#8208;structure synergy, we achieved both low Tni and high actuation strain rates, enabling self&#8208;rolling, self&#8208;breathing and autonomous twisting&#8208;untwisting movements powered by ambient/body temperature or natural sunlight. This low&#8208;energy, self&#8208;sustained actuator design opens new possibilities for LCE&#8208;based biomedical applications and naturally powered automatic devices.

To address this, we synthesized a carbon nanotube-doped LCE with a low T&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt; and reversible Diels&#8211;Alder crosslinks, termed DALCE, and readily (re)fabricated it into specific structures (e.g., twisted-and-coiled or bimorph shapes). By leveraging material-structure synergy, we achieved both low T&lt;sub&gt;ni&lt;/sub&gt; and high actuation strain rates, enabling self-rolling, self-breathing and autonomous twisting-untwisting movements powered by ambient/body temperature or natural sunlight. This low-energy, self-sustained actuator design opens new possibilities for LCE-based biomedical applications and naturally powered automatic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Li+&#8208;Solvents Desolvation by Engineering Nickel Single Atoms into Graphene Membrane toward Fast Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni single atom anchored on the graphene membrane (Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G) was prepared by an in situ electrochemical doping coupled with a self&#8208;assembly strategy. The Ni single atom sites can accelerate the dissociation process of the Li+&#8208;solvent complex and obtain a large number of Li+, which delivers fast sulfur redox kinetics. Furthermore, the large&#8208;sized solvent molecules and polysulfides were largely sieved and restricted when passing through the specific nano&#8208;channels of the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries featuring high energy density are expected to be next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, but are severely impeded by the suppressive Li+&#8208;solvents desolvation process at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, a novel electrochemical in situ doping coupled with a self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed to fabricate the graphene membrane anchored by Ni single atoms (Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G), aimed at promoting the dissociation kinetics of Li+&#8208;solvents complex by combining electrocatalysis and nanochannel sieving effect. Theoretical simulation and in situ Raman spectroscopy characterizations revealed that the Ni&#8208;O5 configuration within the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane is capable of lowering the Li+&#8208;solvent dissociation energy barrier and promoting free Li+ migration, thereby delivering the fast sulfur redox kinetics. In addition, taking advantage of the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane with a special transport channel, the large&#8208;sized solvent molecules and polysulfides were sieved and confined to a great degree. As a result, the Li&#8722;S batteries with the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G on separator as cathode front&#8208;faces exhibit a high capacity of 1169&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a good rate performance and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability, where a capacity decay of only 0.024&#8201;% per cycle after 700 cycles can be achieved. Furthermore, the cell with a sulfur loading of 4.78&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 delivers a high areal capacity of 4.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;C.

         <title>Coordination Topology Design in Anion&#8208;Rich Solvated Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolyte, the equal molar dual&#8208;anion strategy expands the solvation energy level distribution and boosts the Li&#8208;ion transport. Moreover, a universal principle is found based on the coordination topology of the dual&#8208;anion combination: only the combination containing anion with the multi&#8208;coordination site can raise the Li&#8208;ion transport in such systems, supporting the design of high&#8208;rate lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Electrolytes with anion&#8208;rich solvated structures are promising for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their good interfacial compatibility. Nevertheless, limited Li&#8208;ion transport of these electrolytes has hindered their high&#8208;rate application. Here we demonstrate that Li&#8208;ion transport in anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolytes could be facilitated by designing the coordination topology of anions in the solvation structure. Results show that, for a binary&#8208;anion electrolyte, equal&#8208;molar anions show the most expanded energy level distribution of solvation structures, thus reducing the Li&#8208;ion transport energy barrier, and resulting in a Li&#8208;ion conductivity even higher than that of the commercial carbonate electrolyte at a temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. More importantly, we identify a universal principle governing the Li&#8208;ion transport enhancement driven by anion configurations: only the combination of anions with multi&#8208;coordination sites shows facilitation in Li&#8208;ion transport, while the combination of centrosymmetric anions with the mono&#8208;coordination site harms it. The diversified anion&#8208;rich solvated structures also form stable interphases on the electrodes, enabling long&#8208;term cycling of 4.5&#8197;V LMBs at a high current density of 3.78&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Overall, our findings shine new light on developing practical electrolytes for energy&#8208;dense LMBs.

         <title>Sequence Similarity Network Guided Discovery of a Dehydrogenase for Asymmetric Carbonyl Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive sequence similarity network based approach enabled the identification of a diverse array of uncharacterized enzymes from nature, leading to the discovery of several novel asymmetric carbonyl desaturation enzymes. Among them, the most outstanding enzyme, TgDH, demonstrated remarkable stereoselectivity and reactivity, catalyzing the synthesis of various chiral cyclohexenones bearing &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters with high efficiency.







Abstract
Carbonyl dehydrogenation is one of the most valuable transformations in modern synthetic chemistry. As compared to traditional chemical synthesis methods, enzymatic dehydrogenation offers a greener and more selective alternative. However, except for a few rare natural dehydrogenases for desaturation, current enzymatic methods predominantly rely on enzyme promiscuity, which often suffers from lower efficiency and limited reaction controllability. Herein, we employed sequence similarity networks to mine natural dehydrogenases from a vast array of sequences with potential dehydrogenation activity. This approach led to the discovery of an uncharacterized FAD&#8208;dependent enzyme capable of efficiently performing the desymmetrizing desaturation of cyclohexanones, thereby generating diverse cyclohexenones bearing remote &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. The current method has enhanced the turnover frequency (TOF) by approximately 178&#8208;fold as compared to the best existing biocatalytic strategies and displayed almost no overoxidation reactions. Through a combination of experimental assays and computational studies, we elucidated that this enzyme enhances its dehydrogenation capability through an unconventional proton relay system, absent in previously reported enzyme promiscuity systems. Additionally, this streamlined enzymatic process demonstrated scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis with maintained efficiency and selectivity, offering robust and sustainable alternatives for the synthesis of chiral cyclohexenones with high optical purity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent surge of photoinitiated transition&#8208;metal catalysis has provided a novel gateway to access carbo&#8208;heteroatom bonds and molecular space that was not been previously attainable. Through the use of photoexcited species, the formation of C&#8722;X bonds has sought out new mechanistic pathways, finding alternatives to high reaction temperatures and limiting stoichiometric additives. Herein, we report the recent advances on transition&#8208;metal photocatalyzed carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, hoping to expand the synthesis toolkit for chemists in industrial and academic laboratories.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalysis has proven useful in facilitating carbon&#8208;halogen (C&#8722;X) bond formation. Despite the vast number of methodologies reported to furnish these bonds, limitations have remained, warranting continued development. The recent surge of metallaphotoredox&#8208;based transformations has provided a novel gateway to bypass these limitations. Through the use of photoexcited species, the formation of C&#8722;X bonds arise through new mechanistic pathways, finding alternatives to high reaction temperatures and stoichiometric additives. The discovery of this novel strategy has provided access to molecular space that has not been previously attainable. Herein, we report the recent advances on transition&#8208;metal photocatalyzed C&#8722;X bond formation, in hopes of easing the synthetic endeavours for chemists in industrial and academic laboratories.

Through&#8208;space conjugated (TSC) materials with highly efficient device performance and narrowband emission are still challenging. Introducing two bulky TSC blocks restrains the vibrational transitions of the multi&#8208;resonance nitrogen/carbonyl core, with full widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19 and 25&#8197;nm in solution. A record&#8208;high electroluminescent efficiency for a nitrogen/carbonyl system of 26.7&#8201;% with a FWHM of 23&#8197;nm was obtained within the blue spectrum.







Abstract
Organic luminescent materials featuring noncovalent through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) have attracted considerable attention. However, the presence of multiple vibrational energy levels and weak spatial electron delocalization typically results in broad emission peaks for TSC&#8208;based emitters, significantly impeding their extensive application in optoelectronic technologies. Herein, two TSC emitters, TSFQ&#8208;TRZ and TSFQ&#8208;Ph, were synthesized by integrating a fused nitrogen/carbonyl skeleton with various adjacent arene 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TPTRZ) and phenyl group segments through a rigid spiro spacer. These emitters exhibited narrow emissions, with full widths at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#8197;nm and 25&#8197;nm, respectively. Experimental and theoretical investigations unveiled that the TPTRZ segment introduces steric hindrance, while simultaneously suppressing molecular vibrations through intramolecular interactions&#8212;a key factor in achieving narrow emissions. Leveraging this narrow blue emission, electroluminescent devices employing TSFQ&#8208;TRZ as the emitter achieved an impressive maximum external quantum efficiency of 26.7&#8201;%, which further increased to 28.3&#8201;% when sensitized by phosphorescent emitter. This work demonstrates highly efficient, narrowband emissions from TSC&#8208;based emitters, thereby expanding their potential applications in the electroluminescence field.

         <title>Giant Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in a Chiral Polar Crystal based on Helical One&#8208;dimensional Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical 1D lead halide perovskites crystallized in the polar C2 space group demonstrate strong circular dichroism and achieve an extraordinary 15&#8197;V open&#8208;circuit voltage via the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE). This work highlights low&#8208;dimensional crystal symmetry engineering as a transformative approach for designing high&#8208;performance BPVE materials.







Abstract
Chiral polar crystals composed of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) conducting materials exhibit unique physical phenomena. The present study focused on helical 1D&#8208;structured lead halide perovskite derivatives with chiral naphthylethylamine as organic cations, (R or S&#8208;NEA)[PbI3](R&#8208;NEA=R&#8208;(+)&#8208;1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine, S&#8208;NEA=S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine). A thermally controlled crystallization method has successfully yielded crystals with a polar chiral space group of C2. The crystals show significantly intense signals of circular dichroism (CD) originating from the asymmetrical electronic transition characteristic of helical 1D structure. In addition, generation of an anomalous zero&#8208;bias photocurrent (bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE)) was observed with an open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 15&#8197;V, which is five times larger than the band gap. This study suggests that parallel arrangements of the helical semiconducting materials are the promising way to obtain chiral polar crystal exhibiting high performance BPVE.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Assembly of Enzyme&#8208;Micelle Systems for Semi&#8208;Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a bio&#8208;hybrid assembly inspired by lipid&#8208;protein interactions in nature by utilizing photosensitized surfactants that self&#8208;assemble into light&#8208;absorbing micellar scaffolds capable of interfacing with hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases. This semi&#8208;artificial approach enabled benchmark turnover numbers for solar H2 production and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion, establishing a versatile platform for future photocatalytic transformations.







Abstract
Supramolecular surfactants provide a versatile platform to construct systems for solar fuel synthesis, for example via the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic photosensitizers and catalysts into diverse supramolecular structures. However, the utilization of amphiphilic photosensitizers in solar fuel production has predominantly focused on yielding gaseous products, such as molecular hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) with turnover numbers (TONs) of synthetic catalysts typically in the range of hundreds to thousands. Inspired by biological lipid&#8208;protein interactions, we present herein a bio&#8208;hybrid assembly strategy that utilizes photosensitizers as surfactants to form micellar scaffolds that interface with enzymes, namely hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases, for semi&#8208;artificial photosynthesis. Specifically, surfactants with a tris(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine)ruthenium(II) head group provide high photocatalytic activity upon association with the enzymes as their positively charged [Ru(bpy)3]2+ complex electrostatically interacts with the enzymes favorably to enable direct electron transfer at the micelle&#8208;enzyme interface. Time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy support the beneficial charge carrier dynamics of the reductively quenched [Ru(bpy)3]+ species when the enzymes are introduced in the micellar solution. Thus, a biohybrid concept is introduced for solar fuel synthesis using a biomimetic enzyme&#8208;micellar system, providing also a platform for other photocatalytic transformations using enzymes in the future.

         <title>Synthesis of Selenium&#8208;Doped Heteroacenes: Unveiling the External Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes have been synthesized to unveil the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host molecules. Compared to oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based analogues, selenium&#8208;embedded host enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling, accelerates reverse intersystem crossing, and improves bipolar transport, enabling the assembly of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a wide color gamut.







Abstract
The internal heavy&#8208;atom effect (IHAE) has garnered considerable attention as a promising approach for developing highly efficient emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nevertheless, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host materials, despite being equally important, has been largely overlooked. In this study, we introduce a selenium&#8208;doping strategy to unlock the potential of EHAE in host molecules. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a straightforward method for synthesizing structurally diverse pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes via an intramolecular radical cyclization of 2&#8208;(arylselanyl)pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;amine derivatives. This method facilitates the rapid construction of a novel host molecule, DCz&#8208;BSeP, by incorporating two carbazole groups into the benzo[4,5]selenopheno[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine (BSeP) core. Compared to its oxygen&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BFP) and sulfur&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BTP) counterparts, the introduction of selenium in DCz&#8208;BSeP significantly enhances spin&#8208;orbit coupling and accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing rate of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters by threefold, while also improving bipolar transport properties. These enhancements make DCz&#8208;BSeP an ideal bipolar host for high&#8208;performance, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut TADF&#8208;OLEDs, with notably reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off. Additionally, its successful application in phosphorescent OLEDs (Ph&#8208;OLEDs) and TADF&#8208;sensitized narrowband red fluorescence OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) highlights its versatility in advancing OLED technologies.

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation of Allyl Ethers: Optimization, Scope, Mechanism and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl ethers has been developed by using ketones as the C&#8208;nucleophiles. Linear vinyl ethers or branched allyl ethers were readily formed in high yield with excellent regioselectivity by changing the reaction conditions. Bimetallic synergistic catalysis with an achiral Pd(0) catalyst and a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;Ni(II) complex enabled the synthesis of a variety of enantioenriched allyl ethers.







Abstract
Vinyl ethers and allyl ethers are important motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods toward their synthesis, direct allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl ethers is one of the most efficient approaches. In this study, one of two regioisomers, a vinyl ether or an allyl ether, could be obtained, depending on whether a Lewis acid co&#8208;catalyst was present. Furthermore, branched allyl ethers were smoothly prepared in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 b/l, 99&#8201;% ee) by synergistic catalysis with an achiral Pd(0) complex and a chiral Lewis acid catalyst.

Bimetallic synergistic catalysis with an achiral Pd(0) catalyst and a chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;-dioxide-Ni(II) complex enabled the synthesis of a variety of enantioenriched allyl ethers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinyl ethers and allyl ethers are important motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods toward their synthesis, direct allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl ethers is one of the most efficient approaches. In this study, one of two regioisomers, a vinyl ether or an allyl ether, could be obtained, depending on whether a Lewis acid co-catalyst was present. Furthermore, branched allyl ethers were smoothly prepared in excellent regio- and enantioselectivity (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;, 99&#8201;% ee) by synergistic catalysis with an achiral Pd(0) complex and a chiral Lewis acid catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective and Efficient Upcycling of Polyesters from Waste Plastic Blends Enabled by a Rationally Designed Manganese Pincer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient hydrogenative upcycling of polyesters was developed enabled by rationally designed PNNH&#8208;pincer manganese catalysts, which not only allow the upcycling of single&#8208;component polyester, but also enable the selective hydrogenolysis of polyester from waste plastic blends or contaminants into highly valuable oxygenated products under very mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic studies supported that the high efficiency of this protocol is attributed to the improved stability and reactivity of the catalyst with the extended &#960;&#8208;system and the N&#8722;H moiety on the side arm.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new class of earth&#8208;abundant pincer manganese catalysts that not only enable the efficient conversion of single&#8208;component post&#8208;consumer polyesters with a turnover number (TON) of up to 5300, but more importantly, allow the selective upcycling of polyesters from waste plastic blends (e.g., nylon, PA; polyethylene, PE; polyurethane, PU; polyvinyl chloride, PVC; cotton) or contaminants such as pigment, aluminum, or glass into highly valuable oxygenated products under mild conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations revealed that the exceptional efficiency of this protocol is due to the use of rationally designed quinaldine&#8208;based PNNH&#8208;type Mn complexes with an extended &#960;&#8208;system and an N&#8722;H moiety on the side arm to simultaneously enhance the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. In addition, the incorporation of dual metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) relay catalysis more effectively facilitates the key steps of this transformation, including H2 activation and hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted hydride transfer.

         <title>Constructing Dense Morphology of Sn with High Reversibility under High Areal&#8208;capacity for Anode&#8208;Free Tin Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiourea (TU) was proposed as an effective additive to constructing dense morphology of deposited Sn in acidic methylsulfonate&#8208;based electrolyte. By participating in double electrode layer, TU reduces exchange current density of Sn2+/Sn redox, suppresses rampant two&#8208;dimension, and makes Sn anode exert high coulombic efficiency of 99.85% at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and high&#8208;performance anode&#8208;free Sn battery was developed.







Abstract
Sn electrode possesses high reversibility, redox kinetics and corrosion resistance, as well as non&#8208;toxic and environmental compatibility, which is competitive candidate for aqueous batteries. However, due to huge size of deposition particles and &#8220;dead Sn&#8221;, it is a great challenge to obtain high areal&#8208;capacity (&gt;5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a highly reversible Sn redox electrochemistry with high areal&#8208;capacity enabled by thiourea additive. Systematical investigations reveal the participation of thiourea molecules in the electrical double layer, reducing exchange current density and suppressing rampant two&#8208;dimensional diffusion. As a result, flat and dense scale&#8208;like deposition Sn morphology is obtained, which enables high cycle stability with high areal&#8208;capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for symmetrical cell with lean electrolyte (25&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and delivering a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;% with practical high 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 area&#8208;capacity for asymmetrical cell. More importantly, anode&#8208;free Organic||Sn battery is developed, and 62&#8201;% capacity retention can be obtained after 570 cycles.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Heli(aminoborane)s with Highly Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three &#960;&#8208;extended heli(aminoborane)s (E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C) were synthesized to find a balance between fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;lum) and absorption/luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs/glum). These molecules exhibited remarkable photophysical properties, including high &#934;lum and narrowband emission (full width at half maximum, FWHM=16&#8197;nm), in which E[10]HAB&#8208;A boosted circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) up to 583&#8197;M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Helical molecular carbons (HMCs) possess high absorption/luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs/glum) and significant luminescence quantum yield (&#934;lum), resulting in a high circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness (BCPL), which is essential for the development of CPL materials for practical applications. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN)&#8208;doped HMCs, named &#960;&#8208;extended heli(aminoborane)s (E[10]HAB&#8208;A, E[10]HAB&#8208;B and E[10]HAB&#8208;C), consisting of laterally &#960;&#8208;extended [10]helicene skeleton with alternating N and B atoms at the inner rim. The aromaticity, electronic structures, and photophysical properties of E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C were systematically investigated through experiments and theoretical calculations. E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C displayed remarkable photophysical properties, including high molar extinction coefficient and bright narrowband emission. The isolated enantiomers of E[10]HAB&#8208;A/B/C exhibited intense circular dichroism (CD) and CPL, in which E[10]HAB&#8208;A shows gabs and glum values up to 0.024 and 0.017, simultaneously with high &#934;lum of 82&#8201;% and a narrow full width at half maximum of 16&#8197;nm. Accordingly, E[10]HAB&#8208;A exhibits a BCPL as high as 583&#8197;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, which is the largest value among the reported BN&#8208;doped HMCs. Our study indicates that inner rim BN&#8208;doping and &#960;&#8208;extension are effective strategies to achieve high &#934;lum and balanced glum values in HMCs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven CuAAC Reaction Catalyzed by Photosensitive Biohybrids Energized by Lactate for Boosting Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system has been presented for boosting cancer immunotherapy. Powered by lactate, the biohybrid can trigger the CuAAC reaction to generate active drugs in situ through bacterial respiration. Of note, under illumination, the CuAAC reaction can be further accelerated.







Abstract
As a typical bioorthogonal reaction, the copper (I) catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction strongly depends on the reducing agents and the rate of the CuAAC reaction is far from sufficient to produce drug agents under physiological conditions. It is necessary and highly demanding to develop an efficient CuAAC reaction without using chemical reducing agents. Herein, inspired by the extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanisms of the electroactive bacteria within the realm of synthetic biology, a photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system for boosting cancer immunotherapy is constructed. The bacteria specifically anaerobically catabolize lactate at the tumor site, accompanied by transferring electrons to the bioorthogonal catalyst, thereby triggering the CuAAC reaction to produce active drugs in situ. Strikingly, under illumination, the photoelectrons generated by attached AuNPs can be transported into bacterial cytoplasm to accelerate the CuAAC reaction by promoting cellular metabolism. The biohybrid enables synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD), immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy and alleviation of immunosuppressive microenvironment. Ingeniously, ICD and lactate consumption both boost the efficacy of ICB immunotherapy. Overall, the system provides a bridge between the tumor metabolism and CuAAC reaction through bacterial respiration, offering fascinating opportunities for controlled synthesis of active molecules by bioorthogonal catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;As a typical bioorthogonal reaction, the copper (I) catalyzed azide-alkyne 1,3-cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction strongly depends on the reducing agents and the rate of the CuAAC reaction is far from sufficient to produce drug agents under physiological conditions. It is necessary and highly demanding to develop an efficient CuAAC reaction without using chemical reducing agents. Herein, inspired by the extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanisms of the electroactive bacteria within the realm of synthetic biology, a photo-assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system for boosting cancer immunotherapy is constructed. The bacteria specifically anaerobically catabolize lactate at the tumor site, accompanied by transferring electrons to the bioorthogonal catalyst, thereby triggering the CuAAC reaction to produce active drugs in situ. Strikingly, under illumination, the photoelectrons generated by attached AuNPs can be transported into bacterial cytoplasm to accelerate the CuAAC reaction by promoting cellular metabolism. The biohybrid enables synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD), immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy and alleviation of immunosuppressive microenvironment. Ingeniously, ICD and lactate consumption both boost the efficacy of ICB immunotherapy. Overall, the system provides a bridge between the tumor metabolism and CuAAC reaction through bacterial respiration, offering fascinating opportunities for controlled synthesis of active molecules by bioorthogonal catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chlorinated Bithiophene Imide&#8208;based n&#8208;Type Polymers: Synthesis, Structure&#8208;Property Correlations, and Applications in Organic Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes with optimized geometries and electronic properties is imperative for advancing n&#8208;type polymers and organic electronic devices. We report here the design and synthesis of two chlorinated imide&#8208;functionalized electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, namely chlorine&#8208;substituted bithiophene imide (ClBTI) and its fused dimer (ClBTI2). The corresponding polymers show near&#8208;planar framework, appropriate frontier molecular orbital levels, and good solubility. When integrated into organic thin&#8208;film transistors, ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer afforded unipolar electron mobility of up to 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Continuous interpenetrating networks with large fibrillar structures can be formed by introducing these polymers with ordered structure, high crystallinity, and sizable electron mobility as the third component. Investigations of charge transfer kinetics and energy loss analyses unveiled that ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer P(ClBTI2&#8208;BTI) enables optimized charge transport, reduced charge recombination, and minimized non&#8208;radiative loss within the all&#8208;polymer blends, yielding a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.35% (certified: 19.20%). The structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships provide valuable insights into the design of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes and n&#8208;type polymers, making a great progress in the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers for organic electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrogenation Reaction via Facet Engineering for Efficient Conversion of Nitrate to Ammonia in Actual Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the competitive relationship between nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the conventional approach to improve Faradaic efficiency is to select a catalyst without HER activity. Nevertheless, such strategy not only limits the application of HER catalysts in NO3&#8208;RR, but also causes insufficient hydrogen source, thereby sacrificing ammonia yield rate. We believe that HER catalysts should not be excluded from hydrogenation reduction, and HER&#8208;involvement in NO3&#8208;RR can achieve both high Faradaic efficiency and ammonia yield rate. Herein, taking traditional water electrolysis material Co3O4 as model system, we employ facet engineering and obtain a Faradaic efficiency of 97.51% and an ammonia yield rate of 4.33 mg&#8208;N&#183;cm&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1 . Excellent performance is attributed to the oxygen vacancy on crystal facet, which greatly promote water dissociation and capture HER intermediate for NO3&#8208;RR, successfully shifting the reaction pathway from hydrogen evolution to nitrate hydrogenation. Beyond material development, we construct a hybrid reactor to address and achieve an ammonia recovery rate of 1216.8 g&#8208;N&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;d&#8208;1 in nuclear industry wastewater with ultra&#8208;high nitrate concentration. This study breaks through the limitation of HER catalyst in NO3&#8208;RR, which provides a significant insight into the catalyst designing and hydrogenation mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Anodic Decomposition Pathway of Supramolecular Lithium Borate for Rationally Tuned Interphase Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational tailoring and molecular&#8208;level engineering of stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (CEIs) are paramount to advancing the performance of next&#8208;generation high energy, layered nickel&#8208;rich oxide based lithium metal batteries. However, developing well&#8208;tailored electrolyte additives with rationally controlled interfacial chemistry remains highly challenging. Here, we designed and synthesized two lithium borates: lithium (2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)trifluoroborate (C&#8208;LiMCFB) and lithium (15&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,5,8,11,14&#8208;pentaoxahexadecan)trifluoroborate (L&#8208;LiMCFB), incorporating cyclic 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) and linear pentaethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEGME) as respective host groups tethered to the boron center. In C&#8208;LiMCFB, the supramolecular polydentate chelation/de&#8208;chelation of the 15C5 with Li+ could sequentially deactivate/activate the anodic decomposition of the C&#8208;O bonds, therefore leading to the controlled cleavage pathway of B&#8208;O and C&#8208;O bonds. The controlled interfacial chemistry leads to the formation of a uniform CEI layer, rich in lithium boron&#8208;oxygen clusters interwoven with LiF, on the NCM811 surface. This novel CEI configuration demonstrates an exceptional balance of mechanical robustness, adhesiveness, and toughness, providing highly desirable protection for the NCM811 cathode. The discovery of these novel supramolecular boron&#8208;based lithium salts not only unlocks supramolecular chemistry for rational electrolyte tuning but also provides a deeper understanding of the CEI formation mechanism in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric 1,4&#8208;Dihydropentalene&#8208;containing Building Blocks for High Mobility Ladder&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nearly amorphous conjugated polymers, while lacking long&#8208;range order, exhibit high charge carrier mobility and enhanced flexibility, making them ideal for flexible or stretchable OFET applications. However, research on novel structural blocks for this class of materials remains limited. We report the synthesis of two derivatives of the 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;a]indene (DHI) core, where two thieno groups are appended to each end in order to reduce torsional disorder with adjacent co&#8208;monomers. The two 1,4&#8208;dihydropentalene containing isomers, anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;Br and syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;Br, feature distinct thieno group orientations, leading to differences in their electronic properties. The anti isomer shows a fully delocalized conjugation pathway, while the syn isomer exhibits cross&#8208;conjugation, limiting delocalization along the polymer backbone. These monomers were co&#8208;polymerized with benzothiadiazole (BT) to form two conjugated polymers, anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT and syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT, both with highly planar backbones, good solubility, and solution processability. Morphological studies reveal that anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT exhibits more ordered stacking and higher crystallinity than syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT. Devices based on anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT show significantly better performance, with a hole mobility of 2.38 cm&#178; V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, slightly higher than&#160;the widely studied pIDTBT under identical conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrazole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of medicinal and agrochemical compounds and as such the development of methods for their enantioselective incorporation into molecular scaffolds is highly desirable. This manuscript describes the effective formation of fused pyrazolo&#8208;pyridones and &#8208;pyranones in high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99:1 er)&#160;via&#160;an isoselenourea (HyperSe) catalyzed enantioselective [3+3]&#8208;Michael addition&#8208;cyclisation process using readily available pyrazolylsulfonamides or pyrazolones as pronucleophiles and&#160;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides as starting materials. Mechanistic analysis indicates an unusual self&#8208;correcting reaction pathway involving preferential [1,2]&#8208;addition of the pronucleophile to initially generate an intermediate amide or ester, that can be intercepted by isoselenourea acylation, leading to productive formation of the fused heterocyclic products with high enantiocontrol. The scope and limitations of this process is developed across a range of examples, with insight into the factors leading to the observed enantioselectivity provided by DFT analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Expansion via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryne Insertion into C&#8722;C Bonds of Benzocyclobutenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first insertion of arynes into non&#8208;enolizable ketones is demonstrated in this ortho&#8208;phenylene ring expansion of benzocyclobutenones using 2&#8208;haloaryl boronates as the coupling partner. In this transformation, Pd plays a dual role in both aryne formation and C&#8722;C activation.







Abstract
Insertion of arynes into cyclic C&#8722;C bonds provides a straightforward approach for ring expansion with an ortho&#8208;phenylene moiety; however, the current scope of substrates has been restricted to enolizable ketones. Here we report the first example of aryne&#8208;insertion into non&#8208;enolizable ketones through Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond activation of benzocyclobutenones. 2&#8208;Haloaryl boronates were employed as an unconventional aryne precursor. The reaction shows a wide substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. The mechanistic studies reveal an interesting dual role of the Pd catalyst for both aryne generation and C&#8722;C bond activation.

         <title>High&#8208;Connectivity 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with pdp Net for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel high&#8208;connectivity 3D COFs, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662, are constructed using a combination of D2h&#8208;symmetric 8&#8208;nodal and D3h&#8208;symmetric 6&#8208;nodal building blocks. These COFs feature an unprecedented [8+6]&#8208;c pdp net with rare mesoporous polyhedral cages and exhibit outstanding C2H2/CO2 separation capabilities.







Abstract
High&#8208;connectivity 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention due to their structural complexity, stability, and potential for functional applications. However, the synthesis of 3D COFs using mixed high&#8208;nodal building units remains a substantial challenge. In this work, we introduce two novel 3D COFs, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662, which are constructed using a combination of D2h&#8208;symmetric 8&#8208;nodal and D3h&#8208;symmetric 6&#8208;nodal building blocks. These COFs feature an unprecedented [8+6]&#8208;c pdp net with rare mesoporous polyhedral cages (~3.9&#8197;nm). Remarkably, JUC&#8208;661 and JUC&#8208;662 exhibit outstanding separation capabilities, achieving adsorption selectivities of 4.3 and 5.9, respectively, for C2H2/CO2 (1/1, v/v) mixtures. Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm their excellent separation capability, maintaining this performance even under conditions of 100&#8201;% humidity. Monte Carlo simulations and DFT calculations indicate that the exceptional adsorption performance is attributed to the well&#8208;defined pore cavities of the COFs, with fluorination of the building unit further enhancing C2H2 selectivity through improved electrostatic and host&#8211;guest interactions. This study expands the structural diversity of COFs and highlights their potential for low&#8208;energy separation processes.

         <title>The Substituent&#8208;Effect in NHCP&#8208;Plumbylenes with a Phosphaplumbene Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of aryl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted NHCP&#8208;plumbylenes is achieved through metathesis reactions. Based on computational studies, the substituent effect and the potential double bond character in these species are discussed. A formal [2+2] cycloaddition at a P&#8722;Pb bond demonstrates the synthetic equivalence to double bonds.







Abstract
This work explores the use of plumbylene&#8208;phosphinidenes to address the challenge of isolating P=Pb bonds. Herein, we report the synthesis of three N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene phosphinidene (NHCP) substituted chlorotetrylene dimers [(IDipp)PECl]2 (E=Ge, Sn, Pb; IDipp=C([N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)CH]2)). Substituent attachment via salt metathesis (E=Sn, Pb) enables the isolation of NHCP&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted stannylene (IDipp)PSn(SiTms2SiTol3) as well as NHCP&#8208;silyl&#8208; and NHCP&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted plumbylenes (IDipp)PPb(SiTms2SiTol3) and (IDipp)PPb(mTer) (mTer=2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3, Tms=Trimethylsilyl). Access to these structures not only expands this chemistry to the heaviest of group 14 elements but also provides a deeper understanding of the substituent effect on NHCP&#8208;tetrylene bonding. Computational studies demonstrate that both silyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted species exhibit partial multiple bond character, with the silyl&#8208;substituted species showing higher bond orders and reduced polarization. This is further supported by the short P&#8722;E bond lengths observed in their solid&#8208;state structures. Finally, the formal [2+2] cycloaddition of diphenylketene to (IDipp)PPb(mTer) provides experimental evidence for the ability of NHCP&#8208;plumbylenes to serve as synthetic equivalents of P=Pb double bonds.

         <title>Maximizing the Accessibility of Acid Sites Within Zeolite Catalysts for Syngas Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the effective diffusion length into the relationship between the Thiele modulus and effectiveness factors of reaction rates, a 12MR channel length of 60&#8197;nm is identified to approach the threshold length for full access to the 8MR acid sites of MOR zeolite in direct syngas conversion. Consequently, MOR60 exhibits remarkable catalytic performance with CO conversion reaching 33&#8201;% and ethylene selectivity 69&#8201;%.







Abstract
Mass transport within zeolites is pivotal in determining the accessibility of active sites to reactants and hence the catalytic performance. However, there lacks of quantitative guidance for synthesis of desired zeolites with reduced diffusion limitation. Herein, we take mordenite (MOR) zeolite as a model, which is characterized by 12&#8208;membered rings (MR) channels as transport path towards the active sites within the 8MR side pockets for syngas conversion to light olefins. By correlating the effective diffusion lengths (

) with the Thiele modulus and the effectiveness factors of reaction rates over a composite catalyst ZnAlOx&#8208;MOR, we determine that the shortest 12MR channel length (

2L

) of 60&#8197;nm in this study is close to the threshold length necessary for full access to the 8MR acid sites. As a result, it exhibits excellent catalytic performance with CO conversion reaching 33&#8201;% and ethylene selectivity 69&#8201;%. Furthermore, the methodology is general and essential for further development of efficient zeolite catalysts with fully accessible active sites.

         <title>Abstraction of Hydride from Alkanes and Dihydrogen by the Perfluorotrityl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the isolation of a perfluorotrityl cation (F15Tr+) as a salt with halogenated carborane anions. These salts are stable at ambient temperature in the solid state. As predicted by theoretical calculations, F15Tr+ displays remarkable propensity for abstraction of a hydride. It extracts a hydride rapidly from alkanes and slowly even from dihydrogen.







Abstract
Lewis acids play a central role in a large variety of chemical transformations. The reactivity of the strongest Lewis acids is typically studied in the context of affinity towards hard bases, such as fluoride or oxygenous species. Carbocations can be viewed as soft Lewis acids, possessing significant affinity for softer bases, such as hydride. This work presents the ambient&#8208;temperature isolation of salts of the perfluorotrityl cation ((C6F5)3C+ or F15Tr+) in combination with halogenated carborane anions. The F15Tr+ cation exhibits remarkable hydride affinity, illustrated by the observation of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and of the rapid abstraction of hydride from &#8722;CH2&#8722;groups in alkanes. Theoretical studies support the favorability of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and indicate that the hydride abstraction from alkanes proceeds via a concerted hydride transfer process that is sensitive to steric effects.

As predicted by theoretical calculations, F&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;Tr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; displays remarkable propensity for abstraction of a hydride. It extracts a hydride rapidly from alkanes and slowly even from dihydrogen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis acids play a central role in a large variety of chemical transformations. The reactivity of the strongest Lewis acids is typically studied in the context of affinity towards hard bases, such as fluoride or oxygenous species. Carbocations can be viewed as soft Lewis acids, possessing significant affinity for softer bases, such as hydride. This work presents the ambient-temperature isolation of salts of the perfluorotrityl cation ((C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or F&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;Tr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in combination with halogenated carborane anions. The F&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;Tr&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation exhibits remarkable hydride affinity, illustrated by the observation of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and of the rapid abstraction of hydride from &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;groups in alkanes. Theoretical studies support the favorability of hydride abstraction from dihydrogen, and indicate that the hydride abstraction from alkanes proceeds via a concerted hydride transfer process that is sensitive to steric effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated TEMPO&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photo&#8208;Induced Hydrogen Peroxide Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitroxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF) was synthesized using a one&#8208;pot strategy for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The involvement of the TEMPO active site accelerates photogenerated charge separation. It promotes O2 adsorption in the Yeager&#8208;type two&#8208;electron O2 reduction pathway, resulting in an H2O2 yield of 10066&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a water&#8208;benzyl alcohol system.







Abstract
Molecular engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offers an alternative approach to conventional anthraquinone oxidation via photo&#8208;induced H2O2 production from O2 reduction. Despite their potential, reported photocatalysts suffer limited proton mobility, low selectivity, and insufficient charge separation and utilization. Herein, we report a nitroxyl radical (TEMPO) decorated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;COF photocatalyst via a one&#8208;pot strategy. Under visible light irradiation, highly crystalline TAPP&#8208;TPDA&#8208;TEMPO&#8208;COF (TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF) exhibits a remarkable photocatalytic H2O2 yield of 10066&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in two&#8208;phase water&#8208;benzyl alcohol (10&#8201;% BA) system through direct two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) pathway. The mechanistic study by DFT calculations and in situ DRIFT spectra suggests Yeager&#8208;type adsorption of *O2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate on the nitroxyl radical site (N&#8722;O&#8901;). The efficient photocatalytic performance and stability of TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF are attributed to the involvement of the nitroxyl radical, which enhances selective O2 adsorption, establishes a distinct electron density distribution, and facilitates photogenerated charge separation compared to TT&#8208;HT&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF counterparts. This study uncovers a new perspective for constructing metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;mediated radical&#8208;based COFs for sustainable energy conversion, storage, and biomedical applications.

         <title>Discovery of Covalent and Cell&#8208;Active ALKBH5 Inhibitors with Potent Antileukemia Effects In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by a non&#8208;catalytic C200&#8208;covalent strategy, a series of maleimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as covalent ALKBH5 inhibitors. Compound 18&#8201;l exhibited good ALKBH5 inhibitory activity, and excellent in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects. Furthermore, 18&#8201;l also had intracellular targeting at the proteomic level.







Abstract
The N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase ALKBH5 is the only other identified m6A eraser except for FTO, and dysregulated ALKBH5 functions were closely associated with leukemogenesis. However, the development of ALKBH5 inhibitors is slow compared to FTO inhibitors. Inspired by a non&#8208;catalytic C200&#8208;covalent strategy, a series of maleimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as potent and covalent ALKBH5 inhibitors in this work. The analog 18&#8201;l exhibited excellent inhibitory effects on ALKBH5 (IC50=0.62&#8197;&#956;M), and exerted a strong antiproliferative effect on NB4 cells with IC50 of 0.63&#8197;&#956;M. The Kd value of 18&#8201;l binding to ALKBH5 was 804&#8197;nM, while no binding was observed with FTO. This result indicated that 18&#8201;l was a highly selective inhibitor of ALKBH5 rather than FTO. Additionally, proteomic experiments showed that 18&#8201;l directly targeted ALKBH5 in cells and altered m6A levels on mRNA, blocked the related downstream signal pathways, promoted differentiation, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, 18&#8201;l exerted excellent in vivo antitumor activity with TGITV values of 66.3&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mg/kg in NB4 tumor xenograft models.

         <title>Superhelical Self&#8208;Assembly of Microcrystals from Cyclodipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclodipeptide platform delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Expression of chirality at macroscopic scale through solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up assembly is accompanied by the formation of complex superstructures. It undergoes complicated pathway including the hierarchical organization of molecular blocks in a spontaneous and ordered manner. Here we present a cyclodipeptide platform which delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. Homochiral linear dipeptides bearing tyrosine and phenylglycine residue go through cyclization to afford cyclodipeptides, leading to the in situ reaction&#8208;induced aggregation into giant helices with ultra&#8208;high yields and phase purity. The pathway comprises formation of subunit microcrystals and the subsequent assembly through adhesion of favorable planes. The cyclodipeptide adopts a folded geometry that generates 2D hydrogen bonded networks differing from the typical 1D duplex hydrogen bonding of diketopiperazines skeletons. The assembly of subunit crystals driven by the hydrogen bonding undergoes dislocations mediated by the inherent chirality of cyclodipeptides. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Dominant Face&#8208;On Oriented Perylene&#8208;Diimide Interlayers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry has been used to synthesize a non&#8208;ionic cathode interlayer (PDIBr&#8208;TOT). The dominant face&#8208;on orientation arising from the bulky and extended side chains affords a solar cell efficiency of 19.52&#8201;%, out&#8208;performing typical self&#8208;doping interlayers. Furthermore, the weak electron&#8208;donating side chains in the PDIBr&#8208;TOT interlayers remarkably enhance the device stability.







Abstract
Electron transport properties of cathode interlayers are crucial to high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). We propose a novel approach to enhance electron transport of cathode interlayers through controlling a preferential face&#8208;on molecular orientation of non&#8208;ionic perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208; (PDI) based cathode interlayers with restricted n&#8208;doping effects. 1&#8208;(2,5,8&#8208;trioxadec&#8208;10&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole (TOT) units as bulky and extended side chains were incorporated into brominated&#8208;PDIs via click chemistry to yield PDIBr&#8208;TOT. TOT side chains impart PDI&#8208;based interlayers with a dominant face&#8208;on orientation, meanwhile leading to a negligible doping effect due to their weak electron&#8208;donating properties. Impressively, at a slight doping level, higher electron mobility is gained through efficient vertical charge transport channels built by preferred face&#8208;on molecular orientations of PDIBr&#8208;TOT, beating the results acquired through strong doping effects of traditional PDIBr&#8722;N with an edge&#8208;on orientation. Thus, PDIBr&#8208;TOT can suppress exciton recombination and lower the surface energies for good contact with active layers, consequently leading to increases in fill factor and short&#8208;circuit current. Integrating PDIBr&#8208;TOT with various active layers, a remarkable efficiency of 19.52&#8201;% is obtained. Moreover, device stability is enhanced by restrained doping effects. Modulating face&#8208;on orientations of cathode interlayers prescribed here will encourage further innovative designs of high&#8208;performance cathode interlayers towards OSC advances.

We propose a novel approach to enhance electron transport of cathode interlayers through controlling a preferential face-on molecular orientation of non-ionic perylene-diimide- (PDI) based cathode interlayers with restricted n-doping effects. 1-(2,5,8-trioxadec-10-yl)-1,2,3-triazole (TOT) units as bulky and extended side chains were incorporated into brominated-PDIs via click chemistry to yield PDIBr-TOT. TOT side chains impart PDI-based interlayers with a dominant face-on orientation, meanwhile leading to a negligible doping effect due to their weak electron-donating properties. Impressively, at a slight doping level, higher electron mobility is gained through efficient vertical charge transport channels built by preferred face-on molecular orientations of PDIBr-TOT, beating the results acquired through strong doping effects of traditional PDIBr&#8722;N with an edge-on orientation. Thus, PDIBr-TOT can suppress exciton recombination and lower the surface energies for good contact with active layers, consequently leading to increases in fill factor and short-circuit current. Integrating PDIBr-TOT with various active layers, a remarkable efficiency of 19.52&#8201;% is obtained. Moreover, device stability is enhanced by restrained doping effects. Modulating face-on orientations of cathode interlayers prescribed here will encourage further innovative designs of high-performance cathode interlayers towards OSC advances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Free&#8208;Electron Transfer Reversal and dz2&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Modulation on Core&#8208;shell NiS@Au Cocatalysts for Highly Selective H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiS&#8208;induced free&#8208;electron reversal migration discharges dz2&#8208;orbital electrons of Au cocatalysts to reduce the antibonding occupancy of Au&#948;+&#8208;Oad bonds, thus improving O2 adsorption and stabilizing *OOH intermediates on NiS@Au cocatalysts to achieve highly selective H2O2 photosynthesis.







Abstract
Spontaneous free&#8208;electron migration usually occurs on the interface between host photocatalysts and cocatalysts, but the influences of the charge transfer direction on the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) of cocatalysts have not been taken seriously. Herein, an innovative electron&#8208;transfer reversal is proposed to direct the free&#8208;electron transfer in a way that enables highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR on Au cocatalysts. To this end, metallic Au nanoparticles are originally loaded on NiS particles to fabricate novel core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 surface by a directional photodeposition procedure. XAS spectra and DFT calculations disclose that the intergrated NiS induces a reversed free&#8208;electron transfer from Au nanoparticles to NiS core, thus essentially modulating dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy of Au atoms to enhance O2 adsorption and stabilize key *OOH intermediates, endowing core&#8211;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts with a highly selective 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR process for efficient H2O2 evolution. Consequently, the optimized g&#8208;C3N4/NiS@Au photocatalyst achieves a remarkably promoted H2O2&#8208;production rate of 264.82&#8197;&#956;mol/h/50&#8197;mg in the air environment, possessing a high apparent quantum efficiency of 8.07&#8201;% under visible light. This work provides novel insights on purposefully steering free&#8208;electron transfer direction to engineer dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy, offering a feasible approach for designing highly active photocatalysts and beyond.

         <title>Ultrathin Polymersomes with Controllable Light&#8208;Responsivity via Adjusting the Electronic Effect from Para&#8208;Substituents of Azobenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with vesicular thickness of ~2.0&#8197;nm were crafted using the self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs). The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transition toward these UTPS was achieved owing to the photo&#8208;isomerization feature of azobenzenes, where the isomerization rate of these UTPS is highly dependent on the electronic effect of the para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release performance using these light&#8208;responsive UTPSs as carriers proved the potential on bionanotechnology.







Abstract
Achieving ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with controllable light&#8208;responsive kinetics poses a prospective strategy to address the growing demands of intelligent and miniature systems, but it remains challenging. Herein, we reported the self&#8208;assembly of numerous side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs) into a series of UTPSs with diameters spanning 210&#8211;270&#8197;nm and ultrathin vesicular thickness spanning 1.91&#8211;2.14&#8197;nm. The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transitions for these UTPSs are rendered by the photo&#8208;isomerization of azobenzene moiety upon alternating irradiation with UV and visible light. The systematical isomerization kinetic study proved that the light&#8208;responsive rate of distinct UTPSs was highly dependent on the electronic effect of para&#8208;substituents of azobenzenes within AAACs. Notably, the rate constant of electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro&#8208;modified UTPSs was 6.7&#8197;times greater than that of electron&#8208;donating hydroxyl&#8208;modified UTPSs. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release activity for different UTPSs was evaluated using a hydrophilic model drug of methylene blue (MB), with a light&#8208;controllable releasing performance that highly depended on the para&#8208;substituent&#8208;induced light&#8208;responsive kinetics. Our work offers an innovative strategy to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a controllable responsive performance for the targeted applications in bionanotechnology.

Harnessing T&#8208;type photoswitching (&#955;1) of dibenzothiadiazepine&#8208;dioxide (DBTDD), a dual&#8208;&#955; intersecting&#8208;controlled photoclick system is established, synchronizing with photolysis of sydnone (&#955;2) to enable cycloaddition. The photoswitching of DBTDD is pivotal in enabling bioorthogonal decoration of phospholipids on live cell membranes, increasing efficacy in line with elevated 445&#8197;nm laser power density with subcellular spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
The advancement of ring&#8208;strain preloaded dipolaro&#8208;/dienophiles plays a crucial role in bioorthogonal chemistry, enabling multiple high&#8208;precision conjugations toward biomolecules simultaneously. However, durability of these ring&#8208;strain preloaded reagents in vivo is a concern, as the ring&#8208;strain is not reloadable once released during delivery process. In situ conversion of light&#8208;energy into ring&#8208;strain is a promising approach to ensure both biostability and spatiotemporal control endowed by light. Herein, we advance a seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzene photoswitch, dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine&#8208;11,11&#8208;dioxide (DBTDD), bridged by a sulphone moiety. The photoisomerization from Z&#8208;DBTDD to ring&#8208;strain&#8208;loaded E&#8208;DBTDD enables an accelerated cycloaddition with various photogenerated dipoles to establish novel photoclick reactions, featuring a dual&#8208;&#955; (405&#8197;nm+445&#8197;nm) synergistic control. In reactions with monoarylsydnones, a higher photo&#8208;stationary ratio of E&#8208;DBTDD, achieved by varying the power density of 445&#8197;nm laser, presented an ultrafast cycloaddition rate (kE=6.6&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) with a 13.8&#8208;fold acceleration compared with Z&#8208;DBTDD, which is superior to established ring&#8208;strain reporters (e.g., BCN&#8208;OH, sTCO&#8208;OH, DBTD). Then, bioorthogonal photoclick labeling of DBTDD tagged artificial phospholipid on living cell membranes was realized at subcellular resolution via an essential dual&#8208;&#955; intersecting lithography with an elevated efficiency by adjusting the 445&#8197;nm power density.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation to Ethylene with High Energy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;doped copper catalysts exhibit exceptional performance in electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH), achieving an ethylene partial current density of &#8722;0.29&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at &#8722;0.62&#8197;V vs. RHE, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Zinc doping significantly promotes acetylene adsorption and activation, accelerates reaction kinetics, and effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and over&#8208;hydrogenation, offering a highly efficient strategy for sustainable ethylene production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH) provides a petroleum&#8208;independent strategy for ethylene production. However, the challenges of high overpotentials and strong hydrogen evolution competition reaction over conventional electrocatalysts at industrial current densities result in substantial energy consumption, limiting the practical application of EASH technology.

&lt;p&gt;Zinc-doped copper catalysts exhibit exceptional performance in electrocatalytic acetylene semi-hydrogenation (EASH), achieving an ethylene partial current density of &#8722;0.29&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a Faradaic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at &#8722;0.62&#8197;V vs. RHE, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Zinc doping significantly promotes acetylene adsorption and activation, accelerates reaction kinetics, and effectively suppresses hydrogen evolution and over-hydrogenation, offering a highly efficient strategy for sustainable ethylene production.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic acetylene semi-hydrogenation (EASH) provides a petroleum-independent strategy for ethylene production. However, the challenges of high overpotentials and strong hydrogen evolution competition reaction over conventional electrocatalysts at industrial current densities result in substantial energy consumption, limiting the practical application of EASH technology. Herein, zinc-doped copper catalysts are designed and prepared via a facile impregnation and electroreduction relay method. The as-prepared Cu-2.7Zn catalyst exhibits an ethylene partial current density of &#8722;0.29&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a Faradaic efficiency of 96&#8201;% and a reaction potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing the previously reported electrocatalysts. The combined results of experimental tests and theoretical calculations demonstrate zinc doping significantly enhances acetylene adsorption and accelerates reaction kinetics, leading to a notable decrease in overpotential. Furthermore, the increased *H-*H binding energy barrier and the improved ethylene desorption on Cu-2.7Zn effectively suppress hydrogen evolution and acetylene over-hydrogenation, contributing to the enhancement of ethylene Faradaic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multifunctional Molecular Modulated Strategy Featuring Novel Li+ Transport Centers and Li2O&#8208;Rich SEI Layer for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin is introduced to simultaneously boost the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Advanced characterization techniques have revealed that coumarin preserves the mechanical properties of the PEO framework, provides new Li+ hopping centers and constructs a Li2O&#8208;rich SEI layer with excellent Li+ transport dynamics, which are crucial for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
The poor ionic conductivity and interfacial instability severely limit the application of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes. In this work, we introduce a multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin, which simultaneously boosts the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;coumarin (PLC) membrane. Unlike conventional additives that diminish PEO's crystallinity, coumarin, with its higher Li+ adsorption energy and stronger dipole moments, acts as a novel &#8216;carrier&#8217; for Li+ without compromising the mechanical properties of the PEO matrix. Its synergistic effect with PEO creates a more efficient Li+ transport pathway to achieve a high ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Simultaneously, coumarin as a sacrificial agent by utilizing its carbonyl group, preferentially reacts with lithium metal to prevent the decomposition of PEO and lithium salts. Furthermore, coumarin acts as an in situ Li2O&#8208;inducer, facilitating the formation of a dense Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with faster ion diffusion kinetics at the interface. The beneficial effect of the multifunctional molecular engineering design enables the Li|PLC|Li symmetric cell to cycle over 5000&#8197;h and allows the Li|PLC|LiFePO4 battery to deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 161.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention ratio of 93&#8201;% after 550&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical synthesis offers a powerful and sustainable alternative to conventional chemical manufacturing techniques. The direct and selective electrohydrogenation of olefins has enormous potential applicability; however, this reactivity has not been sufficiently demonstrated. Herein, we show that an efficient Pt&#8208;based electrocatalyst from commercially available PtCl2 can promote such transformations. This approach enables olefins to be electrohydrogenated (often below &#8722;3.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) at high current density (JGeo up to 133 mA/cm2) using protons and electrons as the hydrogen source. This reaction exhibits broad functional group compatibility, requires low catalyst loading, and affords a diverse series of valuable molecules (more than 70 examples) with high chemoselectivity. In addition, highly regioselective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins (r.r. &gt; 19:1) is demonstrated using PtCl2 and 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs), the fraction of active materials involved in electrode electrochemistry reduces with the increase of electrode thickness. Conventional wisdom suggests that the degree of reaction linearly decreases toward the current&#8208;collector as that in the lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which is, however, limited by the high difficulty of experimental capture of operando transport of charge &amp; mass. Electrode dynamics simulations can provide space visualization but are usually based on assumed or simplified models. Herein, we build digital&#8208;twin electrodes with digital&#8208;space voxel microstructure based on synchrotron tomography, which transforms the electrode architecture from real space to digital space for the construction of precision models. From the digital&#8208;model&#8208;driven simulation, we find an interesting &#8220;lithium trapping&#8221; effect, stemming from susceptible lithium stuck in the solid electrolyte, triggers an inadequate reaction of the intermediate region of electrodes but not near current&#8208;collector region. Then, we construct locally accelerated ion paths activating the lithium trapping, indicating that this strategy can significantly guide the sustainable battery design for next&#8208;generation energy storage.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production from biomass electrooxidation offers a promising alternative to water electrolysis by lowering the anodic oxidation barrier and producing valuable chemicals. However, current biomass electrooxidation systems have difficulties in achieving an industrial&#8208;scale current density due to the difficulty in cleaving high&#8208;energy C&#8208;H and O&#8208;H bonds. Here, we report a ternary layer nitride FeWN2 electrocatalyst with abundant anti&#8208;site defects (ASDs), which significantly improves its electrocatalytic performance for ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation. The catalyst works at a remarkable current density of 2.5 A cm&#8208;2 at 0.69 V (vs. RHE) and achieves 4 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.12 V in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer at 60&#176;C with 100% Faraday efficiency for H2 production. Theoretical calculations reveal that W atoms near antipodal Fe sites replenish the electron density of Fe, maintaining moderate Fe&#8208;DHA adsorption strength induced by ASDs that achieve superior catalytic efficiency for AA&#8208;to&#8208;DHA conversion This study provides new insight for developing high&#8208;performance organic oxidation catalysts with ASDs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly&#8208;stable coatings on iron is essential for mitigating corrosion formation. Herein, we demonstrate that a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) can be electrodeposited on iron foil and function as a binder for a secondary, crosslinked polymer network coating. The dual layer coating, constructed of a monolayer of NHCs and a polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively prevented corrosion formation with a protective efficiency of 99.6&#177;0.2%, as determined by polarization measurements in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. Spectroscopic analysis identified the formation of a chemical interaction between the NHC monolayer and the polymer film. The strong anchoring of NHC to iron along with its chemical interaction with the polymer film induced high stability and durability of the dual layer coating to effectively protect the coated iron from corrosion formation.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Switching Between Nonlinear&#8208;Optical&#8208;Active Nitrate&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailored syntheses of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals, particularly those of metastable NCS polymorphs, remain extremely challenging due to the complex interactions of their constituent primitives. We report herein the first successful synthesis of a set of three nitrate supramolecular polymorphs (C2H5N4)(NO3) (&#945;&#8209;, &#946;&#8209;, and &#947;&#8208;phases) by a pH&#8208;modulation secondary&#8208;bond strategy, via&#160;the assembly of&#160;two types of &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar primitives. Solutions of different pH result in differing orientation of secondary bonds between [C2H5N4] and [NO3] primitives. Secondary bonds dominate the packing of primitives in crystal lattices; varying these secondary bonds can afford NCS or centrosymmetric nitrate supramolecular polymorphs, with 2D &#945;&#8209;phase irreversibly transformed to 2D &#946;&#8209;phase in a solution of appropriate pH. These two polymorphs display distinctly different SHG responses and birefringences, ascribed to variation in stacking of 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded layers resulting from the differing environmental pH. Supramolecular crystal structures comparison and theoretical studies confirm the crucial role played by secondary&#8208;bond interactions between adjacent primitives in the rare nitrate supramolecular polymorphs. This work paves the way in elucidating the supramolecular polymorph transition&#8208;mechanisms and correlating the polymorph structures and their NLO properties, and thereby discloses a new paradigm for development of high&#8208;performance NCS materials with tailored optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Mussel Foot Protein Membrane&#8208;Enclosed Crystalline Drug with Zero&#8208;Order Release Kinetics for Long&#8208;Acting Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Injectable formulations with sustained and steady release capabilities are critically required to treat diseases requiring temporary or lifelong continuous therapy, especially for drugs with a short half&#8208;life. Additionally, achieving a sufficiently high drug loading in a single dose remains a persistent challenge. Herein, by mimicking the formation principles of mussel adhesive plaques, we have developed membrane&#8208;enclosed crystalline systems of insulin and progesterone as model macro&#8208; and small&#8208;molecular crystalline drugs. The system exhibits a substantial drug loading capacity (&gt; 90%). It exhibits sustained and zero&#8208;order release kinetics, thereby facilitating the establishment of a subcutaneous reservoir containing a substantial drug load, enabling progressive and continuous release of the drug into the body. One single injection of membrane&#8208;enclosed insulin crystal can maintain normoglycemia in diabetic mice for up to 7 days. Meanwhile, membrane&#8208;coated progesterone crystals can sustain drug release in rats for over 7 days. The protein membrane can be cleared from the injection sites in 35 days. This system can serve as a versatile platform for the sustained release of various crystalline pharmaceuticals and treating distinct diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8208;H Alkoxylation and Amidation via the Polarity Reversal of Nucleophilic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Norbornene&#8208;mediated remote meta&#8208;selective C&#8208;H functionalizations of arenes have been limited to relatively weakly electronegative and &#8220;soft&#8221; species, such as aryl, alkyl, and alkylamino moieties. Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8208;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta&#8208;positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that alcohol and amide polarity reversal induced by hypervalent iodine reagents and the subsequent formation of a Pd(IV) intermediate via the oxidative addition of the aryl&#8208;norbornyl&#8208;palladacycle intermediate are crucial for promoting the entire catalytic reaction cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>A Magnetic Field&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries with Enhanced Reaction Kinetics by Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) batteries have attracted significant attention due to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical energy density, but are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and high overpotential. Our previous researches have proved that energy fields such as light, force and heat are effective strategies to improve the reaction kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Herein, we proposed a novel magnetic field&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries via a spin polarization strategy. By doping magnetic Mn2+ ions with spin polarization characteristics into CsPbBr3 (Mn&#8208;CsPbBr3) perovskite, a magnetic field&#8208;responsive cathode was designed and prepared. The incorporation of Mn2+ ions drives charge redistribution and spin polarization of CsPbBr3, which remarkably improve the carrier separation efficiency and the oxygen species adsorption energy. Increased spin&#8208;polarization of the magnetic elements by Zeeman effect in an external magnetic field results in the enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. In the magnetic field, a low overpotential of 0.40 V was obtained for Li&#8208;O2 batteries with Mn&#8208;CsPbBr3 cathodes which demonstrate an ultralow overpotential of 0.12 V and an ultra&#8208;high energy efficiency of 96.3% with the further illumination. The introduction of magnetic fields into the Li&#8208;O2 battery system and provides a new avenue for improving the reaction kinetics of rechargeable Li&#8208;O2 battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Retarding Phase Segregation via Lattice Reinforcement for Efficient and Stable Perovskite/Organic Tandem solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The operational perovskite/organic tandem solar cells&#160;are subjected to light irradiation and driven by a higher bias voltage than single&#8208;junction solar cells, posing a severe challenge to their stabilities. Light irradiation can trigger halide phase segregation in the perovskite subcell, exacerbated under higher bias voltage through electron&#8211;phonon coupling. To address this, dimethylammonium ion (DMA+) incorporation delays perovskite crystallization by forming an intermediate phase, enhancing crystallinity, and reducing lattice structural defects. DMA+ with a larger ionic radius entering the A&#8208;site of lattice tilts the [PbX6]4&#8208; (X: I or Br) octahedral, enlarging the perovskite bandgap, shortening Pb&#8211;I bonds, and reinforcing the lattice. This mitigates halide escaping from the lattice and subsequent ion migration. Phase segregation in the perovskite subcell is significantly suppressed under high&#8208;power irradiation and bias voltage. Consequently, the perovskite subcell exhibits increased and stable quasi&#8208;Fermi&#8208;level splitting values, delivering a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.34 V. Notably, 0.062&#8208;cm2 and 1.004&#8208;cm2 perovskite/organic tandem solar cells&#160;achieved remarkable efficiencies of 26.15% (certified of 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, exhibiting excellent operational stability of T90 ~ 1350 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonmetallic High&#8208;Entropy Engineered Nanocarbons for Advanced ORR Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy materials are poised to revolutionize materials science and industrial applications due to their design flexibility, peculiar performance, and broad applicability. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high&#8208;entropy engineered nanocarbon (HENC) co&#8208;doped with five nonmetal elements (B, F, P, S, and N), synthesized via in&#8208;situ polymerization modification of ZIF&#8208;8 followed by pyrolysis. The HENC exhibits outstanding performance as a non&#8208;metal electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with activity on par with benchmark Pt/C electrocatalysts and superior cyclic stability. Simulations and all&#8208;site calculations reveal that the synergistic effects of abundant heteroatoms and increased system entropy facilitate the formation of *O2 species, with N, P, and S acting as the key active elements, while co&#8208;doping with B and F further enhances stability. Notably, HENCs have been validated as cathode catalysts in zinc&#8208;air batteries, achieving an impressive peak power density of 604 mW cm&#8722;2 and demonstrating long&#8208;term stability over a 16&#8208;day period, outpacing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (542 mW cm&#8722;2). This work not only enriches the concept of high entropy and advances the understanding of high&#8208;entropy materials but also opens a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Superprotonic Conduction over Wide Humidity Range Driven by Enhanced Proton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton conducting materials play a key role in various fields, and their proton conduction is profoundly restricted by the proton dissociation process. This process has two components: dissociation from acidic groups (e.g. &#8208;SO3H) and dissociation from intermediate species (e.g. H3O+, C&#8208;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H+). Extensive research has concentrated on the former, utilizing acidic groups with minimal proton dissociation energy or low pKa values, while the latter's substantial effects have been largely overlooked. In reality, proton&#8208;accepting atoms within intermediates, such as oxygen and nitrogen, typically produce a higher electron cloud density compared to those in acidic groups. This results in a pronounced electrostatic binding effect on mobile protons, as well as high dissociation energies. Thus, diminishing the dissociation energy associated with intermediates is paramount in the development of high&#8208;performance proton conductors. Herein, we construct one covalent organic framework based proton conductor, achieving superprotonic conduction over wide humidity range by decreasing the dissociation energy of protons from intermediates. The success of this approach can be attributed to two key factors: the crowded guest molecules within the framework that mitigate proton hydration, and the concurrent establishment of C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;H+ interactions. These combined effects significantly reduce the electrostatic attraction exerted on mobile protons, thereby enhancing proton conduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Grain High&#8208;Efficiency Full&#8208;Visible&#8208;Spectrum White Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission phosphors are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), overcoming the complex and high costs of traditional mixed phosphors. However, their practical application is hindered by low luminescence efficiency. In this regard, we develop a generalization strategy that involves creating heterostructure interfaces to prevent the detrimental energy transfer process, thereby boosting efficiency. The SrLiPO4/Sr9MgLi(PO4)7:Eu2+ single&#8208;grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The WLEDs encapsulated with this phosphor feature a high color rendering index (~93.9), a low correlated color temperature (~3100 K), and stable color performance, indicating that the as&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;grain phosphor is an excellent candidate for healthy full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum lighting. This innovation is expected to accelerate the development of full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum phosphors technology and inspire the creation of more efficient and versatile luminescent materials in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Arrangement of Ordered D&#8208;A Components in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Cocatalyst&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arrangement of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) components in order at a molecular level provides a means to achieve efficient electron&#8208;hole separation for promoting the activity of photocatalysts. Herein, we report the coordination assembly of D&#8208;A molecules with desired staggered energy levels in two isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) 1 and 2, which exhibit high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity without using any cocatalysts and photosensitizers. The modulation of active metal sites of the D&#8208;A MOFs leads to an increase of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates from 1260 to 3218 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. A detailed mechanism study revealed that the energy bond defined by the D&#8208;A components assisted with metal centers is the key to efficiently generate photogenerated charge carriers, and 2 has an appropriate affinity to proton to reduce the energy barrier for hydrogen evolution. Besides, the enhanced proton transport kinetics based on the arrayed free carboxyl groups in the hydrogen bonded network endows 2 higher proton conductivity than 1, thus promoting the usage rate of active metal sites in 2 for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Solvent Effects for Enhanced Oxidation and Coordination in Selective Piezocatalytic Gold Recovery from End&#8208;of&#8208;life Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient gold (Au) recovery from electronic waste (E&#8208;waste) under environmentally sustainable and mild conditions presents a significant challenge in resource recycling. This study introduced a novel piezocatalytic method for Au recovery from E&#8208;waste using a mixed acetonitrile&#8208;water (CH3CN&#8208;H2O) solution. The findings emphasize the crucial role of solvent effects in modulating catalytic performance, with a 75% CH3CN solution offering the most efficient recovery. The solvent not only influenced the oxidation and coordination steps crucial for Au extraction but also facilitated electron and mass transfer, accelerating the generation of reactive species that promote Au dissolution. Furthermore, water amplified the effect of the solvent by modifying the chemical potential of surface species, thus optimizing catalytic reactivity. Under ultrasonic vibration, the piezocatalytic system achieved 100% Au recovery from various types of E&#8208;waste, exhibiting excellent adaptability across a broad pH range. Large&#8208;scale experiments at the kilogram level confirmed its practicality, with 100% recovery from printed circuit boards and 98% from central processing unit boards. This study underscores the importance of solvent effects in piezocatalysis and provides new insights into the sustainable recovery of precious metals, thereby paving the way for the design of solvent&#8208;assisted catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Albumin&#8208;based drug delivery system, exemplified by FDA&#8208;approved treatments like Abraxane, have demonstrated significant potential in cancer therapy.&#160;However, albumin carriers still suffer from poor tumor&#8208;targeting capability, leading to low efficacy and systemic side effects on healthy cells in applications.&#160;Here, we report a general method for modification of albumin drugs by aptamer coating shell that are hydrophobically inserted into the albumin surface, for constructing albumin drugs&#8208;cored spherical nucleic acid (adSNA). This adSNA platform allows for the versatile loading of various therapeutic agents, including chemotherapy drugs, polyphenols, cuproptosis inducers and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, enabling targeted tumor delivery. Compared with covalent method, the hydrophobic insertion method has been proven to be of greater simplicity, higher aptamer&#8208;grafting efficiency,&#160;superior tumor&#8208;targeting capabilities,&#160;and comparable stability under physiological conditions. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we delivered NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents and heat shock protein inhibitors for tumor&#8208;specific mild photothermal therapy. Compared to traditional photothermal therapy (PTT), this approach utilizes NIR&#8208;II PTT agents to achieve greater tissue penetration while downregulating heat shock proteins in tumor cells, resulting in precise thermal ablation at lower temperatures.

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Throughput Microarrays of Peptidoglycan Fragments as a Novel Sero&#8208;Diagnostic Tool for Patient Antibody Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel on&#8208;chip synthesis technology, microarrays of peptidoglycan fragments were generated comprising 864 variants derived from Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. These were used to map monoclonal antibody specificity and to screen samples from patients with the autoimmune disease epidermolysis bullosa, revealing distinct antibody responses. This highlights the platform's potential for profiling microbiome&#8208;associated diseases.







Abstract
Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a complex biopolymer crucial for cell wall integrity and function of all bacterial species. While the strong inflammatory properties of PGN and its derived muropeptides are well&#8208;documented in human innate immune responses, adaptive immunity, including antibody responses to PGN, remain inadequately characterized. Microarray technology represents a cost&#8208; and time&#8208;efficient method for studying such interactions. Our laser&#8208;based technology enables the high&#8208;throughput synthesis of biomolecules on functionalized glass slides. Here, this on&#8208;chip synthesis was developed for PGN fragments, to generate a variety of 216 stem peptides and attach six different glycan moieties that are major structural components of bacterial cell walls. Thereby, 864 PGN fragments from different Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive species were generated. The arrays were validated with four different monoclonal antibodies against PGN or poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine and identified their epitopes. Finally, proof of concept for antibody profiling in patient samples was performed by comparing a panel of well&#8208;characterized plasma samples of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) patients suffering from (chronic) wounds with Staphylococcus aureus infection. EB patients show an increased response to the muramyl dipeptide. Therefore, this novel high&#8208;throughput PGN glycopeptide microarray technology promises to identify distinct antibody profiles against human microbiomes in diseases, notably in those involving the intestine.

Thereby, 864 PGN fragments from different Gram-negative and Gram-positive species were generated. The arrays were validated with four different monoclonal antibodies against PGN or poly-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl glucosamine and identified their epitopes. Finally, proof of concept for antibody profiling in patient samples was performed by comparing a panel of well-characterized plasma samples of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) patients suffering from (chronic) wounds with Staphylococcus aureus infection. EB patients show an increased response to the muramyl dipeptide. Therefore, this novel high-throughput PGN glycopeptide microarray technology promises to identify distinct antibody profiles against human microbiomes in diseases, notably in those involving the intestine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Marine Diterpenoids Caucanolide E and F by Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation: Rigorous Reassignment of Two Almost Indistinguishable Diastereomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of gem&#8208;hydrogenation, which exploits the electrophilic character of the ruthenium carbene intermediates transiently formed, to natural product total synthesis allowed the stereostructure of a pair of diastereomeric seco&#8208;cembranoids that are almost indistinguishable by NMR to be rigorously assigned. Computational analysis of the data by the CP probabilistic method provided independent confirmation.







Abstract
As the spectra of the diastereomeric marine seco&#8208;cembranoids caucanolide E and F are almost identical, the isolation team had not been able to firmly assign their stereostructure. The puzzle has now been solved by a synthetic approach predicated on biogenetic considerations, which suggested that both natural products are 10S configured but differ in the configuration of their C8 stereocenter. Under this proviso, they can be distinguished by comparison with synthetic samples that are deliberately 8S,10S and 8S,10R configured: only one natural product can match sign and magnitude of the [&#945;]D of one of these reference compounds; this particular caucanolide must be the 8S,10S isomer. Both reference compounds needed for this benchmarking exercise were accessible from a single precursor via ruthenium catalyzed gem&#8208;hydrogenation of an enyne to furnish an alkoxyfuran in the first place, followed by hydrolysis; this key transformation leverages the electrophilic character of the pianostool ruthenium carbene intermediates passed through. The recorded data showed that the assignment proposed in the literature is incorrect and needs to be reversed; this conclusion was independently confirmed by a combined NMR/DFT approach using a CP3 probability analysis.

         <title>Reactivity and Magnetic Coupling of Triangulene Dimers Linked via para&#8208;Biphenyl Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangulene dimers linked by one or two para&#8208;biphenyl units were synthesized on Au(111). STM, non&#8208;contact AFM, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal an open&#8208;shell singlet magnetic exchange coupling for Dimer 1 (ES&#8208;T=15&#8197;mV), influenced by the dihedral angles of the two para&#8208;biphenyl units. Dimers 2&#8242; with an ES&#8208;T=6.6&#8197;mV were obtained from a more flexible precursor equipped with one para&#8208;biphenyl linker.







Abstract
Triangulene and its homologues are promising building blocks for high&#8208;spin low&#8208;dimensional networks with long&#8208;range magnetic order. Despite the recent progress in the synthesis and characterization of coupled triangulenes, key parameters such as the number of organic linking units or their dihedral angles remain scarce, making further studies crucial for an essential understanding of their implications. Here, we investigate the synthesis and reactivity of two triangulene dimers linked by two (Dimer 1) or one (Dimer 2) para&#8208;biphenyl units, respectively, on a metal surface in an ultra&#8208;high vacuum environment. First&#8208;principles calculations and model Hamiltonians reveal how spin excitation and radical character depend on the rotation of the para&#8208;biphenyl units. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the successful formation of Dimer 1 on Au(111). Non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) measurements resolve the twisted conformation of the linking para&#8208;biphenyl units for Dimer 1. On the contrary, the inherent flexibility of Dimer 2 induces the planarization of the para&#8208;biphenyl, resulting in the spontaneous formation of two additional five&#8208;membered rings per dimer connected by a single C&#8722;C bond (Dimers 2&#8242;). Furthermore, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements confirm the antiferromagnetic (S=0) coupling of the observed dimers, underscoring the critical influence of dihedral angles and structural flexibility of the linking units in &#960;&#8208;electron magnetic nanostructures.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Gas Sensor of Mixed&#8208;dimensional Heterostructures Combining Borophene and BC2N Quantum Dots: Enhanced Detection through Binary Cooperative Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our research introduces a significant advancement in gas sensor technology by decorating two&#8208;dimensional borophene with zero&#8208;dimensional BC2N quantum dots. Integrating theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, our study demonstrates substantial enhancements in NO2 gas sensing performance, with sensors detecting concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;ppm and achieving a sensitivity of 1170&#8201;% at 30&#8197;ppm, surpassing current technologies.







Abstract
The emergence of mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures has inspired worldwide interests in recent years, opening up new avenues for potential nanotechnology applications. Herein, we proposed a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterostructure composed of borophene sheets and BC2N quantum dots. The gas sensing performance of the heterostructure was evaluated through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental methods. Specifically, first&#8208;principles calculation results show that NO2 is the most strongly interacting molecule and induces the largest amount of charge transfer between the molecule and the heterostructure, suggesting exceptional sensitivity and selectivity of the heterostructure to NO2 gas. Following the theoretical insights, a borophene&#8208;BC2N heterostructure gas sensor was developed and its gas detection abilities were assessed with exposure to various gases at room temperature. Remarkably, this sensor displayed a sensitivity of 1170&#8201;% to 30&#8197;ppm NO2 and remain a high sensitivity of 108&#8201;% even to 0.2&#8197;ppm NO2. These results highlight borophene&#8208;BC2N heterostructure as a superior NO2 gas sensor, demonstrating enhanced sensing via BC2N quantum dots and integrated theoretical&#8208;experimental approaches.

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Polyester&#8208;Derived Alcohol into Value&#8208;Added Chemicals by Engineering Atomically Dispersed Pd Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs atomically dispersed Pd species on TiO2 catalyst for photoreforming polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;derived ethylene glycol into value&#8208;added glycolaldehyde. The Pd single atoms can greatly promote the photocatalytic performance by enriching the photogenerated holes and promoting ethylene glycol adsorption, achieving a high glycolaldehyde yield of 5072&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% and long&#8208;term durability.







Abstract
Photoreforming presents a promising strategy for upcycling waste polyester&#8208;derived alcohol into valuable chemicals. However, it remains a great challenge due to its low performance and unsatisfactory selectivity toward high&#8208;value C2 products. Here, we report the highly efficient and selective conversion of ethylene glycol (EG, a monomer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) to glycolaldehyde using atomically dispersed Pd species supported on TiO2 catalyst. A glycolaldehyde production rate of 5072&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% and long&#8208;term durability can be achieved. Experimental and theoretical results show that Pd single atoms can enhance the photocatalytic activity by enriching the photogenerated holes, which are the dominant species for the selective oxidation of EG to glycolaldehyde. More importantly, the adsorption of EG molecules on the catalysts is significantly promoted, which is subsequently transformed into RO&#8901; radicals, a crucial intermediate in producing glycolaldehyde. Additionally, Pd single atoms on TiO2 enable the reduction of the glycolaldehyde desorption barrier, thereby facilitating high selectivity and inhibiting further oxidation to C1 products. This work provides new insights into the photocatalytic conversion of polyester wastes by atomic engineering.

         <title>Reductant&#8208;Free Enantioselective Aza&#8208;Reformatsky Reaction Enabled by Synergistic Visible Light Photocatalysis and Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reductant&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction was realized through a synergistic catalysis strategy by merging visible light and chiral Lewis acid, affording enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;amino &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketones with high enantioselectivity and good functional group tolerance. The mechanism studies demonstrated a stereoselective radical coupling process.







Abstract
Classical aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction generally involves excess reductants. Herein, we developed a visible light&#8208;induced catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Reformatsky reaction via a chiral Lewis acid&#8208;assisted direct excitation of imines without additional reductants, enabling the carbon&#8211;iodine bond cleavage of iododifluoromethyl ketones and the subsequent enantioselective radical coupling. This protocol provided an ingenious access to chiral &#946;&#8208;amino ketones containing a gem&#8208;difluorine moiety. The mechanistic studies including radical trapping experiment, NMR experiment, electron paramagnetic resonance experiment, cyclic voltammetry experiment and spectroscopic analysis rationalized the reaction process.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Fence Effect in Au Nanoparticle&#8208;Loaded UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Chemoselective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;fence strategy for tailoring the electrostatic interaction between metal&#8211;organic framework structure and nitroarenes substrate molecules for boosting selective hydrogenation, leading to an excellent conversion (100&#8201;%) of 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene to 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene along with high selectivity and ultra&#8208;high catalytic efficiency (3880&#8197;h&#8722;1 turnover frequency), which provides a novel method to construct efficient catalyst for selective hydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
The chemoselective reaction are vital for fine chemicals, which requires economical and environmentally friendly catalysts. In order to improve the selectivity of multi&#8208;reaction competition, herein, we propose a novel ionic&#8208;fence strategy to synthesize heterogeneous catalyst for efficient hydrogenation. Practically, UIO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) modified with pyridinium&#8208;linker has been constructed through post&#8208;synthetic chains with paired anion via quaternization and ion exchange to form ionic&#8208;fence MOF (IFMOF&#8208;Cl), which can manage the adsorption mode of nitro substrate, further confine the formation of metal nanoparticles with high dispersity. The optimal Au@IFMOF&#8208;Cl catalyst demonstrates satisfactory selectivity for hydrogenation of nitro group compared to acetylene group in 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene. Specifically, it owns a high yield of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene (~97&#8201;%) with ultra&#8208;high catalytic efficiency (3880&#8197;h&#8722;1 TOF) and long stability, far superior to other catalysts without ionic fence effect. Adsorption experiments and density functional theory studies reveal that the incorporation of ionic fence could modulate the adsorption energy of nitro group, which is responsible for the high selectivity enhancement. Notably, this ionic&#8208;fence strategy exhibits comprehensive universality towards a wide range of substrates (23 kinds in total), providing a promising avenue for precisely engineering the internal microenvironments of catalysts to achieve highly selective synthesis of fine chemicals.

         <title>Direct Upcycling of Degraded LiCoO2 Towards High&#8208;Performance Cathodes via a Multifunctional Organic Lithium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the degraded lithium cobalt oxide (D&#8208;LCO) structure, the deficiency of Li ions severely causes cracks in the particles, leading to a slow diffusion rates and low efficiency of electrons and Li ions. The upgraded lithium cobalt oxide (LRD&#8208;LCO) was obtained by mixing the D&#8208;LCO with lithium lignosulfonate for direct regeneration by one&#8208;step annealing; the LRD&#8208;LCO structure gets integrated and smooth due to Li ions replenishment and doping by elemental Na and S, and the electron and ion transfer rates are enhanced dramatically.







Abstract
Direct recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is a promising technology for resource sustainability and environmental conservation. However, the lithium sources for cathode regeneration are typically mono&#8208;functional, resulting in low performance enhancement of the recycled material. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step direct upcycling method to recycling degraded lithium cobalt oxide (D&#8208;LCO) with lithium lignosulfonate (Li&#8722;L). Li&#8722;L as a multifunctional organic lithium salt can spontaneously attach to the surface of the D&#8208;LCO molecules, thus providing replenishment of Li and doping of elemental sodium and sulfur during the regeneration process. Benefiting from the more stable structure of regenerated LCO supported by Na and S elements, the diffusion efficiency of Li ions and electrons can be improved during charging/discharging. As a result, the cell with upcycling LCO cathode exhibits a high capacity of 220.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and retention rate of 89.7&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 10&#8197;C with a maximum cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V. More importantly, life&#8208;cycle analysis shows that the upcycling method performs optimally in environmental protection and energy conservation, as well as economic benefits, providing a prospective pathway for the large&#8208;scale application of recycling spent batteries.

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization under Microwatt Irradiation via Unimolecular Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced radical addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization typically requires high light intensity (&gt;5 mW/cm2), limiting energy efficiency and scalability. We demonstrate that adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT systems drastically enhances the reactivity of acidic chain transfer agents (CTAs) with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts (Zn porphyrin and Zn phthalocyanine). This approach enables complete polymerization under microwatt light intensity (0.25 mW/cm2), a significant improvement over traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently with excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity. Reactivity was triggered chemically (via base addition) or electrochemically (via electrolytic reduction). Mechanistic studies reveal that base addition promotes a CTA&#8208;Zn photocatalyst complex, shifting the activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Polarization&#8208;Boosting Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics and Exciton Dissociation in Fe Nanoparticle&#8208;Loading Graphitic Carbon Nitride toward Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of exciton properties plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity of photocatalysts, primarily due to the rapid recombination of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs caused by the strong Coulomb interaction between them. In this study, we explore the spin polarization effect in nanohybrids composed of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles, which accelerates exciton dissociation and spin&#8208;selective electron transfer, thereby improving the selective photoreduction of CO2 into CO. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs, embedded in the iron oxide layer on the surface of Fe nanoparticles, function as ultrafast charge transfer shuttles via a double exchange interaction (Fe2+&#8211;O&#8211;Fe3+). This process facilitates spin&#8208;selective electron transfer from g&#8208;C3N4 to Fe species, thereby contributing to the efficient conversion of CO2. This work provides novel insights into the design of spin&#8208;dependent photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron Single&#8208;Atom Based Double&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Center Catalysis Triggers Internal&#8208;Driven and External&#8208;Driven Pathways for Green Fenton&#8208;like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs) Fenton&#8208;like chemistry with low or zero oxidant addition has garnered increasing attentions due to their alignment with the principles of green and sustainable development. However, the regulation of such processes remains a significant challenge, primarily due to deficiencies in the microscopic interpretation of their electron migration mechanisms operating with low or zero oxidant addition. In this work, iron single&#8208;atom DRCs catalyst (Fe/N&#8208;SAC) was prepared for internal&#8208;driven system (zero oxidant addition) and external&#8208;driven system (low peroxymonosulfate (PMS) addition). Results indicated the absence of dissolved oxygen activation in the PMS&#8208;zreo Fe/N&#8208;SAC system, and the iron single atoms in the Fe/N&#8208;SAC acted as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07 and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere. In contrast, the electrons from the pollutants could be transferred to both PMS and iron atoms in the external&#8208;driven Fe/N&#8208;SAC/PMS system involving both predominant electron transfer process (ETP) and iron internal&#8208;driven. Furthermore, two experimental devices based on core mechanisms of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven systems were designed to achieve long&#8208;term operation. These studies will complement the core catalytic mechanisms and module applications of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven DRCs systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Oxygen Evolution Mechanism of Lithium&#8208;Rich Antifluorite Prelithiation Agent Based on Anionic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing sacrificial cathode prelithiation technology to compensate for irreversible lithium loss is crucial for enhancing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Antifluorite Li&#8208;rich Li5FeO4 (LFO) is a promising prelithiation agent due to its high theoretical capacity (867 mAh/g) and superior decomposition dynamic (&lt; 4.0 V versus. Li/Li+). However, the oxygen evolution mechanism in LFO remains unclear, limiting its application as an ideal prelithiation agent. Herein, we systematically track the full lifecycle oxygen footprint in LFO lattice, electrolyte and solid electrolyte interface (SEI). We demonstrate the lattice mismatch induced by the quasi&#8208;disorder rocksalt intermediate phase can activate the lattice oxygen oxidation promoting the dimerization to O2. Specifically, in contrast to the O&#8208;O dimers formed within typical anionic&#8208;redox active cathodes, the oxidation of lattice oxygen in LFO generates O&#8208; stabilized in Li6&#8208;O configuration. Significantly, a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Li6&#8208;O configurations transforms into a superoxo dimer, which further evolves into O2 via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process. Moreover, we demonstrate that nucleophilic intermediates threaten the stability of electrolytes and SEI. Leveraging the insights above, we offer comprehensive perspectives for the modification of ideal prelithiation agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated CO2 Electrolysis for Recovering Transmembrane Carbon Loss</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 electrolysis in alkaline media presents advantages by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and enhancing the CO2 reduction selectivity. However, it suffers from the carbonation issue, leading to substantial carbon loss due to CO2 transmembrane transport. To tackle this issue, we here put forward a redox mediator (RM)&#8208;coupled electrolysis strategy. By integrating a highly reversible redox couple, this approach spatially separates the cathodic CO2 reduction and the anodic oxygen evolution reactions into two electrolyzers, thereby enabling the recovery and reuse of transmembrane CO2. Anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonic acid (AQDS) was chosen as the redox mediator owing to its suitable redox potential, excellent electrochemical reversibility, high solubility, and non&#8208;transmembrane shuttling characteristics. It allowed the RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis system to operate continuously at 100 mA/cm2, maintaining a high faradaic efficiency for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion consistently around 90%, while effectively capturing the transmembrane CO2. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration validates the feasibility of RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis and highlights its significant potential to advance the practical application of CO2 electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Valence Engineering via Polyoxometalate&#8208;Induced on Vanadium Centers for Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered vanadium&#8208;based compounds have attracted attention as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) because of their low cost, high theoretical specific capacity, and abundant vanadium valence states. However, the slow migration of Zn2+ ions and their poor cycling stability hinder their practical application in AZIBs. Herein, using a one pot solvothermal method, the polyoxometalates (POMs) were inserted into the aluminum vanadate interlayer spacing, and a series of novel three&#8208;dimensional nanoflower cathode materials (HAVO&#8208;MMo6&#8208;X) were successfully fabricated. The unique electron&#8208;rich structure of the POMs accelerated the migration of Zn2+ on the cathode to obtain a high specific capacity. Owing to the synergistic pillar effect of POMs and HAVO, the interlayer spacing of HAVO&#8208;FeMo6&#8208;50 increased to approximately 14.33 &#197;. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was used to analyze the coordination environments of the cathode materials. A combination of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques demonstrated the storage mechanism of Zn2+ during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the experimental results and DFT calculations indicated that the introduction of POMs had the dual function of improving conductivity and reducing the Zn2+ migration barrier. Thus, this work provides a new perspective on the synergistic interaction between POMs and metal compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying Key Properties that Drive Redox Mediator Activity in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is known to utilize exogenous small molecule quinone mediators to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), allowing it to produce a detectable current in a bioelectrochemical system (BES). Utilization of quinone mediators by L. plantarum requires a type&#8208;II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2); however, structural variations in the core of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone EET mediators have shown to yield significantly different current outputs. Herein, we assembled a library of 40 quinone&#8208;based EET mediators to probe the important physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions responsible for Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET in L. plantarum. The library was designed with inspiration from naturally occurring metabolites, and assembly was focused on structural modifications that diversified polarity, reduction potential, and predicted free energy of binding to Ndh2 (&#916;Gcomp), as these properties are hypothesized to drive EET activity. In general, Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET activity in an iron(III) nanoparticle reduction assay significantly correlates to the mediator's polarity and &#916;Gcomp. Five mediators were analyzed in BESs with L. plantarum, and each generated Ndh2&#8208;dependent current over background signal. Importantly, an amine&#8208;containing mediator yielded incredibly stable current output over the course of the experiment (up to 5 days). These findings improve our understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships for quinone&#8208;mediated EET and provide stable mediators for bioelectronic sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>LIBX&#8208;A401: A Novel Selective Inhibitor of Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) and Its Binding Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid metabolism is essential for cellular homeostasis, and its disruption is linked to various diseases. Acyl&#8208;coenzyme A synthetase long&#8208;chain family member 4 (ACSL4), a pivotal enzyme in lipid metabolism, has emerged as a therapeutic target for ferroptosis&#8208;related conditions and cancer. Antidiabetic drug rosiglitazone is the reference ACSL4 inhibitor. However, its potent activity on peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#947;), a key regulator of lipid metabolism, represents a significant limitation. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of LIBX&#8208;A401 (compound 9), a potent ACSL4 inhibitor derived from rosiglitazone but devoid of PPAR&#947; activity. We showed that its binding to ACSL4 is ATP&#8208;dependent. Using Hydrogen&#8208;Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry, we demonstrate that ATP binding stabilizes the ACSL4 C&#8208;terminus, with LIBX&#8208;A401 further stabilizing this domain and altering the fatty acid gate&#8208;region. Photoaffinity labeling with a diazirine probe identified A329 within the fatty acid binding site, while molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis highlighted Q302 as critical for LIBX&#8208;A401 binding. LIBX&#8208;A401 exhibits significant anti&#8208;ferroptotic properties in cells, supported by demonstrated target engagement. These findings position LIBX&#8208;A401 as a valuable tool for studying ACSL4 in ferroptosis&#8208;related diseases and cancer, while its elucidated binding mode paves the way to the rational design of improved ACSL4 inhibitors with therapeutic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer and the Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement for Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines from Unactivated Allylsulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylethylamines are crucial elements in pharmaceutical molecules, making methods for their synthesis highly significant. The Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is a well&#8208;developed strategy to synthesise arylethylamine motifs via aryl migration. However, most examples require amide substrates to activate the alkene to attack by a radical precursor. This strategy both limits the product scope to amide containing compounds as well as necessitating the incorporation of specific functional groups arising from the initial radical addition. In this work, we overcome these limitations, delivering a hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer from a cobalt catalyst to unactivated alkenes to yield &#223;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that increasing the steric hindrance in at least one of the ortho positions on the migrating aromatic group promotes ipso over ortho addition, selectivity that contrasts with previous methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Two Mechanistically Distinct Reactions from a Single Iron Complex: a Tandem Approach to Thermally Stable and Recyclable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A shift from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources has the potential to address some of the environmental concerns associated with petrochemical extraction, thereby making the production of plastics a sustainable process. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of selective techniques for the conversion of abundant renewable feedstocks into environmentally friendly polymers. We present a one&#8208;pot iron&#8208;based catalytic system, which is active, efficient, and selective under mild conditions for producing of renewable copolymers. We demonstrate that this system can function as a tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s, followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide. This effective approach provides direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. Furthermore, we detail the quantitative chemical recycling of such copolymers, underscoring their potential as new environmentally friendly materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Degradation of Polycaprolactone into Adipic Acids over Pt/TiO2 in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upgrading polyester wastes into high value&#8208;added chemicals can achieve carbon recycling, which is of great significance for sustainable development. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot protocol to oxidatively degrade polycaprolactone (PCL) with air into adipic acid (AA) mediated by ionic liquid (IL, e.g., 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [BMIm][NTf2]) in water. In this protocol, IL catalyzes the hydrolysis of PCL into 6&#8208;hydroxyhexanoic acid (6&#8208;HHA), and further mediates the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA into AA over TiO2 supported Pt nanocatalysts, reaching the highest AA yield of 85.6% under relatively mild conditions (140 &#176;C, 1.5 MPa). Mechanism investigation indicates that both O2&#8226;&#8208; and &#8226;OH derived from oxygen and water involve in the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA to form 6&#8208;oxohexanoic acid&#160;via two pathways, which further convert into AA. The IL inhibits the overoxidation of AA, thus leading to a high selectivity towards AA. This protocol provides a green and feasible way to degrade PCL, and also to access AA.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Circularity via Chemical Recycling to All Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aliphatic polyesters synthesized via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) have properties competitive to incumbent plastic (PE, PP), while simultaneously opening up for chemical recycling to monomer (CRM). However, not all aliphatic polyesters are prone to undergo CRM, and the ability to shift the equilibrium between polymer and monomer is tightly associated with the initial monomer structure. The standard strategy to measure CRM is to evaluate the change in free energy during polymerization (&#8710;GROP). However, &#8710;GROP is only one&#8208;dimensional by assessing the equilibrium between initial monomer and polymer. But under active catalytic conditions, the depolymerization of polymers can lead to formation of larger rings, such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc., via the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium (RCE), meaning that the real thermodynamic recycling landscape is multi&#8208;dimensional. This work introduces a multi&#8208;dimensional chemical recycling to all rings (CRR) via a highly active catalytic system to reach RCE. Thermodynamically &#8710;GRCE is completely different from &#8710;GROP. Using &#8710;GRCE instead of &#8710;GROP allows us to achieve CRR for polymers notoriously difficult to achieve CRM for, as exemplified within by CRR for poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone), poly(pentadecalactone), and mixed polymer systems. Overall, this work provides a new general concept of closing the material loop.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triphenylamine&#8208;Functionalized Co&#8208;Assembly Material for Record Efficiency Inverted CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High quality distribution and surface modification of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and stability of p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a new co&#8208;assembly material, 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline iodide (TPAI), is developed to make SAMs orderly assembled. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and sum frequency generation (SFG) characterization unveil that TPAI can bind with SAMs through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions to effectively diminish SAMs aggregation and improve the orderly assembly of SAMs. In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterizations confirm that the co&#8208;assembly TPAI could bind with upward perovskite by &#8211;NH3 and Pb interaction for spreading the perovskite solution and improving the quality of perovskite film. The obtained favorable buried interface between SAMs and perovskite augmented hole extraction and transfer capability. Consequently, the TPAI&#8208;treated CsPbI3 PSCs achieve a high VOC of 1.26 V, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.60%, the highest reported PCE for inverted CsPbI3 PSCs, maintaining 96.71% initial PCE after tracking at maximum power point (MPP) for 1400 h.</dc:description>
