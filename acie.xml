      <title>Enabling NMR studies of high molecular weight systems without the need for deuteration: The XL&#8208;ALSOFAST experiment with delayed decoupling</title>
      <dc:description>Current biological research increasingly focusses on large human proteins and their complexes. Such proteins are difficult to study by NMR spectroscopy because they often can only be produced in higher eukaryotic expression systems, where deuteration is hardly feasible.

Here, we present the XL&#8208;ALSOFAST&#8208;[  13  C,  1  H]&#8208;HMQC experiment with much improved sensitivity for fully protonated high&#8208;molecular weight proteins. For the tested systems ranging from 100 to 240&#160;kDa in size, 3&#8208;fold higher sensitivity was obtained on average for fast relaxing signals compared to current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art experiments. In the XL&#8208;ALSOFAST approach, non&#8208;observed magnetisation is optimally exploited and transverse relaxation is minimized by the newly introduced concept of delayed decoupling. The combination of high sensitivity and superior artefact suppression makes it ideal for studying inherently unstable membrane proteins or for analysing therapeutic antibodies at natural  13  C abundance. The XL&#8208;ALSOFAST and delayed decoupling will therefore expand the range of biomolecular systems accessible to NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

      <title>SERS&#8208;Active MIL&#8208;100(Fe) Sensory Array for Ultrasensitive and Multiplex Detection of VOCs</title>
      <dc:description>The application of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as SERS&#8208;active platforms in multiplex volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detection is still unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate MIL&#8208;100 (Fe) serves as an ideal SERS substrate for VOCs detection. The limit of detection (LOD) of MIL&#8208;100(Fe) for toluene sensing can reach 2.5 ppm, and can be even further decreased to 0.48 ppb level when &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in between Au nanoparticles are employed onto MIL&#8208;100 (Fe) substrate, resulting in an enhancement factor of 10  10  . Additionally, we show that MIL&#8208;100(Fe) substrate has a unique &#8220;sensor array&#8221; property allowing multiplex VOCs detection, with great modifiability and expandability by doping with foreign metal elements. Finally, the MIL&#8208;100(Fe) platform is utilized to simultaneously detect   the different gaseous indicators of lung cancer with ppm detection limit, demonstrating its high potential for early diagnosis of lung cancer  in vivo   .</dc:description>

      <title>Fe Single Atom on MoS2 Nanosheets for N2 Electroreduction into Ammonia</title>
      <dc:description>Ammonia (NH  3  ) plays a pivotal role in our daily life considering its wide applications in fertilizer industry. Many efforts have been devoted to achieving highly efficient artificial synthesis of ammonia. Herein, we reported a novel Fe&#8208;MoS  2  catalyst with Fe atomically dispersed on MoS  2  nanosheets by imitating the natural nitrogenase to boost N  2  electroreduction into NH  3  at room temperature. The Fe&#8208;MoS  2  nanosheets exhibited a faradic efficiency of 18.8% with a yield rate of 8.63 mg  NH3  &#160;mg  cat.  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  for NH  3  at &#8208;0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The mechanism study revealed that the electroreduction of N  2  was promoted and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction was suppressed&#160;by decorating the edge sites of S in the MoS  2  with the atomically dispersed Fe, resulting in the high catalytic performance for the electroreduction of N  2  into NH  3.  This work would provide new ideas for the design of catalysts for N  2  electroreduction and strengthen our understanding about the N  2  activation on Mo&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Understanding drug release kinetics is critical for the development of drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles. In this study, we developed a J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) method to investigate the release of our novel high drug&#8208;loading (50 wt%) nanoparticles, in comparison with the low drug&#8208;loading (0.5 wt%) nanoparticles.

Dual&#8208;dye loaded nanoparticles with high dye loading using FRET pairs exhibited not only FRET phenomenon but also a J&#8208;aggregate red&#8208;shift (116 nm). Using this J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based FRET method, dye&#8208;core polymer&#8208;shell nanoparticles showed two release processes intracellularly: the dissolution of the dye aggregates into dye molecules and the release of the dye molecules from the polymer shell. Also, the high drug&#8208;loading nanoparticles (50 wt%) exhibited a slow release kinetics in serum and relatively quick release in cells, demonstrating their great potential in drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct observation of defect&#8208;aided structural evolution in Ni&#8208;rich layered cathode</title>
      <dc:description>Ni&#8208;rich LiNi  1&#8208;x&#8208;y  Mn  x  Co  y  O  2  (NMC) layered compounds have become the dominated cathode for lithium ion batteries. The role of crystallographic defects on their structure evolution and consequent performance degradation during electrochemical cycling is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated the structural evolution of Ni&#8208;rich NMC cathode in a solid&#8208;state cell via in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy. We identified antiphase boundary (APB) and twin boundary (TB) separating layered phases played an important role on phase change. Upon the lithium depletion, the APB extends across the layered structure, while Li/transition metal (TM) ion mixing in the layered phases is detected to induce the rock&#8208;salt phase formation along the coherent TB. According to DFT calculations, Li/TM mixing and phase transition are aided by the low diffusion barriers of TM ions at planar defects. This work reveals the dynamical scenario of secondary phase evolution, which helps to unveil the origin of performance fading in Ni&#8208;rich NMC.</dc:description>

      <title>An Integrated Microfluidic Probe for Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Biological Samples</title>
      <dc:description>Ambient ionization based on liquid extraction is widely used in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of molecules in biological samples. The development of nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI) has enabled the robust imaging of tissue sections with high spatial resolution.

      <title>Direct Nanomachining on Semiconductor Wafer By Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is one of the most important instrumental methods of modern electrochemistry, due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we introduce SECM into nanomachining by feeding the electrochemical modulations of the tip electrode back to the positioning system, and we demonstrate that SECM is qualified to be a versatile nanomachining technique on semiconductor wafers using electrochemically&#8208;induced chemical etching. The removal profile is correlated to the applied tip current when the tip is held stationary and when it is moving slowly (&lt; 20 &#181;m/s), and it follows Faraday&#8217;s law. Both regular and irregular nanopatterns can be translated into a spatially distributed current by the home&#8208;made digitally controlled SECM instrument. Thus, the desired nanopatterns can be &#8220;sculpted&#8221; directly on a semiconductor wafer by SECM direct&#8208;writing mode. The machining accuracy can be controlled to the sub&#8208;micrometer and even nanometer scales. This advance is expected to play an important role in electrochemical nanomachining for 3D micro/nano&#8208;structures in the semiconductor industry.</dc:description>

      <title>FtsZ reorganisation facilitates deformation of giant vesicles in microfluidic traps</title>
      <dc:description>The geometry of reaction compartments can affect the local outcome of interface&#8208;restricted reactions. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are commonly used to generate cell&#8208;sized, membrane&#8208;bound reaction compartments, which are, however, always spherical. Here, we have developed a microfluidic chip to trap and reversibly deform GUVs into cigar&#8208;like shapes. When trapping and elongating GUVs that contain the primary protein of the bacterial Z ring, FtsZ, we find that membrane&#8208;bound FtsZ filaments align preferentially with the short GUV axis. When GUVs are released from this confinement and membrane tension is relaxed, FtsZ reorganizes reversibly from filaments into dynamic rings that stabilize membrane protrusions; a process that allows reversible GUV deformation. We conclude that microfluidic traps are useful for controlling both geometry and tension of GUVs, and for investigating how both affect the outcome of spatially&#8208;sensitive reactions inside them, such as protein self&#8208;organization.</dc:description>

Due to the hypoxic microenvironment found in solid tumors, oxygen&#8208;independent photosensitizers are in great demand for cancer therapy. We herein report an iridium(III) anthraquinone complex (Ir4) as a mitochondrion&#8208;localized carbon radical initiator.

Furthermore, the two&#8208;photon excitation properties of Ir4 (&#955;ex = 730 nm) are highly desirable for imaging.

The efficacy of Ir4 as a PDT agent was also demonstrated under hypoxic conditions in vivo.

      <title>Zooming into the Interaction of &#945;&#8208;synuclein with Calcium Ions through Exclusively Heteronuclear NMR Experiments</title>
      <dc:description>Many properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or protein regions (IDRs) are expected to be modulated by the nature of amino acid side chains as well as by local solvent exposure. Here we propose a set of  exclusively heteronuclear  NMR experiments to investigate these features in different experimental conditions relevant for physiological function. The proposed approach is generally applicable to many IDPs/IDRs whose assignment is available in the BMRB to investigate how their properties are modulated by different, physiologically relevant conditions. The experiments are tested on &#945;&#8208;synuclein. They are then used to investigate how &#945;&#8208;synuclein senses Ca2+ &#160; concentration jumps associated to the transmission of nervous signals. Novel modules in the primary sequence of &#945;&#8208;synuclein optimized for calcium sensing in highly flexible, disordered protein segments are identified.</dc:description>

      <title>High Throughput Label&#8208;Free Enzymatic Assays using Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>High throughput (HT) enzymatic assays, which typically rely on labeled compounds and plate readers, are important for drug discovery. Mass spectrometry (MS) provides an alternative method of performing HT label&#8208;free assays. Here we demonstrate the use of a HT platform based on desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) MS for the label&#8208;free study of enzymatic reactions directly from the bioassay matrix, with an effective analysis time of 0.3 s/sample. This system allows for thorough analysis of the enzymatic process through monitoring of its substrate and product after an external calibration. We show the platform capabilities by an in&#8208;depth study of the acetylcholinesterase assay, including kinetic parameter determination, rapid inhibitor screening and further characterization of positive hits (i.e. IC  50  , K  i  ), as well as inhibition&#8208;reactivation assays. We anticipate that this platform will have high impact in label&#8208;free enzymology as well as in drug discovery.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantifying the Covalent Functionalization of Black Phosphorus</title>
      <dc:description>A straightforward quantification method to consistently determine the overall functionalization degree of covalently modified two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) by Raman spectroscopy has been carried out. Indeed, the successful reductive methylation of the BP lattice using sodium intercalation compounds and exhibiting different functionalization degrees has been demonstrated by  31  P&#8208;magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the correlation of  31  P&#8208;MAS NMR spectroscopy and statistical Raman spectroscopy (SRS) revealed the first method to determine the functionalization degree of BP solely by evaluating the intensities of distinct peaks in the Raman spectra of the covalently modified material, in a similar way to the widely employed I  D  /I  G  ratio of graphene research.</dc:description>

      <title>Reversible Hydride Migration from C5Me5 to Rh(I) revealed by a Cooperative Bimetallic Approach</title>
      <dc:description>The use of cyclopentadienyl ligands in organometallic chemistry and catalysis is ubiquitous, mostly due to their robust spectator role. Nonetheless, increasing examples of non&#8208;innocent behaviour are being documented. Here, we provide evidence for reversible intramolecular C&#8212;H activation at one methyl terminus of C  5  Me  5  in [(  &#951;  &#8208;C  5  Me  5  )Rh(PMe  3  )  2  ] to form a new Rh&#8212;H bond, a process so far restricted to early transition metals. Experimental proof was acquired from bimetallic rhodium/gold structures in which the gold centre binds either to the rhodium atom or to the activated Cp* ring. Reversibility of the C&#8212;H activation event regenerates the Rh(I) and Au(I) monometallic precursors, whose cooperative reactivity towards polar E&#8212;H bonds (E = O, N), including the N&#8212;H bonds in ammonia, can be understood in terms of bimetallic frustration.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The use of cyclopentadienyl ligands in organometallic chemistry and catalysis is ubiquitous, mostly due to their robust spectator role. Nonetheless, increasing examples of non&#8208;innocent behaviour are being documented. Here, we provide evidence for reversible intramolecular C&#8212;H activation at one methyl terminus of C  5  Me  5  in [(  &#951;  &#8208;C  5  Me  5  )Rh(PMe  3  )  2  ] to form a new Rh&#8212;H bond, a process so far restricted to early transition metals. Experimental proof was acquired from bimetallic rhodium/gold structures in which the gold centre binds either to the rhodium atom or to the activated Cp* ring. Reversibility of the C&#8212;H activation event regenerates the Rh(I) and Au(I) monometallic precursors, whose cooperative reactivity towards polar E&#8212;H bonds (E = O, N), including the N&#8212;H bonds in ammonia, can be understood in terms of bimetallic frustration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chemical Synthesis Elucidates the Key Antigenic Epitope of the Autism&#8208;related Bacterium Clostridium bolteae Capsular Octadecasaccharide</title>
      <dc:description>The gut pathogen  Clostridium bolteae  has been associated with the onset of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To create vaccines against  C. bolteae  , it is important to identify exact protective epitopes of the immunologically active capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Here, we prepared a series of  C. bolteae  CPS glycans up to an octadecasaccharide. Key to achieving the total syntheses is a [2+2] coupling strategy based on a &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Rha  p  &#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Man  p  repeating unit that in turn was accessed via a stereoselective &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;rhamnosylation. The 4,6&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzylidene&#8208;induced conformational locking is a powerful strategy for forming &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;mannose&#8208;type glycoside. An indirect strategy based on the C2 epimerization of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;quinovoside was efficiently achieved by Swern oxidation and borohydride reduction. Sequential glycosylation, regioselective and global deprotection produced disaccharide, tetrasaccharide, all the way to octadecasaccharide. Glycan microarrays analysis of sera from rabbits immunized with inactivated  C. bolteae  bacteria revealed a humoral immune response to di&#8208; and tetrasaccharide but none of the longer sequences. Tetrasaccharide may be a key motif for designing glycoconjugate vaccines against  C. bolteae  .</dc:description>

      <title>Quantification of the Magnetic Anisotropy of a Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet from the Experimental Electron Density</title>
      <dc:description>We report an entirely new application of the experimental electron density (EED) in the study of magnetic anisotropy of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Among those SMMs based on one single transition metal, tetrahedral Co(II)&#8208;complexes are prominent, and their large zero&#8208;field splitting arises exclusively from coupling between the dx2&#8208;y2 and dxy orbitals. Using very low temperature single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data, we obtained an accurate electron density (ED) for a prototypical SMM, and we have used the experimental d&#8208;orbital populations to quantify the dxy&#8208;dx2&#8208;y2 coupling, which simultaneously provides us with the composition of the ground state Kramers doublet wave function. Based on this experimentally determined wave function, we calculate an energy barrier for magnetic relaxation in the range 193&#8208;268 cm&#8208;1, which is in full accordance with the previously published value of 230 cm&#8208;1 obtained from near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy.

      <title>Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Cycloaddition with RAFT Polymers as Bioconjugation Platform</title>
      <dc:description>We introduce the bioconjugation of polymers synthesized by RAFT polymerization, and bearing no specific functional end group, by means of hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition through their inherent terminal thiocarbonylthio moiety with a diene&#8208;modified model protein. Quantitative conjugation occurs over the course of a few hours, at ambient temperature and neutral pH, and in the absence of any catalyst. Our technology platform affords thermoresponsive bioconjugates, whose aggregation is solely controlled by the polymer chains.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Promotion of Catalytic Reactions by Surface Acoustic Waves</title>
      <dc:description>Surface acoustic waves (SAW) allow to manipulate surfaces with potential applications in catalysis, sensor and nanotechnology. SAWs were shown to cause a strong increase in catalytic activity and selectivity in many oxidation and decomposition reactions on metallic and oxidic catalysts. However, the promotion mechanism has not been unambiguously identified. Using stroboscopic X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectro&#8208;microscopy we were able to evidence a sub&#8208;nanosecond work function change during propagation of 500 MHz SAWs on a 9 nm thick platinum film. We quantify the work function change to 455 &#181;eV. Such a small variation rules out that electronic effects due to elastic deformation (strain) play a major role in the SAW&#8208;induced promotion of catalysis. In a second set of experiments SAW&#8208;induced intermixing of a five monolayers thick Rh film on top of polycrystalline platinum was demonstrated to be due to enhanced thermal diffusion caused by an increase of the surface temperature by about 75 K when SAWs were excited. Reversible surface structural changes are suggested to be a major cause for catalytic promotion.</dc:description>

      <title>External Radiation&#8211;Induced Local Hydroxylation Enables Remote Release of Functional Molecules in Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>Radiation&#8208;cleavage chemistry that can achieve tumor&#8208;selective prodrug activation without causing unwanted side effects is of high value for clinical use yet has not been established. Here, we describe 3,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzyl carbamate (DHBC) as a masking group that can be selectively and efficiently removed by external radiation  in vitro  and  in vivo  . DHBC reacts mainly with hydroxyl radical among reactive oxygen species produced by radiation to afford hydroxylation on para/ortho positions, followed by 1,4&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;elimination to rescue the diverse functionality of the client molecule. We found that the reaction is rapid and can liberate client functional molecules under physiological conditions. This controlled release platform is compatible with living organisms, as demonstrated by the release of a rhodol fluorophore derivative (O&#8208;methylrhodol,  MeRho  ) in three cancer cell lines and mouse tumor xenografts. The combined benefits of synthetic ease, rapid kinetics, independence of penetration depth, high release yields, and structural compactness make DHBC derivatives attractive chemical caging moieties for use in radiation&#8208;perturbing chemical biology and prodrug activation  in vivo.</dc:description>

The vast majority of candidates under investigation are repurposed from agents of other indications. Understanding of protein&#8208;inhibitor interactions at molecular scale will provide crucial insights for drug discovery to stop this pandemic. In this article, we summarize and analyze the most recent structural data on several viral targets with the presence of promising inhibitors for COVID&#8208;19 in the perspective of modes of action (MOA) to unravel insightful mechanistic features with atomistic resolution. The targets include spike glycoprotein and various host proteases mediating the entry of the virus into the cells, viral chymotrypsin&#8208; and papain&#8208;like proteases, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase. The main purpose of this review is to present detailed MOA analysis to inspire fresh ideas for both de novo drug design and optimization of known scaffolds to combat COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Establishing the atomic&#8208;scale structure of metal&#8208;oxide surfaces during electrochemical reactions is a key step to modelling this important class of electrocatalysts. Here, we demonstrate that the characteristic (&#8730;2&#215;&#8730;2)R45&#176; surface reconstruction formed on (001)&#8208;oriented magnetite single crystals is maintained after immersion in 0.1 M NaOH at 0.20&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl and investigate its dependence on the electrode potential. We follow the evolution of the surface using  in situ  and  operando  surface X&#8208;ray diffraction from the onset of hydrogen evolution, to potentials deep in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) regime. The reconstruction remains stable for hours between &#8209;0.20&#160;and 0.60&#160;V and surprisingly, still present at anodic current densities of up to 10 mA/cm  2  and strongly affects the OER kinetics. We attribute this to a stabilization of the Fe  3  O  4  bulk by the reconstructed surface. At more negative potentials, a gradual and largely irreversible lifting of the reconstruction is observed due to the onset of oxide reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamics of Bacteriorhodopsin in the Dark&#8208;Adapted State from Solution NMR</title>
      <dc:description>To achieve efficient proton pumping in the light&#8208;driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, the protein must be tightly coupled to the retinal to rapidly convert retinal isomerization into protein structural rearrangements. Methyl group dynamics of bR embedded in lipid nanodiscs were determined in the dark&#8208;adapted state, and were found to be mostly well&#8208;ordered at the cytosolic side. Methyl groups in the M145A mutant of bR, which displays only 10% residual proton pumping activity, are less well ordered suggesting a link between side chain dynamics on the cytosolic side of the bR cavity and proton pumping activity. In addition, slow conformational exchange, attributed to low frequency motions of aromatic rings, was indirectly observed for residues on the extracellular side of the bR cavity. This may be related to reorganization of the water network. These observations provide a detailed picture of previously undescribed equilibrium dynamics on different time scales for ground&#8208;state bR.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Function HKUST&#8208;1 Templating and Catalyzing Formation of Graphitic Carbon Nitride Quantum Dots at Mild Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>Graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g&#8208;CNQDs) are highly promising photoresponsive materials. However, synthesis of monodispersed g&#8208;CNQDs remains challenging. Here we report the dual function of MOF [Cu3BTC2] (HKUST&#8208;1) as a catalyst and template simultaneously to prepare g&#8208;CNQDs at mild conditions.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g&#8208;CNQDs) are highly promising photoresponsive materials. However, synthesis of monodispersed g&#8208;CNQDs remains challenging.

      <title>Efficient Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Coupling of Aryl Chlorides with Alkyllithium Reagents</title>
      <dc:description>Organolithium compounds are amongst the most important organometallic reagents and frequently used in difficult metallation reactions.

These multichromophoric molecular systems revealed interesting structural&#8208;property relationships. While the cross&#8208;conjugated bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenequinone chromophores displayed broad UV&#8208;Vis absorption bands spanning from 350 nm through 650 nm, the linearly&#8208;conjugated bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacene chromophores exhibited much red&#8208;shifted absorptions at 800 &#8211; 900 nm. Bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenes  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  showed rich redox chemistry with 7 and 8 observable redox states respectively. The linearly&#8208;conjugated bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenes (  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  ) possess much narrower HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps (1.65 and 1.42 eV redox, respectively) and higher HOMO energy levels than those of their pentacene analogues (2.23 and 2.01 eV redox, respectively), similar to those of much unstable hexacenes and heptacenes. Counterintuitively,  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  demonstrated unusual stability. An estimated half&#8208;life of &gt; 945 h was obtained for bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacene  Pen&#8208;2a, which is remarkably much longer than that of its pentacene analogue (  BPE&#8208;P,&#160;half&#8208;life, 33 h). Investigations of the abnormal stability of  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  using femtosecond transient absorption technique suggested nickel porphyrin centered photo&#8208;events leading to a short&#8208;lived intermediate charge transfer state, consequently blocking the photodegradation pathways. This charge transfer event is believed to play a major role in causing the abnormal stability of  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a.

      <title>Multiple Site Hydrogen Isotope Labelling  of Pharmaceuticals</title>
      <dc:description>Radiolabelling is fundamental in drug discovery and development as it is mandatory for preclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies and late&#8208;stage human clinical trials.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Radiolabelling is fundamental in drug discovery and development as it is mandatory for preclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies and late&#8208;stage human clinical trials.

      <dc:description>Multi&#8208;functionalization and isomer&#8208;purity of fullerenes are crucial tasks for the development of fullerene chemistry in various fields. In both current main approaches &#8211; tether&#8208;directed covalent functionalization and supramolecular masks &#8211; the control of regioselectivity requires multi&#8208;step synthetic procedures to prepare the desired tether or mask.

The formation of the bis&#8208;adducts and their spectroscopic and photochemical properties, as well as the effect of azobenzene photoswitching on the regiochemistry of the bis&#8208;addition, have been studied. The behavior of the tethers depends on the geometry of the connection between the photoactive core and the malonate moieties. One tether lead to strikingly different adduct distribution for the E and Z isomers, indicating that the covalent bis&#8208;functionalization of C60 can be controlled by light.</dc:description>

      <title>Truxenone&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework as All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathode with High Capacity</title>
      <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been recognized as one of the ideal choices for energy storage techniques for practical applications given their safety and long&#8208;term stability. However, limited availability of electrode active materials with high capacity and long&#8208;term stability fabricated through low cost procedure remains a bottleneck. Herein, we report a truxenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;TRO) as cathode materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LIBs. The high&#8208;density carbonyl groups combined with the ordered crystalline COF structure greatly facilitate lithium ion storage via reversible redox reactions. As a result, a high specific capacity of 268 mAh g  &#8208;1  , almost 97.5% of the calculated theoretical capacity was achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest capacity among all COF&#8208;based cathode materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LIBs reported so far. Moreover, the excellent cycling stability (99.9% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.1 C rate) shown by COF&#8208;TRO suggests such truxenone&#8208;based COFs have great potential in energy storage applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the Reactivity of a Heterogeneous Catalyst using N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands for C&#8208;H Activation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>We report in this communication the dramatic impact of the addition of N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands on the reactivity and selectivity of heterogeneous Ru catalysts in the context of C&#8208;H activation reactions. Using a simple and robust protocol, we have prepared a series of new air stable catalysts starting from commercially available Ru on carbon (Ru/C) and differently substituted NHCs. Associated with C&#8208;H deuteration processes, depending on Ru/C&#8208;NHC ratios, the chemical outcome can be controlled to a large extent. Indeed, tuning the reactivity of the Ru catalyst with NHC has allowed: i) to increase the chemoselectivity and the regioselectivity for the deuteration of alcohols in organic media; ii) to synthesize fragile pharmaceutically relevant deuterated heterocycles (azine, purine) otherwise completely reduced using unmodified commercial catalysts; iii) to discover a novel reactivity for such heterogeneous Ru catalysts: the selective C&#8208;1 deuteration of aldehydes.</dc:description>

      <title>Optical Control of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system for gene editing using photolabile crRNA</title>
      <dc:description>Currently CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 is a widely used efficient tool for gene editing. Precise control over CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system in temporal and spatial resolution is essentially important for studying gene regulation and editing. Here, we presented a novel light&#8208;controlled crRNA via coupling vitamin E and a photolabile linker at 5&#8217; terminus to inactivate CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system. The vitamin E modification did not affect ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation of Cas9/crRNA /tracrRNA complexes, but did inhibit the association of RNP with the target DNA. Upon light irradiation, vitamin E caged crRNA was successfully activated to achieve light&#8208;induced genome editing of Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor A (VEGFA) in human cells through T7E1 assay and Sanger sequencing as well as gene knockdown of EGFP expression in EGFP stably expressing cells.

      <title>Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts from Multivariate MOFs for Highly Selective Reduction of CO2 at Low Pressures</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are of great interest due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the lack of general synthetic protocol makes it difficult in the construction of model SACs to discern activity difference of diverse single&#8208;atom metal species. Herein, a universal synthetic strategy towards single&#8208;atom metal implanted N&#8208;doped carbon (M1&#8208;N&#8208;C; M = Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) has been developed based on multivariate MOFs. The M1&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts, featuring identical parameters in chemical environment and support, provide an ideal platform to identify the differentiated activity of single&#8208;atom metal species. Upon being employed toward electrocatalytic CO2  reduction, Ni1&#8208;N&#8208;C exhibits a very high CO faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 96.8%, far surpassing Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Cu&#8208;based M1&#8208;N&#8208;C. Remarkably, the best&#8208;performed Ni1&#8208;N&#8208;C even possesses excellent CO FE at low CO2  pressures, which is more challenging, demonstrating a promising opportunity for the direct use of dilute CO2  feedstock.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are of great interest due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the lack of general synthetic protocol makes it difficult in the construction of model SACs to discern activity difference of diverse single&#8208;atom metal species. Herein, a universal synthetic strategy towards single&#8208;atom metal implanted N&#8208;doped carbon (M1&#8208;N&#8208;C; M = Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) has been developed based on multivariate MOFs. The M1&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts, featuring identical parameters in chemical environment and support, provide an ideal platform to identify the differentiated activity of single&#8208;atom metal species. Upon being employed toward electrocatalytic CO2  reduction, Ni1&#8208;N&#8208;C exhibits a very high CO faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 96.8%, far surpassing Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Cu&#8208;based M1&#8208;N&#8208;C. Remarkably, the best&#8208;performed Ni1&#8208;N&#8208;C even possesses excellent CO FE at low CO2  pressures, which is more challenging, demonstrating a promising opportunity for the direct use of dilute CO2  feedstock.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Reactions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
      <dc:description>Due to the synergistic &#8220;push&#8208;pull&#8221; effect of vicinal electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, donor&#8722;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropanes have been recognized as one of the most powerful reagents to generate polyfunctional reactive intermediates after a strain&#8208;driven ring cleavage. Enantioselective reactions of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes provide an efficient approach to enantioenriched acyclic and cyclic compouds. A number of chiral Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acids, transition metals and organocatalysts have been designed for such transformations, including ring&#8208;openings, annulations and rearrangements. This Minireview highlights the developments and new advances in this field and familiarizes the Reader with new synthetic opportunities offered by these interesting methodologies.</dc:description>

      <title>Tumor Triggered Disassembly of Multiple&#8208;Agent&#8208;Therapy Probe for Efficient Cellular Internalization</title>
      <dc:description>Integration of multiple agent therapy (MAT) into one probe has been considered as a promising approach to improve therapeutic efficiency for cancer treatment. However, MAT probe, if entering the cell as a whole, might not be optimal for each individual therapeutic agent (with different physicochemical properties), to achieve their best performance, which hinders the strategy optimization. Here, we report a peptide&#8208;conjugated&#8208;AIEgen (FC&#8208;PyTPA): upon loading with siRNA, it can be self&#8208;assembled into FC  siRNA  &#8208;PyTPA. When approaching the region near targeting tumor cells, FC  siRNA  &#8208;PyTPA responds to extracellular MMP&#8208;2 and is cleaved into two parts: FC  siRNA  and PyTPA. The former enters cells mainly by macropinocytosis and the latter is internalized into cells mainly through caveolae&#8208;mediated endocytosis. This dividing&#8208;into&#8208;two&#8208;part strategy greatly improves the internalization efficiency of each individual therapeutic agent. Once inside the cell, (1) self&#8208;assembly of nanofiber precursor F, (2) gene interference of C  siRNA  and (3) ROS production of PyTPA are activated synergistically to successfully inhibit tumor growth.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Cooperative Photoswitching in Dihydropyrene Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>We present a strategy to achieve highly cooperative photoswitching, where the initial switching event greatly facilitates subsequent switching of the neighboring unit. By linking donor/acceptor substituted dihydropyrenes via suitable&#160;p&#8208;conjugated bridges, the quantum yield for the second photochemical ring&#8208;opening process could be enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude as compared to the first ring&#8208;opening. As a result, the intermediate mixed switching state is not detected during photoisomerization although it is formed during the thermal back reaction. Comparing the switching behavior of various dimers, both experimentally and computationally, helped to unravel the crucial role of the bridging moiety connecting both photochromic units. The presented dihydropyrene dimer serves as model system for longer cooperative switching chains, which, in principle, should enable efficient and directional transfer of information along a defined path. Moreover, our concept allows to enhance the photosensitivity in oligomeric and polymeric systems and materials thereof.</dc:description>

      <title>Idiosyncratic Ag7Pt2O7, an Electron Imprecise yet Diamagnetic, Small Band Gap Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>The seminal qualitative concepts of chemical bonding, as presented by Walter Kossel and Gilbert Newton Lewis back in 1916, have proven to be of lasting general validity. Even nowadays, these basic rules of chemical valence still serve as a touchstone for validating the plausibility of composition and constitution of a given chemical compound. Here, we report on Ag  7  Pt  2  O  7  , the composition of which violates the basic rules of chemical valence and displays an exotic crystal structure. The first coordination sphere of platinum is characteristic of tetravalent platinum. Thus, the electron count corresponds to Ag  7  Pt  2  O  7  *e  &#8208;  , where excess electrons are associated with the silver sub&#8208;structure. For such a scenario, one would expect that the excess electrons are either itinerant or localized forming Ag&#8211;Ag bonds. Neither of these assumptions complies with the experiment. The material does not show metallic conductivity, nor does the structure feature Ag&#8211;Ag pairs. Instead, indications have been obtained that the excess electrons organize themselves in 2e &#8211; 4c bonds within the silver sub&#8208;structure. This finding of a subvalent silver oxide, taken together with singular previous similar reports, is suited to reveal a new general facet pertinent to the chemistry of silver.</dc:description>
