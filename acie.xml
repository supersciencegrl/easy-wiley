         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cyanation of Organohalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reaction by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation utilizes acetone cyanohydrin as a nucleophilic cyanide source to convert simple aryl and alkenyl iodides into the corresponding nitriles. Combined experimental and computational studies highlighted the crucial role of cationic silver salts in activating the stable (P,N)&#8208;AuCN complex towards the oxidative addition of aryl iodides to subsequently generate key aryl&#8208;Au(III) cyanide complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperpolarizing Small Molecules using Parahydrogen and Solid&#8208;State Spin Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization is a simple low&#8208;cost approach for hyperpolarizing molecules to enhance their NMR signals, but requires specific hydrogenation chemistry. A new approach is shown to hyperpolarize a wider range of target molecules via solid state mixing with a pre&#8208;hyperpolarized source molecule. The mechanism of polarization transfer from the source to the target molecules is solid&#8208;state spin diffusion.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) is an inexpensive way to produce hyperpolarized molecules with polarization levels of &gt;10&#8201;% in the solution&#8208;state, but is strongly limited in generality since it requires chemical reactions/ interactions with H2. Here we report a new method to widen the scope of PHIP hyperpolarization: a source molecule is produced via PHIP with high 13C polarization, and precipitated out of solution together with a target species. Spin diffusion within the solid carries the polarization onto 13C spins of the target, which can then be dissolved for solution&#8208;state applications. We name this method PHIP&#8208;SSD (PHIP with solid&#8208;state spin diffusion) and demonstrate it using PHIP&#8208;polarized [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;fumarate as the source molecule, to polarize different 13C&#8208;labelled target molecules. 13C polarizations of between 0.01 and 3&#8201;% were measured on [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;benzoic acid, depending on the molar ratio of fumarate:benzoate in the solid state. We also show that PHIP&#8208;SSD does not require specific co&#8208;crystallization conditions by grinding dry powders of target molecules together with solid fumarate crystals, and obtain 13C signal enhancements of between 100 and 200 on [13C,15N2]&#8208;urea, [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;pyruvate, and [1&#8208;13C]&#8208;benzoic acid. This approach appears to be a promising new strategy for facile hyperpolarization based on PHIP.

         <title>Kinetics of Strand Displacement Reaction with Acyclic Artificial Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetics of strand displacement by acyclic artificial nucleic acids were systematically investigated. Effects of toehold length, temperature, orthogonality, and heterochirality were determined. These data will allow rational design of novel nanotechnology devices based on artificial nucleic acids.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction, one of the DNA nanotechnologies, has great potential as s biological programmable platform in the cellular environment. Various artificial nucleic acids have been developed to improve stability and affinity for biological applications. However, the lack of understanding of the kinetics of TMSD reaction among artificial nucleic acids has limited their applications. We herein systematically characterized the kinetics of TMSD reactions with acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs): serinol nucleic acid (SNA), acyclic D&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (D&#8208;aTNA), and acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (L&#8208;aTNA). We found that the strand displacement reactions by D&#8208;aTNA and by L&#8208;aTNA were highly dependent on temperature. D&#8208;aTNA and L&#8208;aTNA systems were orthogonal to each other, and chirality of the input can be switched by using SNA as an interface. We also applied TMSD reactions of XNAs to a seesaw gate amplification system which utilizes the orthogonality. This work will contribute to the developments of thermoresponsive and bioorthogonal nucleic acid circuits.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Like Silicone Nanofilaments@Montmorillonite Nanofillers of PEO&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries with Wide Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. The SSLMBs with the CSEs show high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are promising to accelerate commercialization of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). Nonetheless, this is hindered by the CSEs&#8217; limited ion conductivity at room temperature. Here, we propose design, synthesis, and application of the bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers for PEO&#8208;based CSEs. The neuron&#8208;like superhydrophobic nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. Compared to various reported fillers, the nanofillers can greatly improve ionic conductivity (4.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, 30&#8201;&#176;C), Li+ transference number (0.63), oxidation stability (5.3&#8197;V) and mechanical properties of the PEO&#8208;based CSEs because of the following facts. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. Consequently, the assembled SSLMBs with the CSEs and LiFePO4 or NCM811 cathodes display superior cycling stability over a wide temperature range of 50&#8201;&#176;C to 0&#8201;&#176;C. Surprisingly, the pouch batteries with the large&#8208;scale prepared CSEs kept working after being repeatedly bent, folded, cut or even punched in air. We believe that design of neuron&#8208;like nanofillers is a viable approach to produce CSEs with high room temperature ionic conductivity for SSLMBs.

         <dc:description>
Two COFs with non&#8208;polar vinylene linkages were successfully constructed using 2&#8208;connected 3,6&#8208;dimethylpyridazine in Knoevenagel condensation, with high crystallinity, large surface areas, and finely tailored micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;channels decorated with substantial cis&#8208;azo moieties, which exhibited exceptionally stepwise water uptake capacity.

In this study, we successfully developed two novel vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using 2&#8208;connected 3,6&#8208;dimethylpyridazine through Knoevenagel condensation. These COFs featured finely tailored micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;scale pore sizes, high surface areas and stable non&#8208;polar vinylene linkages. Finely resolved powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns demonstrated highly crystalline structures with a hexagonal lattice in the AA layer stacking. The resulting one&#8208;dimensional channels possess strong hydrogen&#8208;bond accepting sites arising from the decorated cis&#8208;azo/azine units with two pairs of fully exposed lone pair electrons, endowing the as&#8208;prepared COFs with exceptional water absorption properties. The g&#8208;DZPH&#8208;COF exhibited successive steep water uptake steps starting from low relative pressures (P/PSTA=0.1), with the remarkable water uptake capacity of 0.26&#8197;g/g at P/PSTA=0.2 (25&#8201;&#176;C), which is the optimal value recorded among the reported COFs. Dynamic vapour sorption measurements revealed the fast kinetics of these COFs, even in the cluster formation process. Water uptake and release cycling tests demonstrated their outstanding hydrolytic stability, durability, and adsorption&#8211;desorption retention ability.

         <title>Rational Understanding Hydroxide Diffusion Mechanism in Anion Exchange Membranes during Electrochemical Processes with RDAnalyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>

We design a toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer (RDAnalyzer), to analyze and decouple hydroxide diffusion mechanism in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) during electrochemical processes. Our simulations show that the majority of hydroxides follow the associated Grotthuss diffusion mechanism in the model system.







Abstract
Enhancing the understanding of hydroxide transport mechanisms in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is beneficial for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AEMs in the renewable energy system. However, the high complexity and lack of adequate analytic tools make it challenging to clarify different mechanisms unambiguously. Herein, we developed an in&#8208;house toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer (RDAnalyzer), to conduct an effective analysis of hydroxide diffusion mechanisms from ReaxFF molecular dynamic simulations. Using the experimentally well&#8208;synthesized T20NC6NC5N as a model system, we successfully decoupled the hydroxide diffusion mechanisms into free Vehicular and free Grotthuss, as well as associated Vehicular and associated Grotthuss, which was not yet achieved previously. Meanwhile, RDAnalyzer managed to specifically identify the drift length of hydroxide species for each mechanism under the electric field, which worked as a useful variable for calculating the conductivity of AEMs. Our theoretically predicted conductivity for T20NC6NC5N agrees reasonably with experimental results, indicating the reliability of RDAnalyzer. This work not only provides a rational understanding of the complex hydroxide diffusion mechanisms in AEMs but also holds the potential to guide the rational design of high&#8208;performance AEMs with computations.

         <title>Transient Structural Properties of the Rho GDP&#8208;Dissociation Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex formation between GTPases and their partially disordered nucleotide dissociation inhibitors has been assumed to rely on folding upon binding. Here, Medina Gomez et&#8197;al. show that instead, pertinent structural features are equally representative, both in apo inhibitor and the complex, as transient structural properties, which revises the mechanisms of membrane extraction.







Abstract
Rho GTPases, master spatial regulators of a wide range of cellular processes, are orchestrated by complex formation with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs). These have been thought to possess an unstructured N&#8208;terminus that inhibits nucleotide exchange of their client upon binding/folding. Via NMR analyses, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical assays, we reveal instead pertinent structural properties transiently maintained both, in the presence and absence of the client, imposed onto the terminus context&#8208;specifically by modulating interactions with the surface of the folded C&#8208;terminal domain. These observations revise the long&#8208;standing textbook picture of the GTPases&#8217; mechanism of membrane extraction. Rather than by a disorder&#8208;to&#8208;order transition upon binding of an inhibitory peptide, the intricate and highly selective extraction process of RhoGTPases is orchestrated via a dynamic ensemble bearing preformed transient structural properties, suitably modulated by the specific surrounding along the multi&#8208;step process.

         <title>Identification and Characterization of Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent Lyases with an Unusual CDG Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;binding motif, characterized by the canonical sequence GDG(X)24&#8208;27N, is the fingerprint of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes. We have characterized a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (JanthE) with an unusual cysteine replacing the first glycine of this motif. We unravel an unexpected function for the atypical cysteine and establish JanthE for valuable biocatalytic applications and as a model for mechanistic studies.







Abstract
The thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;binding motif, characterized by the canonical GDG(X)24&#8208;27N sequence, is highly conserved among ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes. We investigated a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (JanthE from Janthinobacterium sp. HH01) with an unusual cysteine (C458) replacing the first glycine of this motif. JanthE exhibits a high substrate promiscuity and accepts long aliphatic &#945;&#8208;keto acids as donors. Sterically hindered aromatic aldehydes or non&#8208;activated ketones are acceptor substrates, giving access to a variety of secondary and tertiary alcohols as carboligation products. The crystal structure solved at a resolution of 1.9&#8197;&#197; reveals that C458 is not primarily involved in cofactor binding as previously thought for the canonical glycine. Instead, it coordinates methionine 406, thus ensuring the integrity of the active site and the enzyme activity. In addition, we have determined the long&#8208;sought genuine tetrahedral intermediates formed with pyruvate and 2&#8208;oxobutyrate in the pre&#8208;decarboxylation states and deciphered the atomic details for their stabilization in the active site. Collectively, we unravel an unexpected role for the first residue of the ThDP&#8208;binding motif and unlock a family of lyases that can perform valuable carboligation reactions.

         <title>Light and Guest Responsive Behavior in a Porous Coordination Network Enabled by Reversible [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a light and guest responsive physisorbent which exhibited gas&#8208;induced nonporous to porous switching and [2+2] photocycloaddition upon exposure to UV irradiation or sunlight. The phase transformations were enabled by flexible olefinic linker ligands and occurred in single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion (2D sql to 3D mot topology). Activated variants exhibited different stepped isotherm profiles when exposed to CO2 at 195&#8197;K.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents that undergo reversible structural transformations induced by external stimuli (e.g. light, guests, or heat) offer the promise of utility in gas storage and separation. Whereas reports on guest or light&#8208;responsive sorbents have increased in recent years, we are unaware of reports on sorbents that exhibit both light and guest&#8208;induced structural transformations. Herein, we report that the square lattice, sql, topology coordination network Zn(fba)(bis)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMF (sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#945;, 5=trans&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)stilbene=bis, 6=2,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane=H2fba) underwent single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation (SCSC) upon activation, affording nonporous sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946;. Parallel alignment at 3.23&#8197;&#197; of olefinic moieties on adjacent bis ligands in sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#945; enabled SCSC [2+2] photocycloaddition upon exposure to UV light (365&#8197;nm) or sunlight. sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#945; thereby transformed to mot&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#945;, which was subsequently activated to the narrow pore phase mot&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946;. sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; and mot&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; both exhibited S&#8208;shaped adsorption isotherms characteristic of guest&#8208;induced structural changes when exposed to CO2 at 195&#8197;K (type&#8208;F&#8211;IV and type&#8197;F&#8211;I, respectively). Cycling experiments conducted upon sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#946; reduced particle size after cycle 1 and induced transformation into a rare example of a shape memory coordination network, sql&#8208;5,6&#8208;Zn&#8208;&#947;. Insight into this smorgasbord of SCSC phase changes was gained from in situ PXRD, single crystal XRD and 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments.

&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive physisorbents that undergo reversible structural transformations induced by external stimuli (e.g. light, guests, or heat) offer the promise of utility in gas storage and separation. Whereas reports on guest or light-responsive sorbents have increased in recent years, we are unaware of reports on sorbents that exhibit both light and guest-induced structural transformations. Herein, we report that the square lattice, &lt;b&gt;sql&lt;/b&gt;, topology coordination network Zn(fba)(bis)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2DMF (&lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#945;&lt;/b&gt;, 5=trans-4,4&#8242;-bis(1-imidazolyl)stilbene=bis, 6=2,2-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane=H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;fba) underwent single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation (SCSC) upon activation, affording nonporous &lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#946;&lt;/b&gt;. Parallel alignment at 3.23&#8197;&#197; of olefinic moieties on adjacent bis ligands in &lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#945;&lt;/b&gt; enabled SCSC [2+2] photocycloaddition upon exposure to UV light (365&#8197;nm) or sunlight. &lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#945;&lt;/b&gt; thereby transformed to &lt;b&gt;mot-5,6-Zn-&#945;&lt;/b&gt;, which was subsequently activated to the narrow pore phase &lt;b&gt;mot-5,6-Zn-&#946;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#946;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;mot-5,6-Zn-&#946;&lt;/b&gt; both exhibited S-shaped adsorption isotherms characteristic of guest-induced structural changes when exposed to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 195&#8197;K (type-F&#8211;IV and type&#8197;F&#8211;I, respectively). Cycling experiments conducted upon &lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#946;&lt;/b&gt; reduced particle size after cycle 1 and induced transformation into a rare example of a shape memory coordination network, &lt;b&gt;sql-5,6-Zn-&#947;&lt;/b&gt;. Insight into this smorgasbord of SCSC phase changes was gained from in situ PXRD, single crystal XRD and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of the Structural Analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 in the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 establish a solid foundation for designing highly efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalysts and offer new insights into the mechanism of CO2 activity at the atomic level.







Abstract
Owing to the significant attention directed toward alloy metal nanoclusters, it is crucial to explore the relationship between their structures and their performance during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and discover potential synergistic effects for the design of novel functional nanoclusters. However, a lack of suitable analogs makes this investigation challenging. In this study, we synthesized a well&#8208;defined pair of structural analogs, [Au8Cu1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ and [Au8Ag1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ (Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1, respectively), and characterized them. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au8M1 (M=Cu/Ag) consists of a tetrahedral Au3M1 core capped by three (Dppm)Au staples, one Au2(SR)3 staple, one lone SR ligand, and a terminal Cl ligand. Ag and Cu were doped at the same site in the Au8M1 nanoclusters, which has rarely been reported. Au8Cu1 exhibited a significantly higher CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO; ~82.2&#8201;%) during eCO2RR than that of Au8Ag1 (FECO; ~33.1&#8201;%). Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that *COOH is the key intermediate in the reduction of CO2 to CO. The formation of *COOH on Au8Cu1 is more thermodynamically stable than on Au8Ag1, and Au8Cu1 shows a smaller *CO formation energy than that on Au8Ag1, which promotes the reduction of CO2. We believe that the structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 offer a suitable template for the in&#8208;depth investigation of structure&#8208;property correlations at the atomic level.

         <title>Catalytic Refining Lignin&#8208;Derived Monomers: Seesaw Effect between Nanoparticle and Single&#8208;Atom Pt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seesaw effect between Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles in the catalytic refining of lignin monomers, viz. demethoxylation on a single&#8208;atom catalyst versus deep deoxygenation on a nanoparticle, is disclosed. The weak hydrogen spillover behavior on SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H inhibits hydrogenation of the benzene ring and removal of the phenol hydroxyl group, presenting in a high demethoxylation selectivity.







Abstract
Pt automatically adsorbed on oxygen vacancy of TiO2 via an in situ interfacial redox reaction, resulting in atomically dispersion of Pt on TiO2. In the upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived 4&#8208;propylguaiacol, single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) Pt/TiO2&#8722;H achieved a conversion of 96.9&#8201;% and a demethoxylation selectivity of 93.3&#8201;% under 3&#8197;MPa H2 at 250&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h, markedly different from the performance of nanoparticle counterpart that gave deep deoxygenation selectivity over 99.0&#8201;%. The high demethoxylation activity of SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H is mainly attributed to its weak hydrogen spillover capacity that suppressed the benzene ring hydrogenation and the deep deoxygenation. Additionally, SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H reduced the energy barrier of CAr&#8722;OCH3 bond cleavage and accordingly lowered the Gibbs free energy of the demethoxylation reaction. This facile method could fabricate single&#8208;atom Au, Pd, Ir, and Ru supported on TiO2&#8722;H, demonstrating the generality of this strategy for the establishment of a library of SACs. Moreover, SAC exhibited versatile capacity in demethoxylation of different lignin&#8208;derived monomers and high stability. This study showcases the superiority of atomically dispersed metal catalysts for selective demethoxylation reactions and proposes a renewable alternative to fossil&#8208;based 4&#8208;alkylphenols through upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived monomers.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Mixed Plastics of Polyester and CO2&#8208;Based Polycarbonate to a Single Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lactone/epoxide bifunctional monomer is polymerized orthogonally to polyester and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonate which, including their mixture (physical blend), can be depolymerized back to the same, single monomer with &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity, realizing the closed&#8208;loop recycling of a mixture of plastics.







Abstract
Physical blending is an effective strategy for tailoring polymeric materials to specific application requirements. However, physically blended mixed plastics waste adds additional barriers in mechanical or chemical recycling. This difficulty arises from the intricate requirement for meticulous sorting and separation of the various polymers in the inherent incompatibility of mixed polymers during recycling. To overcome this impediment, this work furthers the emerging single&#8208;monomer &#8211; multiple&#8208;materials approach through the design of a bifunctional monomer that can not only orthogonally polymerize into two different types of polymers &#8211; specifically lactone&#8208;based polyester and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonate &#8211; but the resultant polymers and their mixture can also be depolymerized back to the single, original monomer when facilitated by catalysis. Specifically, the lactone/epoxide hybrid bifunctional monomer (BiLO) undergoes ring&#8208;opening polymerization through the lactone manifold to produce polyester, PE(BiLO), and is also applied to ring&#8208;opening copolymerization with CO2, via the epoxide manifold, to yield polycarbonate, PC(BiLO). Remarkably, a one&#8208;pot recycling process of a BiLO&#8208;derived PE/PC blend back to the constituent monomer BiLO in &gt;99&#8201;% selectivity was achieved with a superbase catalyst at 150&#8201;&#176;C, thereby effectively obviating the requirement for sorting and separation typically required for recycling of mixed polymers.

         <title>Ion Current Rectification Activity Induced by Boron Hydride Nanosheets to Enhance Magnesium Analgesia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic MgB2 nanoparticles are found with potent analgesia, surpassing the efficacy of the clinical MgSO4 and morphine. In pathological environments, MgB2 undergoes hydrolysis, forming borohydride (BH). BH characterized by semimetallic properties and delocalized pi electrons, can alter the behaviors of Na+ and K+ around neurons via pi&#8208;cation interactions, significantly enhancing the magnesium analgesia.







Abstract
The limited analgesic efficiency of magnesium restricts its application in pain management. Here, we report boron hydride (BH) with ion currents rectification activity that can enhance the analgesic efficiency of magnesium without the risks of drug tolerance or addiction. We synthesize MgB2, comprising hexagonal boron sheets alternating with Mg2+. In pathological environment, Mg2+ is exchanged by H+, forming two&#8208;dimensional borophene&#8208;analogue BH sheets. BH interacts with the charged cations via cation&#8208;pi interaction, leading to dynamic modulation of sodium and potassium ion currents around neurons. Additionally, released Mg2+ competes Ca2+ to inhibit its influx and neuronal excitation. In vitro cultured dorsal root neurons show a remarkable increase in threshold potential from the normal &#8722;35.9&#8197;mV to &#8722;5.9&#8197;mV after the addition of MgB2, indicating potent analgesic effect. In three typical pain models, including CFA&#8208;induced inflammatory pain, CINP&#8208; or CCI&#8208;induced neuropathic pain, MgB2 exhibits analgesic efficiency approximately 2.23, 3.20, and 2.0&#8197;times higher than clinical MgSO4, respectively, and even about 1.04, 1.66, and 1.95&#8197;times higher than morphine, respectively. The development of magnesium based intermetallic compounds holds promise in addressing the non&#8208;opioid medical need for pain relief.

         <title>Multiple Stabilization Effects of Benzylhydrazine on Scalable Perovskite Precursor Inks for Improved Perovskite Solar Cell Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of stabilizing perovskite ink is proposed. This method uses benzylhydrazine hydrochloride (BHC) to stabilize the organic cations of perovskite ink, and remove harmful water impurities, while also reducing iodine back to iodide as has already been discovered. The downstream products of BHC and iodine are investigated via 1D and 2D&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and found to be chemically benign. All scalable perovskite solar cells are made with BHC ink and found to have nearly 20&#8201;% efficiency.







Abstract
Perovskite precursor inks suffer various forms of degradation, such as iodide anion oxidation and organic cation breakdown, hindering reliable perovskite solar cell manufacturing. Here we report that benzylhydrazine hydrochloride (BHC) not only retards the buildup of iodine as previously reported but also prevents the breakdown of organic cations. Through investigating BHC and iodine chemical reactions, we elucidate protonation and dehydration mechanisms, converting BHC to harmless volatile compounds, thus preserving perovskite film crystallization and solar cell performance. This inhibition effect lasts nearly a month with minimal BHC, contrasting control inks without BHC where organic cations fully react in less than a week. This enhanced understanding, from additive stabilization to end products, promises improved perovskite solar cell production reliability.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase&#8208;Supported Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Analysis of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic synthesis has been successfully performed producing the longest homogeneous chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycopeptides to date. Compared to more traditional chemical synthesis, this new strategy was much more efficient, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80&#8201;%. The availability of well&#8208;defined CS glycopeptides enabled the study of the impacts of sulfation on glycopeptide structures and functions.







Abstract
Proteoglycans (PGs), consisting of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked with the core protein through a tetrasaccharide linkage region, play roles in many important biological events. The chemical synthesis of PG glycopeptides is extremely challenging. In this work, the enzymes required for synthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS) PG (CSPG) have been expressed and the suitable sequence of enzymatic reactions has been established. To expedite CSPG synthesis, the peptide acceptor was immobilized on solid phase and the glycan units were directly installed enzymatically onto the peptide. Subsequent enzymatic chain elongation and sulfation led to the successful synthesis of CSPG glycopeptides. The CS dodecasaccharide glycopeptide was the longest homogeneous CS glycopeptide synthesized to date. The enzymatic synthesis was much more efficient than the chemical synthesis of the corresponding CS glycopeptides, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80&#8201;%. The structures of the CS glycopeptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis and NMR studies. In addition, the interactions between the CS glycopeptides and cathepsin G were studied. The sulfation of glycan chain was found to be important for binding with cathepsin G. This efficient chemoenzymatic strategy opens new avenues to investigate the structures and functions of PGs.

         <title>Poly(Dibenzothiophene&#8208;Terphenyl Piperidinium) for High&#8208;Performance Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the introduction of dibenzothiophene into poly(aryl piperidinium) membrane, the sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks can efficiently transport the OH&#8722; ions through continuous OH&#8722; ions conducting highways, leading to significant improvement of anion exchange membrane water electrolysis.







Abstract
The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is widely regarded as the next&#8208;generation technology for producing green hydrogen. The OH&#8722; conductivity of the anion exchange membrane plays a key role in the practical implementation of this device. Here, we present a series of Z&#8722;S&#8208;x membranes with dibenzothiophene groups. These membranes contain sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks that link surrounding surface site hopping regions, forming continuous OH&#8722; conducting highways. Z&#8722;S&#8208;20 has a high through&#8208;plane OH&#8722; conductivity of 182&#177;28&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and ultralong stability of 2650&#8197;h in KOH solution at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Based on rational design, we achieved a high PGM&#8208;free alkaline water electrolysis performance of 7.12&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#8197;V in a flow cell and demonstrated durability of 650&#8197;h at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C with a cell voltage increase of 0.65&#8197;mV/h.

         <title>Broad Protection against Invasive Fungal Disease from a Nanobody Targeting the Active Site of Fungal &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;Glucanosyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanobodies show promise in treating invasive fungal diseases such as aspergillosis and cryptococcosis. By selectively targeting enzymes critical for fungal cell wall remodeling, these single&#8208;domain antibodies significantly enhanced survival rates in animal models. This approach opens up a promising new pathway for the development of antifungal therapies, potentially improving outcomes for immunocompromised patients.







Abstract
Invasive fungal disease accounts for about 3.8&#8197;million deaths annually, an unacceptable rate that urgently prompts the discovery of new knowledge&#8208;driven treatments. We report the use of camelid single&#8208;domain nanobodies (Nbs) against fungal &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucanosyltransferases (Gel) involved in &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan transglycosylation. Crystal structures of two Nbs with Gel4 from Aspergillus fumigatus revealed binding to a dissimilar CBM43 domain and a highly conserved catalytic domain across fungal species, respectively. Anti&#8208;Gel4 active site Nb3 showed significant antifungal efficacy in vitro and in vivo prophylactically and therapeutically against different A. fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans isolates, reducing the fungal burden and disease severity, thus significantly improving immunocompromised animal survival. Notably, C. deneoformans (serotype&#8197;D) strains were more susceptible to Nb3 and genetic Gel deletion than C. neoformans (serotype A) strains, indicating a key role for &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan remodelling in C. deneoformans survival. These findings add new insight about the role of &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan in fungal biology and demonstrate the potential of nanobodies in targeting fungal enzymes to combat invasive fungal diseases.

&lt;p&gt;Nanobodies show promise in treating invasive fungal diseases such as aspergillosis and cryptococcosis. By selectively targeting enzymes critical for fungal cell wall remodeling, these single-domain antibodies significantly enhanced survival rates in animal models. This approach opens up a promising new pathway for the development of antifungal therapies, potentially improving outcomes for immunocompromised patients.

         <title>Enhancement of Overall Kinetics by Se&#8722;Br Chemistry in Rechargeable Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>

In this work, a multifunctional electrolyte additive PhSeBr has been successfully applied to Li&#8722;S batteries, which can exert synergistic influence on the electrodes and electrolyte, thus improving the kinetic behavior of lithium ion and reducing the high energy barrier of the solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur. The Li&#8722;S cell modified by PhSeBr displays the superior stability in both coin and pouch cells with the extreme conditions of high S loadings and low temperature.







Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries severely impedes the application in extreme conditions. Bridging the sulfur cathode and lithium anode, the electrolyte plays a crucial role in regulating kinetic behaviors of Li&#8722;S batteries. Herein, we report a multifunctional electrolyte additive of phenyl selenium bromide (PhSeBr) to simultaneously exert positive influences on both electrodes and the electrolyte. For the cathode, an ideal conversion routine with lower energy barrier can be attained by the redox mediator and homogeneous catalyst derived from PhSeBr, thus improving the reaction kinetics and utilization of sulfur. Meanwhile, the presence of Se&#8722;Br bond helps to reconstruct a loose solvation sheath of lithium ions and a robust bilayer SEI with excellent ionic conductivity, which contributes to reducing the de&#8208;solvation energy and simultaneously enhancing the interfacial kinetics. The Li&#8722;S battery with PhSeBr displays superior long cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 1164.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C rate. And the pouch cell exhibits a maximum capacity of 845.3&#8197;mAh and a capacity retention of 94.8&#8201;% after 50&#8197;cycles. Excellent electrochemical properties are also obtained in extreme conditions of high sulfur loadings and low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work demonstrates the versatility and practicability of the special additive, striking out an efficient but simple method to design advanced Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Hierarchical Solid&#8208;Additive Strategy for Achieving Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Organic Solar Cells with Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>

In layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells, we use FeCl3 as a p&#8208;type dopant to enhance the hole mobility and hole concentration of the lower donor layer and polyfluorene as a wide&#8208;band gap polymer additive into the upper acceptor layer to improve the morphology and prolong exciton lifetime without affecting the open&#8208;circuit voltage. Such a hierarchical strategy achieves higher and more balanced charge mobilities and suppresses charge recombination.







Abstract
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition of active layers in organic solar cells (OSCs) offers immense potential for optimizing performance through precise tailoring of each layer. However, achieving high&#8208;performance LbL OSCs with distinct solid additives in each layer remains challenging. In this study, we explore a novel approach that strategically incorporates different solid additives into specific layers of LbL devices. To this end, we introduce FeCl3 into the lower donor (D18) layer as a p&#8208;type dopant to enhance hole concentration and mobility. Concurrently, we incorporate the wide&#8208;band gap conjugated polymer poly(9,9&#8208;di&#8208;n&#8208;octylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl) (PFO) into the upper acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) layer to improve the morphology and prolong exciton lifetime. Unlike previous studies, our approach combines these two strategies to achieve higher and more balanced electron and hole mobility without affecting device open&#8208;circuit voltage, while also suppressing charge recombination. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the D18+FeCl3/L8&#8208;BO device increases to 18.12&#8201;%, while the D18/L8&#8208;BO+PFO device attains a PCE of 18.79&#8201;%. These values represent substantial improvements over the control device&#8242;s PCE of 17.59&#8201;%. Notably, when both FeCl3 and PFO are incorporated, the D18+FeCl3/L8&#8208;BO+PFO device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.17&#8201;%. In summary, our research results demonstrate the effectiveness of the layered solid additive strategy in improving OSC performance.

         <title>Modifying Proton Relay into Bioinspired Dye&#8208;Based Coordination Polymer for Photocatalytic Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural PCET enzymes, proton&#8208;relay containing dye&#8208;based coordination polymer, H+@In&#8722;AQ, was constructed as potent photocatalytic PCET mediator for both oxidative and reductive PCET, exhibiting the elevated reactivities and special selectivity in photocatalytic PCET&#8208;activation of inert bonds to furnish the conversions with pharmaceutical interests. @ZhangTiexin







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) imparts an energetic advantage over single electron transfer in activating inert substances. Natural PCET enzyme catalysis generally requires tripartite preorganization of proton relay, substrate&#8208;bound active center, and redox mediator, making the processes efficient and precluding side reactions. Inspired by this, a heterogeneous photocatalytic PCET system was established to achieve higher PCET driving forces by modifying proton relays into anthraquinone&#8208;based anionic coordination polymers. The proximally separated proton relays and photoredox&#8208;mediating anthraquinone moiety allowed pre&#8208;assembly of inert substrate between them, merging proton and electron into unsaturated bonds by photoreductive PCET, which enhanced reaction kinetics compared with the counter catalyst without proton relay. This photocatalytic PCET method was applied to a broad&#8208;scoped reduction of aryl ketones, unsaturated carbonyls, and aromatic compounds. The distinctive regioselectivities for the reduction of isoquinoline derivatives were found to occur on the carbon&#8208;ring sides. PCET&#8208;generated radical intermediate of quinoline could be trapped by alkene for proton relay&#8208;assisted Minisci addition, forming the pharmaceutical aza&#8208;acenaphthene scaffold within one step. When using heteroatom(X)&#8722;H/C&#8722;H compounds as proton&#8208;electron donors, this protocol could activate these inert bonds through photooxidative PCET to afford radicals and trap them by electron&#8208;deficient unsaturated compounds, furnishing the direct X&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <dc:description>
The pulverization&#8208;related electrochemical degradation of the silicon anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is closely associated with the presence of LiH in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). During the de&#8208;lithiation process of the silicon&#8208;based anode, the reverse lithiation of LiH on micron&#8208;sized silicon particles significantly increases the localized stress within the particles, accelerating particle pulverization.







Abstract
As a highly promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;specific capacity anode, the industrial&#8208;scale utilization of micron silicon has been hindered by the issue of pulverization during cycling. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of regulating the inorganic components of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in improving pulverization, the evolution of most key inorganic components in the SEI and their correlation with silicon failure mechanisms remain ambiguous. This study provides a clear and direct correlation between the lithium hydride (LiH) in the SEI and the degree of micron silicon pulverization in the battery system. The reverse lithiation behavior of LiH on micron silicon during de&#8208;lithiation exacerbates the localized stress in silicon particles and contributes to particle pulverization. This work successfully proposes a novel approach to decouple the SEI from electrochemical performance, which can be significant to decipher the evolution of critical SEI components at varied battery anode interfaces and analyze their corresponding failure mechanisms.

&lt;p&gt;The pulverization-related electrochemical degradation of the silicon anode in lithium-ion batteries is closely associated with the presence of LiH in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). During the de-lithiation process of the silicon-based anode, the reverse lithiation of LiH on micron-sized silicon particles significantly increases the localized stress within the particles, accelerating particle pulverization.

         <title>Strong Acid Enabled Comprehensive Training of Poly (Sodium Acrylate) Hydrogel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, general, and reversible training strategy assisted by strong&#8208;acids with two&#8208;steps is proposed to enable comprehensive improvement of the poly (sodium acrylate) network&#8208;based hydrogels by constructing dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions. The acid&#8208;containing poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels newly generate anti&#8208;swelling and self&#8208;healing performance, as well as show significantly mechanical improvement in Young's modulus, toughness, and fracture stress.







Abstract
The design of admirable hydrogel networks is of both practical and fundamental importance for diverse applications of hydrogels. Herein a general strategy of acid&#8208;assisted training is designed to enable multiple improvements of conventional poly (sodium acrylate) networks for hydrogels. Hydrophobic homogeneous crosslinked poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels are prepared to verify the strategy. The multiple improvements of poly (sodium acrylate) networks are simply achieved by immersing the hydrogel networks into 4&#8197;M H2SO4 solutions. The introduced acids would induce transformation of poly (sodium acrylate) into poly (acrylic acid) at hydrogel surface, which constructs dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions to tighten the network. The acid&#8208;containing poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels newly generate anti&#8208;swelling and self&#8208;healing performance, and show mechanical improvement. The internal poly (sodium acrylate) of the pristine acid&#8208;containing hydrogels is further fully transformed via acid&#8208;infiltration after following cyclic stretch/release training to significantly improve the mechanical performance. The Young's modulus, stress, and toughness of the fully&#8208;trained hydrogels are 187.6&#8197;times, 35.6&#8197;times, and 5.4&#8197;times enhanced, respectively. The polymeric networks retain isotropic in fully&#8208;trained hydrogels to ensure superior stretchability of 8.6. The acid&#8208;assisted training performance of the hydrogels can be reversibly recovered by NaOH neutralization. The acid&#8208;assisted training strategy here is general for poly (sodium acrylate) hydrogels.

         <title>Exfoliatable Layered 2D Honeycomb Crystals of Host&#8208;guest Complexes Networked by CH&#8208;&#960; Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cylindrical molecule with D3&#8208;symmetry was found to serve as versatile vertices to form 2&#8208;dimensional, honeycomb networks of host&#8211;guest complexes. Varying the structural elements of the layered systems enabled a wide range of structural combinations to become accessible.







Abstract
Studies of graphene show that robust chemical bonds such as covalent bonds with trigonal&#8208;planar atoms afford layered atomic 2D crystals possessing unique properties. Although layered molecular crystals are of interest to diversify elements and structures of 2D materials, the structural diversity of molecules as well as weak intermolecular interactions inevitably makes the design to be one&#8208;off and individual. We herein report a versatile method to assemble layered molecular crystals. By developing a D3&#8208;symmetry host at vertices to form a honeycomb layer, a diverse range of layered 2D host&#8211;guest crystals were obtained. Substituents on the host, elements/structures of the guest, the stereochemistry of the host and types of intercalants were diversified, which should allow for 6&#215;32&#215;3&#215;2 combinations for structural diversification.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Prediction&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Thiophosphates as Promising Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the guidance of theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric alkali and alkaline earth metal [PS4]&#8208;based thiophosphates ACaPS4 have been synthesized successfully. Comprehensive characterizations indicate that the ACaPS4 family could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, considering the wide band gap, moderate birefringence, high LIDT, and phase&#8208;matching large SHG response.







Abstract
Oriented synthesis of functional materials is a focus of attention in material science. As one of the most important function materials, infrared nonlinear optical materials with large second harmonic generation effects and broad optical band gap are in urgent need. In this work, directed by the theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) alkali&#8208;alkaline earth metal [PS4]&#8208;based thiophosphates LiCaPS4 (Ama2), NaCaPS4 (P21), KCaPS4 (Pna21), RbCaPS4 (Pna21), CsCaPS4 (Pna21) were successfully synthesized. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that ACaPS4 could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, exhibiting wide band gap (3.77&#8211;3.86&#8197;eV), moderate birefringence (0.027&#8211;0.064 at 1064&#8197;nm), high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT, ~10&#215;AGS), and suitable phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation responses (0.4&#8211;0.6&#215;AGS). Structure&#8208;properties analyses illustrate that the Ca&#8722;S bonds show non&#8208;ignorable covalent feature, and [PS4] together with [CaSn] units play dominant roles to determine the band gap and SHG response. This work indicates that Li&#8208;, Na&#8208; and K&#8208; analogs may be promising infrared nonlinear optical material candidates, and this is the first successful case of &#8220;prediction to synthesis&#8221; involving infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals in the thiophosphate system and may provide a new avenue to the design and oriented synthesis of high&#8208;performance function materials in the future.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Peptide Assemblies for Multi&#8208;Pathway Cell Death and Tumor Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by copper peptides in human plasma, we designed a ferrocene&#8208;capped self&#8208;assembling peptide, FcGH. It can self&#8208;assemble through two different pathways: spontaneous self&#8208;assembly and Cu2+&#8208;induced. By controlling the amount of Cu2+ added, these pathways can form adjustable assembly morphologies and generate different biological effects.







Abstract
Although self&#8208;assembly has emerged as an effective tool for fabricating biomaterials, achieving precise control over the morphologies and functionalities of the resultant assemblies remains an ongoing challenge. Inspired by the copper peptide naturally present in human plasma, in this study, we designed a synthetic precursor, FcGH. FcGH can self&#8208;assemble via two distinct pathways: spontaneous and Cu2+&#8208;induced. These two assembly pathways enabled the formation of assemblies with tunable morphologies by adjusting the amount of added Cu2+. We found that the nanoparticles formed by Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly exhibited a significantly higher cellular uptake efficiency than the wormlike fibers formed spontaneously. Moreover, this Cu2+&#8208;induced assembly process occurred spontaneously at a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio of Cu2+ to FcGH, avoiding the excessive use of Cu2+ and a tedious preparation procedure. By co&#8208;assembling with 10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT)&#8208;conjugated FcGH, Cu2+&#8208;induced supramolecular nanodrugs elicited multiple cell death modalities in cancer cells with elevated immunogenicity, enhancing the therapeutic effect compared to free HCPT.

     alt="Copper-Induced Supramolecular Peptide Assemblies for Multi-Pathway Cell Death and Tumor Inhibition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by copper peptides in human plasma, we designed a ferrocene-capped self-assembling peptide, FcGH. It can self-assemble through two different pathways: spontaneous self-assembly and Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced. By controlling the amount of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; added, these pathways can form adjustable assembly morphologies and generate different biological effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although self-assembly has emerged as an effective tool for fabricating biomaterials, achieving precise control over the morphologies and functionalities of the resultant assemblies remains an ongoing challenge. Inspired by the copper peptide naturally present in human plasma, in this study, we designed a synthetic precursor, FcGH. FcGH can self-assemble via two distinct pathways: spontaneous and Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced. These two assembly pathways enabled the formation of assemblies with tunable morphologies by adjusting the amount of added Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. We found that the nanoparticles formed by Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced self-assembly exhibited a significantly higher cellular uptake efficiency than the wormlike fibers formed spontaneously. Moreover, this Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced assembly process occurred spontaneously at a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to FcGH, avoiding the excessive use of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and a tedious preparation procedure. By co-assembling with 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT)-conjugated FcGH, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced supramolecular nanodrugs elicited multiple cell death modalities in cancer cells with elevated immunogenicity, enhancing the therapeutic effect compared to free HCPT. This study highlights Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced self-assembly as an efficient tool for directing the assembly of nanodrugs and for synergistic tumor therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Lead&#8208;free Hybrid Layered Double Perovskite Halides: Synthesis, Structural Transition and Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs) have been synthesized by variations of trivalent metal centers in the inorganic layer as well as modifications in the organic spacers. All the HLDPs display ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (kL) with notable anisotropy in&#160;kL&#160;observed for RP&#8208;HLDP (3N&#8208;CuIn) when&#160;measured parallel and perpendicular&#160;to layer stacking.







Abstract
Hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs), representing the two&#8208;dimensional manifestation of halide double perovskites, have elicited considerable interest owing to their intricate chemical bonding hierarchy and structural diversity. This intensified interest stems from the diverse options available for selecting alternating octahedral coordinated trivalent [M(III)] and monovalent metal centers [M(I)], along with the distinctive nature of the cationic organic amine located between the layers. Here, we have synthesized three new compounds with general formula (R&#8242;/R&#8242;&#8242;)4/2M(III)M(I)Cl8; where R&#8242;=C3H7NH3 (i.e. 3N) and R&#8242;&#8242;=NH3C4H8NH3 (i.e. 4N4); M(III)=In3+ or Ru3+; M(I)=Cu+ by simple solution&#8208;based acid precipitation method. The structural analysis reveals that (4N4)2CuInCl8 and (4N4)2CuRuCl8 adopt the layered Dion Jacobson (DJ) structure, whereas (3N)4CuInCl8 exhibits layered Ruddlesden Popper (RP) structure. The alternative octahedra within the inorganic layer display distortions and tilting. Three compounds show temperature&#8208;dependent structural phase transitions where changes in the staking of inorganic layer, extent of octahedral tilting and reorientation of organic spacers with temperature have been noticed. We have achieved ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) in the HLDPs in the 2 to 300&#8197;K range, marking a distinctive feature within the realm of HLDP systems. The RP&#8208;HLDP compound, (3N)4CuInCl8, demonstrates anisotropy in &#954;L while measured parallel and perpendicular to layer stacking, showcasing ultralow &#954;L of 0.15 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is one of the lowest values obtained among Pb&#8208;free metal halide perovskite. The observed ultralow &#954;L in three new HLDPs is attributed to significant lattice anharmonicity arising from the chemical bonding heterogeneity and soft crystal structure, which resulted in low&#8208;energy localized optical phonon modes that suppress heat&#8208;carrying acoustic phonons.

         <title>Directional Growth and Density Modulation of Single&#8208;Atom Platinum for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic adsorption synergistically modulates the density of CeO2&#8722;X particles on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) ultimately enabling directional growth and localized density modulation of single&#8208;atom platinum (PtSA). Localized density control of PtSA via tuning the density of H* radicals can improve the electrocatalytic performance of all pH conditions in hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
Dispersion of single atoms (SAs) in the host is important for optimizing catalytic activity. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to tune oxygen vacancies in CeO2&#8722;X directionally anchoring the single atom platinum (PtSA), which is uniformly dispersed on the rGO. The catalyst's performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be enhanced by controlling different densities of CeO2&#8208;X in rGO. The PtSA performs best optimally densified and loaded on homogeneous and moderately densified CeO2&#8208;X/rGO (PtSA&#8722;M&#8722;CeO2&#8722;X/rGO). It exhibited higher activity in HER with an overpotential of 25&#8197;mV at 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 and 33&#8197;mV at 1 KOH than that of almost reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, it exhibited stability for 90&#8197;hours at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1 KOH and &#8722;150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 conditions, respectively. Through comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the suitable dispersion density of PtSA on the defects of CeO2&#8722;X with more active sites gives the potential for practical applications. This research paves the way for developing single&#8208;atom catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity and stability, holding promise in advanced green energy conversion through defects engineering.

         <title>Structurally Modulated Formation of Cyanine J&#8208;Aggregates with Sharp and Tunable Spectra for Multiplexed Optoacoustic and Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208;aggregates with sharp spectral bands are attained by introducing a branched structure with a benzyl and a trifluoroacetyl group at meso&#8208;position of heptamethine cyanine dyes. Fine&#8208;tuning the benzyl group enables spectral regulation of J&#8208;aggregates. J&#8208;aggregates with their absorption band in NIR&#8208;II region are successfully implemented in multiplexed optoacoustic and fluorescence imaging on animal models.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregation brings intriguing optical and electronic properties to molecular dyes and significantly expands their applicability across diverse domains, yet the challenge for rationally designing J&#8208;aggregating dyes persists. Herein, we developed a large number of J&#8208;aggregating dyes from scratch by progressively refining structure of a common heptamethine cyanine. J&#8208;aggregates with sharp spectral bands (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum&#8804;38&#8197;nm) are attained by introducing a branched structure featuring a benzyl and a trifluoroacetyl group at meso&#8208;position of dyes. Fine&#8208;tuning the benzyl group enables spectral regulation of J&#8208;aggregates. Analysis of single crystal data of nine dyes reveals a correlation between J&#8208;aggregation propensity and molecular arrangement within crystals. Some J&#8208;aggregates are successfully implemented in multiplexed optoacoustic and fluorescence imaging in animals. Notably, three&#8208;color multispectral optoacoustic tomography imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution is achieved, owing to the sharp and distinct absorption bands of the J&#8208;aggregates.

Electron Theft: Upon removal of an electron, perfluoronaphthalene turns to the selective and powerful deelectronator radical cation [naphthaleneF]+., with a potential of +2.00 (solution)/+2.41&#8197;V (solid&#8208;state) vs. Fc+/0. Its broad applicability, power, and selectivity are demonstrated by the reaction with a series of exemplarily chosen organ(ometall)ic molecules and elements.







Abstract
A selective deelectronation reagent with very high potential of +2.00 (solution)/+2.41&#8197;V (solid&#8208;state) vs. Fc+/0 and based on a room temperature stable perfluoronaphthalene (naphthaleneF) radical cation salt was developed and applied. The solid&#8208;state deelectronation of commercial naphthaleneF with [NO]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; generates [naphthaleneF]+&#8901;[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (ORF=OC(CF3)3) in gram scale. Thermochemical analysis unravels the solid&#8208;state deelectronation potential of the starting [NO]+&#8208;reagent to be +2.34&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 with [F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; counterion, but only +1.14&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 with the small [SbF6]&#8722; ion. Selective reactions demonstrate the selectivity of [naphthaleneF]+&#8901; for deelectronation of a multitude of organ(ometall)ic molecules and elements in solution: providing the molecular structures of the acene dications [tetracene]2+, [pentacene]2+ or spectroscopic evidence for the carbonyl complex of the ferrocene dication [Fc(CO)]2+, the [P9]+ cation from white phosphorus, the solvent&#8208;free copper(I) salt starting from copper metal and the dicationic Fe(IV)&#8208;scorpionate complex [Fe(sc)2]2+.

         <title>Efficient Capture and Low Energy Release of NH3 by Azophenol Decorated Photoresponsive Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new UV/Vis photoresponsive covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;HNU38, was designed and synthesized by chemical integration of light&#8208;responsive azophenol units into the pore wall of an imine type COF as both light switch and NH3 adsorption sites. It was found that the COF exhibited efficient capture and low&#8208;energy release of NH3, and about 29.0&#8201;% of the adsorbed NH3 could be removed by vis&#8208;light irradiated cis&#8208;trans isomerization at 25&#8201;&#176;C, while the remaining NH3 might be released at 25&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum.







Abstract
In NH3 capture technologies, the desorption process is usually driven by high temperature and low pressure (such as 150&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum), which accounts for intensive energy consumption and CO2 emission. Developing light responsive adsorbent is promising in this regard but remains a great challenge. Here, we for the first time designed and synthesized a light responsive azophenol&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF), COF&#8208;HNU38, to address this challenge. We found that at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1.0&#8197;bar, the cis &#8208;COF exhibited a NH3 uptake capacity of 7.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a NH3/N2 selectivity of 158. In the adsorbed NH3, about 29.0&#8201;% could be removed by vis&#8208;light irradiated cis&#8208;trans isomerization at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the remaining NH3 might be released at 25&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum. Almost no decrease in adsorption capacity was observed after eight adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. As such, an efficient NH3 capture and low energy release strategy was established thanks to the multiple hydrogen bond interactions (which are strong in total but weak in individuals) between NH3 and the smart COF, as well as the increased polarity and number of hydrogen bond sites after the trans&#8208;cis isomerization.

         <title>Intrinsically Decoupled Coordination Chemistries Enable Quasi&#8208;Eutectic Electrolytes with Fast Kinetics toward Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>

A universal theory of intrinsically decoupling is proposed to conquer the sluggish kinetics in eutectic electrolytes, producing a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;quasi&#8208;eutectic&#8221; electrolyte that enables ZICs with high reversibility and elevated capacitance output.







Abstract
Eutectic electrolytes show potential beyond conventional low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) in zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) yet suffer from high viscosity and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we originally propose a universal theory of intrinsically decoupling to address these issues, producing a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;quasi&#8208;eutectic&#8221; electrolyte (quasi&#8208;EE). Joint experimental and theoretical analyses confirm its unique solution coordination structure doped with near&#8208;LCE domains. This enables the quasi&#8208;EE well inherit the advanced properties at deep&#8208;eutectic states while provide facilitated kinetics as well as lower energy barriers via a vehicle/hopping&#8208;hybridized charge transfer mechanism. Consequently, a homogeneous electroplating pattern with much enhanced Sand's time is achieved on the Zn surface, followed by a twofold prolonged service&#8208;life with drastically reduced concentration polarization. More encouragingly, the quasi&#8208;EE also delivers increased capacitance output in ZICs, which is elevated by 12.4&#8201;%&#8211;144.6&#8201;% compared to that before decoupling. Furthermore, the pouch cell with a cathodic mass loading of 36.6&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maintains competitive cycling performances over 600&#8197;cycles, far exceeding other Zn&#8208;based counterparts. This work offers fresh insights into eutectic decoupling and beyond.

         <title>Dynamics of the Boundary Layer in Pulsed CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While numerous experimental investigations underscore the efficacy of pulsed CO2 electrolysis in enhancing productivity, selectivity, and stability, elucidating the underlying mechanisms remains an intricate challenge. However, modeling the boundary layer, assuming steric ion effects and non&#8208;electroneutral conditions, allows us to illuminate dynamic reorganization within the electrode microenvironment.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 poses a vast potential to contribute to a defossilized industry. Despite tremendous developments within the field, mass transport limitations, carbonate salt formation, and electrode degradation mechanisms still hamper the process performance. One promising approach to tweak CO2 electrolysis beyond today's limitations is pulsed electrolysis with potential cycling between an operating and a regeneration mode. Here, we rigorously model the boundary layer at a silver electrode in pulsed operation to get profound insights into the dynamic reorganization of the electrode microenvironment. In our simulation, pulsed electrolysis leads to a significant improvement of up to six times higher CO current density and 20 times higher cathodic energy efficiency when pulsing between &#8722;1.85 and &#8722;1.05&#8197;V vs SHE compared to constant potential operation. We found that elevated reactant availability in pulsed electrolysis originates from alternating replenishment of CO2 by diffusion and not from pH&#8208;induced carbonate and bicarbonate conversion. Moreover, pulsed electrolysis substantially promotes carbonate removal from the electrode by up to 83&#8201;% compared to constant potential operation, thus reducing the risk of salt formation. Therefore, this model lays the groundwork for an accurate simulation of the dynamic boundary layer modulation, which can provide insights into manifold electrochemical conversions.

         <title>Oxygen Functional Groups Regulate Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin Molecular Electrocatalyst for Acidic H2O2 Electrosynthesis at Industrial&#8208;Level Current</title>

A local&#8208;environmental regulation infinitely clarifies distinguishing interaction manners (remote or vicinal interaction) between different oxygen functional groups and Co center, and hence enhances the acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis on cobalt&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) reactor represents a promising approach to industrial&#8208;level H2O2 production, while it is hampered by the lack of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts in acidic medium. Herein, we present a strategy for the specific oxygen functional group (OFG) regulation to promote the H2O2 selectivity up to 92&#8201;% in acid on cobalt&#8208;porphyrin molecular assembled with reduced graphene oxide. In situ X&#8208;ray adsorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy combined with theoretical calculation unravel that different OFGs exert distinctive regulation effects on the electronic structure of Co center through either remote (carboxyl and epoxy) or vicinal (hydroxyl) interaction manners, thus leading to the opposite influences on the promotion in 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity. As a consequence, the PEM electrolyzer integrated with the optimized catalyst can continuously and stably produce the high&#8208;concentration of ca. 7&#8197;wt&#8201;% pure H2O2 aqueous solution at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 200&#8197;h with a cell voltage as low as ca. 2.1&#8197;V, suggesting the application potential in industrial&#8208;scale H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Elevating Discharge Voltage of Li2CO3&#8208;Routine Li&#8722;CO2 Battery over 2.9&#8197;V at an Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Li&#8722;CO2 battery with a configuration of Li/LiTFSI&#8208;TEGDME&#8208;CoPc/Mo2C exhibits prominent temperature adaptability (&#8722;30&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C), high electrochemical stability (1600&#8197;hours), and especially a higher discharge voltage of 2.98&#8197;V than the theoretical value (2.8&#8197;V). CoPc adsorbs CO2 to form an intermediate C33H16CoN8O2, and the reduction potential of intermediate C33H16CoN8O2 is higher than 2.8&#8197;V. This is the main reason why Li&#8722;CO2 battery has an ultra&#8208;high discharge platform.







Abstract
The Li&#8722;CO2 batteries utilizing greenhouse gas CO2 possess advantages of high energy density and environmental friendliness. However, these batteries following Li2CO3&#8208;product route typically exhibit low work voltage (&lt;2.5&#8197;V) and energy efficiency. Herein, we have demonstrated for the first time that cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) as homogeneous catalyst can elevate the work plateau towards 2.98&#8197;V, which is higher than its theoretical discharge voltage without changing the Li2CO3&#8208;product route. This unprecedented discharge voltage is illustrated by mass spectrum and electrochemical analyses that CoPc has powerful adsorption capability with CO2 (&#8722;7.484&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and forms discharge intermediate of C33H16CoN8O2. Besides high discharge capacity of 18724&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and robust cyclability over 1600&#8197;hours (1000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 cut&#8208;off) at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the batteries show high temperature adaptability (&#8722;30&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C). Our work is paving a promising avenue for the progress of high&#8208;efficiency Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>BF2&#8208;Bridged Azafulvene Dimer&#8208;Based 1064&#8201;nm Laser&#8208;Driven Superior Photothermal Agent for Deep&#8208;Seated Tumor Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A BF2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimer&#8208;based superior photothermal agent (OTTBF) with high MEC was designed for combating the deep&#8208;seated tumor in NIR&#8208;II window. This study provides an insight into the future exploration of versatile D&#8208;A&#8208;D structured NIR&#8208;II absorption organic PTAs for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Small organic photothermal agents (PTAs) with absorption bands located in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window are highly desirable for effectively combating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, the rarely reported NIR&#8208;II absorbing PTAs still suffer from a low molar extinction coefficient (MEC, &#1013;), inadequate chemostability and photostability, as well as the high light power density required during the therapeutic process. Herein, we developed a series of boron difluoride bridged azafulvene dimer acceptor&#8208;integrated small organic PTAs. The B&#8208;N coordination bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated azafulvene dimer backbone endow it the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, facilitating the vigorous donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) structure PTAs with NIR&#8208;II absorption. Notably, the PTA namely OTTBF shows high MEC (7.21&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), ultrahigh chemo&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. After encapsulated into water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticles, OTTBF NPs can achieve remarkable photothermal conversion effect under 1064&#8197;nm irradiation with a light density as low as 0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is the lowest reported NIR&#8208;II light power used in PTT process as we know. Furthermore, OTTBF NPs have been successfully applied for in vitro and in vivo deep&#8208;seated cancer treatments under 1064&#8197;nm laser. This study provides an insight into the future exploration of versatile D&#8208;A&#8208;D structured NIR&#8208;II absorption organic PTAs for biomedical applications.

         <title>Precisely Regulating Intermolecular Interactions and Molecular Packing of Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors via Halogen Transposition for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we propose a novel halogen transposition strategy aimed at precisely regulate the intermolecular interactions and aggregated structures of nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs). Hence, the NFREA 3TTB&#8208;ClF, featuring a 3D&#8208;interconnected packing network, achieves outstanding power conversion efficiencies of 17.46&#8201;% and 18.24&#8201;% in binary and ternary organic photovoltaic devices, respectively, marking a new milestone in the field of NFREA&#8208;based organic solar cells.







Abstract
The structure of molecular aggregates is crucial for charge transport and photovoltaic performance in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, the intermolecular interactions and aggregated structures of nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) are precisely regulated through a halogen transposition strategy, resulting in a noteworthy transformation from a 2D&#8208;layered structure to a 3D&#8208;interconnected packing network. Based on the 3D electron transport pathway, the binary and ternary devices deliver outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.46&#8201;% and 18.24&#8201;%, respectively, marking the highest value for NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.

Based on the 3D electron transport pathway, the binary and ternary devices deliver outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.46&#8201;% and 18.24&#8201;%, respectively, marking the highest value for NFREA-based OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Transformation from Membrane&#8208;Less Coacervates to Membranized Coacervates and Giant Vesicles: Toward Multicompartmental Protocells with Complex (Membrane) Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous protocell transformation system is developed. In a meticulously controlled anionic terpolymer concentration&#8208;dependent process, membrane&#8208;less coacervates can be induced into membranized coacervates and, ultimately, into giant hybrid vesicles. This transition endows protocells with diverse structural features in this system and further promotes the creation of synthetic cells with different diffusible compartments.







Abstract
The membranization of membrane&#8208;less coacervates paves the way for the exploitation of complex protocells with regard to structural and cell&#8208;like functional behaviors. However, the controlled transformation from membranized coacervates to vesicles remains a challenge. This can provide stable (multi)phase and (multi)compartmental architectures through the reconfiguration of coacervate droplets in the presence of (bioactive) polymers, bio(macro)molecules and/or nanoobjects. Herein, we present a continuous protocell transformation from membrane&#8208;less coacervates to membranized coacervates and, ultimately, to giant hybrid vesicles. This transformation process is orchestrated by altering the balance of non&#8208;covalent interactions through varying concentrations of an anionic terpolymer, leading to dynamic processes such as spontaneous membranization of terpolymer nanoparticles at the coacervate surface, disassembly of the coacervate phase mediated by the excess anionic charge, and the redistribution of coacervate components in membrane. The diverse protocells during the transformation course provide distinct structural features and molecular permeability. Notably, the introduction of multiphase coacervates in this continuous transformation process signifies advancements toward the creation of synthetic cells with different diffusible compartments. Our findings emphasize the highly controlled continuous structural reorganization of coacervate protocells and represents a novel step toward the development of advanced and sophisticated synthetic protocells with more precise compositions and complex (membrane) structures.

         <title>Spheroidization: The Impact of Precursor Morphology on Solid&#8208;State Lithiation Process for High&#8208;Quality Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We clarified the relationship between precursor morphology and structural evolution of ultrahigh nickel layered cathode during solid&#8208;state lithiation. Spheroidization of precursors avoids the inhomogeneous distribution of LiOH and inhibits the preferential lithiation on particle surface, which can fundamentally solve the inhomogeneous phase transition of cathodes material. This strategy improves the cycling stability of the cathode material.







Abstract
Layered oxides with ultrahigh nickel content are considered promising high energy cathode materials. However, their cycle stability is constrained by a series of heterogeneous structural transformations during the complex solid&#8208;state lithiation process. By in&#8208;depth investigation into the solid&#8208;state lithiation process of LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, it is found that the protruded parts on the surface of precursor particles tend to be surrounded by locally excessive LiOH, which promotes the formation of a rigid and dense

 shell during the early stage of lithiation process. The shell will hinder the diffusion of lithium and topotactic lithiation within the particles, culminating in spatially heterogeneous intermediates that can impair the electrochemical properties of the cathode material. The spheroidization of the precursor can enhance uniformity in structural evolution during solid&#8208;phase lithiation. Ultrahigh nickel cathodes derived from spherical precursors demonstrate high initial discharge specific capacity (234.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, in the range of 2.7&#8211;4.3&#8197;V) and capacity retention (89.3&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles), significantly superior to the non&#8208;spherical samples. This study not only sheds light on the intricate relationship between precursor shape and structural transformation but also introduces a novel strategy for enhancing cathode performance through precursor spheroidization.

         <title>Compressible Hydrogels with Stabilized Chirality from Thermoresponsive Helical Dendronized Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoresponsive hydrogels were fabricated from helical dendronized phenylacetylene copolymers, which showed stabilized helicities originated from the copolymer precursors, and memorized the thermally&#8208;induced chiralities. These hydrogels possessed excellent mechanical properties, and exhibited unprecedent compressibility with extraordinary fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Fabrication of chiral hydrogels from thermoresponsive helical dendronized phenylacetylene copolymers (PPAs) carrying three&#8208;fold dendritic oligoethylene glycols (OEGs) is reported. Three different temperatures, i.e. below or above cloud point temperatures (Tcps) of the copolymers, and under freezing condition, were utilized, affording thermoresponsive hydrogels with different morphologies and mechanical properties. At room temperature, transparent hydrogels were obtained through crosslinking among different copolymer chains. Differently, opaque hydrogels with much improved mechanical properties were formed at elevated temperatures through crosslinking from the thermally dehydrated and collapsed copolymer aggregates, leading to heterogeneity for the hydrogels with highly porous morphology. While crosslinking at freezing temperature synergistically through ice templating, these amphiphilic dendronized copolymers formed hydrogels with highly porous lamellar structures, which exhibited remarkable compressible properties as human articular cartilage with excellent fatigue resistance. Amphiphilicity of the dendronized copolymers played a pivotal role in modulating the network formation during the gelation, as well as morphology and mechanical performance of the resulting hydrogels. Through crosslinking, these dendronized copolymers featured with typical dynamic helical conformations were transformed into hydrogels with unprecedently stabilized helicities due to the restrained chain mobilities in the three&#8208;dimensional networks.

         <title>Steering Geometric Reconstruction of Bismuth with Accelerated Dynamics for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of elemental Cl into Bi19Cl3S27 significantly accelerates the electrochemical reconstruction process, inducing the formation of bismuth nanosheets with abundant vacancy defects. These Bi vacancies can aggregate electron density and enhance the adsorption of key intermediates *OCHO, thereby facilitating the production of formate.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8208;based materials have emerged as promising catalysts in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate. However, the reasons for the reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based precursors to form bismuth nanosheets are still puzzling, especially the formation of defective bismuth sites. Herein, we prepare bismuth nanosheets with vacancy&#8208;rich defects (V&#8208;Bi NS) by rapidly reconstructing Bi19Cl3S27 under negative potential. Theoretical analysis reveals that the introduction of chlorine induces the generation of intrinsic electric field in the precursor, thereby increasing the electron transfer rate and further promoting the metallization of trivalent bismuth. Meanwhile, experimental tests verify that Bi19Cl3S27 has a faster reconstruction rate than Bi2S3. The formed V&#8208;Bi NS exhibits up to 96&#8201;% HCOO&#8722; Faraday efficiency and 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 HCOO&#8722; partial current densities, and its electrochemical active surface area normalized formate current density and yield are 2.2&#8197;times higher than those of intact bismuth nanosheets (I&#8208;Bi NS). Density functional theory calculations indicate that bismuth vacancies with electron&#8208;rich aggregation reduce the activation energy of CO2 to *CO2&#8722; radicals and stabilize the adsorption of the key intermediate *OCHO, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics of formate production.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Cascade Hydrogen Atom Transfers for Assembly of Multi&#8208;Substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H Cyclopentanones</title>

A photocatalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H cyclopentanones. The strengths are multiple including green aspects (atom&#8208;economy, photocatalysis, continuous microflow synthesis). Each step of the reaction mechanism was deciphered by DFT calculations. This work expands the scope of possibilities, which means gaining access to novel fluorinated scaffolds for biological evaluation.







Abstract
A photocatalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed to construct original polysubstituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 cyclopentanones in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. This building block approach leverages trifluoromethylthio alkynes and branched/linear aldehydes, as readily available reaction partners, in consecutive hydrogen atom transfers and C&#8722;C bond formations. Difluoromethylthio alkynes are also compatible substrates. Furthermore, the potential for telescoped reaction starting from alcohols instead of aldehydes was demonstrated, as well as process automatization and scale&#8208;up under continuous microflow conditions. This prompted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to support a radical&#8208;mediated cascade process.

         <title>Bimetallic Single Atom/Nanoparticle Ensemble for Efficient Photochemical Cascade Synthesis of Ethylene from Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a bimetallic design of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd single atoms (SAs) on ZnO for the cascade photocatalytic CH4 conversion toward C2H4 with the highest production rate compared with previous works. The synergistic effect of Ag NPs and Pd SAs lowers the overall energy barrier of the activation process of both CH4 and the resulting C2H6, constituting a truly synergistic catalytic system to facilitate the C2H4 generation.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven photoredox catalysis presents a promising approach for the activation and conversion of methane (CH4) into high value&#8208;added chemicals under ambient conditions. However, the high C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy of CH4 and the absence of well&#8208;defined C&#8722;H activation sites on catalysts significantly limit the highly efficient conversion of CH4 toward multicarbon (C2+) hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene (C2H4). Herein, we demonstrate a bimetallic design of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and Pd single atoms (SAs) on ZnO for the cascade conversion of CH4 into C2H4 with the highest production rate compared with previous works. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic effect of Ag NPs and Pd SAs, upon effecting key bond&#8208;breaking and &#8208;forming events, lowers the overall energy barrier of the activation process of both CH4 and the resulting C2H6, constituting a truly synergistic catalytic system to facilitate the C2H4 generation. This work offers a novel perspective on the advancement of photocatalytic directional CH4 conversion toward high value&#8208;added C2+ hydrocarbons through the subtle design of bimetallic cascade catalyst strategy.

         <title>Enantioselective Allylboration of Acetylene: A Versatile Tool for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the enantioselective conversion of acetylene gas under ambient temperature and pressure into a chiral orthogonally functionalized skipped diene is reported. The product represents a privileged scaffold to access the full set of stereoisomers of the chiral skipped diene core through simple stereodivergent pathways, thus serving as a versatile intermediate for the enantioselective total synthesis of natural skipped diene products.







Abstract
Efficient catalytic methods that allow the use of simple and abundant chemical feedstocks for the preparation of synthetically versatile compounds are central to modern synthetic chemistry. Acetylene is a basic feedstock with a remarkable production over one million tons per year, although it is underutilized in the stereoselective synthesis of fine chemicals. Here we report a facile catalytic multicomponent reaction that allows for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective allylboration of acetylene gas. This process is catalyzed by a chiral copper catalyst, operates without specialized equipment or pressurization, and provides chiral skipped dienes bearing stereodefined and orthogonally functionalized olefins with excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The combined stereochemical features and orthogonal functionalization make the products privileged structural scaffolds to access the complete set of stereoisomers of the chiral skipped diene core through simple enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent pathways. The utility of the method is demonstrated with the enantioselective synthesis of three bioactive natural skipped diene products, namely (+)&#8208;Nyasol, (+)&#8208;Hinokiresinol and Phorbasin C, and other related synthetically relevant chiral molecules.

         <title>Mass Transfer Limitation within Molecular Crowding Electrolyte Reorienting (100) and (101) Texture for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is introduced into Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous solution to prepare a macromolecular crowding electrolyte (MCE). Under the regulation of both specific adsorption of PVP on the Zn surface and mass transfer limitation in the MCE, the Zn deposition exhibits reoriented (100) and (101) textures. Consequently, MCE enables zinc metal batteries with dendrite&#8208;free deposition and high sustainability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries are emerging as a promising alternative for energy storage due to their high safety and low cost. However, their development is hindered by the formation of Zn dendrites and side reactions. Herein, a macromolecular crowding electrolyte (MCE40) is prepared by incorporating polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) into the aqueous solutions, exhibiting an enlarged electrochemical stability window and anti&#8208;freezing properties. Notably, through electrochemical measurements and characterizations, it is discovered that the mass transfer limitation near the electrode surface within the MCE40 electrolyte inhibits the (002) facets. This leads to the crystallographic reorientation of Zn deposition to expose the (100) and (101) textures, which undergo a &#8220;nucleation&#8208;merge&#8208;growth&#8221; process to form a uniform and compact Zn deposition. Consequently, the MCE40 enables highly reversible and stable Zn plating/stripping in Zn/Cu half cells over 600&#8197;cycles and in Zn/Zn symmetric cells for over 3000&#8197;hours at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, Na0.33V2O5/Zn and &#945;&#8208;MnO2/Zn full cells display promising capacity and sustained stability over 500&#8197;cycles at room and sub&#8208;zero temperatures. This study highlights a novel electrochemical mechanism for achieving preferential Zn deposition, introducing a unique strategy for fabricating dendrite&#8208;free zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Atomically Precise Chiral Metal Nanoclusters for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral silver nanoclusters (R/S&#8208;Ag7) were successfully prepared and utilized as photoactive materials for direct CPL detection. The R/S&#8208;Ag7&#8208;based photodetectors show effective discrimination between RCP and LCP lights with short response time, high responsivity and considerable discrimination ratio. This work demonstrates the direct detection of CPL by metal clusters for the first time, paving the way for the application of chiral metal clusters in CPL detection.







Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) detection is of great significance in various applications such as drug identification, sensing and imaging. Atomically precise chiral metal nanoclusters with intense circular dichroism (CD) signals are promising candidates for CPL detection, which can further facilitate device miniaturization and integration. Herein, we report the preparation of a pair of optically active chiral silver nanoclusters [Ag7(R/S&#8208;DMA)2(dpppy)3] (BF4)3 (R/S&#8208;Ag7) for direct CPL detection. The crystal structure and molecular formula of R/S&#8208;Ag7 clusters are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. R/S&#8208;Ag7 clusters exhibit strong CD spectra and CPL both in solution and solid states. When used as the photoactive materials in photodetectors, R/S&#8208;Ag7 enables effective discrimination between left&#8208;handed circularly polarized and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light at 520&#8197;nm with short response time, high responsivity and considerable discrimination ratio. This study is the first report on using atomically precise chiral metal nanoclusters for CPL detection.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral silver nanoclusters (&lt;b&gt;R/S-Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) were successfully prepared and utilized as photoactive materials for direct CPL detection. The &lt;b&gt;R/S-Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;-based photodetectors show effective discrimination between RCP and LCP lights with short response time, high responsivity and considerable discrimination ratio. This work demonstrates the direct detection of CPL by metal clusters for the first time, paving the way for the application of chiral metal clusters in CPL detection.

         <title>Bis&#8208;azopyrazole Photoswitches for Efficient Solar Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;azopyrazoles have been developed to achieve highly efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under unfiltered sunlight. The bis&#8208;azo motif features a coupled &#960;n system, which not only red&#8208;shifts the &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* band into the red region, but also reverses the n&#8211;&#960;* and &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* transitions on the energy scale. Sunlight&#8208;induced photoswitches are conducive to advancing the development of sustainable light&#8208;responsive applications and bring significant opportunities for solar energy storage and conversion.







Abstract
Although natural sunlight is one of the most abundant and sustainable energy resources, only a fraction of its energy is currently harnessed and utilized in photoactive systems. The development of molecular photoswitches that can be directly activated by sunlight is imperative for unlocking the full potential of solar energy and addressing the growing energy demands. Herein, we designed a series of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;azopyrazoles featuring a coupled &#960;n system, resulting in a pronounced redshift in their spectral absorption, reaching up to 661&#8197;nm in the red region. By varying the amino substituents of these molecules, highly efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under unfiltered sunlight can be achieved, with yields of up to 88.4&#8201;%. Moreover, the Z,Z&#8208;isomers have high thermal stability with half&#8208;lives from days to years at room temperature. The introduction of ortho&#8208;amino substitutions and meta&#8208;bisazo units leads to a reversal of the n&#8211;&#960;* and &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* transitions on the energy scale. This change provides a new perspective for further tuning the visible absorption of azo&#8208;switches by utilizing the &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* band instead of the conventional n&#8211;&#960;* band. These results suggest that photoresponsive systems can be powered by sunlight instead of traditional artificial lights, thereby paving the way for sustainable smart materials and devices.

         <title>Efficient Silver(I)&#8208;Containing I&#8211;Motif DNA Hybrid Catalyst for Enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver(I)&#8208;containing i&#8208;motif DNA hybrid catalyst enables the catalysis of Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with high reactivity and excellent enantioselectivity, in which the catalytic center of copper(II) ion specifically coordinates with one nitrogen atom of adenine and two nearby phosphate&#8208;oxygen atoms in the loop region.







Abstract
The inherent chiral structures of DNA serve as attractive scaffolds to construct DNA hybrid catalysts for valuable enantioselective transformations. Duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA&#8208;based enantioselective catalysis has made great progress, yet novel design strategies of DNA hybrid catalysts are highly demanding and atomistic analysis of active centers is still challenging. DNA i&#8208;motif structures could be finely tuned by different cytosine&#8208;cytosine base pairs, providing a new platform to design DNA catalysts. Herein, we found that a human telomeric i&#8208;motif DNA containing cytosine&#8208;silver(I)&#8208;cytosine (C&#8208;Ag+&#8208;C) base pairs interacting with Cu(II) ions (i&#8208;motif DNA(Ag+)/Cu2+) could catalyze Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with full conversions and up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. As characterized by various physicochemical techniques, the presence of Ag+ is proved to replace the protons in hemiprotonated cytosine&#8208;cytosine (C&#8201;:&#8201;C+) base pairs and stabilize the DNA i&#8208;motif to allow the acceptance of Cu(II) ions. The i&#8208;motif DNA(Ag+)/Cu2+ catalyst shows about 8&#8208;fold rate acceleration compared with DNA and Cu2+. Based on DNA mutation experiments, thermodynamic studies and density function theory calculations, the catalytic center of Cu(II) ion is proposed to be located in a specific loop region via binding to one nitrogen&#8208;7 atom of an unpaired adenine and two phosphate&#8208;oxygen atoms from nearby deoxythymidine monophosphate and deoxyadenosine monophosphate, respectively.

Hexagonal comb cells of honeybees can be mimicked by assembling nanoscale molecular cylinders as reported by Hiroyuki Isobe et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406502). The molecular honeycomb encapsulated various guests with 32 different structures, which were further diversified by 6 substituents, 3 stereochemistries and 2 intercalants. Although weak CH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds were used to assemble the cylinders, the 2D crystal was grown up to the centimeter scale, allowing for mechanical exfoliation.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Chiral Tetrakis Eu(III) Complexes with Ammonium Cations for Improved Circularly Polarized Luminescence (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 34/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations, as reported by Yasuchika Hasegawa et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202405584). The maximum gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. The CPL brightness of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of previous chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs+.

         <title>Inside Cover: Compressible Hydrogels with Stabilized Chirality from Thermoresponsive Helical Dendronized Poly(phenylacetylene)s (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 34/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compressive chiral hydrogels are fabricated from thermoresponsive helical dendronized poly(phenylacetylene)s through dynamic covalent chemistry at freezing temperature. These highly porous hydrogels possess stabilized chiralities originated from the copolymer precursors, and exhibit remarkable compressibility like human articular cartilage with full recoverability and excellent fatigue resistance, as described by Xiacong Zhang, Afang Zhang, Wen Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407552).

The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment leads to insufficient infiltration of effector lymphocytes, significantly weakening the anti&#8208;tumor immune response and promoting the tumor to become &#8220;cold&#8221;. In the cover image, tumor cells are representend as icebergs, with organelles as ice blocks floating on the ice surface. The copper peptide nanoparticles are meteorites falling from the sky, attacking multiple organelles. The ice begins to melt, symbolizing the elicited multiple cell death pathways, and also indicating the transformation of cold tumors into hot tumors, as illustrated by Ling Wang, Jie Gao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406602).

Heterometallic Complexes. In their Communication (e202408415), Kazuhiro Uemura synthesized a paramagnetic chain aligned as &#8211;Rh&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pt&#8211;Ni&#8211;Pt&#8211; with heterometallic bonds. The unpaired electrons on the Ni atoms strongly interact antiferromagnetically through metal&#8211;metal bonds.

         <title>Aluminum in Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>

Frustrated Aluminum! The field of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) gained increased interest over the past 18&#8197;years. The majority of FLP systems consist of boron Lewis acids. This review highlights the developments in the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic application of intermolecular, intramolecular and hidden aluminum FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases.







Abstract
This review article describes the development of the use of aluminum compounds in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) over the last 14&#8197;years. It also discusses the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic applications of intermolecular, intramolecular and so&#8208;called hidden FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases. The intrinsically higher acidity of aluminum compounds compared to their boron analogs opens up different reaction pathways. The results are presented in a more or less chronological order. It is shown that Al FLPs react with a variety of polar and non&#8208;polar substrates and form both stable adducts and reversibly activate bonds. Consequently, some catalytic applications of the title compounds were presented such as dimerization of alkynes, hydrogenation of tert&#8208;butyl ethylene and imines, C&#8722;F bond activation, reduction of CO2, dehydrogenation of amine borane and transfer of ammonia. In addition, various Al FLPs were used as initiators in polymerization reactions.

This review summarizes recent progress in the development of electrochemical glutamate sensors through the co&#8208;design of materials, interfaces, and electronics. It covers various aspects including operational principles, assessment techniques, and applications as bio&#8208;integrated electronics in animal research. We also provide an outlook on the development of the next generation glutamate sensors for neuroscience and neuroengineering, with the aim of offering practical guidance for future research.







Abstract
Glutamate is one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters within the mammalian central nervous system. The role of glutamate in regulating neural network signaling transmission through both synaptic and extra&#8208;synaptic paths highlights the importance of the real&#8208;time and continuous monitoring of its concentration and dynamics in living organisms. Progresses in multidisciplinary research have promoted the development of electrochemical glutamate sensors through the co&#8208;design of materials, interfaces, electronic devices, and integrated systems. This review summarizes recent works reporting various electrochemical sensor designs and their applicability as miniaturized neural probes to in vivo sensing within biological environments. We start with an overview of the role and physiological significance of glutamate, the metabolic routes, and its presence in various bodily fluids. Next, we discuss the design principles, commonly employed validation models/protocols, and successful demonstrations of multifunctional, compact, and bio&#8208;integrated devices in animal models. The final section provides an outlook on the development of the next generation glutamate sensors for neuroscience and neuroengineering, with the aim of offering practical guidance for future research.

         <title>Polycatenanes Formed of Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the most relevant examples of polycatenanes in which the catenating subcomponents forming the mechanical bonds are interlocked three&#8208;dimensional metal organic cages (MOCs). We emphasize the beneficial aspects of mechanical bond formation among MOCs, synthetic approaches, supramolecular topologies, and structure&#8211;function correlations. The experimental and theoretical aspects of polycatenanes made of MOCs have also been investigated.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenanes (PCs) self&#8208;assembled of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal organic cages (MOCs) (hereafter referred to as PCs&#8208;MOCs) are a relatively new class of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) that combine the properties of MOCs and polymers. The synthesis of PCs&#8208;MOCs is challenging because of the difficulties associated with interlocking MOCs, the occurrence of multiple weak supramolecular electrostatic interactions between cages, and the importance of solvent templating effects. The high density of mechanical bonds interlocking the MOCs endows the MOCs with mechanical and physical properties such as enhanced stability, responsive dynamic behavior and low solubility, which can unlock new functional properties. In this Minireview, we highlight the benefit of interlocking MOCs in the formation of PCs&#8208;MOCs structures as well as the synthetic approaches exploited in their preparation, from thermodynamic to kinetic methods, both in the solution and solid&#8208;states. Examples of PCs&#8208;MOCs self&#8208;assembled from various types of nanosized cages (i.e., tetrahedral, trigonal prismatic, octahedral and icosahedral) are described in this article, providing an overview of the research carried out in this area. The focus is on the structure&#8211;property relationship with examples of functional applications such as electron conductivity, X&#8208;ray attenuation, gas adsorption and molecular sensing. We believe that the structural and functional aspects of the reviewed PCs&#8208;MOCs will attract chemists in this research field with great potential as new functional materials in nanotechnological disciplines such as gas adsorption, sensing and photophysical properties such as X&#8208;ray attenuation or electron conductivity.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Molecular Sieving of High&#8208;Humidity C2H4/C2H6 Mixture by a Hydrophobic Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic and flexible metal&#8211;organic framework shows weak adsorption affinity and high structural transition pressure at ambient temperature, which enables C2H4/C2H6 molecular sieving under high&#8208;pressure and wet conditions.







Abstract
Molecular sieving is an ideal separation mechanism, but controlling pore size, restricting framework flexibility, and avoiding strong adsorption are all very challenging. Here, we report a flexible adsorbent showing molecular sieving at ambient temperature and high pressure, even under high humidity. While typical guest&#8208;induced transformations are observed, a high transition pressure of 16.6&#8197;atm is observed for C2H4 at 298&#8197;K because of very weak C2H4 adsorption (~16&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Also, C2H6 is completely excluded below the pore&#8208;opening pressure of 7.7&#8197;atm, giving single&#8208;component selectivity of ca. 300. Quantitative high&#8208;pressure column breakthrough experiments using 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;C2H4/C2H6 mixtures at 10&#8197;atm as input confirm molecular sieving with C2H4 adsorption of 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 or 32&#8197;cm3(STP) cm&#8722;3 and negligible C2H6 adsorption of 0.001(2) mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the adsorbent can be completely regenerated by inert gas purging. Furthermore, it is highly hydrophobic with negligible water adsorption, and the C2H4/C2H6 separation performance is unaffected at high humidity.

Here, we report a flexible adsorbent showing molecular sieving at ambient temperature and high pressure, even under high humidity. While typical guest-induced transformations are observed, a high transition pressure of 16.6&#8197;atm is observed for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 298&#8197;K because of very weak C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption (~16&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Also, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is completely excluded below the pore-opening pressure of 7.7&#8197;atm, giving single-component selectivity of ca. 300. Quantitative high-pressure column breakthrough experiments using 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures at 10&#8197;atm as input confirm molecular sieving with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption of 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; or 32&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(STP) cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and negligible C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption of 0.001(2) mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the adsorbent can be completely regenerated by inert gas purging. Furthermore, it is highly hydrophobic with negligible water adsorption, and the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance is unaffected at high humidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating the Solvation Structure in Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the relationship between solvation structure and ion transportation and interphase chemistry in polymer electrolytes. By combining strong Li+&#8208;ether interactions and weak Li+&#8208;ester interactions with steric hindrance, we get a polymer electrolyte which possesses high lithium ion transference number (0.80) and a wide electrochemical window (5.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li+). The anion&#8208;rich solvation structure makes it be compatible with both Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM cathode with middle&#8208;high areal loading (~7.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Our work provides new insight into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes through the regulation of ion&#8208;dipole interactions.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are promising electrolytes for safe and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. However, traditional ether&#8208;based polymer electrolytes are limited by their low lithium&#8208;ion conductivity and narrow electrochemical window because of the well&#8208;defined and intimated Li+&#8208;oxygen binding topologies in the solvation structure. Herein, we proposed a new strategy to reduce the Li+&#8208;polymer interaction and strengthen the anion&#8208;polymer interaction by combining strong Li+&#8208;O (ether) interactions, weak Li+&#8208;O (ester) interactions with steric hindrance in polymer electrolytes. In this way, a polymer electrolyte with a high lithium ion transference number (0.80) and anion&#8208;rich solvation structure is obtained. This polymer electrolyte possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) and compatibility with both Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM cathode. Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 full cells with middle&#8208;high active material areal loading (~7.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) can stably cycle at 4.5&#8197;V. This work provides new insight into the design of polymer electrolytes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries through the regulation of ion&#8208;dipole interactions.

         <title>A Modular Dual&#8208;Catalytic Aryl&#8208;Chlorination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated dual catalysis strategy for the modular synthesis of highly functionalized and structurally diverse 1&#8208;aryl, 2&#8208;chloroalkanes via the coupling of diaryliodonium salts, alkenes, and potassium chloride.







Abstract
Alkyl chlorides are a class of versatile building blocks widely used to generate C(sp3)&#8208;rich scaffolds through transformation such as nucleophilic substitution, radical addition reactions and metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling processes. Despite their utility in the synthesis of high&#8208;value functional molecules, distinct methods for the preparation of alkyl chlorides are underrepresented. Here, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated dual catalysis strategy for the modular synthesis of highly functionalized and structurally diverse arylated chloroalkanes via the coupling of diaryliodonium salts, alkenes and potassium chloride. A distinctive aspect of this transformation is a ligand&#8208;design&#8208;driven approach for the development of a copper(II)&#8208;based atom&#8208;transfer catalyst that enables the aryl&#8208;chlorination of electron&#8208;poor alkenes, complementing its iron(III)&#8208;based counterpart that accommodates non&#8208;activated aliphatic alkenes and styrene derivatives. The complementarity of the two dual catalytic systems allows the efficient aryl&#8208;chlorination of alkenes bearing different stereo&#8208;electronic properties and a broad range of functional groups, maximizing the structural diversity of the 1&#8208;aryl, 2&#8208;chloroalkane products.

         <title>Radical Fluorosulfonamidation: A Facile Access to Sulfamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;Fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium (FSAP) was designed and synthesized as a redox&#8208;active fluorosulfamoyl radical precursor, which can be applied in radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation of a variety of (hetero)arenes. Further utilization in the radical 1,2&#8208;functionalization, radical distal migration, tandem radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions of olefins is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Recently, the introduction of fluorosulfonyl (&#8722;SO2F) groups have attracted considerable research interests, as this moiety could often afford enhanced activities and new functions in the context of chemical biology and drug discovery. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of 1&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium (FSAP) salts, which could serve as an effective photoredox&#8208;active precursor to fluorosulfamoyl radicals and enable the direct radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation of a variety of (hetero)arenes. This method features mild conditions, visible light, broad substrate scope, good group tolerance, etc., and a metal&#8208;free protocol is also viable by using organic photocatalysts. Further, FSAP can also be applied to the radical functionalization of alkenes via 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization, radical distal migration, tandem radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions, etc. In addition, a formal C&#8722;H methylamination of (hetero)arenes by combining this radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation with subsequent hydrolysis as well as product derivatization are also demonstrated.

         <title>Unprecedented Packing Polymorphism of Oxindole: An Exploration Inspired by Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of computational predictions, along with innovative crystallization techniques for oxindole, has led to the discovery of four new forms and the reconstruction of a previously presumed &#8220;disappearing polymorph&#8221;. The findings have established a new record for the largest number of packing polymorphs for rigid organic systems, where variations are indeed due to distinct crystalline packing arrangements with the same molecular conformation.







Abstract
Crystal polymorphism, characterized by different packing arrangements of the same compound, strongly ties to the physical properties of a molecule. Determining the polymorphic landscape is complex and time&#8208;consuming, with the number of experimentally observed polymorphs varying widely from molecule to molecule. Furthermore, disappearing polymorphs, the phenomenon whereby experimentally observed forms cannot be reproduced, pose a significant challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Herein, we focused on oxindole (OX), a small rigid molecule with four known polymorphs, including a reported disappearing form. Using crystal structure prediction (CSP), we assessed OX solid&#8208;state landscape and thermodynamic stability by comparing predicted structures with experimentally known forms. We then performed melt and solution crystallization in bulk and nanoconfinement to validate our predictions. These experiments successfully reproduced the known forms and led to the discovery of four novel polymorphs. Our approach provided insights into reconstructing disappearing polymorphs and building more comprehensive polymorph landscapes. These results also establish a new record of packing polymorphism for rigid molecules.

         <title>Bioinspired Tetranuclear Manganese Cubane Complex as an Efficient Molecular Electrocatalyst for Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation Towards Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired tetranuclear manganese complex with a cubane structure has been developed to electrocatalyze water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide. This complex demonstrates an optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87&#8201;%, which is amongst (if not) the highest FE(H2O2) of reported homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Stable homogeneous two&#8208;electron water oxidation electrocatalysts are highly demanded to understand the precise mechanism and reaction intermediates of electrochemical H2O2 production. Here we report a tetranuclear manganese complex with a cubane structure which can electrocatalyze water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide under alkaline and neutral conditions. Such a complex demonstrates an optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87&#8201;%, which is amongst (if not) the highest FE(H2O2) of reported homogeneous and heterogeneous electrocatalysts. In addition, active species were identified and co&#8208;catalysts were excluded through ESI&#8208;MS characterization. Furthermore, we identified water binding sites and isolated one&#8208;electron oxidation intermediate by chemical oxidation of the catalyst in the presence of water substrates. It is evident that efficient proton&#8208;accepting electrolytes avoid rapid proton building&#8208;up at electrode and substantially improve reaction rate and selectivity. Accordingly, we propose a two&#8208;electron catalytic cycle model for water oxidation to hydrogen peroxide with the bioinspired molecular electrocatalyst. The present work is expected to provide an ideal platform to elucidate the two&#8208;electron WOR mechanism at the atomic level.

         <title>Intermolecular Enantioselective Amination Reactions Mediated by Visible Light and a Chiral Iron Porphyrin Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron porphyrin that is linked via an ethynyl unit to a chiral octahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;4,7&#8208;methanoisoindol&#8208;1&#8208;one scaffold serves as a potent catalyst for the enantioselective, visible light&#8208;mediated intermolecular amination of 3&#8208;arylmethyl&#8208;substituted quinolones and pyridones. A two&#8208;point hydrogen bonding interaction is responsible for the exquisite site&#8208; and enantioselectivity of the reaction.







Abstract
In the presence of 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a chiral iron porphyrin catalyst, various 3&#8208;arylmethyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones and 2&#8208;pyridones underwent an enantioselective amination reaction (20&#8197;examples; 93&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). The substrates were used as the limiting reagents, and fluorinated aryl azides (1.5&#8197;equivalents) served as nitrene precursors. The reaction is triggered by visible light which allows a facile dediazotation at ambient temperature. The selectivity of the reaction is governed by a two&#8208;point hydrogen bond interaction between the ligand of the iron catalyst and the substrate. Hydrogen bonding directs the amination to a specific hydrogen atom within the substrate that is displaced by the nitrogen substituent either in a concerted fashion or by a rebound mechanism.

We present a novel intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) system ([12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe) based on cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) grafted with eight di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino groups (TPAOMe) as donors.

Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) system ([12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe) based on cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) grafted with eight di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino groups (TPAOMe) as donors. Compared to [12]CPP, D&#8722;A nanohoop exhibited significant changes in physical properties, including a large redshift (&gt;78&#8197;nm) in the fluorescence spectrum and novel positive solvatofluorochromic properties with a maximum peak ranging from 484&#8197;nm to 546&#8197;nm. The potential applications of [12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe in electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport devices were further investigated, and its bipolar behavior as a charge transport active layer was clearly observed.

         <title>Desymmetrization of Cyclic Sulfonimidamides by Asymmetric Allylation</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the desymmetrization of cyclic sulfonimidamides via a palladium catalyzed asymmetric allylation. The products are further elaborated to novel tricyclic ring systems containing a stereogenic sulfur center. Mechanistic insights to the origin of selectivity are highlighted through computational studies.







Abstract
Herein we report the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed approach to the enantioenriched synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides relying on commercially available palladium catalysts and ligands. High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was employed to identify the optimal catalyst system and solvent. The method is applied to a variety of saturated and unsaturated rings and exhibits the highest selectivity for 2&#8208;substituted allyl electrophiles. The products are further elaborated to complex, tricyclic scaffolds. DFT experiments presented herein highlight the key ligand substrate interactions leading to the high levels of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Transpiration&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Growth of Texture Hydrogel Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PIC hydrogels contained isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids. Like trees, transpiration would induce voids reversibly collapse to generate negative pressures within the matrices to extract polymerizable compounds from external sources for growing. The hydrogel mimics the function of trees, which can grow user&#8208;defined complex structures on surfaces from different external sources.







Abstract
Trees grow by coupling the transpiration&#8208;induced nutrient absorption from external sources and photosynthesis&#8208;based nutrient integration. Inspired by this manner, we designed a class of polyion complex (PIC) hydrogels containing isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids for growing texture surfaces. The isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids were created via irreversible matrix reconfiguration in a deswelling&#8208;swelling process. During transpiration, these voids reversibly collapse to generate negative pressures within the matrices to extract polymerizable compounds from external sources and deliver them to the surface of the samples for photopolymerization. This growth process is spatial&#8208;controllable and can be applied to fabricate complex patterns consisting of different compositions, suggesting a new strategy for making texture surfaces.

         <title>[22]Pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) Displaying N&#8208;Fusion, Pyrrole&#8208;Rearrangement, and Dimerization Reactions Upon Oxidation and Metalation</title>

[22]Pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) synthesized by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,10&#8208;diaryltripyrrin with 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dipyrrolyethenes show roughly planar structures and varying aromaticities depending upon the vinylene structures. Upon oxidation, the 19,20&#8208;ditolyl pentaphyrin gave N&#8208;fusion and pyrrole&#8208;rearranged products, which were effectively dimerized upon treatment with CuCl.







Abstract
Exploration of expanded porphyrins with unprecedented reactivities has remained important. Here [22]pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) were synthesized as a constitutional isomer of sapphyrin by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,10&#8208;diaryltripyrrin with 1,2&#8208;di(pyrro&#8208;2&#8208;ly)ethenes. These pentaphyrins display roughly planar structures and varying aromaticities depending upon the vinylene structures. The 19,20&#8208;ditolyl pentaphyrin gave an N&#8208;fused product and an unprecedented pyrrole&#8208;rearranged product, depending upon the oxidation conditions. Remarkably, upon the metalation with CuCl, the N&#8208;fused product and the pyrrole&#8208;rearranged product afforded an inner &#946;&#8208;&#946; coupled face&#8208;to&#8208;face CuII complex dimer and an outer &#946;&#8208;&#946; coupled lateral CuII complex dimer, respectively, in fairly good yields. Further, [22]pentaphyrin(2.0.1.1.0) fused with a NiII porphyrin was effectively dimerized upon oxidation with MnO2 to give a 16&#8211;16&#8217; directly linked dl&#8208;dimer.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic Interactions through the Thirteen &#197; Metal&#8211;Metal Distances in Heterometallic One&#8208;Dimensional Chains</title>

         <dc:description>
Strong magnetic interactions with the magnetic parameter J=&#8722;37.9&#8197;cm&#8722;1, despite the long distance of 13&#8197;&#197; between the Ni(+2) atoms, was realized in heterometallic one&#8208;dimensional chain aligned as &#8722;Rh&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ni&#8722;Pt&#8722;. This magnitude was not realized with other molecules, clearly demonstrating the utility of bridging metal&#8211;metal bonds.







Abstract
A heterometallic and paramagnetic one&#8208;dimensional aligned chain in &#8722;Rh(+2)&#8722;Rh(+2)&#8722; Pt(+2)&#8722;Ni(+2)&#8722;Pt(+2)&#8722; with direct metal&#8722;metal bonds was obtained via HOMO&#8211;LUMO interactions at the &#963;* (dz2) orbital between [Rh2(O2CCH3)4] and [Pt2Ni(piam)4(NH3)4] (piam=pivalamidate). The one&#8208;dimensional chains had straight backbones attributed to face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking of each complex, and the Ni atoms were separated by approximately 13&#8197;&#197; from four different metals. Each Ni atom had two unpaired electrons in the d&#8208;orbitals, which strongly exchanged with J=&#8722;37.9&#8197;cm&#8722;1 through the diamagnetic &#8722;Pt&#8722;Rh&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pt&#8722; bonds.

         <title>Chiral Tetrakis Eu(III) Complexes with Ammonium Cations for Improved Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 34, August 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations exhibited large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL=&#8722;1.54), which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.







Abstract
Large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in ligand and coordination tuned chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations. The gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Through photophysical measurements, single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses and quantum chemical calculations, changes in the geometric and electronic structures were observed for a series of chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes which enhanced the gCPL value. The emission quantum yield and photosensitized energy transfer efficiencies of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs+. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.

         <title>The Impact of Supersaturated Electrode on Heterogeneous Lithium Nucleation and Growth Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of a lithiophilic electrode proves inadequate in describing carbon&#8208;based electrode materials due to their substantial mismatch in surface energy with lithium metal. However, their notable capacity for lithium chemisorption can increase active lithium concentration required for nucleation and growth, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). In this study, we elucidate the effects of the supersaturated electrode which has high active lithium capacity around equilibrium lithium potential on LMAs through an in&#8208;depth electrochemical comparison using two distinct carbon electrode platforms with differing carbon structures but similar two&#8208;dimensional morphologies. In the supersaturated electrode, both the dynamics and thermodynamic states involved in lithium nucleation and growth mechanisms are significantly improved, particularly under continuous current supply conditions. Furthermore, the chemical structures of the solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface layers (SEIs) are greatly influenced by the elevated surface lithium concentration environment, resulting in the formation of more conductive lithium&#8208;rich SEI layers. The improved dynamics and thermodynamics of surface lithium, coupled with the formation of enhanced SEI layers, contribute to higher power capabilities, enhanced Coulombic efficiencies, and improved cycling performances of LMAs. These results provide new insight into understanding the enhancements in heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth kinetics on the supersaturated electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Nacre&#8722;Inspired Structure Enables Ultrahigh "Strong&#8722;Tough" Design of Phosphorus Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Red phosphorus anode, attributed to its high specific capacity of 2596 mAh g&#8722;1, is expected to improve the energy density of Na&#8722;ion batteries. However, the P anode currently is unsatisfactory for practical usage due to the large volume expansion beyond 300%, which brings out uncontrolled brittle failure. To address this challenge, we here design a nacre&#8722;like phosphorus anode by resilient graphene oxide staggered together. The  staggered structure simultaneously offers mechanical strength and interwoven toughness. Finite element modeling reveals that the sodiation stress from P nanoparticles will be transferred into interlayer pillars as the elastic medium to release sodiation stress. The prepared anode achieves an ultrahigh areal capacity of 13 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a mass loading of 5.8 mg cm&#8722;2. Notably, the volume change of the anode is limited to approximately 8.2% at full sodiation, significantly lower than that of the traditional phosphorus electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Therapeutically&#8208;Relevant Multifunctional Antisense Oligonucleotide Conjugates Using Native Chemical Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies hold significant promise in the realm of molecular medicine. By precisely targeting RNA molecules, ASOs offer an approach to modulate gene expression and protein production, making them valuable tools for treating a wide range of genetic and acquired diseases. As the precise intracellular targeting and delivery of ASOs is challenging, strategies for preparing ASO&#8208;ligand conjugates are in exceedingly high demand. This work leverages the utility of native chemical ligation to conjugate ASOs with therapeutically relevant chemical modifications including locked nucleic acids and phosphorothioate backbone modifications to peptides and sugars via a stable amide linkage. A suite of post&#8208;ligation functionalizations through modification of the cysteine ligation handle are highlighted, including chemoselective radical desulfurization, lipidation, and alkylation with a range of valuable handles (e.g. alkyne, biotin, and radionuclide chelating ligands), affording multifunctional constructs for further applications in biology and medicine. Application of the methodology to a clinically&#8208;relevant triantennary&#8208;GalNAc ASO conjugate and validation of its binding and functional activity underpins the applicability of the technique to oligonucleotide&#8208;based therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Focus Workflow for Simultaneously Engineering High Activity and Thermal Stability in Methyl Parathion Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Industrial fermentation applications typically require enzymes that exhibit high stability and activity at high temperatures. However, efforts to simultaneously improve these properties are usually limited by a trade&#8208;off between stability and activity. This report describes a computational strategy to enhance both activity and thermal stability of the mesophilic organophosphate&#8208;degrading enzyme,  methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH). To predict hotspot mutation sites, we assembled a library of features associated with the target properties for each residue and then prioritized candidate sites by hierarchical clustering. Subsequent in silico screening with multiple algorithms to simulate selective pressures yielded a subset of 23 candidate mutations. Iterative parallel screening of mutations that improved thermal stability and activity yielded, MPHase&#8208;m5b, which exhibited 13.3 &#176;C higher Tm and 4.2 times higher catalytic activity than wild&#8208;type (WT) MPH over a wide temperature range. Systematic analysis of crystal structures, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) calculations revealed a wider entrance to the active site that increased substrate access with an extensive network of interactions outside the active site that reinforced &#945;&#946;/&#946;&#945; sandwich architecture to improve thermal stability. This study thus provides an advanced, rational design framework to improve efficiency in engineering highly active, thermostable biocatalysts for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolable Si=B Analogue of a Vinyl Halide: A Building Block for Facile Access toward Silicon&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonded Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to the outstanding development in the synthesis of Si&#8211;B single bonded species, borylsilanes and their application to organic synthesis, the chemistry of Si=B double bonded species, borasilenes and boratasilenes have only made little progress, first of all, due to the difficulties in accessing such double bonds. Herein we report the synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide, a bromoboratasilene, via formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a monoatomic Si(0) complex, using a dihaloborane as the borylene source.&#160;The treatment of bromoboratasilene toward neutral or anionic Lewis bases gives access to new boratasilenes, all of which were proved to possess significant Si=B double bond character by XRD analysis and DFT calculations. These results demonstrate exciting strategies to synthesize new types of Si=B double bonded species which should further progress the chemistry of boron, silicon&#8208;containing molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Traceless Nucleophile Strategy for C5&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Sulfonylation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of pyridines is crucial for the rapid construction and derivatization of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Conventional functionalization approaches have primarily focused on the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, while achieving precise meta&#8208;selective functionalization, particularly at the C5 position in substituted pyridines, remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines. Herein, we present a new strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8211;H sulfonylation of N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts, which employs a transient enamine&#8208;type intermediate generated through a nucleophilic addition to N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process harnesses the power of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, enabling high selectivity and broad applicability, including the construction of complex pyridines bearing valuable sulfonyl functionalities under mild conditions without the need for an external photocatalyst.    The remarkable C5 selectivity, combined with the broad applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization, significantly expands the toolbox for pyridine functionalization, unlocking access to previously unattainable meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.</dc:description>

Herein, we present a new strategy for meta- and C5-selective C&#8211;H sulfonylation of N-amidopyridinium salts, which employs a transient enamine-type intermediate generated through a nucleophilic addition to N-amidopyridinium salts. This process harnesses the power of electron donor-acceptor complexes, enabling high selectivity and broad applicability, including the construction of complex pyridines bearing valuable sulfonyl functionalities under mild conditions without the need for an external photocatalyst.    The remarkable C5 selectivity, combined with the broad applicability to late-stage functionalization, significantly expands the toolbox for pyridine functionalization, unlocking access to previously unattainable meta-sulfonylated pyridines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 for Photo&#8208;Assisted Cross&#8208;Couplings and CO2 to Methanol: Activity and Selectivity Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our study unveils a pioneering methodology that effectively distributes Pd species within a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8). We demonstrate that Pd can be encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 as atomically dispersed Pd species that function as an excited&#8208;state transition metal catalyst for promoting carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) cross&#8208;couplings at room temperature using visible light as the driving force. Furthermore, the same material can be reduced at 250 &#176;C, forming Pd metal nanoparticles encapsulated in ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst shows high rates and selectivity for carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol under industrially relevant conditions (250 &#176;C, 50 bar): 7.46 molmethanol molmetal&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and &gt;99%. Our results demonstrate the correlations of the catalyst structure with the performances at experimental and theoretical levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Overall Splitting of Pure Water in a Porous Microreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic overall splitting of pure water (H2O) without sacrificial reagent to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) holds a great potential for achieving carbon neutrality. Herein, by anchoring cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) as cocatalyst and cadmium sulfide (CdS) as light absorber to channel wall of a porous polymer microreactor (PP12), continuous violent H2 and O2 bubbling productions from photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O without sacrificial reagent is achieved, with H2 and O2 production rates as high as 4.41 and 2.20 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat.&#8208;1 respectively. These are significantly enhanced than those in the widely used stirred tank&#8208;type reactor in which no O2 is produced and H2 production rate is only 0.004 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat.&#8208;1. Besides improved charge separation and interaction of H2O with photocatalyst in PP12, bonding interaction of Co9S8 with PP12 creates abundant catalytic active sites for simultaneous productions of H2 and O2, thus leading to the significantly enhanced H2 and O2 bubbling productions in PP12. This offers a new strategy to enhance photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O without sacrificial reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Homopropargylic Alcohols via Cycloisomerization: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopentenes Featuring a Quaternary Chiral Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentene rings possessing a chiral quaternary center are important structural motifs found in various natural products. In this work, we disclose expedient and efficient access to this class of synthetically valuable structures via highly enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral propargylic alcohols. The efficient chirality induction in this asymmetric gold catalysis is achieved via two&#8208;point bindings between a gold catalyst featuring a bifunctional phosphine ligand and the substrate homopropargylic alcohol moiety &#8211; an H&#8208;bonding interaction between the HO group and a ligand phosphine oxide moiety and the gold&#8208;alkyne complexation. The propargylic alcohol substrates can be prepared readily via propargylation of ketone precursors, and spirocyclic and bicyclic cyclopentenes are formed with additional neighboring chiral centers of flexible stereochemistry in addition to the quaternary center. This work represents rare gold&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the chirality induction model and suggest that the rate acceleration enabled by the bifunctional ligand can be attributed to a facilitated protodeauration step at the end of the catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Responsive Crystalline B&#8592;N Host Adducts with Solvent&#8208;Induced Allosteric Effect for Guest Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;responsive organic crystals, capable of converting light energy into chemical energy to initiate conformational transitions, present an emerging strategy for developing lightweight and versatile smart materials. However, visible light&#8208;triggered tailored guests capture and release behaviors in all&#8208;organic solids are rarely reported. Here, we introduce a photoreactive crystalline boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) host adduct with the ability to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition upon 447 nm light exposure. This process facilitates single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization in the mother liquor, maintaining the original B&#8592;N host structure. Weakened intermolecular interactions within the photodimer host contribute to fast guest release in air under irradiation. Furthermore, the dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enable reversible transformations between organic host adducts and adduct cocrystals under the solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect. As a result, four B&#8592;N host adduct crystals containing individual alkane guest are easily obtained and exhibited the ability of photo&#8208;controlled alkane release. Therefore, the integration of photo reactivity and structural transformation within B&#8592;N host adduct enables customized capture and release of guest molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Solid&#8208;Solution Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Porous Molecular Crystals for In&#8208;situ Generation of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional synthetic methods of organic luminescent molecules often involve labor&#8208;intensive solution&#8208;phase organic synthesis, which violate the principles of atom&#8208;economic transformation. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) offers a promising alternative, allowing direct transformation from one fluorophore to another. Although PSM is commonly implemented in extended frameworks, its application in porous molecular crystals remains challenging. Herein, we focus on utilizing porous molecular crystals, specifically tetraphenylethylene&#8208;cored frameworks, as versatile platforms for tandem PSM reactions to customize organic fluorophores. The tailored skeleton design ensures both the formation of porous structures and the occurrence of tandem solid&#8208;solution reactions while maintaining the solid state of reactants and products in each step. The inherent non&#8208;covalent bonding nature of the frameworks facilitates processing and characterization, offering unparalleled advantages for porous networks. The accompanying solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow) enables real&#8208;time monitoring of tandem reactions and provides intuitive mechanistic insights. This phenomenon is exploited for the facile construction of a dynamic information encryption system using fluorescent quick response codes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Bridging Mechanism for Bimetallic Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting&#8208;edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in&#8208;situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual&#8208;site O&#8208;O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in&#8208;situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O&#8208;O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe&#8208;Ni(P4O11) as pre&#8208;catalyst, the in&#8208;situ formed Fe&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4 mV at current density of 18.0 mA cm&#8208;2. Successfully constructed Fe&#8208;Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts: High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Element Combinations in Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an innovative method for accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in Pt&#8208;based quinary high&#8208;entropy alloys, utilizing large&#8208;scale language model, microscale printing, pulsed high&#8208;temperature synthesis, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy, and density functional theory calculations. This offers a new avenue for the discovery of multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.







Abstract
The vast number of element combinations and the explosive growth of composition space pose significant challenges to the development of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Here, we propose a procedural research method aimed at accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on Pt&#8208;based quinary HEAs. The method begins with an element library provided by a large language model (LLM), combined with microscale precursor printing and pulse high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques to prepare multi&#8208;element combination HEA array in one step. Through high&#8208;throughput measurement using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), precise identification of highly active HEA element combinations and exploration of composition space for a specific combination are achieved. Advantageous element combinations are further validated in practical electrocatalytic evaluations. The contributions of individual element sites and the synergistic effects among elements of such HEAs in enhancing reaction activity are elucidated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This method integrates high&#8208;throughput experiments, practical catalyst validation, and DFT calculations, providing a new pathway for accelerating the discovery of efficient multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.

         <title>Asymmetric Local Electric Field Induced by Dual Heteroatoms on Copper Boosts Efficient CO2 Reduction Over Ultrawide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver and tin heteroatoms are injected into the nano&#8208;porous copper to construct an asymmetric local electric field, thereby realizing excellent selectivity up to a nearly 100&#8201;% Faraday efficiency for CO over ultrawide potential window, a superior CO local current density of 340&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and high energy efficiency of 90&#8201;% for CO production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity provides an elegant route for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and feedstocks, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. Herein, Ag and Sn heteroatoms were simultaneously introduced into nanoporous Cu (np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu) mainly in the form of an asymmetric local electric field for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. The designed np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90&#8201;% energy efficiency and a 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (&#916;E=1.4&#8197;V), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Au and Ag&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO2 molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR.

         <title>Pendant Proton&#8208;Relays Systematically Tune the Rate and Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Ammonia Generation in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Installation of secondary sphere proton relaying functionalities within an iron&#8208;porphyrin based MOF, enables systematic adjustment of heterogeneous electrocatalytic nitrite reduction performance in aqueous solution. Thus, high rates of NH3 production at more than 90&#8201;% faradaic efficiency were obtained.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction (eNO2RR) is a promising alternative route to produce ammonia (NH3). Until now, several molecular catalysts have shown capability to homogeneously reduce nitrite to NH3, while taking advantage of added secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities to direct catalytic performance. Yet, realizing such control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that heterogenization of a Fe&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst within a 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), allows efficient eNO2RR to NH3. On top of that, installation of pendant proton relaying moieties proximal to the catalytic site, resulted in significant improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity. Notably, systematic manipulation of NH3 faradaic efficiency (up to 90&#8201;%) and partial current (5&#8208;fold increase) was achieved by varying the proton relay&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst molar ratio. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis show that the proton relays simultaneously aid in generating and stabilizing of reactive Fe&#8208;bound NO intermediate. Thus, this concept offers new molecular tools to tune heterogeneous electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Stability of Mg Metal Anodes: High&#8208;Exposure (002) Facets and Nanosheet Arrays for Superior Mg Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mg foil, featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and nanosheet arrays architecture, is fabricated via a selective etching strategy. The facet property encourages smooth nucleation and dense deposition, while the distinctive morphology ensures uniform electric field and Mg ion flux distributions. As a result, an improved Mg plating/stripping reversibility and extended cycle stability is achieved.







Abstract
Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs), recognized as promising contenders for post&#8208;lithium battery technologies, face challenges such as uneven magnesium (Mg) plating and stripping behaviors, leading to uncontrollable dendrite growth and irreversible structural damage. Herein, we have developed a Mg foil featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and an architecture of nanosheet arrays (termed (002)&#8208;Mg), created through a one&#8208;step acid etching method. Specifically, the prominent exposure of Mg (002) facets, known for their inherently low surface and adsorption energies with Mg atoms, not only facilitates smooth nucleation and dense deposition but also significantly mitigates side reactions on the Mg anode. Moreover, the nanosheet arrays on the surface evenly distribute the electric field and Mg ion flux, enhancing Mg ion transfer kinetics. As a result, the fabricated (002)&#8208;Mg electrodes exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;cycle performance, lasting over 6000&#8197;h (&gt;8 months) at a current density of 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for a capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells equipped with various electrolytes and cathodes demonstrate remarkable capacity and cycling stability, highlighting the superior electrochemical compatibility of the (002)&#8208;Mg electrode. This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.

         <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Li7P3S7.5O3.5 with Low Density and Excellent Anode Compatibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte showing the combination of strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density, and anode compatibility is indispensable for the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries, but none of the previously reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets this requirement. Here, a solid electrolyte, Li7P3S7.5O3.5, is discovered, and it displays all these three characteristics simultaneously.







Abstract
The commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs) demands solid electrolytes with strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density (for enabling satisfactory energy densities), and decent anode compatibility (the need for cathode compatibility can be circumvented by the cathode coating techniques that are widely applied in sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs). However, none of the reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets these requirements simultaneously. Here, we design a Li7P3S7.5O3.5 (LPSO) solid electrolyte, which shows a combination of all the aforementioned characteristics. The synthesis of this material does not need the expensive Li2S, so the raw materials cost is only $14.42/kg, which, unlike most solid electrolytes, lies below the $50/kg threshold for commercialization. The density of LPSO is 1.70&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3, considerably lower than those of the oxide (typically above 5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and chloride (around 2.5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) solid electrolytes. Besides, LPSO also shows excellent anode compatibility. The Li|LPSO|Li cell cycles stably with a potential of ~50&#8197;mV under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 4200&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell with the Si anode shows a capacity retention of 89.29&#8201;% after 200 cycles under 88.6&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercialization of all-solid-state Li batteries (ASSLBs) demands solid electrolytes with strong cost-competitiveness, low density (for enabling satisfactory energy densities), and decent anode compatibility (the need for cathode compatibility can be circumvented by the cathode coating techniques that are widely applied in sulfide-based ASSLBs). However, none of the reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets these requirements simultaneously. Here, we design a Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3.5&lt;/sub&gt; (LPSO) solid electrolyte, which shows a combination of all the aforementioned characteristics. The synthesis of this material does not need the expensive Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, so the raw materials cost is only $14.42/kg, which, unlike most solid electrolytes, lies below the $50/kg threshold for commercialization. The density of LPSO is 1.70&#8197;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, considerably lower than those of the oxide (typically above 5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and chloride (around 2.5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) solid electrolytes. Besides, LPSO also shows excellent anode compatibility. The Li|LPSO|Li cell cycles stably with a potential of ~50&#8197;mV under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for over 4200&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the all-solid-state pouch cell with the Si anode shows a capacity retention of 89.29&#8201;% after 200 cycles under 88.6&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 60&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Descriptor for Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Axial Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general descriptor &#963; was constructed to predict the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activity of axial coordination ligand single&#8208;atom catalysts (ACL&#8208;SACs). We identify that ACLs can weaken the adsorption capability of the metal atom (M) by raising the bonding energy levels of the M&#8722;O bond while enhancing dispersity of the d orbital of M. Importantly, an axial ligand descriptor &#963;ACL was also identified that can serve as a potential descriptor to determine the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ACL&#8208;SACs in experiment.







Abstract
Decoration of an axial coordination ligand (ACL) on the active metal site is a highly effective and versatile strategy to tune activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the regulation mechanism of ACLs on SACs is still incompletely known. Herein, we investigate diversified combinations of ACL&#8208;SACs, including all 3d&#8211;5d transition metals and ten prototype ACLs. We identify that ACLs can weaken the adsorption capability of the metal atom (M) by raising the bonding energy levels of the M&#8722;O bond while enhancing dispersity of the d orbital of M. Through examination of various local configurations and intrinsic parameters of ACL&#8208;SACs, a general structure descriptor &#963; is constructed to quantify the structure&#8211;activity relationship of ACL&#8208;SACs which solely based on a few key intrinsic features. Importantly, we also identified the axial ligand descriptor &#963;ACL, as a part of &#963;, which can serve as a potential descriptor to determine the rate&#8208;limiting steps (RLS) of ACL&#8208;SACs in experiment. And we predicted several ACL&#8208;SACs, namely, CrN4&#8208;, FeN4&#8208;, CoN4&#8208;, RuN4&#8208;, RhN4&#8208;, OsN4&#8208;, IrN4&#8208; and PtN4&#8208;ACLs, that entail markedly higher activities than the benchmark catalysts of Pt and IrO2 for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, thereby supporting that the general descriptor &#963; can provide a simple and cost&#8208;effective method to assess efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Cationic Bis(hydrosilane)&#8212;Coinage&#8208;Metal Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Use as Catalysts for Outer&#8208;Sphere C=O Hydrosilylation Not Involving Metal Hydrides</title>

Coinage&#8208;metal hydrides or Lewis acidic cationic hydrosilane&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes? The synthesis and characterization of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes are reported. These can catalyze carbonyl hydrosilylation without the addition of an external base. Mechanistic control experiments and DFT calculations reveal a new mechanism in which the coinage&#8208;metal&#8211;alkoxides act as the key intermediates.







Abstract
The preparation of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes by chloride abstraction from the neutral metal chloride precursors with Na[BArF4] is described. Unlike previously reported hydrosilane&#8208;stabilized copper and silver complexes, the presented complexes are cationic and feature two bidentate (ortho&#8208;silylphenyl)phosphine ligands. These complexes were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, revealing that both Si&#8722;H bonds are activated by the Lewis acidic cationic metal center. The new complexes were found to be effective in catalytic carbonyl hydrosilylation, leading to the corresponding silyl ethers under mild conditions without the addition of an external base. Combined mechanistic control experiments and quantum chemical calculations support an ionic outer&#8208;sphere mechanism, in which a neutral metal alkoxide species instead of a metal hydride is the key intermediate that interacts with the silylcarboxonium ion to generate the silyl ether.

         <title>Piezofluorochromism in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement and Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of 2D and 3D bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs with varying dimensions, topologies, and linkages were employed to systematically investigate their piezochromic behavior, revealing significant pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement with an increase of 16&#8208;fold, as well as rare instances of blue&#8208;shifted emission.







Abstract
Achieving enhanced or blue&#8208;shifted emission from piezochromic materials remains a major challenge. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for the development of piezochromic materials owing to their dynamic structures and adjustable optical properties, where the emission behaviors are not solely determined by the functional groups, but are also greatly influenced by the specific geometric arrangement. Nevertheless, this area remains relatively understudied. In this study, a successful synthesis of a series of bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs with varying topologies, dimensions, and linkages was conducted, followed by an investigation of their structural and emission properties under hydrostatic pressure generated by a diamond anvil cell. Consequently, these COFs exhibited distinct piezochromic behaviors, particularly a remarkable pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement (PIEE) phenomenon with a 16&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence intensity from three&#8208;dimensional COFs, surpassing the performance of CPMs and most organic small molecules with PIEE behavior. On the contrary, three two&#8208;dimensional COFs with flexible structures exhibited rare blue&#8208;shifted emission, whereas the variants with rigid and conjugated structures showed common red&#8208;shifted and reduced emission. Mechanism research further revealed that these different piezochromic behaviors were primarily determined by interlayer distance and interaction. This study represents the first systematic exploration of the structures and emission properties of COFs through pressure&#8208;treated engineering and provides a new perspective on the design of piezochromic materials.

         <title>Nanometer&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Organic Cation Migration Behavior in Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining with the surface sensitive heterodyne mode and volume sensitive homodyne mode of infrared photo induced force microscopy, the 3&#8208;dimensional organic ion migration behaviors in organic metal halide perovskite has been imaged with sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm resolution, revealing the bias&#8208;dependent transition of MA+ migration channels from grain boundaries to grains and allowing the calculation of MA+ drift velocity across GBs.







Abstract
The performance and stability of organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP) optoelectronic devices have been associated with ion migration. Understanding of nanoscale resolved organic cation migration mechanism would facilitate structure engineering and commercialization of OMHP. Here, we report a three&#8208;dimensional approach for in situ nanoscale infrared imaging of organic ion migration behavior in OMHPs, enabling to distinguish migrations along grain boundary and in crystal lattice. Our results reveal that organic cation migration along OMHP film surface and grain boundaries (GBs) occurs at lower biases than in crystal lattice. We visualize the transition of organic cation migration channels from GBs to volume upon increasing electric field. The temporal resolved results demonstrate the fast MA+ migration kinetics at GBs, which is comparable to diffusivity of halide ions. Our findings help understand the role of organic cations in the performance of OMHP devices, and the proposed approach holds broad applicability for revealing migration mechanisms of organic ions in OMHPs based optoelectronic devices.

A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives. As a result, liquid LIBs exhibited enhanced performance at ultrahigh temperatures at&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were largely impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which were induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions, thus highly enhancing the high&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. As a result, both cathodes and anodes, without compromising their low&#8208;temperature performance, can operate at temperatures &#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C, with excellent capacity retentions of 96.1&#8201;% after 500 cycles and 93.5&#8201;% after &#8805;200 cycles, respectively, at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Ah&#8208;level LiCoO2||graphite full cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.3&#8197;V also exhibited superior temperature&#8208;resistance with a capacity retention of 89.9&#8201;% at temperature as high as 120&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the fully charged pouch cells exhibited highly enhanced safety, demonstrating their potentials in practical applications at ultrahigh temperatures.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;doped Carbon Support Enables Superfast Oxygen Reduction Kinetics by Breaking the Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well&#8208;established that Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer from the unfavorable linear scaling relationship (LSR) between *OOH and *OH (&#916;G(*OOH) = &#916;G(*OH) + 3.2 &#177; 0.2 eV) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in a great challenge to significantly reduced ORR overpotentials. Herein, we propose a universal and feasible strategy of fluorine&#8208;doped carbon supports, which optimize interfacial microenvironment of Pt&#8208;based catalysts and thus significantly enhance their reactive kinetics. The introduction of C&#8208;F bonds not only weakens the *OH binding energy, but also stabilizes the *OOH intermediate, resulting in a break of LSR. Furthermore, fluorine&#8208;doped carbon constructs a local super&#8208;hydrophobic interface that facilitates the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2. Electrochemical tests show that the F&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Pt catalysts exhibit over 2&#8208;fold higher mass activities than those without F modification. More importantly, those catalysts also demonstrate excellent stability in both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) tests. This study not only validates the feasibility of tuning the electrocatalytic microenvironment to improve mass transport and to break the scaling relationship, but also provides a universal catalyst design paradigm for other gas&#8208;involving electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenophene&#8208;fused Perylene Diimide&#8208;Based Cathode Interlayer Enables 19&#8201;% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells via Stimulative Charge Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A D&#8211;A type selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide derivative (SePDI3) is developed as CIM for OSCs. SePDI3 shows simultaneous superior charge transport and extraction capacity. Finally, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displayed a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy in the development of high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.







Abstract
The cathode interlayer is crucial for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), but the research on simple and efficient interlayer materials is lagging behind. Here, a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) typed selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) derivative (SePDI3) is developed as cathode interlayer material (CIM) for OSCs, and a non&#8208;fused PDI derivative (PDI3) is used as the control CIM for comparison. Compared to PDI3, SePDI3 shows a stronger self&#8208;doping effect and better crystallinity, resulting in better charge transport ability. Furthermore, the interaction between SePDI3 and L8&#8208;BO can form an efficient extraction channel, leading to superior charge extraction behavior. Finally, benefitting from significantly enhanced charge transport and extraction capacity, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displays a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO active layer, which is one of the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs based novel CIMs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy to develop high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.

         <title>Hirocidins, Cytotoxic Metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis, Induce Mitochondrion&#8208;Mediated Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hirocidins A&#8722;C, secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with novel architectures and promising inhibitory activity against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. The total synthesis of hirocidin A and mechanistic investigations, which reveal mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis via caspase&#8208;9, provide opportunities to better understand and chemically enhance hirocidin's antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
Recent advances in whole genome sequencing have revealed an immense microbial potential for the production of therapeutic small molecules, even from well&#8208;known producers. To access this potential, we subjected prominent antimicrobial producers to alternative antiproliferative assays using persistent cancer cell lines. Described herein is our discovery of hirocidins, novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with antiproliferative activities against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. Hirocidin A is an unusual nine&#8208;membered carbocyclic maleimide and hirocidins B and C are relatives with an unprecedented, bridged azamacrocyclic backbone. Mode of action studies show that hirocidins trigger mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis by inducing expression of the key apoptotic effector caspase&#8208;9. The discovery of new cytotoxins contributes to scaffold diversification in anticancer drug discovery and the reported modes of action and concise total synthetic route for variant A set the stage for unraveling specific targets and biochemical interactions of the hirocidins.

         <title>Value&#8208;Added Upcycling of PET to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexanedimethanol by a Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistage relay process has been developed that directly transforms PET into high&#8208;value&#8208;added 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimetha&#8208;nol (CHDM). The process utilizes polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) as a crucial intermediate, enabling the efficient and trans&#8208;selective production of CHDM. By implementing a temperature&#8208;programmed, three&#8208;stage relay approach, we successfully achieved an isolated CHDM yield of up to 87&#8201;%, with a significantly enhanced trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1.







Abstract
We present an innovative process for directly transforming poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a polymer extensively used in food and beverage packaging, into trans&#8208;isomer&#8208;enriched 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM), a key ingredient in advanced specialty polymers. Our approach leverages a dual&#8208;catalyst system featuring palladium on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/r&#8208;GO) and oxalate&#8208;gel&#8208;derived copper&#8208;zinc oxide (og&#8208;CuZn), utilizing hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis relay catalysis. This method efficiently transforms PET into polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD), which is then converted into CHDM with an impressive overall yield of 95&#8201;% in a two&#8208;stage process. Our process effectively handles various post&#8208;consumer PET plastics, converting them into CHDM with yields between 78&#8201;% and 89&#8201;% across different substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of this approach through a temperature&#8208;programmed three&#8208;stage relay process on a 10&#8208;gram scale, which results in purified CHDM with an isolated yield of 87&#8201;% and a notably higher trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1, far exceeding that of commercially available CHDM. This research not only provides a viable route for repurposing PET waste but also enhances the control of selectivity patterns in multistage relay catalysis.

Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of this approach through a temperature-programmed three-stage relay process on a 10-gram scale, which results in purified CHDM with an isolated yield of 87&#8201;% and a notably higher &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; ratio of up to 4.09/1, far exceeding that of commercially available CHDM. This research not only provides a viable route for repurposing PET waste but also enhances the control of selectivity patterns in multistage relay catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Wittig Reaction by Phosphorus PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the atroposelective Wittig reaction enabled by PIII/PV=O redox catalysis. An endogenous base release compatible with Lewis acid co&#8208;catalysis thereby generates the ylide intermediates. The mild, chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction allows the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomers with enantioselectivities of up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is renowned as exceptionally versatile method for converting a diversity of aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. Recently, strategies for chiral phosphine catalysis under PIII/PV=O redox cycling emerged to render this venerable transformation stereoselective. Herein, we describe that phosphine redox catalysis enables the enantioselective synthesis of pertinent biaryl atropisomers by means of a stereocontrolled arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction. Key to the process is the release of an endogenous base from readily accessible tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonylated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts triggered by catalyst intramolecularization, permitting mild phosphine redox catalysis for atroposelective Wittig reactions. By this strategy, a broad diversity of biaryl atropisomers is obtained with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 enantioselectivity.

         <title>Structural Modulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have adeptly optimized the ORR process through strategic engineering of COFs, effectively transitioning the reaction from a four&#8208;electron pathway to a two&#8208;electron pathway. Significantly, when implemented within a flow cell apparatus, the COF augmented with ionic salt (JUC&#8208;660) demonstrated consistent productivity, maintaining a H2O2 yield rate in excess of 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an extended operational period more than 85&#8197;hours. This performance solidifies its status as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed catalysts reported to date.







Abstract
The electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using metal&#8208;free catalysts has emerged as a viable and sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, the precise architectural design of these electrocatalysts poses a significant challenge, requiring intricate structural engineering to optimize electron transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we introduce a novel design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that effectively shift the ORR from a four&#8208;electron to a more advantageous two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, the JUC&#8208;660 COF, with strategically charge&#8208;modified benzyl moieties, achieved a continuous high H2O2 yield of over 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an impressive duration of over 85&#8197;hours in a flow cell setting, marking it as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed H2O2 electrocatalysts reported to date. Theoretical computations alongside in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that JUC&#8208;660 markedly diminishes the adsorption of the OOH* intermediate, thereby steering the ORR towards the desired pathway. Furthermore, the versatility of JUC&#8208;660 was demonstrated through its application in the electro&#8208;Fenton reaction, where it efficiently and rapidly removed aqueous contaminants. This work delineates a pioneering approach to altering the ORR pathway, ultimately paving the way for the development of highly effective metal&#8208;free H2O2 electrocatalysts.

         <title>Common Biosynthesis of Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Terpenes through a Fragmentation&#8208;Recombination Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of six bacterial non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers was investigated through a combination of isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results showed that five of these compounds are formed by an unusual fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism. In addition, for anaximandrene a dancing mechanism was discovered, explaining the distribution of labeling over several carbon positions.







Abstract
The biosynthesis of six recently reported non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers, archimedene, aristotelene, eratosthenene, pythagorene, &#945;&#8208;democritene and anaximandrene, was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and isotopic labeling experiments. The results revealed for all compounds except archimedene a unique fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism as previously demonstrated for sodorifen biosynthesis, in addition to a remarkable &#8220;dancing&#8221; mechanism for anaximandrene biosynthesis.

         <title>A Dual Cobalt&#8208;Photoredox Catalytic Approach for Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles with Aryl Amides via C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we showcase cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric dearomatization of indoles with aryl amides, achieving remarkable enantioinduction and exceptional regioselectivity. This dual catalytic strategy, which integrates photocatalyst and cobalt, represents a pioneering approach in asymmetric C&#8722;H bond functionalization. Through detailed experimental investigations and DFT calculations, we present a plausible mechanism to elucidate the reaction pathway.







Abstract
In this study, we unveil a novel method for the asymmetric dearomatization of indoles under cobalt/photoredox catalysis. By strategically activating C&#8722;H bonds of amides and subsequent migratory insertion of &#960;&#8208;bonds present in indole as reactive partner, we achieve syn&#8208;selective tetrahydro&#8208;5H&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;c]isoquinolin&#8208;5&#8208;one derivatives with excellent yields and enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt;99&#8201;%. The developed method operates without a metal oxidant, relying solely on oxygen as the oxidant and employing an organic dye as a photocatalyst under irradiation. Control experiments and stoichiometric studies elucidate the reversible nature of the enantiodetermining C&#8722;H activation step, albeit not being rate&#8208;determining. This study not only expands the horizon of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H bond functionalization, but also showcases the potential synergy between cobalt and photoredox catalysis in enabling asymmetric synthesis of complex molecules.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Frameworks with Controlled and Uniform Pore Apertures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline supramolecular polymer frameworks (SPFs) with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are readily prepared using three&#8208;arm rigid polyisocyanides as building block via intermolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Porous frameworks with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are greatly demanded. However, precise synthesis of this kind of materials is a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the fabrication of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymer frameworks using a precisely synthesized rod&#8208;like helical polyisocyanide as link. Four three&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped polyisocyanides with the degree of the polymerization of 10, 20, 30 and 40, and having 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) terminals were synthesized. 2D&#8208;Crystalline polymer frameworks with apertures of 5.3, 10.1, 13.9, and 19.1&#8197;nm were respectively obtained through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between the terminal Upy units. The pore aperture is dependent on the length of polyisocyanide backbone. Thus, well&#8208;defined supramolecular polymer frameworks with controlled and uniform hexagonal pores were obtained, as proved by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (synchrotron radiation facility), atomic force microscopy, and Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller analyses. The frameworks with uniform large pore aperture were used to purify nanomaterials and immobilize biomacromolecules. For instance, the membranes of the polymer frameworks could size&#8208;fractionation of silver nanoparticles into uniform nanoparticles with very low dispersity. The frameworks with large aperture facilitated the inclusion of myoglobin and enhanced the stability and catalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;Crystalline supramolecular polymer frameworks (SPFs) with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are readily prepared using three-arm rigid polyisocyanides as building block via intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous frameworks with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are greatly demanded. However, precise synthesis of this kind of materials is a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymer frameworks using a precisely synthesized rod-like helical polyisocyanide as link. Four three-arm star-shaped polyisocyanides with the degree of the polymerization of 10, 20, 30 and 40, and having 2-ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone (UPy) terminals were synthesized. 2D-Crystalline polymer frameworks with apertures of 5.3, 10.1, 13.9, and 19.1&#8197;nm were respectively obtained through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between the terminal Upy units. The pore aperture is dependent on the length of polyisocyanide backbone. Thus, well-defined supramolecular polymer frameworks with controlled and uniform hexagonal pores were obtained, as proved by small-angle X-ray scattering (synchrotron radiation facility), atomic force microscopy, and Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller analyses. The frameworks with uniform large pore aperture were used to purify nanomaterials and immobilize biomacromolecules. For instance, the membranes of the polymer frameworks could size-fractionation of silver nanoparticles into uniform nanoparticles with very low dispersity. The frameworks with large aperture facilitated the inclusion of myoglobin and enhanced the stability and catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unexpected Elevated Working Voltage by Na+/Vacancy Ordering and Stabilized Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage by Transition&#8208;Metal Honeycomb Ordering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered oxide cathode material featuring dual&#8208;site ordering superstructures is prepared by simply regulating the calcination time, where the optimized Na+/vacancy ordering significantly elevates the operating voltage and the transition&#8208;metal honeycomb ordering effectively stabilizes the structure, leading to the increased energy density and high cycling stability in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Na+/vacancy ordering in sodium&#8208;ion layered oxide cathodes is widely believed to deteriorate the structural stability and retard the Na+ diffusion kinetics, but its unexplored potential advantages remain elusive. Herein, we prepared a P2&#8208;Na0.8Cu0.22Li0.08Mn0.67O2 (NCLMO&#8208;12&#8197;h) material featuring moderate Na+/vacancy and transition&#8208;metal (TM) honeycomb orderings. The appropriate Na+/vacancy ordering significantly enhances the operating voltage and the TM honeycomb ordering effectively strengthens the layered framework. Compared with the disordered material, the well&#8208;balanced dual&#8208;ordering NCLMO&#8208;12&#8197;h cathode affords a boosted working voltage from 2.85 to 3.51&#8197;V, a remarkable ~20&#8201;% enhancement in energy density, and a superior cycling stability (capacity retention of 86.5&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles). The solid&#8208;solution reaction with a nearly &#8220;zero&#8208;strain&#8221; character, the charge compensation mechanisms, and the reversible inter&#8208;layer Li migration upon sodiation/desodiation are unraveled by systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations. This study breaks the stereotype surrounding Na+/vacancy ordering and provides a new avenue for developing high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;durability sodium layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Nanoribbon: Preparation, Single&#8208;Crystal Structure with Chinese Luban Lock Configuration, and Photocatalytic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal structure of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) with a width of ca. 6&#8197;nm has been shown to exhibit a multiple &#8220;mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon&#8221; like joint 3D network similar to the Chinese traditional Luban lock configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in the metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot tandem hydrogen evolution reaction and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of diphenylacetylene derivatives.







Abstract
The multiple mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks; however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together through dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;27 has a covalent organic nanoribbon structure, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock&#8208;like configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co&#8208;catalysts (metal&#8208;free).

         <title>Highly Efficient Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia through the Cooperation of Plasma and Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Reactors with Confined Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and tunable ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2O is presented, where the plasma activates inert N2 molecules into the excited nitrogen species reacting with the confined H2O molecules in porous MOF reactors with various compositions and structures.







Abstract
While the ambient N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) using H2O as hydrogen source (2N2+6H2O=4NH3+3O2) is known as a promising alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, the high bond energy of N&#8801;N bond leads to the extremely low NH3 yield. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic system for ammonia synthesis using the low&#8208;temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma to activate inert N2 molecules into the excited nitrogen species, which can efficiently react with the confined and concentrated H2O molecules in porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) reactors with V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions. Specially, the Fe&#8208;based catalyst MIL&#8208;100(Fe) causes a superhigh NH3 yield of 22.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The investigation of catalytic performance and systematic characterizations of MIL&#8208;100(Fe) during the plasma&#8208;driven catalytic reaction unveils that the in situ generated defective Fe&#8722;O clusters are the highly active sites and NH3 molecules indeed form inside the MIL&#8208;100(Fe) reactor. The theoretical calculation reveals that the porous MOF catalysts have different adsorption capacity for nitrogen species on different catalytic metal sites, where the optimal MIL&#8208;100(Fe) has the lowest energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *NNH formation step, significantly enhancing efficiency of nitrogen fixation.

         <title>Chirality Interplay between the Interior and Exterior of Metal&#8211;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple stereogenic elements have been embedded into M2L4 metal&#8211;organic cages to control the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages, i.e. within and beyond the first coordination sphere.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic cages featuring two stereogenic elements, in terms of the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges, were exploited. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages. The chirality information induced by a chiral guest inside the cage cavity can pass through the cage framework and influence the orientation of the diazaanthracene segments on the periphery of the cage. In turn, the chirality of a stereogenic center within the diazaanthracene segments can transfer back into the cavity, enabling discrimination of enantiomeric guests.

         <title>Insight into C4 Selectivity in the Light&#8208;Driven C&#8211;H Fluoroalkylation of Pyridines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the prevalence of pyridine motifs in FDA&#8208;approved drugs, selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines and quinolines is essential for preparing diverse bioisosteres. However, conventional Minisci reactions often face challenges in achieving precise regioselectivity due to competing reaction sites of pyridine and the limited availability of fluoroalkyl radical sources. Herein, we present a light&#8208;driven, C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of azines utilizing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and readily available sulfinates. Our approach employs electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, achieving highly C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst. This practical method not only enables the installation of CF2H groups but also allows for the incorporation of CF2&#8208;alkyl groups with diverse functional entities, surpassing the limitations of previous methods. The versatility of the radical pathway is further demonstrated through straightforward three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane. Detailed experimental and computational studies have elucidated the origins of regioselectivity, providing profound insights into the mechanistic aspects.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Interactions in Polymer&#8208;Derived Sodium&#8208;Doped Amorphous Si&#8208;B&#8208;N Ceramic: Towards Main&#8208;Group&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interest is growing in transition metal&#8208;free compounds for small molecule activation and catalysis. We discuss the opportunities arising from synthesizing sodium&#8208;doped amorphous silicon&#8208;boron&#8208;nitride (Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN). Na+ cations and 3&#8208;fold coordinated BIII moieties were incorporated into an amorphous silicon nitride network via chemical modification of a polysilazane followed by pyrolysis in ammonia&#160;at 1000 &#176;C. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of hydrogen (H2) activation within Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN structure. This material design approach allows the homogeneous distribution of Na+ and BIII moieties surrounded by SiN4 units contributing to the transformation of the BIII moieties into 4&#8208;fold coordinated geometry upon encountering H2, potentially serving as frustrated Lewis acid (FLA) sites. Exposure to H2 induced formation of frustrated Lewis base (FLB) N&#8211;= sites with Na+ as a charge&#8208;compensating cation, resulting in the in situ formation of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif (&#8801;BFLA&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#948;&#8211;&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#948;+&#183;&#183;&#183;:N&#8211;(Na+)=). Reversible H2 adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior with high activation energy for H2 desorption (124 kJ mol&#8211;1) suggested the H2 chemisorption on Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN. These findings highlight a future landscape full of possibilities within our reach, where we anticipate main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated small molecule activation will have an important impact on the design of more efficient catalytic processes and the discovery of new catalytic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating nucleic acid catalysis using active droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells use transient membraneless organelles to regulate biological reaction networks. For example, stress granules selectively store mRNA to downregulate protein expression in response to heat or oxidative stress. Models mimicking this active behavior should be established to better understand in vivo regulation involving compartmentalization. Here we use active, complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles to spatiotemporally control the activity of a catalytic DNA (DNAzyme). Upon partitioning into these peptide&#8208;RNA droplets, the DNAzyme unfolds and loses its ability to catalyze the cleavage of a nucleic acid strand. We can transiently pause the DNAzyme activity upon inducing droplet formation with fuel. After fuel consumption, the DNAzyme activity autonomously restarts. We envision this system could be used to up and downregulate multiple reactions in a network, helping understand the complexity of a cell's pathways. By creating a network where the DNAzyme could reciprocally regulate the droplet properties, we would have a powerful tool for engineering synthetic cells.</dc:description>

         <title>An Engineered Imine Reductase for Highly Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Branched Amines with Contiguous Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines with contiguous stereocenters are valuable building blocks for preparing various biologically active molecules. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic approach for preparing a broad range of &#946;&#8208;branched chiral amines starting from their corresponding racemic ketones. This involves a dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination process catalyzed using only an imine reductase. Four rounds of protein engineering endowed wild&#8208;type PocIRED with higher reactivity, better stereoselectivity, and a broader substrate scope. Using the engineered enzyme, various chiral amine products were synthesized with up to &gt;99.9% ee, &gt;99:1 dr, and &gt;99% conversion. The practicability of the developed biocatalytic method was confirmed by producing a key intermediate of tofacitinib in 74% yield, &gt;99.9% ee, and 98:2 dr at a challenging substrate loading of 110 g L&#8722;1. Our study provides a highly capable imine reductase and a protocol for developing an efficient biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination reaction system.</dc:description>

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Type Structured Phosphor Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emission: Intervalence Charge Transfer and Hetero&#8208;Valent Chromium Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel&#8208;type structured LiGa5O8 phosphors with a high concentration of Cr3+ activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR&#8208;I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8211;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210 nm NIR&#8208;II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR&#8208;II emitting phosphors to promote its response.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality and Curvature on Protein Adsorption and Osteogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we designed enantiomeric lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid derivatives (L/D&#8208;UG) and investigated their self&#8208;assembled chiral nanostructures and performance with the protein adsorption as well as the osteogenesis. It was found that L or D&#8208;UG can self&#8208;assemble into vesicle bilayers and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals via a kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. These chiral vesicles and 2D crystals showed differentiated adsorption of proteins by their curvature and chirality. Specifically, fibronectin constituted by L&#8208;amino acids adsorbed preferentially on L&#8208;UG 2D crystal in a semi&#8208;random pattern and L&#8208;2D nanocrystal show as the most effective structures to promote bone regeneration. The controlled vesicle and 2D crystal assemblies with different chirality and curvature helps to clarify their determine roles in protein adsorption and osteogenesis.</dc:description>

It was found that L or D-UG can self-assemble into vesicle bilayers and two-dimensional (2D) nanocrystals via a kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. These chiral vesicles and 2D crystals showed differentiated adsorption of proteins by their curvature and chirality. Specifically, fibronectin constituted by L-amino acids adsorbed preferentially on L-UG 2D crystal in a semi-random pattern and L-2D nanocrystal show as the most effective structures to promote bone regeneration. The controlled vesicle and 2D crystal assemblies with different chirality and curvature helps to clarify their determine roles in protein adsorption and osteogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Computation&#8208;guided Design of Highly Defined and Dense Bimetallic Active Sites on a Two&#8208;dimensional Conductive Metal&#8208;organic Framework for Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) provides an alternative method to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. Metal macrocycles with precise coordination are widely used for 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalysis, but they have to be commonly loaded on conductive substrates, thus exposing a large number of 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR&#8208;inactive sites that result in poor H2O2 production rate and efficiency. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principle predictions, a substrate&#8208;free and two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)), composed of Co&#8208;N4 sites in porphine(Co) centers and Ni2O8 nodes, is designed as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The approperiate distance between the CoN4 and Ni2O8 sites in Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) weakens the electron transfer between them, thus ensuring their inherent activities and creating high&#8208;density active sites. Meanwhile, the intrinsic electronic conductivity and porosity of Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) further facilitate rapid reaction kinetics. Therefore, outstanding 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalytic performance has been achieved in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes (&gt;90%/85% H2O2 selectivity within 0&#8208;0.8 V vs. RHE and &gt;18.2/18.0 mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 H2O2 yield under alkaline/neutral conditions), with confirmed feasibility for water purification and disinfection applications. This strategy thus provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with precise coordination and high&#8208;density active sites, promoting high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthesis of H2O2 and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction between Ni and Fe Atoms in Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Boost CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are promising for applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction due to the enhanced flexibility of the catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between dual atoms. However, precisely controlling the atomic distance and identifying the dual&#8208;atom configuration of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Here, the Ni and Fe atomic pairs were constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support in three different configurations: NiFe&#8208;isolate, NiFe&#8208;N bridge, and NiFe bonding. It was found that the NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity and promising stability when compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding catalysts. A series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations suggested that the N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms can exert a more pronounced synergy. It not only regulated the suitable adsorption strength for the *COOH intermediate but also promoted the desorption of *CO, thus accelerating the CO2 electroreduction to CO. This work provides an important implication for the enhancement of catalysis by the tailoring of the coordination structure of DACs, with the identification of distance effect between neighboring dual atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Sulfur&#8208;Doped Double [7]Helicene Photosensitizer: Synthesis, Structure and Chiral Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with sulfur atoms is becoming more and more important as a means of creating unique functional materials. Recently, thiophene&#8208;containing multiple helicenes have garnered enormous attention due to their intriguing electronic and (chir)optical properties compared with carbohelicenes. However, the efficient synthesis of thiopyran&#8208;containing multiple helicenes and the underlying sulfur doping mechanisms are rather unexplored. Herein, the synthesis and structural analysis of a thiopyran&#8208;containing double [7]helicene 3 are reported. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals 3 and its dication with C2&#8208;symmetric propeller&#8208;shape structure and compact p&#8208;p interaction in the solid state. 3 exhibits deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission. Tunable aromaticity of the central benzene ring and thiopyran rings is found by chemical oxidation, which is further confirmed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS), anisotropy of the induced current density (AICD) and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) analysis. Furthermore, the chiral and photosensitizing characters of 3 are investigated. The excellent deep&#8208;red to NIR fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and photosensitizing activities suggest that 3 can be used as an outstanding photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and bioimaging, especially paving the way for future CPL&#8208;PDT and CPL&#8208;bio&#8208;probe applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophil Elastase and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Unimolecular Photoacoustic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atherosclerosis is a primary global health concern due to its high morbidity and mortality. This disease is characterized by a complex interplay of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Traditional imaging techniques struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes within atherosclerotic plaques. Herein, we have developed a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) that combines specific recognition sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8226;&#8210;/GSH into a cohesive molecular platform, allowing in vivo monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils within plaques. UMAPP features a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core linked to a hydrophilic NE&#8208;cleavable tetrapeptide, and dual oxidative stress&#8208;responsive catechol moieties, enabling NE&#8208;mediated modulation of photoinduced electron transfer, affecting the photoacoustic intensity at 685 nm (PA685), while oxidation and reduction of the catechol groups by O2&#8226;&#8210; and GSH lead to reversible, ratiometric changes in the photoacoustic spectrum. Preliminary applications of UMAPP have successfully differentiated between atherosclerotic and healthy mice, assessed the impact of pneumonia on plaque composition, and validated the probe&#8217;s efficacy in drug&#8208;treatment studies, detecting molecular changes prior to observable histopathological alterations. UMAPP's integrated molecular imaging approach holds significant promise for advancing the diagnosis and management of atherosclerosis by enabling earlier and more precise detection of vulnerable plaques.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Minority Species in Redox Reactions: A Quantitative Combined XAS and Modulation Excitation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding nature of intermediates/active species in reactions is a major challenge in chemistry. This is because spectator species typically dominate the experimentally derived data and consequently active phase contributions are masked. Transient methods offer a means to bypass this difficulty. In particular, modulation excitation with phase&#8208;sensitive detection (ME&#8208;PSD) provides a mechanism to distinguish between spectator and reacting species. Herein, modulation excitation (ME) time&#8208;resolved (energy dispersive) X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, assisted by phase sensitive detection (PSD) analysis, has been applied to the study of a liquid phase process; in this case the classic ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. Periodic switches of the electrical potential (anodic/cathodic) enabled the use of the ME approach. Structural changes at fractions as low as 2% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X&#8208;ray beam probe volume containing ~30 pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrapodal Hole&#8208;Collecting Monolayer Materials Based on Saddle&#8208;Like Cyclooctatetraene Core for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole&#8208;collecting monolayers have greatly advanced the development of positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs). To date, however, most of the anchoring groups in the reported monolayer materials are designed to bind to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) surface, resulting in less availability for other functions such as tuning the wettability of the monolayer surface. In this work, we developed two anchorable molecules, 4PATTI&#8208;C3 and 4PATTI&#8208;C4, by employing a saddle&#8208;like indole&#8208;fused cyclooctatetraene as a p&#8208;core with four phosphonic acid anchoring groups linked through propyl or butyl chains. Both molecules form monolayers on TCO substrates. Thanks to the saddle shape of a cyclooctatetraene skeleton, two of the four phosphonic acid anchoring groups were found to point upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. Compared to the devices using 4PATTI&#8208;C4 as the hole&#8208;collecting monolayer, 4PATTI&#8208;C3&#8208;based devices exhibit a faster hole&#8208;collection process, leading to higher power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7% and 21.4% for a mini&#8208;cell (0.1 cm2) and a mini&#8208;module (1.62 cm2), respectively, together with good operational stability.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hole-collecting monolayers have greatly advanced the development of positive-intrinsic-negative perovskite solar cells (p-i-n PSCs). To date, however, most of the anchoring groups in the reported monolayer materials are designed to bind to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) surface, resulting in less availability for other functions such as tuning the wettability of the monolayer surface. In this work, we developed two anchorable molecules, 4PATTI-C3 and 4PATTI-C4, by employing a saddle-like indole-fused cyclooctatetraene as a p-core with four phosphonic acid anchoring groups linked through propyl or butyl chains. Both molecules form monolayers on TCO substrates. Thanks to the saddle shape of a cyclooctatetraene skeleton, two of the four phosphonic acid anchoring groups were found to point upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. Compared to the devices using 4PATTI-C4 as the hole-collecting monolayer, 4PATTI-C3-based devices exhibit a faster hole-collection process, leading to higher power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7% and 21.4% for a mini-cell (0.1 cm2) and a mini-module (1.62 cm2), respectively, together with good operational stability.

         <title>Confining Conversion Chemistry in Intercalation Host for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confining conversion chemistry in intercalation host enables an integrated anode structure of iron oxide/hydroxide&#8208;pillared titanate. The iron&#8208;based conversion reaction is spatially and kinetically confined within sub&#8208;nano interlayer of titanate, achieving long cycle life, fast kinetics, and universal generality to the electrolyte medium. Two unique types of full batteries are further assembled, exhibiting low redox polarization and long cycling stability.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type anode materials with high theoretical capacities play a pivotal role in developing future aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs). However, their sustainable applications have long been impeded by the poor cycling stability and sluggish redox kinetics. Here we show that confining conversion chemistry in intercalation host could overcome the above challenges. Using sodium titanates as a model intercalation host, an integrated layered anode material of iron oxide hydroxide&#8208;pillared titanate (FeNTO) is demonstrated. The conversion reaction is spatially and kinetically confined within sub&#8208;nano interlayer, enabling superlow redox polarization (ca. 4&#8211;6&#8197;times reduced), ultralong lifespan (up to 8700&#8197;cycles) and excellent rate performance. Notably, the charge compensation of interlayer via universal cation intercalation into host endows FeNTO with the capability of operating well in a broad range of aqueous electrolytes (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, etc.). We further demonstrate the large&#8208;scale synthesis of FeNTO thin film and powder, and rational design of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state high&#8208;voltage ARB pouch cells powering wearable electronics against extreme mechanical abuse. This work demonstrates a powerful confinement means to access disruptive electrode materials for next&#8208;generation energy devices.

The enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution of tetra&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide derivatives using (2S,3R)&#8208;HyperBTM (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the catalyst (&gt;40&#8197;examples in total) is reported.

Abstract
A general and highly enantioselective method for the preparation of tetra&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide esters via isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is reported. Using (2S,3R)&#8208;HyperBTM (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the catalyst, the scope and limitations of this methodology have been extensively probed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields observed (&gt;40&#8197;examples, up to 99&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er). Substitution of the aromatic core within the 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide skeleton, as well as aliphatic and aromatic substitution at C(3), is readily tolerated. A diverse range of anhydrides, including those from bioactive and pharmaceutically relevant acids, can also be used. The high enantioselectivity observed in this DKR process has been probed computationally, with a key substrate heteroatom donor O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;acyl&#8208;isothiouronium interaction identified through DFT analysis as necessary for enantiodiscrimination.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Methylated Sulfone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Back&#8208;Reaction Inhibited Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise methylation of O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen&#8208;intermediate desorption, which obstructs the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics and inhibits the backward reaction of O2 reduction reaction in photocatalytic overall water splitting. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution, which cooperatively contributes to efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with favored proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS&#8208;COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70&#8201;% of the backward reaction and a three&#8208;fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest reported for organic&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Anion Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Protected PtAu12 Superatoms: Charging Energy in Vacuum vs Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charging energy of PtAu24(SCnH2n+1)18 in vacuum was evaluated by gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy. Permittivity of the ligand layer, estimated based on the concentric&#8208;capacitor model, decreased with n. The n&#8208;dependent charging behavior is explained by inhomogeneous monolayers due to the formation of bundles of the longer alkyl chains.







Abstract
The charging behavior of molecular Au clusters protected by alkanethiolate (SCnH2n+1=SCn) is, under electrochemical conditions, significantly affected by the penetration of solvents and electrolytes into the SCn layer. In this study, we estimated the charging energy EC(n) associated with [PtAu24(SCn)18]&#8722;+e&#8722;&#8594;[PtAu24(SCn)18]2&#8722; (n=4, 8, 12, and 16) in vacuum using mass&#8208;selected gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy of [PtAu24(SCn)18]z (z=&#8722;1 and &#8722;2). The EC(n) values of PtAu24(SCn)18 in vacuum are significantly larger than those in solution and decrease with n in contrast to the behavior reported for Au25(SCn)18 in solution. The effective relative permittivity (&#1013;m*) of the SCn layer in vacuum is estimated to be 2.3&#8211;2.0 based on the double&#8208;concentric&#8208;capacitor model. Much smaller &#1013;m* values in vacuum than those in solution are explained by the absence of solvent/electrolyte penetration into the monolayer. The gradual decrease of &#1013;m* with n is ascribed to the appearance of an exposed surface region due to the bundle formation of long alkyl chains.

&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) values of PtAu&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; in vacuum are significantly larger than those in solution and decrease with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; in contrast to the behavior reported for Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(SC&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; in solution. The effective relative permittivity (&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;*) of the SC&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; layer in vacuum is estimated to be 2.3&#8211;2.0 based on the double-concentric-capacitor model. Much smaller &lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;* values in vacuum than those in solution are explained by the absence of solvent/electrolyte penetration into the monolayer. The gradual decrease of &lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;* with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is ascribed to the appearance of an exposed surface region due to the bundle formation of long alkyl chains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice Oxygen in Photocatalytic Gas&#8211;Solid Reactions: Participator vs. Dominator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a dual&#8208;pathway reaction mechanism of lattice oxygen (OL) participation and molecular oxygen oxidation, Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst exhibits efficient complete oxidation of ppm&#8208;level methane and OL plays a dominant role in this reaction. Single&#8208;atom Ru accelerates the O2 activation to &#8901;O2&#8722; and the regeneration of consumed OL during reaction.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen activation has emerged as a popular strategy for optimizing the performance and selectivity of oxide&#8208;based thermocatalysis and electrolysis. However, the significance of lattice oxygen in oxide photocatalysts has been ignored, particularly in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Here, using methane oxidation over a Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst as the prototypical reaction and via 18O isotope labelling techniques, we found that lattice oxygen can directly participate in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Lattice oxygen played a dominant role in the photocatalytic reaction, as determined by estimating the kinetic constants in the initial stage. Furthermore, we discovered that dynamic diffusion between O2 and lattice oxygen proceeded even in the absence of targeted reactants. Finally, single&#8208;atom Ru can facilitate the activation of adsorbed O2 and the subsequent regeneration of consumed lattice oxygen, thus ensuring high catalyst activity and stability. The results provide guidance for next&#8208;generation oxide photocatalysts with improved activities and selectivities.

         <title>Chromium&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Reductant&#8208;Free Asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) Reaction Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A variety of chiral allylic alcohols can be synthesized through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction between alkenyl (pseudo)halides and aldehydes. This innovative technique facilitates both oxidative addition and insertion solely using nickel, representing a significant departure from the traditional NHK reaction pathway that requires both nickel and chromium salts.







Abstract
Chiral allylic alcohols are highly prized in synthetic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity stemming from both alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. While the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of allylic alcohols, it suffers from drawbacks such as the use of toxic chromium salts, high amounts of metal reductants, and poor enantiocontrol. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach involving a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric NHK reaction for the production of chiral allylic alcohols. This method marries alkenyl (pseudo)halides with aldehydes, leveraging a synergistic blend of a chiral nickel catalyst and a photocatalyst. This innovative technique enables both oxidative addition and insertion just using nickel, diverging significantly from the conventional NHK reaction pathway mediated by nickel and chromium salts. The adoption of this methodology holds immense promise for crafting a spectrum of intricate compounds, particularly those of significance in pharmaceuticals. Detailed experimental investigations have shed light on the metallaphotoredox process, further enhancing our understanding and enabling further advancements.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM5&#8208;TF catalyst (where TF indicates template&#8208;free synthesis), featuring spatially adjacent mononuclear Fe and Cu within ZSM&#8208;5 channels, achieves an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C&#8212;more than threefold higher than previous catalysts. The Fe&#8722;Cu synergistic effect promotes the C&#8722;C coupling of &#8901;CH3 radical with CO by retarding the oxidation progress for high&#8208;efficient formation of acetic acid.







Abstract
The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane, utilizing abundant natural gas, offers a mild and straightforward alternative. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to few active sites and rapid C1 oxygenate generation, impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM&#8208;5&#8208;TF (TF denotes template&#8208;free synthesis) catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, tripling the previous records of 12.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process, promoting C&#8722;C coupling for effective acetic acid synthesis. Furthermore, the methyl&#8208;group carbon in acetic acid originates solely from methane, while its carbonyl&#8208;group carbon is derived exclusively from CO, rather than the conversion of other C1 oxygenates. The proposed bimetallic catalyst design not only overcomes the limitations of current catalysts but also generalizes the oxidative carbonylation of other alkanes, demonstrating promising advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Learning from Protein Engineering by Deconvolution of Multi&#8208;Mutational Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First derivative of a typical experimental enzyme fitness pathway landscape mapped on the basis of &#916;G values, in this case of 24&#8197;trajectories in the deconvolution of a 4&#8208;mutational variant. Green areas indicate negative slopes and define trajectories involved in energetically favored stages, while red areas indicate positive slopes representing energetically disfavored pathways.







Abstract
This review analyzes a development in biochemistry, enzymology and biotechnology that originally came as a surprise. Following the establishment of directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes in organic chemistry, the concept of partial or complete deconvolution of selective multi&#8208;mutational variants was introduced. Early deconvolution experiments of stereoselective variants led to the finding that mutations can interact cooperatively or antagonistically with one another, not just additively. During the past decade, this phenomenon was shown to be general. In some studies, molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) computations were performed in order to shed light on the origin of non&#8208;additivity at all stages of an evolutionary upward climb. Data of complete deconvolution can be used to construct unique multi&#8208;dimensional rugged fitness pathway landscapes, which provide mechanistic insights different from traditional fitness landscapes. Along a related line, biochemists have long tested the result of introducing two point mutations in an enzyme for mechanistic reasons, followed by a comparison of the respective double mutant in so&#8208;called double mutant cycles, which originally showed only additive effects, but more recently also uncovered cooperative and antagonistic non&#8208;additive effects. We conclude with suggestions for future work, and call for a unified overall picture of non&#8208;additivity and epistasis.

         <title>Bilateral Unsymmetrical Disulfurating Reagent Design for Polysulfide Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stable and odorless bilateral disulfurating reagents with two divergent mask groups has been established. Diverse arylboronic acids and carbon/nitrogen/sulfur nucleophiles can be sequentially assembled on both sides of a S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Polysulfides are significant compounds in life science, pharmaceutical science, and materials science. Therefore, polysulfide construction is in great demand. The controllable sequential installation of groups on both ends of a S&#8722;S motif faces an enormous challenge owing to the reversible nature of the covalent S&#8722;S bond. A library was established with two divergent mask groups for bilateral unsymmetrical disulfurating reagents (R1O&#8722;SS&#8722;SO2R2). Sequential coupling with preferential activation of the S&#8722;SO2 bond (37.6&#8197;kcal/mol) and controllable activation of the S&#8722;O bond (54.8&#8197;kcal/mol) in the presence of the S&#8722;S bond (62.0&#8197;kcal/mol) enabled successive reactions at each end of the S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides and trisulfides, even for the cross&#8208;linkage of natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides, and a protein (bovine serum albumin).

         <title>Harnessing Cooperative Multivalency in Thioguanine for Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)&#8208;Based Differentiation of Polyfunctional Analytes Differing by a Single Functional Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
6&#8208;Thioguanine (TG), as a receptor capable of forming multidentate cooperative hydrogen bonding, enables the interaction with less&#8208;reactive functional groups and strengthens receptor&#8208;analyte complexation to achieve analyte&#8208;specific surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for accurate polyfunctional analog identification.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule receptors are increasingly employed to probe various functional groups for (bio)chemical analysis. However, differentiation of polyfunctional analogs sharing multiple functional groups remains challenging for conventional mono&#8208; and bidentate receptors because their insufficient number of binding sites limits interactions with the least reactive yet property&#8208;determining functional group. Herein, we introduce 6&#8208;thioguanine (TG) as a supramolecular receptor for unique tridentate receptor&#8208;analyte complexation, achieving &#8805;97&#8201;% identification accuracy among 16 polyfunctional analogs across three classes: glycerol derivatives, disubstituted propane, and vicinal diols. Crucially, we demonstrate distinct spectral changes induced by the tridentate interaction between TG's three anchoring points and all the analyte's functional groups, even the least reactive ones. Notably, hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) networks formed in the TG&#8208;analyte complexes demonstrate additive effects in binding strength originating from good bond linearity, cooperativity, and resonance, thus strengthening complexation events and amplifying the differences in spectral changes induced among analytes. It also enhances spectral consistency by selectively forming a sole configuration that is stronger than the respective analyte&#8208;analyte interaction. Finally, we achieve 95.4&#8201;% accuracy for multiplex identification of a mixture consisting of multiple polyfunctional analogs. We envisage that extension to other multidentate non&#8208;covalent interactions enables the development of interference&#8208;free small molecule&#8208;based sensors for various (bio)chemical analysis applications.

         <title>Coordination Desymmetrization of Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that asymmetric coordination of single&#8208;atom copper catalysts can greatly enhance the efficiency and stability of NO3RR catalysis, which attributes to the accumulation of NO3&#8722; on the surface and the reduction of the energy barrier regarding the formation of the key reaction intermediate.







Abstract
Coordination engineering strategy for optimizing the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) has been rapidly developed over the last decade. However, previous reports on copper SACs for nitrate reduction reactions (NO3RR) have mostly focused on symmetric coordination configurations such as Cu&#8208;N4 and Cu&#8208;N3. In addition, the mechanism in terms of the regulation of coordination environment and catalytic properties of SACs has not been well demonstrated. Herein, we disrupted the local symmetric structure of copper atoms by introducing unsaturated heteroatomic coordination of Cu&#8722;O and Cu&#8722;N to achieve the coordination desymmetrization of Cu&#8208;N1O2 SACs. The Cu&#8208;N1O2 SACs exhibit an efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion with a high FE of ~96.5&#8201;% and a yield rate of 3120&#8197;&#956;g NH3 h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.60&#8197;V vs RHE. As indicated by in situ Raman spectra, the catalysts facilitate the accumulation of NO3&#8722; and the selective adsorption of *NO2, which were further confirmed by the theoretical study of surface dipole moment and orbital hybridization. Our work illustrated the correlation between the coordination desymmetrization and the catalytic performance of copper SACs for NO3RR.

         <title>2,2&#8208;Difluoroethylation of Heteroatom Nucleophiles via a Hypervalent Iodine Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hypervalent iodine(III) reagent is disclosed for 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylation of thiols, amines and alcohols via a proposed ligand coupling mechanism. A range of pharmaceutically relevant nucleophiles are difluoroethylated, including morpholine, glucose and the drugs Captopril, Normorphine and Mefloquine.







Abstract
The 2,2&#8208;difluoroethyl group is an important lipophilic hydrogen bond donor in medicinal chemistry, but its incorporation into small molecules is often challenging. Herein, we demonstrate electrophilic 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylation of thiol, amine and alcohol nucleophiles with a hypervalent iodine reagent, (2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;ethyl)(aryl)iodonium triflate, via a proposed ligand coupling mechanism. This transformation offers a complementary strategy to existing 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylation methods and allows access to a wide range of 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylated nucleophiles, including the drugs Captopril, Normorphine and Mefloquine.

         <title>A Stable Site&#8208;Isolated Mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rhodium Catalyst on a Metal&#8208;Organic Layer for Highly Efficient Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a highly efficient and reusable metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) catalyst is described. The stable site&#8208;isolated mono(phosphine)&#8208;rhodium complex on the MOL exhibits high catalytic efficiency in the hydrogenation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes and the reduction of nitriles to primary amines with turnover numbers of up to 390000 due to the lowering of reaction energy barriers by the low steric hindrance of catalytic active sites.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;ligated transition metal complexes play a pivotal role in modern catalysis, but our understanding of the impact of ligand counts on the catalysis performance of the metal center is limited. Here we report the synthesis of a low&#8208;coordinate mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rh catalyst on a metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL), P&#8208;MOL&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;Rh, and its applications in the hydrogenation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes as well as aryl nitriles with turnover numbers (TONs) of up to 390000. Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations revealed the lowering of reaction energy barriers by the low steric hindrance of site&#8208;isolated mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rh sites on the MOL to provide superior catalytic activity over homogeneous Rh catalysts. The MOL also prevents catalyst deactivation to enable recycle and reuse of P&#8208;MOL&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;Rh in catalytic hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>In situ Generation of Cyclohexanone Drives Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Phenol to Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling in situ generated intermediates with other substrates/intermediates is a viable approach for diversifying product outcomes of catalytic reactions involving two or multiple reactants. Cyclohexanone oxime is a key precursor for caprolactam synthesis (the monomer of Nylon&#8208;6), yet its current production uses unsustainable carbon sources, noble metal catalysts, and harsh conditions. Herein, we report the first work to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime through electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine. The Faradaic efficiency reached 69.1% over Cu catalyst, accompanied by a corresponding cyclohexanone oxime formation rate of 82.0 g h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1. In addition, the conversion of phenol was up to 97.5%. In situ characterizations, control experiments, and theoretical calculations suggested the importance of balanced activation of water, phenol, and hydroxylamine substrates on the optimal metallic Cu catalyst for achieving high&#8208;performance cyclohexanone oxime synthesis. Besides, a tandem catalytic route for the upgrading of lignin to caprolactam has been successfully developed through the integration of thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and Beckmann rearrangement, which achieved the synthesis of 0.40 g of caprolactam from 4.0 g of lignin raw material.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Hydrogel Network with Toughly Interfacial Chemistry for Highly Reversible Flexible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible and high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), coupled with low cost and safe, are considered as one of the most promising energy storage candidates for wearable electronics. However, most of hydrogel electrolytes suffer from poor mechanical properties and interfacial chemistry, which limits them to suppressed performance levels in flexible ZIBs, especially under harsh mechanical strains. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for highly reversible flexible ZIBs. As a result, the trehalose&#8208;modified PAM hydrogel exhibits a superior strength and stretchability up to 100 kPa and 5338%, respectively, as well as strong adhesive properties to various substrates. Also, the PAM/trehalose hydrogel electrolyte provides superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability for Zn anode and regulates Zn nucleation/growth, resulting in achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%, and long&#8208;term stability over 2400 h. Importantly, the flexible Zn//MnO2 pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling performance under different bending conditions, which offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>A Targeted Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Activation of the Last&#8208;Resort Antibiotic Colistin Reduces its Renal Cell Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of highly potent but very toxic antibiotics such as colistin has become inevitable due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed for a chemically&#8208;triggered, controlled release of colistin at the infection site to lower its systemic toxicity by harnessing the power of click&#8208;to&#8208;release reactions. Kinetic experiments with nine tetrazines and three dienophiles demonstrated a fast release via an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) and the amine&#8208;functionalized tetrazine Tz7. The antibiotic activity of colistin against Escherichia coli was masked by TCO units, but restored upon reaction with d&#8208;Ubi&#8211;Tz, a tetrazine functionalised with the bacterial binding peptide d&#8208;Ubi29&#8211;41. While standard TCO did not improve toxicity against human proximal tubular kidney HK&#8208;2 cells, the installation of an aspartic acid&#8208;modified TCO masking group reduced the overall charge of the peptide and entry to the kidney cells, thereby dramatically lowering its toxicity. The analog Col&#8211;(TCO&#8208;Asp)1 had favourable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and was successfully activated locally in the lung by d&#8208;Ubi&#8211;Tz in an in vivo infection model, whereas it remained inactive and non&#8208;harmful without the chemical trigger. This study constitutes the first example of a systemically acting two&#8208;component antibiotic with improved drug tolerability.</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes to Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Stable Direct Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni&#8208;based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine&#8208;rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time.&#160;Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser&#8208;ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L&#8208;LFP), derived from spent Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation.&#160;Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43&#8211; species, formed around L&#8208;LFP, effectively repels Cl&#8722; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion.&#160;Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH&#8211; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3 % activity loss after 600 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high&#8208;performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolved Protein Imaging Using Bifunctional Light&#8208;Up Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient labeling methods for protein visualization with minimal tag size and appropriate photophysical properties are required for single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), providing insights into the organization and interactions of biomolecules in cells at the molecular level. Among the fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamers (FLAPs) originally developed for RNA imaging, RhoBAST stands out due to its remarkable brightness, photostability, fluorogenicity, and rapid exchange kinetics, enabling super&#8208;resolved imaging with high localization precision. Here, we expand the applicability of RhoBAST to protein imaging by fusing it to protein&#8208;binding aptamers. The versatility of such bifunctional aptamers is demonstrated by employing a variety of protein&#8208;binding aptamers and different FLAPs. Moreover, fusing RhoBAST with the GFP&#8208;binding aptamer AP3 facilitates high&#8208; and super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP&#8208;tagged proteins, which is particularly valuable in view of the widespread availability of plasmids and stable cell lines expressing proteins fused to GFP. The bifunctional aptamers compare favorably with standard antibody&#8208;based immunofluorescence protocols, as they are 7&#8208;fold smaller than antibody conjugates and exhibit higher bleaching&#8208;resistance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in super&#8208;resolution microscopy in secondary mammalian cell lines and primary neurons by RhoBAST&#8208;PAINT, an SMLM protein imaging technique that leverages the transient binding of the fluorogenic rhodamine dye SpyRho to RhoBAST.</dc:description>

         <title>Exocyclic and Linker Editing of Lys63&#8208;linked Ubiquitin Chains Modulators Specifically Inhibits Non&#8208;homologous End&#8208;joining Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great advances in discovering cyclic peptides against protein targets, their reduced aqueous solubility, cell permeability, and activity of the cyclic peptide restrict its utilization in advanced biological research and therapeutic applications. Here we report on a novel approach of structural alternation of the exocyclic and linker parts that led to a new derivative with significantly improved cell activity allowing us to dissect its mode of action in detail. We have identified an effective cyclic peptide (CP7) that induces approximately a 9&#8208;fold increase in DNA damage accumulation and a remarkable increase in apoptotic cancer cell death compared to the reported molecule. Notably, treating cells with CP7 leads to a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs), which is accompanied by an increase in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, treating BRCA1&#8208;deficient cells with CP7 restores HR integrity, which is accompanied by increased resistance to CP7. Additionally, CP7 treatment increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CP7 is a selective inhibitor of NHEJ, offering a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Arginine Accelerates Sulfur Fluoride Exchange and Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange Reactions between Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) and phosphorus fluoride exchange (PFEx) click chemistries are advancing research across multiple disciplines. By genetically incorporating latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids (Uaas), these chemistries have been integrated into proteins, enabling precise covalent linkages with biological macromolecules and paving the way for new applications. However, their suboptimal reaction rates in proteins limit effectiveness, and traditional catalytic methods for small molecules are often incompatible with biological systems or in vivo applications. We demonstrated that introducing an arginine adjacent to the latent bioreactive Uaa significantly boosts SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This method is effective across various Uaas, target residues, and protein environments. Notably, it also enables efficient SuFEx reactions in acidic conditions, common in certain cellular compartments and tumor microenvironments, which typically hinder SuFEx reactions. Furthermore, we developed the first covalent cell engager that substantially enhances natural killer cell activation through improved covalent interaction facilitated by arginine. These findings provide mechanistic insights and offer a biocompatible strategy to harness these robust chemistries for advancing biological research and developing new biotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Brings High Electron Delocalization for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike many studies that regulate transport and separation behaviour of photogenerated charge carriers through controlling the chemical composite, our work demonstrates this goal can be achieved through simply tuning the molecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) without altering the building blocks or network topology. Further investigations reveal that the long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking significantly promotes electron delocalization and enhances electron density, thereby effectively suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination and augmenting the charge transfer rate. Simultaneously, acting as a porous substrate, it boosts electron density of Pd nanoparticle loaded on its surfaces, resulting in remarkable CO2 photoreduction catalytic activity (CO generation rate: 48.1 &#956;mol/g/h) without the need for hole scavengers. Our study provide insight into regulating the charge carrier behaviours in molecular assemblies based on hydrogen bonds, offering a new clue for efficient photocatalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Production of C2+ Oxygenates from CO2 in Strongly Acidic Condition by Rough Ag&#8208;Cu Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acidic electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) oxygenates is of great importance in view of enhancing carbon utilization efficiency and generating products with high energy densities, but suffering from low selectivity and activity. Herein, we synthesized Ag&#8208;Cu alloy catalyst with highly rough surface, by which the selectivity to C2+ oxygenates can be greatly improved. In a strongly acidic condition (pH=0.75), the maximum C2+ products Faradaic efficiency (FE) and C2+ oxygenates FE reach 80.4% and 56.5% at &#8208;1.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with a ratio of FEC2+ oxygenates to FEethylene up to 2.36. At this condition, the C2+ oxygenates partial current density is as high as 480 mA cm&#8208;2. The in situ Raman measurements and control experiments indicate that the high generation of C2+ oxygenates over the catalyst originates from its large surface roughness and Ag alloying.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Intermediate&#8208;Size&#160;m&#8208;Xylene from Xylenes via a Length&#8208;Matched Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Optimal Oxygen Sites Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xylene separation is crucial but challenging, especially for the preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene mixtures. Herein, exploiting the differences in molecular length and alkyl distribution among xylenes, we present a length&#8208;matched metal&#8208;organic framework, formulated as Al(OH)[O2C&#8208;C4H2O&#8208;CO2], featuring an effective&#160;pore size corresponding to m&#8208;xylene molecular length combined with multiple negative O hydrogen bond donors distribution, can serve as a molecular trap for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene. Benchmark separation performance was achieved for separating m&#8208;xylene from a ternary mixture of m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene, with simultaneous record&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3 mmol g&#8208;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption. Both vapor&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase fixed&#8208;bed tests confirmed its practical separation capability with benchmark dynamic m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene selectivities, as well as excellent regenerability. The selective and strong m&#8208;xylene binding affinity among xylene molecules was further elucidated by simulations, validating the effectiveness of such a pore environment for the separation of intermediate&#8208;size molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Bioorthogonal Chemistry Altered Natural Killer Cell Activity for Boosted Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural killer (NK) cell&#8208;based immunotherapy has received much attention in recent years. However, the practical application is still suffering from the decreased function, inadequate infiltration, and immunosuppressive microenvironment in solid tumor. Herein, we construct the light&#8208;responsive porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (denoted as NK@p&#8208;Fe) for cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. By installing cholesterol&#8208;modified porphyrin Fe molecules on NK cell surface, it forms a catalytic array with light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. This functionality transforms NK cells into cellular factories, capable of catalyzing the production of active agents in a light&#8208;controlled manner. The NK@p&#8208;Fe can generate active antineoplastic drug doxorubicin through bioorthogonal reactions to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Beyond drug synthesis, the NK@p&#8208;Fe can also bioorthogonally catalyze to produce FDA approved immune agonist, imiquimod (IMQ). The activated immune agonist plays a dual role by inducing DC maturation for NK cells activation and reshaping tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for NK cells infiltration. This work represents a paradigm for modulation of adoptive cell behaviors to boost cancer immunotherapy by bioorthogonal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a new strategy for the carbonylation of alkyl halides with different nucleophiles to generate valuable carbonyl derivatives under visible light irradiation. This method is mild, robust, highly selective, and proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions to prepare a range of structurally diverse esters and amides in good to excellent yields. In addition, we highlight the application of this activation strategy for 13C isotopic incorporation. We propose that the reaction proceeds by a photoinduced reduction to afford radical anions from alkyl halides, which undergo subsequent single electron&#8208;oxidation to form a carbocationic intermediate. Carbon monoxide is trapped by the carbocation to generate an acylium cation, which can be attacked by a series of nucleophiles to give a range of carbonyl products.</dc:description>

         <title>Crosslink&#8208;Enhanced Emission&#8208;Dominated Design Strategy for Constructing Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots with Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with advantageous crosslinked nano&#8208;structures have attracted considerable attention in metal&#8208;free room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, whereas, their RTP emissions are still limited to short wavelength. Expanding their RTP emission to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) range is attractive but suffers from the difficulties in constructing narrow energy levels and inhibiting intense nonradiative decay. Herein, a crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated construction strategy was proposed, achieving desired NIR RTP (710 nm) in self&#8208;protective CPDs for the first time. Structural factors, i.e.&#65292;crosslinking (covalent&#8208;bond CEE), conjugation (conjugated amine with bridging N&#8208;H and C=C group), and steric hindrance (confined&#8208;domain CEE), were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission in CPDs. Contrast experiments and theoretical calculations further revealed the rationality of the design strategy originating from CEE in terms of promoting the narrow energy level emission of triplet excitons and inhibiting the nonradiative quenching. This work not only firstly achieves NIR RTP in self&#8208;protective CPDs, but also helps understand the NIR RTP origin to further guide the synthesis of diverse CPDs with efficient long&#8208;wavelength RTP emission.</dc:description>

Structural factors, i.e.&#65292;crosslinking (covalent-bond CEE), conjugation (conjugated amine with bridging N-H and C=C group), and steric hindrance (confined-domain CEE), were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission in CPDs. Contrast experiments and theoretical calculations further revealed the rationality of the design strategy originating from CEE in terms of promoting the narrow energy level emission of triplet excitons and inhibiting the nonradiative quenching. This work not only firstly achieves NIR RTP in self-protective CPDs, but also helps understand the NIR RTP origin to further guide the synthesis of diverse CPDs with efficient long-wavelength RTP emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Cleavage of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 Bond for Lignin Depolymerization via Paired&#8208;Electrolysis in an Undivided Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the lignin (models) depolymerization and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in a selective and energy&#8208;effective manner.







Abstract
The cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds is one of the most promising strategies for lignin&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, current catalytic system capable of selectively breaking C&#8722;O bonds in lignin often requires a precious metal catalyst and/or harsh conditions such as high&#8208;pressure H2 and elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a novel protocol of paired electrolysis to effectively cleave the C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 bond of lignin model compounds and real lignin at room temperature and ambient pressure. For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in an energy&#8208;effective manner. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, remarkable yield with excellent chemoselectivity, and feasibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that indirect H* (chemical absorbed hydrogen) reduction instead of direct electron transfer might be the pathway for the cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage.

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Tailored F/N Hybrid Polymers by Using Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;controlled radical copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and N&#8208;vinylamides has been developed with fluorinated thiocarbamate and organocatalyst under mild conditions. This work enables on&#8208;demand synthesis of F/N hybrid polymers as versatile and functional structures that could be readily transformed via chain&#8208;extensions and post&#8208;modifications, facilitating the in situ formation of polymeric interphase layers on Li metal anodes.







Abstract
Controlled radical copolymerizations present attractive avenues to obtain polymers with complicated compositions and sequences. In this work, we report the development of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed controlled copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and acyclic N&#8208;vinylamides for the first time. The approach enables the on&#8208;demand synthesis of a broad scope of amide&#8208;functionalized main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers via novel fluorinated thiocarbamates, facilitating regulations over chemical compositions and alternating fractions by rationally selecting comonomer pairs and ratios. This method allows temporally controlled chain&#8208;growth by external light, and maintains high chain&#8208;end fidelity that promotes facile preparation of block sequences. Notably, the obtained F/N hybrid polymers, upon hydrolysis, afford free amino&#8208;substituted fluoropolymers versatile for post modifications toward various functionalities (e.g., amide, sulfonamide, carbamide, thiocarbamide). We further demonstrate the in situ formation of polymer networks with desirable properties as protective layers on lithium metal anodes, presenting a promising avenue for advancing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Cage Membranes Constructed Using Fortified Intermolecular Interactions for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;linked crystalline free&#8208;standing porous organic cage (POC) membranes were constructed via interfacial polymerization at room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions for molecular sieving. The crystalline POC membranes were fabricated by fortifying intermolecular interactions through the induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Among the various types of materials with intrinsic porosity, porous organic cages (POCs) are distinctive as discrete molecules that possess intrinsic cavities and extrinsic channels capable of facilitating molecular sieving. However, the fabrication of POC membranes remains highly challenging due to the weak noncovalent intermolecular interactions and most reported POCs are powders. In this study, we constructed crystalline free&#8208;standing porous organic cage membranes by fortifying intermolecular interactions through the induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To elucidate the driving forces behind, a series of terephthaldehyde building blocks containing different substitutions were reacted with flexible triamine under different conditions via interfacial polymerization (IP). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that intramolecular hydrogen bonding can significantly boost the intermolecular interactions. The resulting membranes exhibited fast solvent permeance and high rejection of dyes not only in water, but also in organic solvents. In addition, the membrane demonstrated excellent performance in precise molecular sieving in organic solvents. This work opens an avenue to designing and fabricating free&#8208;standing membranes composed of porous organic materials for efficient molecular sieving.

A tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as high voltage, high energy density, and stable catholyte for nonaqueous redox flow battery.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with high energy densities are essential for efficient and sustainable long&#8208;term energy storage on a grid scale. To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as a high energy density catholyte was developed. A synergistic approach to the molecular design of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was applied, with the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, which enhance its solubility in organic carbonate electrolytes, and a perfluoro (PerF) group to increase its redox potential. When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two&#8208;electron&#8208;active (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56&#8197;V for the first redox process and 3.92&#8197;V for the second redox process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|(PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF batteries, with concentrations of 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94&#8201;% (99.87&#8201;% per cycle, 97.52&#8201;% per day) and 90&#8201;% (99.93&#8201;% per cycle, 99.16&#8201;% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38&#8201;% and 98.35&#8201;%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129&#8197;mW/cm2. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/L (100&#8197;Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75&#8197;M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96&#8197;Wh/L (150&#8197;Wh/L theoretical).

Covalently modifiable surface terminations distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials and define their intrinsic properties. This minireview highlights recent advances in MXenes with uniform inorganic or organic surface terminations and provides perspectives on future opportunities and challenges in this field.







Abstract
Surface chemistry of MXenes is of great interest as the terminations can define the intrinsic properties of this family of materials. The diverse and tunable terminations also distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials. Conventional fluoride&#8208;containing reagents etching approaches resulted in MXenes with mixed fluoro&#8208;, oxo&#8208;, and hydroxyl surface groups. The relatively strong chemical bonding of MXenes&#8217; surface metal atoms with oxygen and fluorine makes post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications of such MXenes unfavorable. In this minireview, we focus on the recent advances in MXenes with uniform surface terminations. Unconventional methods, including Lewis acidic molten salt etching (LAMS) and bottom&#8208;up direct synthesis, have been proven successful in producing halide&#8208;terminated MXenes. These synthetic strategies have opened new possibilities for MXenes because weaker surface chemical bonds in halide&#8208;terminated MXenes facilitate post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications. Both computational and experimental results on surface termination&#8208;dependent properties are summarized and discussed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting research field.

         <title>Understanding Ligand Effects on Bielectronic Transitions: Chemo&#8208; and Electroreduction of Rhodium Bis(Diphosphine) Complexes to Low Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;electron reduction to low&#8208;valent rhodium &#8722;I is underpinned by structural rearrangements that defines whether the redox transitions are stepwise or in a bielectronic fashion. Study of a parametrized series of Rh bis(diphosphine) complexes identifies how ligand parameters influence this behaviour, whereas an expedient computed electronic parameter allows correlating electronics and geometrics with redox potentials.







Abstract
Rhodium complexes in the &#8722;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood. Herein, we investigate the two&#8208;electron reduction of a parameterized series of bis(diphosphine) Rh complexes [Rh(dxpy)2]NTf2 (x=P&#8208;substituent, y=alkanediyl bridging P atoms). Through (electro)reductions from the RhI parents, Rh&#8722;I d10&#8208;complexes were obtained and characterized spectroscopically, including 103Rh NMR data. The reductive steps convolute with structural rearrangements from square planar to tetrahedral coordination. We found that the extent of these reorganisations defines whether the first E0(RhI/0) and second E0(Rh0/&#8722;I) reduction potentials are normally ordered, leading to monoelectronic stepwise transitions, or inverted, giving bielectronic events. Reductionist approaches based on Hammett parameters or the P&#8722;Rh&#8208;P bite angles provide only partial correlations with the redox potentials. However, we identified the C&#8722;O stretch of analogue diphosphine complexes as an expedient computational parameter that enables these correlations through both electronic and geometric features, even in a predictive manner. Gaining control over two&#8208;electron reduction behaviors through rationalized ligand effects has potential impact beyond Rh complexes, for molecular and enzymatic metal sites commonly exhibiting bielectronic transitions.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Like Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Materials Based on Polyfluorinated Imidazolium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this communication, we report two novel intrinsically liquid crystalline metal halide perovskite&#8208;like materials by utilizing fluorinated ionic liquid crystalline (FILC) mesogens based on polyfluorinated alkylimidazolium cations. Manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions were found to be essential for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of the perovskite&#8208;like structures. This study may pave the way towards a new class of perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.







Abstract
Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskites (HOIHPs) represent an emerging class of semiconducting materials, widely employed in a variety of optoelectronic applications. Despite their skyrocket growth in the last decade, a detailed understanding on their structure&#8211;property relationships is still missing. In this communication, we report two unprecedented perovskite&#8208;like materials based on polyfluorinated imidazolium cations. The two materials show thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior resulting in the emergence of stable mesophases. The manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions are shown to be meaningful for the stabilization of both the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of these perovskite&#8208;like materials. Moreover, the structure of the incorporated imidazolium cation was found to tune the properties of the liquid crystalline phase. Collectively, these results may pave the way for the design of a new class of halide perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.

         <title>Development of Iron&#8208;Based Single Atom Materials for General and Efficient Synthesis of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;based single atoms (Fe&#8208;SACs) as reductive amination catalysts have been prepared by the pyrolysis of Fe&#8208;nitrogen complexes on SiO2 and subsequent removal of silica. Applying these Fe&#8208;SACs, all kinds of amines including N&#8208;methylated products, amino acid esters, amino acid amides and selected drug molecules are synthesized starting from inexpensive and easily accessible carbonyl compounds and ammonia or amines in presence of molecular hydrogen.







Abstract
Earth abundant metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with highly active and at the same time stable isolated metal sites constitute a key factor for the advancement of sustainable and cost&#8208;effective chemical synthesis. In particular, the development of more practical, and durable iron&#8208;based materials is of central interest for organic synthesis, especially for the preparation of chemical products related to life science applications. Here, we report the preparation of Fe&#8208;single atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) entrapped in N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon support with unprecedented potential in the preparation of different kinds of amines, which represent privileged class of organic compounds and find increasing application in daily life. The optimal Fe&#8208;SACs allow for the reductive amination of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with ammonia and amines to produce diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amines including N&#8208;methylated products as well as drugs, agrochemicals, and other biomolecules (amino acid esters and amides) utilizing green hydrogen.

         <title>Encapsulation of Sn Sub&#8208;nanoclusters in Multichannel Carbon Matrix for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability (331 mAh g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles at 100 mA g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of 167 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.4 A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial&#8208;coupled Ampere&#8208;level Electrochemical Propylene Epoxidation over RuO2/Ti Hollow&#8208;fiber Penetration Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) provides a promising route for ecofriendly propylene oxide (PO) production, instantly generating active halogen/oxygen species to alleviate chloride contamination inherent in traditional PER. However, the complex processes and unsatisfactory PO yield for current electrochemical PER falls short of meeting industrial application requirements. Herein, a spatial&#8208;coupling strategy over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) is adopted to facilitate efficient PO production, significantly improving PER performance to the ampere level (achieving over 80% PO faradaic efficiency and a maximum PO current density of 859 mA cm&#8722;2). The synergetic combination of the penetration effect of HPE and the spatial&#8208;coupled reaction sequence, enables the realization of ampere&#8208;level PO production with high specificity, exhibiting significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Autoantibodies in the Sera of Pancreatic Cancer Patients Using Engineered MUC1 Glycopeptide Nanoparticle Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. We describe the development of a diagnostic assay based on the detection of tumor&#8208;associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) in the sera using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. The best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers.







Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic approaches to identify the disease as early as possible. We have developed a diagnostic assay for pancreatic cancer based on the detection of naturally occurring tumor associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. We used a structure&#8208;guided approach to develop unnatural glycopeptides as model antigens for tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. We designed a collection of 13 glycopeptides to bind either SM3 or 5E5, two monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes known to recognize tumor associated MUC1. Glycopeptide binding to SM3 or 5E5 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These model antigens were conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in a dot&#8208;blot assay to detect autoantibodies in serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Nanoparticle probes with glycopeptides displaying the SM3 epitope did not have diagnostic potential. Instead, nanoparticle probes displaying glycopeptides with high affinity for 5E5 could discriminate between cancer patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19&#8208;9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

         <title>Size&#8208;Increased All&#8208;Phenylene Molecular Spoked Wheels &#8211; A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A lateral expansion of molecular spoked wheels (MSWs) based on an all&#8208;phenylene backbone is described. The MSWs contain a central hub, six spokes and a rim that is formed by a sixfold Yamamoto coupling of the respective non&#8208;cyclized dodecabromo precursor yielding MSWs with up to 30 phenylene rings in the perimeter. Attempts to prepare compounds of such size without flexible side groups at the spokes were unsuccessful, most probably due to an aggregation and accompanying oligomerization of the precursors during the cyclization. To overcome these problems, fluorene units are inserted into the spokes. These contain additional alkyl chains and lead to a curvature of the wheels. Quantum chemical calculations on the mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling leads to geometry and strain&#8208;related criteria for the successful rim closure to the respective MSW. Subsequently, MSWs are prepared with four and even six phenylene units at each edge of the hexagonal wheels. The resulting MSWs are characterized by spectroscopic methods, and additionally some of them are visualized via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</dc:description>

         <title>[19]Starphene: Combined In&#8208;Solution and On&#8208;Surface Synthesis Towards the Largest Starphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starphenes are structurally appealing three&#8208;fold symmetric polycyclic aromatic compounds with potential interesting applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This family of star&#8208;shaped polyarenes can be regarded as three acenes that are connected through a single benzene ring. In fact, just like acenes, unsubstituted large starphenes are poorly soluble and highly reactive molecules under ambient conditions making their synthesis difficult to achieve. Herein, we report two different synthetic strategies to obtain a starphene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining solution&#8208;phase and on&#8208;surface synthesis. [19]Starphene was characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) showing a remarkable small HOMO&#8208;LUMO transport gap (0.9 eV).</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Macrocyclic Neurotensin Receptor Type 2 (NTS2) Opioid&#8208;Free Analgesics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The opioid crisis has highlighted the urgent need to develop non&#8208;opioid alternatives for managing pain, with an effective, safe, and non&#8208;addictive pharmacotherapeutic profile. Using an extensive structure&#8208;activity relationship approach, here we have identified a new series of highly selective neurotensin receptor type 2 (NTS2) macrocyclic compounds that exert potent, opioid&#8208;independent analgesia in various experimental pain models. To our knowledge, the constrained macrocycle in which the Ile12 residue of NT(7&#8208;12) was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization is the most selective analog targeting NTS2 identified to date (Ki 2.9 nM), showing 30,000&#8208;fold selectivity over NTS1. Of particular importance, this macrocyclic analog is also able to potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine in a dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Exerting complementary analgesic actions via distinct mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, NTS2&#8208;selective macrocycles can therefore be exploited as opioid&#8208;free analgesics or as opioid&#8208;sparing therapeutics, offering superior pain relief with reduced adverse effects to pain patients.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Deuterated and tritiated analogs of drugs are valuable compounds for pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this work, we present a novel hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of drugs using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. Aromatic C&#8211;H activation is achieved by a commercially available pyridine ligand. Using the most convenient and cheapest deuterium source, D2O, as the only solvent 39 pharmaceuticals were labelled with clean reaction profiles and high deuterium uptakes. Additionally, we describe the first application of non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd catalysis for H/T exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source, demonstrating the applicability to the synthesis of radiotracers.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a &#8220;Radical Amino Ester&#8221; chiral auxiliary, we achieve asymmetric acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangements. This approach efficiently constructs &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides via a HAT strategy.







Abstract
The radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non&#8208;expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom&#8211;transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C&#8722;H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7&#8201;:&#8201;1 to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Axial Ligand Enables Synthesis of Allenylsilane through Dirhodium(II) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ON&#8208;OFF effect of amine ligand enabled Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8242;&#8208;type silylation of propargyl ester bearing a terminal alkyne moiety using hydrosilane was achieved. The fine&#8208;tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the improvement of reactivity. The tertiary amine plays a significant role in assisting the formation of the Rh&#8722;Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) mechanism and facilitating &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination.







Abstract
Described herein is a dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed silylation of propargyl esters with hydrosilanes, using tertiary amines as axial ligands. By adopting this strategy, a range of versatile and useful allenylsilanes can be achieved with good yields. This reaction not only represents a SN2&#8242;&#8208;type silylation of the propargyl derivatives bearing a terminal alkyne moiety to synthesize allenylsilanes from simple hydrosilanes, but also represents a new application of dirhodium(II) complexes in catalytic transformation of carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond. The highly functionalized allenylsilanes that are produced can be transformed into a series of synthetically useful organic molecules. In this reaction, an intriguing ON&#8208;OFF effect of the amine ligand was observed. The reaction almost did not occur (OFF) without addition of Lewis base amine ligand. However, the reaction took place smoothly (ON) after addition of only catalytic amount of amine ligand. Detailed mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the reactivity can be delicately improved by the use of tertiary amine. The fine&#8208;tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the formation of the Rh&#8722;Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) mechanism and facilitating &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts Allenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This enantioconvergent reaction utilizes racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile and shows compatibility with a variety of electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &gt;99.5:0.5 e.r.) 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4&#8208;carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron&#8208;rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in ortho&#8208; and even meta&#8208;selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuning Localized Excitons Toward Enhanced Emission, Photocurrent Enhancement and Piezochromism in Unconventional ACI&#8208;Type 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous enhancement of free excitons (FEs) emission and self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emission remains greatly challenging because of the radiative pathway competition. Here, a significant fluorescence improvement, associated with the radiative recombination of both FEs and STEs is firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4 (ACA=acetamidinium) crystals with {PbI6} octahedron units, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Note that (ACA)(MA)PbI4 exhibits a 91.5&#8208;fold emission enhancement and considerable piezochromism from green to red in a mild pressure interval of 1 atm to 2.5 GPa. The substantial distortion of both individual halide octahedron and the Pb&#8208;I&#8208;Pb angles between two halide octahedra under high pressure indeed determines the pressure&#8208;tuning localized excitons behavior. Upon higher pressure, photocurrent enhancement is also observed, which is attributed to the promoted electronic connectivity in (ACA)(MA)PbI4. The anisotropic compaction reduces the distance between neighboring organic molecules and {PbI6} octahedra, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions. This work not only offers a deep understanding of the structure&#8208;optical relationships of ACI&#8208;type perovskites, but also presents insights into breaking the limits of luminescent efficiency by pressure&#8208;suppressed nonradiative recombination.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualization of Electrooxidation on Palladium Single Crystal Surfaces via In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrooxidation of catalyst surfaces is across various electrocatalytic reactions, directly impacting their activity, stability and selectivity. Precisely characterizing the electrooxidation on well&#8208;defined surfaces is essential to understanding electrocatalytic reactions comprehensively. Herein, we employed in situ Raman spectroscopy to monitor the electrooxidation process of palladium single crystal. Our findings reveal that the Pd surface's initial electrooxidation process involves forming *OH intermediate and ClO4&#8208; ions facilitate the deprotonation process, leading to the formation of PdOx. Subsequently, under deep electrooxidation potential range, the oxygen atoms within PdOx contribute to creating surface&#8208;bound peroxide species, ultimately resulting in oxygen generation. The adsorption strength of *OH and the coverage of ClO4&#8208; can be adjusted by the controllable electronic effect, resulting in different oxidation rates. This study offers valuable insights into elucidating the electrooxidation mechanisms underlying a range of electrocatalytic reactions, thereby contributing to the rational design of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Catalyst Mimicking the Two&#8208;Component Architecture of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen sources involves competitive adsorption of different intermediates and multiple electron and proton transfers, presenting grand challenges in catalyst design. In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;S&#8211;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8211;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37 mg L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97% for over 200 hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8211;S&#8211;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Electronic Interactions Promoted Activation for Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia over Ag&#8208;modified Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers a promising pathway for ammonia synthesis. The interfacial electronic interactions (IEIs) can regulate the physicochemical capabilities of catalysts in electrochemical applications, while the impact of IEIs on electrocatalytic NRA remains largely unexplored in current literature. In this study, the high&#8208;efficiency electrode Ag&#8208;modified Co3O4 (Ag1.5Co/CC) is prepared for NRA in neutral media, exhibiting an impressive nitrate conversion rate of 96.86%, ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 96.11%, and ammonia selectivity of ~100%. Notably, the intrinsic activity of Ag1.5Co/CC is ~81 times that of Ag nanoparticles (Ag/CC). Multiple characterizations and theoretical computations confirm the presence of IEIs between Ag and Co3O4, which stabilize the CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4 and significantly promote the adsorption of reactants (NO3&#8722;) as well as intermediates (NO2&#8722; and NO), while suppressing the Heyrovsky step, thereby improving nitrate electroreduction efficiency. Furthermore, our findings reveal a synergistic effect between different active sites that enables tandem catalysis for NRA: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites while NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to ammonia at Co sites. This study offers valuable insights for the development of high&#8208;performance NRA electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Hydroxyallylation of Cyclopropenes with Cyclopropanols via NHC Catalysis of Transient Organozinc Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stereoselective hydroxyallylation reaction of cyclopropenes with cyclopropanols is achieved under zinc&#8208;mediated conditions, affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. A racemic variant of the reaction is synergistically promoted by catalytic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and organic base, whereas chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC enables a catalytic enantioselective variant. The reaction likely involves the generation of enolized zinc homoenolate via ring&#8208;opening of zinc cyclopropoxide and enolization of the resulting homoenolate, followed by its addition to the cyclopropene as a prochiral allylzinc nucleophile. Our mechanistic investigations highlighted the transient nature of enolized homoenolate, which, once generated from thermodynamically predominant cyclopropoxide, immediately proceeds to allylzincation with cyclopropene. The NHC not only promotes the rate&#8208;determining generation of enolized homoenolate but also engages in the allylzincation process. The resulting cyclopropylzinc species undergoes partial in situ protonation while partially remaining intact, thereby leaving an opportunity for trapping with an external electrophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in&#8208;depth analysis of the two&#8208;dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Involved Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Triple&#8208;Bond Monomer Based Polymerization toward Processable Functional Polyamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyamide plays a pivotal role in engineering thermoplastics. Constrained by the harsh conditions and arduous procedures for its industrial synthesis, developing facile synthesis of polyamides is still challengeable and holds profound significance. Herein, we successfully utilized water as one of the monomers to synthesize functional polyamides under ambient conditions. A powerful multicomponent polymerization of water, isocyanides, and chlorooximes was established in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Soluble and thermally stable polyamides with high weight&#8208;average molecular weights (up to 53900) were obtained in excellent yields (up to 95%). The polymerization exhibits unique polymerization&#8208;induced emission characteristics, successfully converting non&#8208;emissive monomers into unconventional emissive polymers. Notably, the resultant polyamides could undergo effective post&#8208;modification via the hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction. By incorporating various functional groups into the polyamide, its emission color could be fine&#8208;tuned from blue to green and to red. Remarkably, the refractive index (n) of the polyamide at 589 nm could be increased from 1.6173 to 1.7227 and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers after post&#8208;modification, and its micron&#8208;thick films exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region. Thus, this work not only establishes a powerful polymerization toward novel polyamides but also opens up an avenue for their versatile functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Reconfiguration of Supramolecular Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: From Solution Self&#8208;Assembly to Co&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Assistant Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out switch of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expansion of Structure Property in Cascade Nazarov Cyclization and Cycloexpansion&#160;Reaction to Diverse Angular Tricycles and Total Synthesis of Nominal Madreporanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction was developed for the precise synthesis of the angularly fused M/5/N (M = 5, 6; N = 4&#8722;9, 13) tricyclic skeletons. The prioritized expansion of the first ring played a critical role in the transformations, due to the release of ring strain, and the nature of the substituents present on the substrate is another influencing factor. This pioneering cascade reaction features broad substrates scope (33 examples), short reaction time, exceptional yields (up to 95%), and remarkable regioselectivities (&gt; 20:1). Exploiting the synthetic application of this cascade reaction, we successfully executed a succinct total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. We introduce a novel cleavable&#160;&#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester (DXE) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst&#8208;free reaction of&#160;&#946;&#8208;ketoester and 1,3&#8208;diol, to cross&#8208;link poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for the formation of high&#8208;performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. PVA, modified with&#160;&#946;&#8208;ketoester through the transesterification reaction with excess tert&#8208;butyl acetoacetate, cross&#8208;links&#160;with the unmodified 1,3&#8208;diols within PVA itself upon thermal treatment. Cross&#8208;linking improves PVA&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young&#8217;s modulus and toughness that reach up to 656 MPa and 84 MJ cm&#8208;3, i.e. 3&#8208; and 12&#8208;fold those of linear PVA. Thermal treatment of the cross&#8208;linked PVA under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, allowing the almost PVA excellent recovery (&gt; 90%) . In the absence of thermal or acidic treatment, cross&#8208;linked PVA maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of PVA is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, PVA&#8208;based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross&#8208;linked by the DXE linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the PVA and the fillers.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Indolyl Ketosulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent advancements in catalytic synthesis of axial chirality, reports on non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers remain limited because of the stringent steric requirements necessary to establish effective rotational brakes. In this study, we present a novel class of monoaryl atropisomers, indolyl ketosulfoxonium ylides, and describe an organocatalytic protocol for their synthesis. We discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) serves as an effective catalyst for the highly enantioselective iodination of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a strong preference for the intended iodination process over the competing protonation was observed. Subsequently, intramolecular amide cyclization enabled the formation of sterically congested indole fragments. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the products was demonstrated by showcasing versatile transformations into other chiral scaffolds with complete retention of optical purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modularization of Immobilized Multienzyme Cascades for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;enzyme cascade has been developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective C&#8722;H amination of aromatic alkanes by constructing two immobilized bienzymatic modules and integrating them in tandem packed&#8208;bed reactors. The resulting flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multienzyme cascades (MECs) have gained much attention in synthetic chemistry but remain far from being a reliable synthetic tool. Here we report a four&#8208;enzyme cascade comprising a cofactor&#8208;independent and a cofactor self&#8208;sustaining bienzymatic modules for the enantioselective benzylic C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes, a challenging transformation from bulk chemicals to high value&#8208;added chiral amines. The two modules were subsequently optimized by enzyme co&#8208;immobilization with microenvironmental tuning, and finally integrated in a gas&#8208;liquid segmented flow system, resulting in simultaneous improvements in enzyme performance, mass transfer, system compatibility, and productivity. The flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is a 90&#8208;fold increase over the highest value previously reported.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are employed to covalently anchor Au and Ag atoms, resulting in bimetallic random copolymers, as reported by Ali Nazemi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409800). When these polymers are used as substrates and undergo reduction, they produce polyNHC&#8208;capped alloy and core&#8208;shell AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles, whose structures are influenced by the proportion of each metal in the metallopolymer. These nanomaterials have been shown to be effective in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Membrane Enthalpy and Entropy Barriers towards Superior Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous TpPa COF interlayer is introduced to regulate the architecture and charge properties of the CAPEI selective layer, culminating in a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. Consequently, M&#8208;TpPaCAPEI exhibits superior separation performance to that of M&#8208;CAPEI and other advanced monovalent ion selective membranes for Li+/Mg2+ separation.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#916;H) and entropy barrier (&#916;S) for designing next&#8208;generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule&#8208;absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. This recorded performance with a Li+/Mg2+ perm&#8208;selectivity of 25.50 and a Li+ flux of 1.86&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li+/Mg2+ separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S&#8208;ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A porous TpPa COF interlayer is introduced to regulate the architecture and charge properties of the CAPEI selective layer, culminating in a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, greater &#916;H for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and lower &#916;H for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. Consequently, M-TpPaCAPEI exhibits superior separation performance to that of M-CAPEI and other advanced monovalent ion selective membranes for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sub-nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#916;H) and entropy barrier (&#916;S) for designing next-generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule-absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, greater &#916;H for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and lower &#916;H for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. This recorded performance with a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; perm-selectivity of 25.50 and a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux of 1.86&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S-ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Use of Photocycloaddition Reactions to Drive Mechanical Motions Resembling Humanoid Movements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline molecular material with olefinic groups has been used to achieve photomechanical motion in both single crystals and single&#8208;crystal composite films. This dimerization of dipyridyl ligands by [2+2] photocycloaddition introduces strain within the crystal, resulting in a variety of fast, flexible and continuous photomechanical including reversible bending and curling, movements that resemble a human performing various gymnastic exercises.







Abstract
With the aim of producing a photomechanical material for incorporation in soft microrobots, a one&#8208;dimensional diene coordination polymer (CP) [Cd(F&#8208;bpeb)(3&#8208;CBA)2]n (CP1, F&#8208;bpeb=4,4&#8242;&#8208;((1E,1&#8242;E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)bis(ethene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diyl))dipyridine, 3&#8208;HCBA=3&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid) was synthesized and characterized. Irradiation of CP1 with ultraviolet (UV) or visible light causes [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions resulting in the introduction of crystal strain which triggers various types of crystal movements. Composite films of CP1&#8208;PVA (SC) fabricated by dispersing CP1 crystals into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution allow amplification of the crystal movement so that the film strips exhibit fast and flexible curling upon photoirradiation. The composite films may be cut into long rectangular strips and folded to simulate soft microrobots which exhibit a variety of fast, flexible and continuous photomechanical movements resembling a human performing various gymnastic exercises.

         <title>From Coordination to &#960;&#8208;Hole Chemistry of Transition Metals: Metalloporphyrins as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this combined experimental (X&#8208;ray structure analysis) and computational (DFT&#8208;D3 calculations) study we have systematically evaluated the &#960;&#8208;hole donor ability of elements across Groups 9 to 12 using metalated porphyrins (ppys) as model systems. The results obtained will make impact in the fields supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and catalysis, where noncovalent Lewis Base&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Metal interactions play a crucial role.







Abstract
Herein we have evidenced the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;hole Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal noncovalent interactions (NCIs) involving elements from groups 9, 11 and 12. More in detail, M (M=Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) containing porphyrins have been synthesized and their supramolecular assemblies structurally characterized by means of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hirshfeld surface analyses, revealing the formation of directional Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M contacts in addition to ancillary hydrogen bond and lone pair&#8208;&#960; bonds. Computations at the PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory revealed the &#960;&#8208;hole nature of the Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction. In addition, the physical nature of these NCIs was studied using Quantum Chemistry methodologies, providing evidence of &#960;&#8208;hole Spodium and Regium bonds in Zn2+ and Cu2+ porphyrins, in addition to unveiling the presence of a &#960;&#8208;hole for group 9 (Co2+). On the other hand, group 10 (Ni2+) acted as both electron donor and acceptor moiety without showing an electropositive &#960;&#8208;hole. Owing to the underexplored potential of &#960;&#8208;hole interactions in transition metal chemistry, we believe the results reported herein will be useful in supramolecular chemistry, organometallics, and solid&#8208;state chemistry by i) putting under the spotlight the &#960;&#8208;hole chemistry involving first row transition metals and ii) unlocking a new tool to direct the self&#8208;assembly of metalloporphyrins.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Dearomative Construction of 2D/3D Frameworks from Quinolines via Nucleophilic Addition/Borate&#8208;Mediated Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative construction of 2D/3D frameworks from 2D aromatics is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Ken Tanaka, Yuki Nagashima et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202403461). The cover mage shows transformations from 2D quinolines into triply&#8208;fused 2D/3D rings through nucleophilic addition, borate complex formation, and photocycloaddition. Mechanistic studies revealed that the borate complex accelerates the photocycloaddition and suppresses rearomatization in the excited state.

         <title>Front Cover: Unlocking Giant Third&#8208;Order Optical Nonlinearity in (MA)2CuX4 through Introducing Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion into a Mott&#8211;Hubbard system emerges as an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical materials. In their Research Article (e202406941), Chi Zhang, Zhipeng Huang employ lattice distortion to provide two distinct transition pathways with varying probabilities, while the Mott&#8211;Hubbard configuration ensures the transition sequence. This synergistic design unveils the excited&#8208;state absorption in (MA)2CuX4, enabling these materials to simultaneously exhibit a large nonlinear absorption coefficient and substantial modulation depth.

         <title>Back Cover: Electrochemical Monitoring of Real&#8208;Time Vesicle Dynamics Induced by Tau in a Confined Nanopipette</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette method was developed to electrochemically monitor single vesicle dynamics induced by lipid&#8208;tau interactions. To mimic the lipid environment in synapses, model vesicles and a modified lipid layer were confined within a nanopipette, as reported by Ru&#8208;Jia Yu, Yi&#8208;Tao Long et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202406677). Characteristic ionic current oscillations were recorded and could be used to evaluate the binding affinity of tau protein, indicating that phosphorylated tau inhibits vesicle dynamics through strong interactions with synaptic vesicles.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Tetra&#8208;substituted Morpholinone and Benzoxazinone Lactols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. DFT studies identify an N&#8208;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction as key to producing products in highly enantioenriched form.







Abstract
The development of methods to allow the selective acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of tetra&#8208;substituted lactols is a recognised synthetic challenge. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields (up to 89&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er) observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating substitution at N(4) and C(2), di&#8208; and spirocyclic substitution at C(5) and C(6), as well as benzannulation (&gt;35&#8197;examples in total). The DKR process is amenable to scale&#8208;up on a 1&#8197;g laboratory scale. The factors leading to high selectivity in this DKR process have been probed through computation, with an N&#8722;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction identified as key to producing ester products in highly enantioenriched form.

         <title>Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Polyoxometalates by Bridging with Mixed&#8208;Valent Multinuclear Platinum Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three paramagnetic one&#8208;dimensional assembles were successfully obtained from spherical polyoxometalates and multinuclear platinum complexes. Each assemble has mixed&#8208;valent metal oxidation states and unpaired electrons on metal d orbitals, showing semiconducting behaviours, which was 105 times greater than that of the parent polyoxometalates.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanosized molecular metal oxide anion clusters with tuneable structures and functionalities, and they exhibit a redox chemistry and catalytic activity in multielectron redox processes. These are typically poor electrical conductors (&lt;10&#8722;10&#8201;Scm&#8722;1), which is attributed to negligible electronic interactions among anions in the solid state. Since the reduced electrons on the d0 metals in POMs are delocalized, electrical conductivity was improved when judicious pathways for the electrons were created by bridging the POMs. Utilized with the electronic interactions between bridging oxygen atoms with the highest occupied molecular orbital in the POMs and the metal dz2 orbitals in the multinuclear platinum complexes, and three mixed&#8208;valent assemblies were synthesized and characterized. Simply mixing Keggin&#8208;type or Dawson&#8208;type POMs with tetranuclear or trinuclear platinum complexes in solution afforded three single crystals, and all three compounds were paramagnetic with mixed oxidation states and better conductivities at room temperature than the parent compounds.

         <title>Direct Microenvironment Modulation of CO2 Electroreduction: Negatively Charged Ag Sites Going beyond Catalytic Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported &#8220;nc&#8208;Ag&#8221; active sites featuring both the high intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. The sites could exert long&#8208;range electrostatic forces to regulate interfacial H2O and CO2 in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This work opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating the intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active sites may also boost catalytic performance. Here we designed &#8220;negatively charged Ag (nc&#8208;Ag)&#8221; active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only mediate the surface processes by bonding with the intermediates), the nc&#8208;Ag sites could also manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with a CO faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

         <title>Fabrication of Azacrown Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cathode Performance in Aqueous Ni&#8722;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical linker derived from azacrown ether, utilized in COF synthesis via reticular synthesis. The embedded crown ether moieties and imine linkages faciltate Ni2+ ions immobilization via post&#8208;modification. The resulting composite COF materials exhibit high nickel loading capacity, maintaining porosity and crystallinity, demonstrate promise as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries, offering high discharge capacity and exceptional cycling stability.







Abstract
Crown ethers (CEs), known for their exceptional host&#8211;guest complexation, offer potential as linkers in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for enhanced performance in catalysis and host&#8211;guest binding. However, their highly flexible conformation and low symmetry limit the diversity of CE&#8208;derived COFs. Here, we introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown&#8208;6 (TPy18C6), for COF fabrication (ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni2+ ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni2+&#8208;doped COFs (Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 8&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and exceptional cycling stability (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic&#8208;synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.

         <title>Reconstruction of Ferromagnetic/non&#8208;magnetic Cobalt&#8208;based Electrocatalysts under Gradient Magnetic Fields for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/non&#8208;magnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8208;shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores&#8217; local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells&#8217; surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128% at 1.63 V and an overpotential reduction by 28 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100 h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.</dc:description>

These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen-containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128% at 1.63 V and an overpotential reduction by 28 mV at 10 mA cm-2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100 h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2 products of high economic value provides a promising strategy to realize resourceful CO2 utilization. Rational design and construct dual sites to realize the CO protonation and C&#8208;C coupling to unravel their structure&#8208;performance correlation is of great significance in catalysing electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions. Herein, Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites with different site distance coordinated by halogen at the first&#8208;shell are constructed and shows a higher intramolecular electron redispersion and coordination symmetry configurations. The long&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu (Cu&#8208;I&#8208;Cu) dual sites show an enhanced Faraday efficiency of C2 products, up to 74.1%, and excellent stability. In addition, the linear relationships that the long&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu dual site is accelerated to C2H4 generation and short&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu (Cu&#8208;Cl&#8208;Cu) dual site is beneficial for C2H5OH formation are disclosed. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and theoretical calculations manifest that long&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites can weaken reaction energy barriers of CO hydrogenation and C&#8208;C coupling, as well as accelerating deoxygenation of *CH2CHO. This study uncovers the exploitation of site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent electrochemical property to steer the CO2 reduction pathway, as well as a potential generic tactic to target C2 synthesis by constructing the desired Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites.</dc:description>

         <title>CdS Quantum Dot Gels as a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalyst for C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdS quantum dot gels are potent direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalysts for C&#8722;H bond activation, in which photoexcited CdS directly attracts a hydrogen atom from a C&#8722;H substrate to generate a neutral radical.







Abstract
Here, we report CdS quantum dot (QD) gels, a three&#8208;dimensional network of interconnected CdS QDs, as a new type of direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalyst for C&#8722;H activation. We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;&#8208;amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds. Its C&#8722;H activation ability imparts a broad substrate and reaction scope. The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8722;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d&#8208;HAT mechanism. This d&#8208;HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8722;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &#945;=0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation.
