         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Gas Three&#8208;Phase Indirect Electrolysis Enabled by Affinity Auxiliary Imparted Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system has been developed based on a covalent organic framework (Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu) as heterogeneous redox mediator for S&#8722;S coupling reaction.







Abstract
The design of efficient heterogeneous redox mediators with favorable affinity to substrate and electrolyte are much desired yet still challenging for the development of indirect electrolysis system. Herein, for the first time, we have developed a solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system based on a covalent organic framework (Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu) as heterogeneous redox mediator for S&#8722;S coupling reaction. Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu with the integration of high porosity, nanorod morphology, abundant hydroxyl groups and active Cu sites is much beneficial for the adsorption/activation of thiols, uniform dispersion and high wettability in electrolyte, and efficient interfacial electron transfer. Notably, Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu as solid&#8208;phase redox mediator exhibits excellent electrocatalytic efficiency for the formation of value&#8208;added liquid&#8208;phase S&#8722;S bond product (yields up to 99&#8201;%) coupling with the generation of gas&#8208;phase product of H2 (~1.40&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), resulting in a powerful three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system. This is the first work about COFs that can be applied in three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system, which might promote the development of porous crystalline materials in this field.

         <title>Cleavage of the Robust Silicon&#8211;Fluorine &#963;&#8208;Bond Allows Silicon&#8211;Carbon Bond Formation: Synthetic Strategies Toward Ortho&#8208;Silyl Aryl Phosphonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, efficient, and metal&#8208;free Si&#8722;C and P&#8722;C bond formation was achieved by cleaving the robust Si&#8722;F &#963;&#8208;bond. Although activation of the Si&#8722;F bond is highly challenging, Si&#8722;F bond cleavage has been accomplished with the assistance of bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids. Various ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates were produced through this three&#8208;component coupling reaction involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides.







Abstract
A straightforward, mild, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component coupling reaction involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides was developed through Si&#8722;F bond activation. Although the Si&#8722;F bond is one of the strongest bonds, Si&#8722;C bond formation via Si&#8722;F bond cleavage with the assistance of bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids has been successfully achieved. This unprecedented strategy provides a facile approach for synthesizing ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates. Notably, this method allows the use of not only dialkylarylsilyl fluorides and diarylalkylsilyl fluorides but also triarylsilyl fluorides as coupling partners, which is uncommon in the field of arylsilane synthesis. Furthermore, a variety of ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates were produced in moderate to good yields with broad functional group tolerance. Additionally, the versatility of ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates was demonstrated by the elaboration of the products into a range of silicon&#8208;containing compounds.

         <title>High Performance Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Polymeric Conductor with Stability to Autoclave Sterilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel donor&#8208;acceptor polymers has been precisely designed and synthesized. Among them gFBT&#8208;g2T showed the highest normalized peak transconductance (gm,norm) of 298&#177;10.4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a product of charge&#8208;carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance (&#956;C*) of 847&#8197;F&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which was comparable with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials. gFBT&#8208;g2T also exhibited exceptional ultra&#8208;high temperature stability, maintaining the outstanding electrochemical performance even after undergoing the standard autoclave steam sterilization procedure.







Abstract
We present a series of newly developed donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymers designed specifically for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) synthesized by a straightforward route. All polymers exhibited accumulation mode behavior in OECT devices, and tuning of the donor comonomer resulted in a three&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in transconductance. The best polymer gFBT&#8208;g2T, exhibited normalized peak transconductance (gm,norm) of 298&#177;10.4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with a corresponding product of charge&#8208;carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance, &#956;C*, of 847&#8201;F&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and a &#956; of 5.76&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, amongst the highest reported to date. Furthermore, gFBT&#8208;g2T exhibited exceptional temperature stability, maintaining the outstanding electrochemical performance even after undergoing a standard (autoclave) high pressure steam sterilization procedure. Steam treatment was also found to promote film porosity, with the formation of circular 200&#8211;400&#8197;nm voids. These results demonstrate the potential of gFBT&#8208;g2T in p&#8208;type accumulation mode OECTs, and pave the way for the use in implantable bioelectronics for medical applications.

         <title>As Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Meets with Noncovalent Conformational Locks: Subtly Regulating NIR&#8208;II Molecules for Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Navigated Synergistic Therapies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ingenious integration of NoCLs into AIE&#8208;active molecular architecture endows the constructed molecule TEEITQ with superior absorption capacity, bright NIR&#8208;II emission and prominent photothermal effect simultaneously. Those features enable them to perform well in the NIR&#8208;II FLI/PAI/PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided chemo&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy towards cancer.







Abstract
Phototheranostics is growing into a sparking frontier in disease treatment. Developing single molecular species synchronously featured by powerful absorption capacity, superior second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence and prominent photothermal conversion ability is highly desirable for phototheranostics, yet remains formidably challenging. In this work, we propose a molecular design philosophy that the integration of noncovalent conformational locks (NoCLs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in a single formulation is able to boost multiple photophysical properties for efficient phototheranostics. The introduction of NoCLs skeleton with conformation&#8208;locking feature in the center of molecular architecture indeed elevates the structural planarity and rigidity, which simultaneously promotes the absorption capacity and bathochromic&#8208;shifts the emission wavelength centered in NIR&#8208;II region. Meanwhile, the AIE tendency mainly originated from flexibly propeller&#8208;like geometry at the ends of molecular architecture eventually endows the molecule with satisfactory emission intensity and photothermal conversion in aggregates. Consequently, by utilizing the optimized molecule, unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemo synergistic therapy is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor ablation.

         <title>The Nature of Structural Defects in ZIF&#8208;8 Revealed with 1H and 31P MAS NMR and X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of experimental techniques including 1H and 31P MAS NMR, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and phosphine molecular probes was used to characterize for the first time the catalytically active defect sites in ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework. These defect sites were found to be represented by Zn&#8722;OH hydroxyl groups with the signal at 0.3 and &#8722;0.7&#8197;ppm (1H MAS NMR) and were found to be of basic nature.







Abstract
The metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) attract interest as potential catalysts whose catalytic properties are driven by defects. Several methods have been proposed for the defects&#8208;inducing synthesis of MOFs. However, the active species formed on the defective sites remain elusive and uncharacterized, as the spectroscopic fingerprints of these species are hidden by the regular structure signals. In this work, we have performed the synthesis of ZIF&#8208;8 MOF with defect&#8208;inducing procedures using fully deuterated 2&#8208;methylimidazolate ligands to enhance the defective sites&#8242; visibility. By combining 1H and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we have found evidence for the presence of different structural hydroxyl Zn&#8722;OH groups in the ZIF&#8208;8 materials. It is demonstrated that the ZIF&#8208;8 defect sites are represented by Zn&#8722;OH hydroxyl groups with the signals at 0.3 and &#8722;0.7&#8197;ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum. These species are of basic nature and may be responsible for the catalytic activity of the ZIF&#8208;8 material.

         <title>Simultaneous Tailoring of Chemical Composition and Morphology Configuration in Metal Hexacyanoferrate for Ultrafast and Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous tailoring of chemical composition and morphology configuration is carried out to design a hollow monoclinic high&#8208;entropy metal hexacyanoferrate assembled by nanocubes to realize ultrafast and durable sodium storage capability as well as comparable capacity.







Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCFs) with adjustable composition and open framework structures have been considered as intriguing cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Exploiting MHCFs with ultrafast and durable sodium storage capability as well as comparable capacity is always a goal that many investigators pursue, but remains challenging. Herein, simultaneous tailoring of chemical composition and morphology configuration is carried out to design a hollow monoclinic high&#8208;entropy MHCF (HMHE&#8208;HCF) assembled by nanocubes for the first time to realize the objective. The &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; of high&#8208;entropy construction, rich sodium content of monoclinic phase, and unique hollow structure endow HMHE&#8208;HCF cathode with fast reaction kinetics and energetically stable performance during continuous charging/discharging processes. As a result, the HMHE&#8208;HCF cathode demonstrates superior rate performance up to an ultra&#8208;high rate of 100&#8197;C (71.1&#8201;% retention to 0.1&#8197;C), and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 77.8&#8201;% over 25,000&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;C, outperforming most reported sodium&#8208;ion cathodes. Further, the HMHE&#8208;HCF//hard carbon full&#8208;cell delivers capacities of 99.0 and 82.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C, respectively, and retains 98.1&#8201;% of the initial capacity after 1,600&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C, demonstrating its potential application for sodium&#8208;ion storage.

This study highlights the crucial role of DFT calculations in screening non&#8208;radioactive lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks for optimal electrochemical CO2 reduction performance. The findings underscore the significant impact of f&#8208;&#960;* orbital interactions in enhancing catalytic efficiency with Lu&#8208;HHTP and selectivity towards methane production.







Abstract
The research on electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (ECR) catalysts using renewable energy is particularly crucial in energy conversion studies, especially for viable hydrocarbon production. This study employs density functional theory calculations to screen a series of non&#8208;radioactive lanthanide two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for product selectivity in ECR. Based on theoretical screening, our focus is on a lutetium (Lu)&#8208;based conducting MOF (Lu&#8208;HHTP), which exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of approximately 77&#8201;% for methane (CH4) production and maintains a stable current density of &#8722;280&#8197;mA/cm2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE. In situ electrochemical experiments and material characterization demonstrate that the Lu sites possess high coordination stability and structural recoverability during catalytic CO2 reduction, attributed to the overlap between Lu&#8242;s f&#8208;orbitals and the &#960;*&#8208;orbitals of the ligand O, and the formation of back bonding orbitals between the f&#8208;orbitals of Lu and the &#960;* orbitals of CO contribute increasing CH4 selectivity and lowering the potential. This study leverages rare&#8208;earth MOF&#8208;type materials, offering a novel approach to addressing low conductivity and stabilizing rare&#8208;earth materials, thereby establishing a theoretical framework for the conversion of linearly adsorbed *CO into hydrocarbons.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Highly Luminescent Cu(I) Metallacycles toward New Luminescent Thermic Tracers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TADF luminescent Cu(I) metallacycle B carrying unusual semi&#8208;bridging aqua ligands has been prepared in a one&#8208;step high&#8208;yield reaction. When B is heated markedly above room temperature, a solid&#8208;state reaction affords a new metallacycle C displaying TADF luminescence different from that of B. The removal of the aqua ligands and the formation of cuprophilic interactions makes this transition an innovative example of a solid&#8208;state photoactive tracer.







Abstract
A new luminescent Cu(I) tetrametallic metallacycle B is reported that features very rare semi&#8208;bridging aqua ligands. When heated markedly above room temperature, this compound undergoes a post&#8208;synthetic transformation in the solid&#8208;state, affording the new luminescent metallacycle C. Thermogravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that this alteration preserves the gross tetrametallic macrocycle structure, but is caused by the release of the coordinated water molecules with the concomitant formation of cuprophilic interactions. This transition induces a shift from eye&#8208;perceived green (B) to blue (C) room&#8208;temperature luminescence for these molecular solids. Photophysical measurements and time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory calculations have been conducted to identify the origins of the emission properties lying in these structurally related assemblies, and suggest that thermally activated delayed fluorescence dominates the radiative relaxation pathways. This study highlights the innovative feature of Cu(I) derivatives, offering access to stimuli&#8208;sensitive materials that can witness, a posteriori, the exceeding of critical temperatures in their environment.

         <title>An Expedient Route to Bio&#8208;Based Polyacrylate Alternatives with Inherent Post&#8208;Chemical Modification and Degradation Capabilities by Organic Catalysis for Polymerization of Muconate Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalyzed group transfer polymerization (O&#8208;GTP) of muconic esters leads to bio&#8208;sourced and degradable polymers analogous to polyacrylates. This O&#8208;GTP method proves ultra&#8208;fast, converting 100&#8201;% of the monomer in one minute in toluene at room temperature. Chemical modification of the internal double bonds offers additional leverage either for modulating polymer properties or for chemical degradation.

The quest for polymers that would be at the same time bio&#8208;based and degradable after usage, in addition to offering chemical post&#8208;modification options, remains a daunting challenge in contemporary polymer science. Despite advances in polymer chemistry, attempts at controlling the chain&#8208;growth polymerization of muconate esters remain unexplored. Here we show that dialkyl muconates can be rapidly polymerized by organocatalyzed group transfer polymerization (O&#8208;GTP). O&#8208;GTP is conducted to completion at room temperature in toluene within a few minutes, using 1&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;1&#8208;(trimethylsiloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (ETSB) as initiator and 1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4,4,4&#8208;tris(dimethylamino)&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis[tris(dimethylamino)&#8208;phosphoranylidenamino]&#8208;2

&lt;p&gt;Organocatalyzed group transfer polymerization (O-GTP) of muconic esters leads to bio-sourced and degradable polymers analogous to polyacrylates. This O-GTP method proves ultra-fast, converting 100&#8201;% of the monomer in one minute in toluene at room temperature. Chemical modification of the internal double bonds offers additional leverage either for modulating polymer properties or for chemical degradation.

         <title>The P(III)&#8208;Amidite Based Synthesis of Stable Isotope Labeled mRNA&#8208;Cap&#8208;Structures Enables their Sensitive Quantitation from Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an approach to synthesize high quality cap standards using P(III)&#8208;amidite chemistry. It enables ready access to stable isotope labeled internal standards in the milligram range. These references are the applied in the development of a highly sensitive LC&#8211;MS/MS method to study the cap epitranscriptome. The application to biological samples allowed the combined quantitation of cap structures as well as modified nucleosides in a single run.







Abstract
The 5&#8217; cap structure is crucial to mRNA function, with its diverse methylation patterns depending on the cellular state. Sensitive analytical methods are sought after to quantify this cap variety also referred to as cap epitranscriptome. To address a bottleneck for accurate and precise quantitation, we report a facile and fast access to high&#8208;quality synthetic standards via a new route, involving P(III)&#8208;amidite chemistry. A range of cap nucleotides and their stable heavy isotopic labeled analogues were derived from nucleoside diphosphates, which themselves were directly prepared in a one&#8208;step reaction sequence starting from unprotected nucleosides using a triphosphorylating reagent in combination with ethylenediamine. Considering a wider scope, the route also enables direct access to magic spot nucleotides and diphosphates of isoprenyl&#8208;alcohols. Stable&#8208;isotope labeled cap nucleotides derived from this route paved the way for the development of a highly sensitive LC&#8211;MS/MS method, applied to the characterization of mouse brain cap epitranscriptomes, which turned out to be very different from those of cultured cell lines of widespread use in the life sciences.

         <title>A 3D Robust and Microporous B&#8592;N Framework with 8&#8208;connected Sandwich Nodes for Efficient Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of three&#8208;dimensional robust microporous B&#8592;N organic framework, BNF&#8208;100, based on dative B&#8592;N bond that is self&#8208;assembled from 8&#8208;connected electrostatic&#8208;complementary sandwich nodes [(TEPB)(BACT)2] was reported. The activated BNF&#8208;100&#8201;a achieved the purification of different branched hexane isomers by using a single breakthrough column for the first time.







Abstract
Recently B&#8592;N organic frameworks (BNFs) have gained substantial attention owing to their unique dative bond energy, which imparts them with specialized functionalities across a broad spectrum of applications. Despite previous reports on BNFs with permanent porosity, research endeavors towards three&#8208;dimensional (3D) BNFs with similar properties are scarce, with no report of robust 3D BNFs featuring permanent porosity to date. Herein, electrostatic complementary strategy is proposed to construct the first example of 3D robust and microporous BNF, BNF&#8208;100, featuring a reo topology with 8&#8208;connected sandwich nodes assembled via dative B&#8592;N bonds. The activated form BNF&#8208;100&#8201;a exhibits excellent chemical stability and permanent porosity with Langmuir surface area of 645.9&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and pore volume of 0.23 cm3 g&#8722;1. BNF&#8208;100&#8201;a can efficiently separate hexane isomers through sieving mechanisms, as confirmed by vapor adsorption experiments and dynamic breakthrough tests, surpassing the performance of most MOF materials. Finally, we achieved the purification of different branched hexane isomers using a single breakthrough column in a combined breakthrough and purging experiment, which is the first reported instance in the literature on hexane isomer separation.

         <title>The Key Descriptors for Predicting the Exciton Binding Energy of Organic Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two key descriptors associated with molecular and aggregation properties are identified for predicting the exciton binding energy in solid state and an unprecedented prediction accuracy is achieved from data&#8208;driven machine learning, which will enable fast and precise screening of efficient organic photovoltaic materials with low exciton binding energy.







Abstract
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter to determine the mechanism and performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Small Eb benefits to reduce the interfacial energy offset and the energy loss of organic solar cells. However, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations of the Eb in solid state with considering electronic polarization effects are extremely time&#8208;consuming. Furthermore, current studies lack critical descriptors. Here, we use data&#8208;driven machine learning (ML) to accelerate the computation and identify the key descriptors most relevant to the solid&#8208;state Eb. The results verify two key descriptors associated with molecular and aggregation&#8208;state properties for efficient prediction of the solid&#8208;state Eb. Moreover, a very high accuracy is achieved by using the extreme gradient boosting algorithm, with the Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.92. Finally, we use this ML model to predict the Eb of thin films, which is difficult to achieve using the current quantum&#8208;chemical calculations due to the large structural disorder. Remarkably, the predicted thin&#8208;film Eb values are fully consistent with the results of temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra. Therefore, our work provides an accurate and efficient approach to predict the solid&#8208;state Eb and would be helpful to accelerate the exploitation of novel promising organic photovoltaic materials.

         <title>Integrated Ziegler&#8208;Natta/Brookhart&#8208;Ni Catalysts for the Synthesis of Sutured Polar High&#8208;Impact Polypropylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct synthesis of polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes using industrially&#8208;preferred heterogeneous catalysts is challenging due to the poisoning of polar functional groups towards metal center and the high stereo&#8208;selectivity requirement. In this work, dual&#8208;site catalysts combining Ziegler&#8208;Natta and Brookhart&#8208;Ni catalysts were used to produce polar polyolefin ionomers, followed by polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes containing isotactic polypropylene and branched polyethylene as toughening agents. Three combination modes between these catalysts were investigated, including mixed, core&#8208;shell, and integrated types. The integrated dual&#8208;site catalyst achieved the optimal material properties because the polyolefin ionomer acted as a suture molecule that stitched different components into a whole network. This produced sutured polar high&#8208;impact polypropylenes with excellent mechanical properties and compatibility with polar substances. The restraining effect of the suture molecules greatly reduced the release of microplastic particles after aging. Moreover, the obtained polar high&#8208;impact polypropylene can serve as an efficient compatibilizer to recycle polyethylene/polypropylene mixed&#8208;waste plastics. This work provides an appealing and potentially practical strategy to upgrade the widely used polypropylenes and to alleviate the ever&#8208;growing plastic pollution issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Au@CeO2 Helical Nanorods with Spatially Separated Structures for Polarization&#8208;Dependent N2 Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the successful development of chiral Au@CeO2 HNRs featuring spatially separated structures, achieved via a wet&#8208;chemistry approach. This advancement significantly boosts the photocatalytic efficiency of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials and highlights their promising application in N2 photofixation when stimulated by circularly polarized light.







Abstract
Chiral photocatalytic nanomaterials possess numerous unique properties and hold promise for various applications in chemical synthesis, environmental protection, energy conversion, and photoelectric devices. Nevertheless, it is uncommon to develop effective means to enhance the asymmetric catalytic performances of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials. In this study, a type of L/D&#8208;Au@CeO2 helical nanorods (HNRs) was fabricated by selectively growing CeO2 on the surface of Au HNRs via a facile wet&#8208;chemistry construction method. Chiral Au@CeO2 HNRs, featuring Au and CeO2 with spatially separated structures, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance for N2 fixation, being 50.80&#177;2.64&#8197;times greater than that of Au HNRs. Furthermore, when L&#8208;Au@CeO2 HNRs were exposed to left circularly polarized light (CPL) and D&#8208;Au@CeO2 HNRs were exposed to right CPL, their photocatalytic efficiency was enhanced by 3.06&#177;0.06&#8197;times compared to the samples illuminated with the opposite CPL, which can be attributed to the asymmetrical generation of hot carriers upon CPL excitation. This study not only offers a simple approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials but also demonstrates the potential of chiral plasmonic materials for application in specific photocatalytic reactions, such as N2 fixation.

         <title>Simultaneous Regulation of Organic and Inorganic Components in Interphase by Fiber Separator for High&#8208;Stable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidized cellulose separator provides strong dipole moments, facilitating the cleavage of P&#8722;F bonds to construct a solid electrolyte interphase rich in NaF. In addition, the separator prevents the reduction of organic solvents by attracting electrons, thereby inhibiting the formation of organic oligomers. Thus, it results in a smooth and robust interphase, which significantly reduces the interface impedance of the Na anode.







Abstract
Uncontrollable side reactions at the metal interface have been identified as the root cause of the formation of a fragile solid electrolyte interphase, leading to irreversible sodium loss in sodium metal batteries. Here, we proposed an interface engineering strategy that employed a carboxyl functionalized cellulose separator to provide strong dipole moments and induce the cleavage of P&#8722;F bond to construct a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in NaF. In addition, we employed nuclear magnetic resonance technology confirmed that the separator with strong dipole moments prevented the reduction of organic solvents by attracting electrons, thereby inhibiting the formation of organic oligomers. SEI with high NaF content and few oligomers is smooth and robust, obviously decreasing the interface impedance of the Na anode. The symmetric Na||Na cells, equipped with the functionalized separator, efficiently operated for 1400&#8197;hours with a stable 72&#8197;mV overpotential at 0.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, exhibiting low energy barrier and fast ion transport kinetics. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell also showed stable cycling performance, with the capacity remaining at 94.83&#8201;% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 1C. The proposed separator could control the formation and composition of SEI, paving the way for the development of long&#8208;life sodium metal batteries.

         <title>A Green and Efficient Electrocatalytic Route for the Highly&#8208;Selective Oxidation of C&#8722;H Bonds in Aromatics over 1D Co3O4&#8208;Based Nanoarrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation selectivities of target products can be manipulated via surface and interface engineering of Co3O4&#8208;based nanocatalysts. The selectivity toward benzaldehyde is achieved to 90&#8201;% at a 47.6&#8201;% conversion of toluene on Co3O4 NNs/Ti. In contrast, the selectivity switching to benzyl alcohol reaches 90.1&#8201;% at a 32.1&#8201;% conversion on Co3O4@MnO2/Ti, demonstrating that electrocatalytic oxidation process is readily maneuvered.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds in hydrocarbons represents an efficient and sustainable strategy for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Herein, a highly selective and continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical oxidation process of toluene to various oxygenated products (benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and benzyl acetate) is developed with the electrocatalytic membrane electrodes (ECMEs). The selectivity of target products can be manipulated via surface and interface engineering of Co3O4&#8208;based electrocatalysts. We achieved a high benzaldehyde selectivity of 90&#8201;% at a toluene conversion of 47.6&#8201;% using 1D Co3O4 nanoneedles (NNs) loaded on a microfiltration (MF) titanium (Ti) membrane, i.e, Co3O4 NNs/Ti. In contrast, the main product shifted to benzyl alcohol with a selectivity of 90.1&#8201;% at a conversion of 32.1&#8201;% after modifying MnO2 nanosheets (NSs) on Co3O4 NNs/Ti (Co3O4@MnO2/Ti) catalyst. Moreover, benzyl acetate product can be obtained with a selectivity of 92&#8201;% at a conversion of 58.5&#8201;% at high current density (&gt;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating that the pathway of toluene oxidation is readily maneuvered. DFT results reveal that modifying MnO2 on Co3O4 optimizes the electron structure of Co3O4@MnO2/Ti and modulates the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. This work demonstrates a sustainable, efficient, and continuous&#8208;flow process for precise control over the production selectivity of value&#8208;added oxygenated derivatives in the electrochemical oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Opening the Hysteresis Loop in Ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 Nanosheets Through Functionalization with TCNQ Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasonic liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation of a layered ferromagnet, Fe3GeTe2, produces nanosheets with weak coercivity of ~0.1&#8197;T. The nanosheets react with an organic acceptor, TCNQ, to yield an FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite with a 5&#8208;fold increase in coercivity.







Abstract
Ferromagnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), whose structure exhibits weak van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions between 5&#8208;atom thick layers, was subjected to liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) in N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) to yield a suspension of nanosheets that were separated into several fractions by successive centrifugation at different speeds. Electron microscopy confirmed successful exfoliation of bulk FGT to nanosheets as thin as 6&#8197;nm. The ferromagnetic ordering temperature for the nanosheets gradually decreased with the increase in the centrifugation speed used to isolate the 2D material. These nanosheets were resuspended in NMP and treated with an organic acceptor, 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;quinodimethane (TCNQ), which led to precipitation of FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite. The formation of the composite material is accompanied by charge transfer from the FGT nanosheets to TCNQ molecules, generating TCNQ&#8901;&#8722; radical anions, as revealed by experimental vibrational spectra and supported by first principles calculations. Remarkably, a substantial increase in magnetic anisotropy was observed, as manifested by the increase in the coercive field from nearly zero in bulk FGT to 1.0&#8197;kOe in the exfoliated nanosheets and then to 5.4&#8197;kOe in the FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite. The dramatic increase in coercivity of the composite suggests that functionalization with redox&#8208;active molecules provides an appealing pathway to enhancing magnetic properties of 2D materials.

         <title>Inner Side Chain Modification of Small Molecule Acceptors Enables Lower Energy Loss and High Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells Processed with Non&#8208;halogenated Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Two small molecule acceptors (SMAs) L8&#8208;PhF and L8&#8208;PhMe were synthesized. The L8&#8208;PhMe possesses more effective non&#8208;covalent interactions and ordered molecular packing than that of L8&#8208;PhF. While, superior morphology and reduced energy loss were also obtained in L8&#8208;PhMe&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs). This study highlights that the energy loss of OSCs processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents could be decreased through regulating the intermolecular interactions of SMAs by inner side chain modification.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents usually suffer from excessive self&#8208;aggregation of small molecule acceptors (SMAs), severe phase separation and higher energy loss (Eloss), leading to reduced open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Regulating the intermolecular interaction to disperse the aggregation and further improve the molecular packing order of SMAs would be an effective strategy to solve this problem. Here, we designed and synthesized two SMAs L8&#8208;PhF and L8&#8208;PhMe by introducing different substituents (fluorine for L8&#8208;PhF and methyl for L8&#8208;PhMe) on the phenyl end group of the inner side chains of L8&#8208;Ph, and investigated the effect of the substituents on the intermolecular interaction of SMAs, Eloss and performance of OSCs processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents. Through single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations, it is found that compared with L8&#8208;PhF, which possesses strong and abundant intermolecular interactions but downgraded molecular packing order, L8&#8208;PhMe with the methyl substituent possesses more effective non&#8208;covalent interactions, which improves the tightness and order of molecular packing. When blending the SMAs with polymer donor PM6, the differences in intermolecular interactions of the SMAs influenced the film formation process and phase separation of the blend films. The L8&#8208;PhMe based blend film exhibits shorten film formation and more homogeneous phase separation than those of the L8&#8208;PhF and L8&#8208;Ph based ones. Especially, the OSCs based on L8&#8208;PhMe show reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss and enhanced Voc than the devices based on the other two SMAs. Consequently, the L8&#8208;PhMe based device processed with o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) and using 2PACz as the hole transport layer (HTL) shows an outstanding PCE of 19.27&#8201;%. This study highlights that the Eloss of OSCs processed with non&#8208;halogenated solvents could be decreased through regulating the intermolecular interactions of SMAs by inner side chain modification, and also emphasize the importance of effectivity rather than intensity of non&#8208;covalent interactions introduced in SMAs on the molecular packing, morphology and PCE of OSCs.

         <title>Ultrabroad Near Infrared Emitting Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining emission from host self&#8208;trapped excitons (STE) with dopant d&#8211;d transitions, we designed ultrabroad near infrared (NIR) emitting perovskites, 2.5&#8201;% W4+ and 2.8&#8201;% Mo4+&#8208;doped Cs2Na0.95Ag0.05BiCl6. They exhibit exceptional spectral widths exceeding 450&#8197;nm with quantum yield ~40&#8201;%. Leveraging 3D printing technology, we fabricated robust phosphor converted light emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) demonstrating NIR imaging capabilities.







Abstract
Phosphor converted light emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) have revolutionized solid&#8208;state white lighting by replacing energy&#8208;inefficient filament&#8208;based incandescent lamps. However, such a pc&#8208;LED emitting ultrabroad near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiations still remains a challenge, primarily because of the lack of ultrabroad NIR emitting phosphors. To address this issue, we have prepared 2.5&#8201;% W4+&#8208;doped and 2.8&#8201;% Mo4+&#8208;doped Cs2Na0.95Ag0.05BiCl6 perovskites emitting ultrabroad NIR radiation with unprecedented spectral widths of 434 and 468&#8197;nm, respectively. Upon band&#8208;edge excitation, the soft lattice of the host exhibits broad self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission covering NIR&#8208;I (700&#8197;nm), which then nonradiatively excites the dopants.

The large spin&#8208;orbit coupling and local structural distortion might possibly enhance the dopant emission intensity, leading to an overall NIR photoluminescence quantum yield ~40&#8201;%.

         <title>Switching Sides: Regiochemistry and Functionalization Dictate the Photoswitching Properties of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
You know what imine? Aryliminopyrazoles have demonstrated their suitability as photoswitches and in driving dynamic&#8208;covalent reactions out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium. However, the influence of their structure on their photoswitching properties remains unknown. Here, we present the first comprehensive investigation into their structure&#8211;property relationship, a detailed list of design rules, and their ability to switch in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Photoswitchable imines demonstrate light&#8208;dependent dynamic covalent chemistry and can function as molecular ratchets. However, the design of aryliminopyrazoles (AIPs) has been limited to N&#8208;pyrazole derivatives with ortho&#8208;pyrrolidine motifs. The impact of other functionalization patterns on the photoswitching properties remains unknown. Here, we present a systematic structure&#8208;property analysis and study how the photoswitching properties can be tuned through ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization of the phenyl ring in N&#8208;pyrazole and N&#8208;phenyl AIPs. This study establishes the first set of design rules for these AIP photoswitches and reports the most stable Z&#8208;isomer of an AIP to date, enabling its crystallization and resulting in the first reported crystal structure of a metastable Z&#8208;aldimine. Finally, we demonstrate that the AIPs are promising candidates for photoswitching in the condensed phase.

         <title>Amplifying Colossal Thermal Expansion of a Martensitic Molecular Crystal through Interlayer Shear&#8208;Induced Side&#8208;Chain Liberation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel colossal thermal expansion (TE) material, p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB, amplifies TE behavior via an irreversible &#945;&#8594;&#946; martensitic transition. The transition, accompanied by substantial interlayer shear, increases free volume surrounding TIPS side&#8208;chains, significantly enhancing their motility. This mechanism nearly doubles the volumetric TE coefficient in the &#946;&#8208;phase, from 255.3 to 444.9&#8197;MK&#8722;1.







Abstract
Molecular crystals capable of colossal thermal expansion (TE) are fascinating owing to their substantial and continuous volume changes and reasonably linear responses to temperature. This makes them promising candidates for micromachine applications. Macroscopic motion is driven by subtle yet cooperative movements of molecules that respond to the thermal motions of dynamic functional units. The study of p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB presented here offers a compelling case highlighting the relationship between the degree of dynamicity of functional units and TE behavior. In its &#945;&#8208;phase, the p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB crystal undergoes an irreversible martensitic transition to the &#946;&#8208;phase, accompanied by significant cooperative interlayer shear. This process substantially enhances the mobility of the side&#8208;chains driven by the increased free volume surrounding them. This nearly doubles the volumetric TE coefficient from 255.3 (10) to 444.9&#8197;(32)&#8201;MK&#8722;1, particularly in the actuation direction from 175.0&#8197;(7) to 291.7&#8197;(20)&#8201;MK&#8722;1, enabling about 4.5&#8201;% elongation/contraction. As demonstrated here, p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB exhibits a decent force density (&gt;1.4&#215;107&#8197;N&#8201;m&#8722;3) and precise motion control capabilities due to its hysteresis&#8208;free and non&#8208;abrupt TE nature. Furthermore, we demonstrated the limited operating distance of colossal TE materials can be amplified by utilizing levers, highlighting the high potential of these materials for use in micromachines.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Induced &#8220;Breathing&#8208;Helical&#8221; Dynamic System of a Porphyrinic Metallo&#8208;Organic Cage for Advanced Conformational Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallo&#8208;organic cage with a flexible inner cavity and freely twisted side chains has been obtained by the assembly of terpyridine&#8208;terminated porphyrinic ligands. This cage exhibited excellent packaging capability with fullerenes, with a higher binding affinity for C70 and the resulting host&#8208;guest complex showing an unprecedent coexistence of racemic and symmetric conformations.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest dynamic systems in coordination&#8208;driven metallo&#8208;organic cages have gained significant attentions since their promising applications in chiral separation, drug delivery, and catalytical fields. To maximize guest&#8208;binding affinity, hosts adopting multiple conformations are widely investigated on their structural flexibility for guest accommodation. In this study, a novel metallo&#8208;organic cage S with breathing inner cavity and freely twisted side chains was proposed. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses depicted a characteristic &#8220;breathing&#8208;helical&#8221; dynamic system on the semiflexible framework, which led to an unprecedent co&#8208;crystallisation of racemic and symmetric conformations via the encapsulation locking of C70 guests. By taking advantages of the high binding affinity, selective extraction of C70 was realized. This research provides new ideas for the modification on the helicities of metallo&#8208;organic cages, which could pave a new way for advanced conformational manipulation of supramolecular host systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stage Reduction Strategy of Tin Perovskite Enables High Performance Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study firstly proposes sustained dynamic reduction using a dual&#8208;stage reduction strategy to fabricate devices of high efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Ultimately, a champion power conversion efficiency of 14.78&#8201;% and 90&#8201;% of initial efficiency after 628&#8197;h at maximum power.







Abstract
The rapid oxidation of Sn2+ in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) restricts their efficiency and stability have been main bottleneck towards further development. This study developed a novel strategy which utilizes thiosulfate ions (S2O32&#8722;) in the precursor solution to enable a dual&#8208;stage reduction process. In the solution stage, thiosulfate acted as an efficacious reducing agent to reduce Sn4+ to Sn2+, meanwhile, its oxidation products were able to reduce I2 to I&#8722; during the film stage. This dual reduction ability effectively inhibited the oxidation of Sn2+ and passivated defects, further promising an excellent stability of the perovskite devices. As a result, thiosulfate&#8208;incorporated devices achieved a high efficiency of 14.78&#8201;% with open&#8208;circuit voltage reaching 0.96&#8197;V. The stability of the optimized devices achieved a remarkable improvement, maintaining 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after 628&#8197;hours at maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point (MPP). The findings provid research insights and experimental data support for the sustained dynamic reduction in TPSCs.

         <title>Catalytic Edges in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with various catalytic edges (carbonyl group, diaminopyrazine, phenylimidazole, and benzaldehyde imidazole) have been demonstrated to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction. The carbon atoms in phenylimidazole facilitated the formation of OOH*, thus showing higher activity than other COFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are employed in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) because of their diverse structural units and controllable catalytic sites, and the edge sites have high catalytic activity than the basal sites. However, it is still challenge to modulate the edge sites in COFs, because the extended frameworks in two&#8208; or three&#8208;dimensional topologies resulted in limited edge parts. In this study, we have demonstrated the edge site modulation engineering based on one dimensional (1D) COFs to catalyze the ORR, which featured distinct edge groups&#8208;carbonyl, diaminopyrazine, phenylimidazole, and benzaldehyde imidazole units. The synthesized COFs have same ordered frameworks, similar pore structure, but had different electronic states of the carbons along the edge sites, which results in tailored catalytic properties. Notably, the COF functionalized with a phenylimidazole edge group exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to the other synthesized COFs. And the theoretical calculation further revealed the different edge sites had tunable binding ability of the intermediates OOH*, which contributed modulated activity. Our findings introduce a novel way for designing COFs optimized for ORR applications through molecular level control of edge sites.

         <title>Anchoring Catalytic Metal Nodes within a Single&#8208;Crystalline Pyrazolate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;node&#8208;based catalytic site anchoring strategy was presented by synthesizing a single&#8208;crystalline pyrazolate MOF, PCN&#8208;1004, which features one&#8208;dimensional copper&#8208;pyrazolate chains and exceptional stability. PCN&#8208;1004 shows outstanding catalytic activity in cross dehydrogenative coupling reactions for constructing C&#8722;O/C&#8722;S bonds without directing groups, achieving yields of up to ~99&#8201;%, with long cycle lives and high substrate compatibility.







Abstract
The synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline and robust pyrazolate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Pz&#8208;MOFs) capable of facilitating challenging organic transformations is fundamentally significant in catalysis. Here we demonstrate a metal&#8208;node&#8208;based catalytic site anchoring strategy by synthesizing a single&#8208;crystalline and robust Pz&#8208;MOF (PCN&#8208;1004). PCN&#8208;1004 features one&#8208;dimensional (1D) copper&#8208;Pz chains interconnected by well&#8208;organized ligands, forming a porous three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network with two types of 1D open channels. Notably, PCN&#8208;1004 displays exceptional stability in aqueous solutions across a broad pH range (1 to 14), attributed to the robust copper&#8208;Pz coordination bond. Significantly, PCN&#8208;1004 functions as an outstanding catalyst in cross dehydrogenative coupling reactions for constructing C&#8722;O/C&#8722;S bonds, even in the absence of directing groups, achieving yields of up to ~99&#8201;%, with long cycle lives and high substrate compatibility. PCN&#8208;1004 outperforms all previously reported porphyrin&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Control experiments and computations elucidate the pivotal catalytic role of the copper&#8208;Pz chains and reveal a free radical pathway for the reaction. This work not only demonstrates the successful implementation of a metal&#8208;node&#8208;based catalytic site anchoring strategy for the efficient catalysis of challenging organic transformations but also highlights the synergistic effect of a robust framework, 1D open channels, and active sites in enhancing catalytic efficiency within MOFs.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Depolymerization of Functionalized Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Polyethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;enzymatic concept is described for the depolymerization of low molecular weight polyethylene. Initial treatment with mCPBA and ultrasonication is followed by the key steps, a four&#8208;enzyme cascade reaction yielding various functionalized medium&#8208;chain products.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most commonly used plastic type in the world, contributing significantly to the plastic waste crisis. Microbial degradation of PE in natural environments is unlikely due to its inert saturated carbon&#8208;carbon backbones, which are difficult to break down by enzymes, challenging the development of a biocatalytic recycling method for PE waste. Here, we demonstrated the depolymerization of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (LMW) PE using an enzyme cascade that included a catalase&#8208;peroxidase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, a Baeyer Villiger monooxygenase, and a lipase after the polymer was chemically pretreated with m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) and ultrasonication. In a preparative experiment with gram&#8208;scale pretreated polymers, GC&#8208;MS and weight loss determinations confirmed ~27&#8201;% polymer conversion including the formation of medium&#8208;size functionalized molecules such as &#969;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids and &#945;,&#969;&#8208;carboxylic acids. Additional analyses of LMWPE&#8208;nanoparticles using AFM showed that enzymatic depolymerization reduced the sizes of these mCPBA&#8208; and enzyme&#8208;treated LMWPE&#8208;nanoparticles. This multi&#8208;enzyme catalytic concept with distinct chemical steps represents a unique starting point for future development of bio&#8208;based recycling methods for polyolefin waste.

&lt;p&gt;A chemo-enzymatic concept is described for the depolymerization of low molecular weight polyethylene. Initial treatment with &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;CPBA and ultrasonication is followed by the key steps, a four-enzyme cascade reaction yielding various functionalized medium-chain products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene (PE) is the most commonly used plastic type in the world, contributing significantly to the plastic waste crisis. Microbial degradation of PE in natural environments is unlikely due to its inert saturated carbon-carbon backbones, which are difficult to break down by enzymes, challenging the development of a biocatalytic recycling method for PE waste. Here, we demonstrated the depolymerization of low-molecular-weight (LMW) PE using an enzyme cascade that included a catalase-peroxidase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, a Baeyer Villiger monooxygenase, and a lipase after the polymer was chemically pretreated with &lt;i&gt;m-&lt;/i&gt;chloroperoxybenzoic acid (&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;CPBA) and ultrasonication. In a preparative experiment with gram-scale pretreated polymers, GC-MS and weight loss determinations confirmed ~27&#8201;% polymer conversion including the formation of medium-size functionalized molecules such as &#969;-hydroxycarboxylic acids and &#945;,&#969;-carboxylic acids. Additional analyses of LMWPE-nanoparticles using AFM showed that enzymatic depolymerization reduced the sizes of these &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;CPBA- and enzyme-treated LMWPE-nanoparticles. This multi-enzyme catalytic concept with distinct chemical steps represents a unique starting point for future development of bio-based recycling methods for polyolefin waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Ray Driven Aqueous&#8208;Phase Methane Conversions into Complex Molecules up to Glycine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#947;&#8208;Ray is capable of driving an aqueous&#8208;phase CH4+H2O+O2 conversion selectively into CH3COOH via &#8901;CH3 and &#8901;OH radical intermediates, and driving an aqueous&#8208;phase CH3COOH+NH3 conversion into NH2CH2COOH via &#8901;CH2COOH and &#8901;NH2 radical intermediates. Such &#947;&#8208;ray driven aqueous&#8208;phase methane conversions probably play an important role in the formation network of complex organic molecules in the universe, and provides a strategy to convert abundant CH4 into value&#8208;added products at mild conditions.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of initial evolutions of molecules in the universe is of great interest and importance. CH4 is one of the abundant simple molecules in the universe. Herein we report &#947;&#8208;ray, high&#8208;energy photons commonly existing in cosmic rays and unstable isotope decay, as an external energy to efficiently drives aqueous&#8208;phase CH4 conversions to various products with the presence of oxygen at room temperature. Glycine also forms with an additional introduction of ammonia. Both CH4 conversions and product distributions are modified by solid granules, and a CH3COOH selectivity as high as 82&#8201;% is obtained when SiO2 is added. Our results point to &#947;&#8208;ray driven aqueous&#8208;phase CH4 conversions as a likely formation network of initial complex organic compounds in the universe and offer an alternative strategy for efficiently utilizing CH4 as the carbon source to produce value&#8208;added products at mild conditions, a long&#8208;standing challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Achieving Controllable Thermochromic Fluorescence via Synergistic Intramolecular Charge Transfer and Molecular Packing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing molecular engineering strategies to synergistically control intramolecular charge transfer transitions and packing configurations of fluorophores, we developed thermochromic fluorescent materials with high quantum yield. These materials cover the deep red to near&#8208;infrared region and exhibit a broad peak shift range, showing significant potential for use in programmable multi&#8208;level information encryption devices.







Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) have attracted significant attention due to their unique fluorescent colorimetric response to temperature. However, existing TFMs still suffer from weak stimulus responsiveness, broad temperature response ranges, uncontrollable emission color changes, and low quantum yields. In this study, we address these issues by designing and synthesizing three diketone&#8208;boron complexes with distinct emission wavelengths (NWPU&#8208;(2&#8211;4)). Utilizing a molecular engineering strategy to manipulate intramolecular charge transfer transitions and molecular packing modes, our synthesized complexes exhibit efficient fluorescence emission in both solution and solid states. Moreover, their emission wavelengths are highly sensitive to environmental polarity. By incorporating these compounds into thermosensitive matrices of long&#8208;chain alkanes, we produced TFMs with varied fluorescence emission peak variation ranges. Notably, the TFM based on NWPU&#8208;4, owing to its strong charge transfer transitions and dense J&#8208;aggregate packing configuration, not only exhibits intense fluorescence emission spanning the deep red to near&#8208;infrared spectrum but also displays a remarkable 90&#8197;nm broad range of thermochromic properties. Ultimately, it was successfully applied to programmable, thermally controlled, multi&#8208;level information encryption.

         <title>Pentagon&#8208;Rich Caged Carbon Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized caged carbon catalysts enriched with pentagonal structures and investigated their catalytic activity for the high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction. The origin of the ORR activity of the pentagon&#8208;containing carbon catalyst lies in the spin that localizes in the pentagon ring. The SOMO of pentagon&#8208;containing molecules is characterized by &#960; orbitals and is energetically low, which promotes effective oxygen adsorption.







Abstract
The interaction between electron spin and oxygen molecules in non&#8208;platinum catalysts, particularly carbon catalysts, significantly influences the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A promising approach to developing high&#8208;performance catalysts involves introducing five&#8208;membered ring structures with spin into graphitic carbons. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of cage&#8208;like cubic carbon catalysts enriched with pentagon structures using pentagon ring&#8208;containing C60 and a NaCl template. The number of pentagons contained in the structure was increased by doping with nitrogen and annealing, and the number of electron spins also increased, thereby improving catalytic activity. The prepared catalyst exhibits remarkable activity in ORR under acidic electrolytes. Furthermore, we elucidate the correlation between the pentagon structure, the number of spin, and catalytic activity, demonstrating that enhanced activity is contingent upon the presence of spin. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the role of spin in improving activity. The concept of spin and the introduction of pentagon structures provide new design principles for carbon catalysts.

         <title>Programmable Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence Switches through Wavelength&#8208;Selective Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we engineered a wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive system utilizing the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer strategy. This system integrates a photoactivated long&#8208;lived luminescent material as the energy donor with a fluorescent photoswitch as the energy acceptor, facilitating programmable persistent luminescence switches. Distinct afterglow color states, such as initial nonemissive, green, yellow, and orange, were achieved through irradiation at 400&#8197;nm, 365&#8197;nm, and 254&#8197;nm, respectively. Based on this capability, we established an interacting network for multistate afterglow color switching among these four emissive states.

Based on this capability, we established an interacting network for multistate afterglow color switching among these four emissive states. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of this wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive system in the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of multicolor afterglow images on a single thin film. This work represents a substantial step towards the fabrication of sophisticated wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive systems, potentially revolutionizing applications in optical data storage, security labeling, and smart displays by enabling precise control over photoresponsive behaviors under various photoirradiation wavelengths.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper highlights a smart sustainable Ni@TiOx catalyst, Ni encapsulated in TiOx, for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as reported by Gong and co&#8208;workers. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in PDH, achieving 94&#8201;% propylene selectivity and high stability. This design offers a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, with potential for broader industrial applications.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an important process for propylene synthesis, relies on expensive noble metals or highly toxic oxides as catalysts. In a recent publication, Gong and co&#8208;workers report a breakthrough discovery for PDH by introducing a sustainable catalyst composed of titanium oxide overlayers encapsulating nickel nanoparticles, termed Ni@TiOx. This innovative catalyst showcases exceptional performance in PDH, exhibiting high propylene selectivity and stability under industrially relevant conditions. The study elucidates the role of defective TiOx overlayers and the electronic promotional effect of subsurface Ni in enhancing catalytic activity, translating a traditional model catalyst system into a sustainable industrial catalyst for low&#8208;carbon energy and the chemical industry.

         <title>Modulating the Inner Helmholtz Plane towards Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions for High&#8208;Performance Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, achieved by engineering the current collectors with electron&#8208;deficient aromatic layers that possess high permanent quadrupole moment, can fundamentally regulate the inner Helmholtz plane structure and lithium (Li)&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to construct stable anion&#8208;derived inorganic solid electrolyte interphase layer, thus achieving unprecedented Li plating/stripping performance and long lifespan for anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries with thick cathodes.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries (AFLBs) featured high energy density are viewed as the viable future energy storage technology. However, the irregular Li deposition and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode current collectors reduce their cycling performance. Here, we propose a concept of anion&#8208;recognition electrodes enabled by anion&#8208;&#960; interactions to regulate the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and electrolyte solvation chemistry for high&#8208;performance AFLBs. By engineering the electrodes with electron&#8208;deficient aromatic&#8208;&#960; systems that possess high permanent quadrupole moment (Qzz), the anion&#8208;&#960; interactions can be generated to concentrate the anions on the electrode surface and tune the IHP structure to construct a stable anion&#8208;derived SEI layer, thus achieving highly reversible Li plating/stripping process. Through designing various current collectors with different Qzz values, the intimate correlations among the surface charge of the electrode, competitive adsorption of the IHP, and SEI structures are demonstrated. Particularly, the modified carbon cloth current collector with a high Qzz value (+35.1) delivers a high average Li stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency of 99.1&#8201;% over 230 cycles in the carbonated electrolyte, enabling a long lifespan and high capacity retention of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#8208;based AFLBs with a commercial&#8208;level areal capacity (4.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Controllable Heavy n&#8208;type Behaviours in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Non&#8208;Conjugated Passivants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial issues between the perovskite film and electron transport layer greatly limit the efficiency and stability of inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Despite organic ammonium passivants have been widely established as interfacial layers, they failed to improve electron extraction. Here, we reported that the heavy n&#8208;type characteristics in a low bandgap perovskite film could be modulated by incorporating non&#8208;conjugated ammonium passivants with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing abilities. This resulted in a significant enhancement of electron extraction in the heavily n&#8208;type doped perovskite. The passivant&#8208;treated PSCs exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 25.74% with an excellent fill factor of 85.4% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.166 V, which are significantly higher than that of the control device. The unencapsulated devices maintained 88% of their initial PCEs after 1,200 hours at 85 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Simple Deformations to Elicit Complex Motions and Directed Swimming of Smart Organic Crystals with Controllable Thickness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of control over the crystal growth in a systematic way currently stands as an unsurmountable impediment to the preparation of dynamic crystals as soft robots; in effect, the mechanical effects of molecular crystals have become a subject of scattered reports that pertain only to specific crystal sizes and actuation conditions, often without the ability to establish or confirm systematic trends. One of the factors that prevents the verification of such performance is the unavailability of strategies for effectively controlling crystal size and aspect ratio, where crystals of serendipitous size are harvested from crystallization solution. Here we devised a water&#8208;assisted precipitation method to prepare crystals of chemical variants of 9&#8208;anthracene derivative (chemical substitution of the 9th carbon) crystals with various thicknesses that respond to ultraviolet light with simple mechanical effects, including bending, splintering, and rotation. By capitalizing on the robust mechanical flexibility and deformability of crystals, we demonstrate systematic variations in crystal deformation that are further elevated in complexity to construct crystal&#8208;based robots capable of motions reminiscent of controllable sailing and humanoid movements. The results illustrate an approach to eliminate a critical obstacle&#160;towards complete control over the motility of dynamic molecular crystals as microrobots in nonaerial environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Insertion into Se&#8208;S Bonds by Synergistic Rh(II)/Guanidine Catalysis Involving Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Assistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient construction of chalcogen&#8208;atom&#8208;based chiral compounds remains a challenge, despite the importance of organoselenium and organosulfur compounds in life and materials science. Chalcogen atoms can form net attractive interactions called chalcogen bonds, but it is an undeveloped tool to assist asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report an enantioselective insertion platform to install a stereogenic center bearing selanyl and thiocyano functional groups. Our method operates by synergistic catalysis by a chiral guanidine and an achiral dirhodium complex in a three&#8208;component or four&#8208;component reaction, through Se&#8208;S bond insertion into carbene species, competing successfully with the spontaneous racemic process and showing high regioselectivity. As elucidated by spectroscopic experiments and computational studies, a unique mechanism involving chalcogen as well as hydrogen bonding was established to account for the enantiocontrol. The high stereoselectivity holds for a broad array of selanylthiocyanatopropanoates, which showed excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory toward IL&#8208;1&#946; and low cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions are powerful synthetic tools for constructing organic molecular frameworks. In this study, strongly Lewis acidic bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolates were generated from alkynes through oxygen transfer from 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide using tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]. Boron enolates were highly reactive owing to the strong acidity of the boron centers, and thus immediately coupled with alkynes. N&#8208;Ethynylphthalimide reacted as an alkyne with 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide and B(C6F5)3 to form a semi&#8208;stable bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolate through the coordination of the carbonyl group to the boron center.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric de novo synthesis of benzocyclobutenes (BCBs) via catalytic intermolecular reaction is highly desired for efficient access to this important class of compounds, yet such a strategy remains unmet challenge. Here, we report a Pd/Pyrox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2+2] annulation between arylboronic acids and functionalized alkenes, providing an unprecedented efficient protocol to access various enantio&#8208;enriched BCBs in a modular and versatile manner under mild conditions. A broad substrate scope with excellent enantioselectivity has been achieved under the current protocol. The isolation and characterization of the key chiral palladacycle intermediate, together with DFT calculations, provides strong evidence for the catalytic pathway including an enantiodetermining arylpalladation step.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoregulated Supramolecular Polymerization through Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers are able to change their structure, morphology and function in response to external stimuli. However, controlling the independence of stimuli&#8208;responses in these systems is challenging. Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) as a reversible network element to regulate the photoresponsive and adaptive behavior of supramolecular polymers. To this end, we have designed a system comprising an amphiphilic XB acceptor with the ability to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media (OPE&#8208;Py) and a molecule with a dual photoresponsive and XB donor function [(E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I]. OPE&#8208;Py self&#8208;assembles in aqueous media into supramolecular polymers, which transform into nanoparticle assemblies upon co&#8208;assembly with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I. Interestingly, a third type of assembly (2D sheets) is obtained if OPE&#8208;Py is treated with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I and exposed to photoirradiation. At ambient conditions, both nanoparticles and 2D sheets remain invariant over time. However, heating dissociates the XB interactions present in both assemblies, resulting in their transformation to the original fiber&#8208;like morphology of OPE&#8208;Py. Thus, breaking the communication between self&#8208;assembly and the stimuli&#8208;responses upon heating restores the original state of the system, drawing parallels to feedback loops in programming language. This work broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether&#8208;Free Alkaline Polyelectrolytes for Water Electrolyzers: Recent Advances and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have attracted great interest for their potential as sustainable, environmentally friendly, low&#8208;cost sources of renewable energy. Alkaline polyelectrolytes play a crucial role in AEMWEs, determining their performance and longevity. Because heteroatom&#8208;containing polymers have been shown to have poor durability in alkaline conditions, this review focuses on ether&#8208;free alkaline polyelectrolytes, which are more chemically stable. The merits, weaknesses, and challenges in preparing ether&#8208;free AEMs are summarized and highlighted. The evaluation of synthesis methods for polymers, modification strategies, and cationic stability will provide insights valuable for the structural design of future alkaline polyelectrolytes. Moreover, the in&#8208;situ degradation mechanisms of AEMs and ionomers during AEMWE operation are revealed. This review provides insights into the design of alkaline polyelectrolytes for AEMWEs to accelerate their widespread commercialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Modulation of Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide toward Long&#8208;Enduring Anionic Redox with Fast Kinetics for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with anionic redox reactions hold great potential for energy storage applications due to their ultra&#8208;high capacity and cost effectiveness. However, achieving high capacity requires overcoming challenges such as oxygen&#8208;redox failure, sluggish kinetics, and structural degradation. Herein, we employ an innovative crystal modulation strategy, using Mn&#8208;based Na0.72Li0.24Mn0.76O2 as a representative cathode material, which shows that the highly exposed {010} active facets enable an enhanced rate capability (119.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10C) with fast kinetics. Meanwhile, the reinforced Mn&#8211;O bond inhibits excessive oxidation of lattice oxygen and O&#8211;O cohesion loss, stabilizing and maintaining a long&#8208;enduring reversible oxygen&#8208;redox activity (100% high capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5C and 84.28% retention after 300 cycles at 5C). Time&#8208;resolved operando two&#8208;dimensional X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the robust structural stability, zero&#8208;strain behavior, and suppressed phase transition with ultra&#8208;low volume variation during cycling at different rates (0.1C: 1.75%, 1C: 0.31%, 5C: 0.04%). Additionally, the full cell coupled with hard carbon achieves a high energy density of approximately 211 Wh kg&#8722;1 with superior performance. This work highlights the significance of crystal modulation and presents a universal approach in developing Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes with stable anionic redox for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Mild&#8208;condition Photocatalytic Reforming of Methanol&#8208;water by a Hierarchical, Asymmetry Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a reproducible intermediate for hydrogen (H2) and carbon cycling, methanol mixed with water (H2O) in a ratio of 1:1 can multiply the outcome of green H2 generation via Photocatalytic reforming of methanol&#8208;H2O (PRMW). Hitherto, low&#8208;energy and mild&#8208;condition PRMW remains a serious challenge. Here, the amino acid&#8208;derived carbon nitrides (ACN) were synthesized supramolecular precursor strategy for PRMW and achieved excellent performance (H2, 35.6 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1; CO2, 11.5 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1) under sunlight at 35 &#176;C. We revealed that the surface&#8208;terminating carboxyl groups (&#8211;COOH) promote the dark dehydrogenation of methanol on MetCNx to form methoxy (&#8270;OCH3) and methylol (&#8270;CH2OH) simultaneously, with the hydroxyl (&#8270;OH) generated by photostimulated H2O oxidation promotes the C&#8208;H activation of formaldehyde, then leads the whole reaction into the formation of CO2 and three H2. The extended light absorption, enhanced charge separation and transport, and efficient surface reaction improve photocatalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Cellular Internalization of Zr(IV) Nanocages by Tuning Hydrophilicity and Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoscale molecular materials have emerged as a new class of compounds at the nanometer scale with well&#8208;defined chemical structures, remarkable uniformity and high reproducibility. Among these materials, zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional stability and applications in catalysis, recognition and separation and so on. However, their poor water solubility impedes their biomedical applications. In this study, decorating the ligand with Ru(II) complexes can not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with large Stokes shift (180 nm). Notably, butyl&#8208;modification of the cyclopentadiene rings can significantly enhance the cell uptake (100 folds) of nanocages via actin&#8208; and dynamin&#8208;mediated endocytosis. The unique advantages and easy modifiability of these nanocages make them highly promising candidates for diverse biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Nanobodies Bind Bismuth, Indium and Gallium for Applications in Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted theranostics heavily rely on metal isotopes conjugated to antibodies. Single&#8208;domain antibodies, known as nanobodies, are much smaller in size without compromising specificity and affinity. The conventional way of conjugating metals to nanobodies involves non&#8208;specific modification of amino acid residues with bifunctional chelating agents. We demonstrate that mutagenesis of a single residue in a nanobody creates a triple cysteine motif that selectively binds bismuth which is, for example, used in targeted alpha therapy. Two mutations create a quadruple cysteine mutant specific for gallium and indium used in positron emission tomography and single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography, respectively. Labelling is quantitative within a few minutes. The metal nanobodies maintain structural integrity and stability over weeks, resist competition from endogenous metal binders like glutathione, and retain functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Modulation through the Inverted Energy Gap Law in Triply N&#9472;B&#8592;N&#8208;Containing Windmill&#8208;Shaped Triazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of windmill&#8208;shape heterocyclic molecules containing three N&#9472;B&#8592;N units, TBN and its derivatives, with quasi&#8208;planar C3 symmetric backbone, are synthesized. The parent TBN exhibits a strongly allowed, doubly degenerate lowest excited state but suffers from very low fluorescence, due to very fast nonradiative decay rate through a conical intersection (CI) as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Introducing peripheral phenyl&#8208; or thienyl&#8208;groups (Ph&#8208;TBN or Th&#8208;TBN) induces pronounced bathochromic shifts and enhances fluorescence, which is beneficial from inhibited nonradiative pathway by the increased energy barriers to access the CI at excited state. The understanding of this rather uncommon behaviour may open routes for the design of novel fluorescence materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimagnetic Core/Shell Nanoprobes with Tunable Exchange Coupling for High Resolution and Sensitive Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has demonstrated versatile applications in biomedicine, including tumor imaging, cell tracking, and image&#8208;guided hyperthermia. Despite these advancements, the prevalent use of clinically approved tracers has posed limitations on MPI's resolution and sensitivity. In this study, we engineered a bimagnetic core/shell nanocrystals (BMCS) tailored for MPI by optimizing the heterostructure and modulating the exchange coupling effect between the two magnetic components. The resulting BMCS exhibited remarkably heightened susceptibility and magnetization while maintaining low coercivity, thereby substantially improved both MPI resolution and sensitivity compared to conventional tracers such as VivoTrax. At an equivalent mass concentration, BMCS demonstrated a notable 5.08&#8208;fold increase in signal intensity and achieved an unprecedentedly high resolution down to 1 mm. The excellent MPI performance contributes to high resolution MPI and the sensitive detection of orthotopic colorectal cancer in mice. The design strategy employed in BMCS, centered on the exchange coupling effect, introduces an efficacious approach for the development of high performance MPI tracers.</dc:description>

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Silver Clusters from Ag57 to Ag72 via Laminating Multiple Different Anion Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The established capability of anion templates in precisely manipulating the size, geometry, and function of metal clusters is well acknowledged. However, the development of a systematic methodology for orchestrating the assembly of silver clusters, particularly those encompassing multiple distinct types of anion templates, remains elusive due to the formidable synthetic challenge. In this work, we report two novel silver clusters, Ag57 and Ag72, using two and three different anion templates, respectively. Ag57 features a gyroscope&#8208;like monovalent cation with an Ag3 triangle core sandwiched by one [SiW9O34]10&#8722; and a triad of Cl&#8722; anion templates. By intentionally introducing the third anion template, SO42&#8722;, the structure is expanded to the unprecedented Ag72 (with 15 silver atoms epitaxially grown on top of Ag57) resembling a tumbler, inside of which two Ag3 layers are laminated by one [SiW9O34]10&#8722;, seven Cl&#8722; and one SO42&#8722; anion templates in parallel with respect to longitudinal orientation. It is noteworthy that Ag72 exhibits remarkable structural complexity and represents a pioneering achievement as the first silver cluster incorporating three distinct types of anion templates. In addition, Ag72 demonstrates a significant advantage over Ag57, particular in terms of applications such as luminescent thermometers and remote laser ignition.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis and striking reactivity of the first 1,2,3&#8208;trisilacyclopentadiene I with a hypercoordinate &#955;4Si= &#955;3Si bond is reported. The compound consumes one molar equivalent CO and xylyl isocyanide to afford the unprecedented 1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentadienes II and III with an endocyclic hypercoordinate &#955;4Si= &#955;3C bond attached to a conjugated Si=O group or aminosilylene pendent, respectively.







Abstract
The facile reaction of the SiPh2&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;silylene (LSi:)2SiPh2 (L=PhC(NBut)2) with diphenylacetylene affords the unprecedented 1,2,3&#8208;trisilacyclopentadiene (LSi)2(PhC)2SiPh2 1 with a hypercoordinate &#955;4Si&#8722;&#955;3Si double bond. Compound 1 is very oxophilic and consumes three molar equivalents of inert N2O to form the bicyclic oxygenation product 2 through O&#8208;atom insertion in the Si=Si and Si&#8722;Si bonds. Strikingly, 1 can completely split the C&#8801;O bonds of carbon monoxide under ambient conditions (1&#8197;atm, room temperature), yielding the 1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentadiene 3, representing the first hypercoordinate example of a cyclosilene with a &#955;4Si&#8208;&#955;3C double bond. Likewise, reaction of Xyl&#8208;NC (Xyl=2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl), an isocyanide isoelectronic with CO, with 1 furnishes the related 1,3&#8208;disilacyclopentadiene 4 but with an amidinato silylene pendent attached to the Si=C carbon ring atom.

         <title>Solution&#8208;processing induced H&#8208;aggregate of Perylene&#8208;Diimide Zwitterion Exhibiting Compact Molecular Stacking toward Efficient Cathode Modification in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene&#8208;diimide zwitterion PDI&#8208;B was designed and synthesized as a universal cathode interlayer material, enabling diverse applications in efficient OSCs. With the assistance of solution&#8208;processing, PDI&#8208;B tended to form H&#8208;aggregate and possessed tight molecular packing in the film, which significantly facilitates the electron transport of OSCs.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance organic cathode interlayers (CILs) play a crucial role in the advance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, organic CILs have exhibited inferior performances to their inorganic counterparts over a long time, due to the inherent shortcoming of poor charge transporting capability. Here, we designed and synthesized a perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI) zwitterion PDI&#8208;B as high&#8208;performance organic CIL for OSCs. We revealed that an obvious H&#8208;aggregate of PDI&#8208;B was formed during the solution processing, thereby significantly enhancing the charge transporting capability of the CIL. Compared to the classic PDINN, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance of PDI&#8208;B was reduced from 4.2&#8197;&#197; to 3.9&#8197;&#197;, which further facilitated the charge transport. Consequently, PDI&#8208;B showed a high conductivity of 1.81&#215;10&#8722;3S/m; this is comparable to that of inorganic CILs. The binary OSC showed an elevated PCE of 19.23&#8201;%, which is among the highest PCE values for binary OSCs. Benefitting from improved solvent resistance and good compatibility with large&#8208;area processing method of PDI&#8208;B, the photovoltaic performances of inverted and 1&#8208;cm2 OSC were significantly improved. The results from this work provide a new approach of optimizing the condensed structure of PDI film to boost the charge conductivity, opening an avenue to develop high&#8208;performance PDI&#8208;based CILs.

         <title>Directly Regenerating of Spent LiCoO2 with Gradient F&#8208;Doped Subsurface towards Ultra&#8208;Stable Storage Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the existence of OVs, the diffusion energy barrier of F&#8208;elements is lowered. Thus, trace amounts of F&#8208;elements (0.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%) achieve the gradient doping on subsurface, establishing the rigid CoO5F layer. However, when introducing the high levels of F impurities (1&#8197;wt&#8201;%), the form LiF passivation layer leads to imperfect Li&#8208;ions supplementation and crystalline phase reconstruction.







Abstract
As great potential recycling strategy, the direct regeneration of spent LiCoO2 (LCO) is beneficial for lowering environmental pollutions and promoting global sustainability. However, owing to the using of binder and electrolyte, some fluorine impurities would be remained into spent materials. Considering the doping behaviors of F&#8208;elements, their suitable content introducing would facilitate the energy&#8208;storage abilities of regenerated LCO. Herein, through the tailored introduction of F&#8208;elements, spent LCO are successfully regenerated with physical&#8208;chemical evolutions. Benefitting from the existed oxygen vacancies, the diffusion energy&#8208;barrier of F&#8208;elements is reduced from 1.73&#8197;eV to 0.61&#8197;eV, facilitating the establishment of gradient F&#8208;doped subsurface, along with the formation of rigid CoO5F. Meanwhile, excess F&#8208;elements (1&#8197;wt&#8201;%, as a threshold) lead to the formation of LiF passivation layer on the surface. Thus, the as&#8208;optimized sample displays a considerable capacity of 154.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 5.0&#8197;C, with retention rate (88.3&#8201;%) in 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V. Supported by detailed electrochemical and kinetic analysis, the structural advantages are confirmed to boost the improved redox activity of Co&#8208;ions and the alleviating of irreversible oxygen&#8208;release. Give this, the work is anticipated to reveal the evolutions of regenerated LCO with the introduced F&#8208;elements, whilst providing the practical regeneration strategies toward excellent high&#8208;voltage properties.

         <title>Reversible Multi&#8208;Complexation of CO2 to Alkaline Earth Metal Ion&#8208;Pair at 400&#8201;ppm and 298&#8201;K</title>

Breaking upper limit of CO2&#8208;uptake at low&#8208;pressure using porous materials is challenging due to the lack of multiple adsorption mechanisms. This study presents a novel concept of reversible multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to alkaline earth metal ion&#8208;pairs in ferrierite&#8208;type zeolite with the formation of unprecedented CO2&#8208;complexes even at 400&#8197;ppm and 298&#8197;K. The findings in the present study offer a new direction for efficient CO2 adsorbents.







Abstract
The efficient capture of low&#8208;pressure CO2 remains a significant challenge due to the lack of established multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to active sites in microporous materials. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of reversible multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to alkaline earth metal (AEM) ion pairs, utilizing a host site in ferrierite&#8208;type zeolite (FER). This unique site constrains two AEM ions in proximity, thereby enhancing and isotopically spreading their electrostatic potentials within the zeolite cavity. This electrostatic potential&#8208;engineered micropore can trap up to four CO2 molecules, forming M2+&#8722;(CO2)n&#8722;M2+ (n=0&#8211;4, M=Ca, Sr, Ba) complexes, where each CO2 molecule is stabilized by interactions between terminal oxygen (Ot) in CO2 and the AEM ions. Notably, the Ba2+ pair site exhibits higher thermodynamic stability for multiple adsorptions due to the optimal binding mode of Ba2+&#8722;Ot&#8722;Ba2+. Through high&#8208;accuracy energy calculations, we have established the relationship among structure, CO2 uptake, and operating temperature/pressure, demonstrating that the Ba2+ pair site can capture four CO2 molecules even at concentrations as low as 400&#8197;ppm and at 298&#8197;K. Three of the four molecules of CO2 trapped were removable at room temperature and under vacuum. The findings in the present study provide a new direction for developing efficient CO2 adsorbents.

         <title>Promoting Water Dissociation and Weakening Active Hydrogen Adsorption to Boost the Hydrogen Transfer Reaction over a Cu&#8722;Ag Superlattice Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of H*(H2O)x as a mediator is proposed to deliver a hydrogen transfer reaction (HTR) pathway for overcoming the traditional scaling relationship for electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (EHRs) using H2O. A Cu&#8722;Ag alloy with a superlattice structure (sl&#8208;CuAg) site is then designed to enhance water dissociation while ensuring weak *H adsorption at the active site to enable the HTR mechanism. This material could be utilized in acetylene semihydrogenation to ethylene to simultaneously increase its activity and selectivity.







Abstract
The prerequisite for electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (EHRs) is H2O splitting to form surface hydrogen species (*H), which occupy catalytic sites and lead to mismatched coverage of *H and reactants, resulting in unsatisfactory activity and selectivity. Thus, modulating the splitting pathway of H2O is significant for optimizing the EHR process. Herein, a Cu&#8722;Ag alloy with a superlattice structure of staggered&#8208;ordered Cu and Ag is theoretically predicted and experimentally proven to undergo a pathway for H2O splitting called the hydrogen transfer reaction (HTR) in the water layer, which involves the formation of *H, the capture of *H by a water cluster to form H*(H2O)x and subsequent hydrogenation reactions by H*(H2O)x. Taking acetylene hydrogenation as a model case, the as&#8208;proposed HTR pathway could lead to a relaxation hydrogenation process to modulate the matching degree of C2H2 and *H, thus enabling a 91.2&#8201;% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency at a partial current density of 0.38&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, greatly outperforming its counterpart without a superlattice structure.

         <title>Employing Singlet&#8208;Singlet Energy Transfer for Boosting the Reactivity of Type I Photoinitiators in Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exceptional photosensitization process of radical photopolymerization by singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer was found when using optical brighteners in a photopolymerizable resin containing phosphine oxide as photoinitiator.







Abstract
A remarkable and unexpected increase in the photopolymerization efficiency of an acrylic resin by a bisacylphosphine oxide photoinitiator was observed when an optical brightener was present in the medium. High values for the maximal rates of photopolymerization were obtained by RT&#8208;FTIR at 365&#8197;nm under a very low irradiance of 1&#8197;mW/cm2. Fluorescence studies revealed that the quenching process occurs through singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer between the first singlet excited state of the optical brightener and the ground state photoinitiator. This mechanism acts as an additional pathway for the excitation of the photoinitiator, thereby increasing the total amount of initiating radicals. Using the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer model, we calculated the relative efficiency of the photosensitization process with respect to the direct excitation efficiency of the photoinitiator. The results demonstrate that the photosensitization process can be predicted, paving the way for further improvements in photoinitiating systems.

         <title>Photo&#8208;activation of Tolane&#8208;based Synthetic Ion Channel for Transmembrane Chloride Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive tolane&#8208;based supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette ion channels are reported. Uncaging o&#8208;nitrobenzyl groups from the corresponding transport inactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based caged system leads to the formation of self&#8208;assembled barrel rosette ion channels. These channels emerged as anion&#8208;selective channels, primarily operating through an antiport mechanism and having profound selectivity towards Cl&#8722; ion.







Abstract
While natural channels respond to external stimuli to regulate ion concentration across cell membranes, creating a synthetic version remains challenging. Here, we present a photo&#8208;responsive uncaging technique within an artificial ion channel system, which activates the ion transport process from a transport&#8208;inactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based caged system. From the comparative ion transport screening, 1&#8201;b emerged as the most active transporter. Interestingly, its bis(o&#8208;nitrobenzyl) derivative, i.e., protransporter 1&#8201;b&#8242; was inefficient in transporting ions. Detailed transport studies indicated that compound 1&#8201;b is an anion selective transporter with a prominent selectivity towards chloride ions by following the antiport mechanism. Compound 1&#8201;b&#8242; did not form an ion channel, but after the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl groups were photocleaved, it released 1&#8201;b, forming a transmembrane ion channel. The channel exhibited an average diameter of 6.5&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197; and a permeability ratio of 

PCl-/PK+=7.3&#177;1.5

 ${{P}_{{Cl}^{-}}/{P}_{{K}^{+}}=7.3\pm 1.5}$



. The geometry&#8208;optimization of protransporter 1&#8201;b&#8242; indicated significant non&#8208;planarity, corroborating its inefficient self&#8208;assembly. In contrast, the crystal structure of 1&#8201;b demonstrates strong self&#8208;assembly via the formation of an intermolecular H&#8208;bond. Geometry optimization studies revealed the plausible self&#8208;assembled channel model and the interactions between the channel and chloride ion.

&lt;p&gt;Photo-responsive tolane-based supramolecular barrel-rosette ion channels are reported. Uncaging &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl groups from the corresponding transport inactive &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl-based caged system leads to the formation of self-assembled barrel rosette ion channels. These channels emerged as anion-selective channels, primarily operating through an antiport mechanism and having profound selectivity towards Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While natural channels respond to external stimuli to regulate ion concentration across cell membranes, creating a synthetic version remains challenging. Here, we present a photo-responsive uncaging technique within an artificial ion channel system, which activates the ion transport process from a transport-inactive &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl-based caged system. From the comparative ion transport screening, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; emerged as the most active transporter.

         <title>Selective Cross&#8208;Metathesis Versus Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis of Terpenes, Taking the Path Less Travelled</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,6&#8208;Heptadiene substrates readily ring&#8208;close to form thermodynamically stable five&#8208;membered rings in the presence of metathesis catalysts. However, the unique selectivity displayed by Ru&#8722;SCF3&#8722;I provides a distinct cross&#8208;metathesis pathway with various prenylated 1,6&#8208;heptadienes, including terpenes. This new methodology presents a promising opportunity for the modification of biologically active compounds.







Abstract
A diiodo ruthenium olefin metathesis pre&#8208;catalyst was employed to achieve remarkably selective cross&#8208;metathesis reactions of prenylated 1,6&#8208;dienes, effectively overcoming the entropically favored intramolecular ring&#8208;closing metathesis. This reaction was investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations and fine&#8208;tuned through the application of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach. The potential of this innovative process was demonstrated through the unprecedented functionalization of various terpene natural products via cross&#8208;metathesis, resulting in the synthesis of new derivatives in a single step.

         <title>Quantum Spin Exchange Interactions Trigger O&#8197;p Band Broadening for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved a breakthrough in broadening the O&#8197;p band in transition metal oxides (TMOs) by harnessing quantum spin exchange interactions in Ru&#8722;MnO2 nanosheets. This induces electronic spin polarization, modulating MnO2&#8242;s spin density and broadening the O&#8197;p band. The resulting structural changes optimize proton adsorption and electron transport in zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The pressing demand for large&#8208;scale energy storage solutions has propelled the development of advanced battery technologies, among which zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are prominent due to their resource abundance, high capacity, and safety in aqueous environments. However, the use of manganese oxide cathodes in ZIBs is challenged by their poor electrical conductivity and structural stability, stemming from the intrinsic properties of MnO2 and the destabilizing effects of ion intercalation. To overcome these limitations, our research delves into atomic&#8208;level engineering, emphasizing quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI). These essential for modifying electronic characteristics, can significantly influence material efficiency and functionality. We demonstrate through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that enhanced QSEI in manganese oxides broadens the O&#8197;p band, narrows the band gap, and optimizes both proton adsorption and electron transport. Empirical evidence is provided through the synthesis of Ru&#8722;MnO2 nanosheets, which display a marked increase in energy storage capacity, achieving 314.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintaining high capacity after 2000&#8197;cycles. Our findings underscore the potential of QSEI to enhance the performance of TMO cathodes in ZIBs, pointing to new avenues for advancing battery technology

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst with Precise Structure and Extremely Exposed Active Site for Efficient H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uniform dispersion of single Ni center with well&#8208;defined structure was facilely achieved by anchoring nanosized NiPOM on graphene oxide (GO). The resulting NiPOM/GO was used to couple with CdS photoabsorber to achieve ultra&#8208;efficient hydrogen evolution performance of 2753.27&#8197;mmol&#8201;gPOM&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, representing a record value among all the POM&#8208;based photocatalytic systems.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts with precise structure and extremely high catalytic efficiency remain a fervent focus in the fields of materials chemistry and catalytic science. Herein, a nickel&#8208;substituted polyoxometalate (POM) {NiSb6O4(H2O)3[&#946;&#8208;Ni(hmta)SbW8O31]3}15&#8722; (NiPOM) with one extremely exposed nickel site [NiO3(H2O)3] was synthesized using the conventional aqueous method. The uniform dispersion of single nickel center with well&#8208;defined structure was facilely achieved by anchoring nanosized NiPOM on graphene oxide (GO). The resulting NiPOM/GO can couple with CdS photoabsorber for the construction of low&#8208;cost and ultra&#8208;efficient hydrogen evolution system. The H2 yield can reach to 2753.27&#8197;mmol&#8201;gPOM&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which represents a record value among all the POM&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Remarkablely, an extremely high hydrogen yield of 3647.28&#8197;mmol&#8201;gPOM&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved with simultaneous photooxidation of commercial waste plastic, representing the first POM&#8208;based photocatalytic system for H2 evolution and waste plastic conversion. This work highlights a straightforward strategy for constructing extremely exposed single&#8208;metal site with precise microenvironment by facilely manipulating nanosized molecular cluster to control individual atom.

         <title>Ostwald&#8208;Ripening Induced Interfacial Protection Layer Boosts 1,000,000&#8208;Cycled Hydronium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming at addressing the issue of unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface caused by the lack of cathode electrolyte interphase in the cathode material of aqueous batteries, by reversing the notorious side reaction&#8212;dissolution of electrode materials, we applied Ostwald ripening in the electrochemical cycling of a copper hexacyanoferrate electrode in hydronium&#8208;ion batteries, thus creating a stable interface layer of cross&#8208;linked cubes on the electrode surface, and leading to an excellent cycle life of one million cycles.







Abstract
Collapsing and degradation of active materials caused by the electrode/electrolyte interface instability in aqueous batteries are one of the main obstacles that mitigate the capacity. Herein by reversing the notorious side reactions include the loss and dissolution of electrode materials, as we applied Ostwald ripening (OR) in the electrochemical cycling of a copper hexacyanoferrate electrode in a hydronium&#8208;ion batteries, the dissolved Cu and Fe ions undergo a crystallization process that creates a stable interface layer of cross&#8208;linked cubes on the electrode surface. The layer exposed the low&#8208;index crystal planes (100) and (110) through OR&#8208;induced electrode particle growth, supplemented by vacancy&#8211;ordered (100) superlattices that facilitated ion migration. Our design stabilized the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface considerably, achieving a cycle life of one million cycles with capacity retention of 91.6&#8201;%, and a capacity retention of 91.7&#8201;% after 3000&#8197;cycles for a full battery.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Cyclometalated Platinum Ring Enables Synthetic Post&#8208;processing of a [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platinum&#8208;containing rotaxane was developed and underwent post&#8208;synthetic modification via modulation of the redox properties of the metal center. Oxidation using mild reagents led to rapid conversion to a PtIV complex and a PtIII dimer with different photophysical and shuttling dynamics. Notably, this is the first known example where a Pt&#8722;Pt bond has been used as a bridge to access higher&#8208;order rotaxanes.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) is an attractive avenue to add complexity to already intricate systems. This remains an important, challenging topic that is under&#8208;developed. In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of a [2]rotaxane molecule featuring a ring appended to an emissive cyclometalated PtII unit. Modulation of the oxidation state at the metal center can transform the interlocked molecule into a new PtIV [2]rotaxane or a PtIII [3]rotaxane held together by an intermetallic Pt&#8722;Pt bond &#8211; a first of its kind. These molecules display distinct structural and photophysical properties, as well as shuttling dynamics. This approach for post&#8208;synthetic modification could be used to construct more complex MIMs and inorganic supramolecular assemblies with redox properties.

         <title>Red Blood Cell&#8208;Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Inhibit Influenza Virus through Surface&#8208;Displayed Sialic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell&#8208;derived small extracellular vesicles (RBC sEVs) inhibit influenza virus infection by binding to the viral hemagglutinin (HA) via surface&#8208;displayed sialic acids (SAs). Acting as nanodecoys, RBC sEVs prevent viral attachment to host cells, effectively blocking infection. Removal of SAs from RBC sEVs significantly reduces their antiviral efficacy, highlighting the importance of SA&#8208;HA binding.







Abstract
Disrupting the conserved multivalent binding of hemagglutinin (HA) on influenza A virus (IAV) to sialic acids (SAs) on the host cell membrane offers a robust strategy to block viral attachment and infection, irrespective of antigenic evolution or drug resistance. In this study, we exploit red blood cell&#8208;derived small extracellular vesicles (RBC sEVs) as nanodecoys by harnessing their high abundance of surface&#8208;displayed SAs to interact with IAV through multivalent HA&#8208;SA interactions. This high&#8208;avidity binding inhibits viral adhesion to the cell surface, effectively preventing both attachment and infection in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. Notably, enzymatic removal of SAs from RBC sEVs significantly diminishes their anti&#8208;IAV efficacy. Our findings indicate that RBC sEVs possess intrinsic anti&#8208;IAV properties due to their native multivalent SAs and hold considerable promise as antiviral therapeutics.

         <title>Selective Covalent Inhibiting JNK3 by Small Molecules for Parkinson's Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered JC16I, the first JNK3&#8208;selective covalent inhibitor, which could target conserved cysteine in JNK family. JC16I potently and selectively inhibits and labels JNK3 in living cells and cell lysates, and demonstrates neuroprotective effects in PD models without compromising safety.







Abstract
c&#8208;Jun N&#8208;terminal kinases (JNKs) including JNK1/2/3 are key members of mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase family. Wherein JNK3 is specifically expressed in brain and emerges as therapeutic target, especially for neurodegenerative diseases. However, developing JNK3 selective inhibitors as chemical probes to investigate its therapeutic potential in diseases remains challenging. Here, we adopted the covalent strategy for identifying JNK3&#8208;selective covalent inhibitor JC16I, with high inhibitory activity against JNK3. Despite targeting a conserved cysteine in the vicinity of ATP pocket in JNK family, JC16I exerted a greater than 160&#8208;fold selectivity for JNK3 over JNK1/2. Importantly, even at low concentration, JC16I showed enhanced and long&#8208;lasting inhibition against cellular JNK3. In addition, its alkyne&#8208;containing probe JC&#8208;P1 could label JNK3 in SH&#8208;SY5Y cell lysate and living cells, with good proteome&#8208;wide selectivity. JC16I selectively suppressed the abnormal activation of JNK3 signaling and sufficiently exhibited neuroprotective effect in Parkinson's diseases (PD) models. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of developing isoform&#8208;selective and cell&#8208;active JNK3 inhibitors by covalent drug design strategy targeting a conserved cysteine. This work not only provides a valuable chemical probe for JNK3&#8208;targeted investigations in vitro and in vivo but also opens new avenues for the treatment of PD.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Discovery of a Potent Inhibitor of the Ferric Citrate Binding Protein FecB in Vibrio Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron acquisition is a crucial factor for bacterial growth, and its transport process could be a promising target for antibacterial drugs. A potent molecular inhibitor of the ferric citrate binding protein FecB has been discovered. The findings provide new insight into the modulation of ferric ion acquisition pathways and their application to pathogen growth suppression.







Abstract
Infections caused by Gram&#8208;negative bacteria present a significant risk to human health worldwide. Novel strategies are needed to deal with the challenge caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. Here, we report a new approach to combat infections by targeting iron&#8208;binding proteins to suppress bacterial growth. We investigated the function of the conserved periplasmic binding protein FecB from Vibrio alginolyticus. FecB was known to play a crucial role in the bacterial growth and to relate with biofilm formation. We then solved the crystal structures and elucidated the binding mechanism of FecB with ferric ion chelated by citrate. The results indicated that FecB binds weakly to one citrate molecule and strongly to the Fe3+&#8208;(citrate)2 complex. Based on these results, a structure&#8208;based virtual screening approach was conducted against FecB to identify small molecules that block ferric citrate uptake. Further evaluations in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that salvianolic acid C significantly suppressed bacterial growth, indicating that targeting bacterial nutrient absorption is a promising strategy for identifying potential antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Dynamically Stabilizing Oxygen Atoms in Silver Catalyst for Highly Selective and Durable CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pulsed&#8208;bias technique was developed to dynamically stabilize oxygen atoms in silver (Ag) electrodes under operando conditions, allowing to achieve highly selective and durable electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysis.







Abstract
Oxide derived catalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), in which, it is found that residue oxygen atoms play a pivotal role in regulating the catalyst's electronic structure and thus the CO2RR process. Unfortunately, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst under cathodic CO2RR potentials makes it unstable during continuous electrolysis, greatly hindering its practical industrial applications. In this work, we develop a pulsed&#8208;bias technique that is able to dynamically stabilize the residue oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst during electrochemical CO2RR. As a result, the oxide derived catalyst under pulsed bias exhibits super catalytic stability in catalyzing electrochemical CO2RR, while keeping excellent catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Subnanometer Diameter Control in Nanotubes Self&#8208;Assembled via Consecutive Cyclization &#8211; Polymerization Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the length of rod&#8208;shaped dinucleobase molecules allows fine control on the pore diameter of self&#8208;assembled nanotubes, which are produced by coupling cooperative noncovalent processes of different hierarchy and acting in orthogonal directions: Watson&#8211;Crick H&#8208;bonding macrocyclization and supramolecular polymerization.







Abstract
Tubular self&#8208;assembled architectures are highly appealing supramolecular objects that participate in diverse essential biological processes. Controlling with precision their dimensions, and in particular their pore diameter, is a key objective to develop the full applied potential of these structures. Here, using a strategy that relies on the controlled supramolecular polymerization of Watson&#8211;Crick H&#8208;bonded macrocycles, we target the assembly of 3 sets of nanotubes in which pore diameter is finely controlled from 1.8, to 3.2 and to 4.3&#8197;nm. This is simply done by elongating the oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) block placed in between guanine and cytosine nucleobases in the monomer. Moreover, this structural change leads to a gradual reduction in the chelate cooperativity of the cyclization process and, at the same time, to an enhancement in the tendency of the macrocycles to stack, which critically influences the coupling between these consecutive supramolecular processes.

         <title>Dynamic Active Sites in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolutions of active sites are ubiquitous in electrocatalysis due to the applied potentials and reaction environments. The study on dynamic active sites deciphers the intrinsic structure&#8211;property relationships and provides more comprehensive insights into the interaction between electrocatalysts and electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
In&#8208;depth understanding of the real&#8208;time behaviors of active sites during electrocatalysis is essential for the advancement of sustainable energy conversion. Recently, the concept of dynamic active sites has been recognized as a potent approach for creating self&#8208;adaptive electrocatalysts that can address a variety of electrocatalytic reactions, outperforming traditional electrocatalysts with static active sites. Nonetheless, the comprehension of the underlying principles that guide the engineering of dynamic active sites is presently insufficient. In this review, we systematically analyze the fundamentals of dynamic active sites for electrocatalysis and consider important future directions for this emerging field. We reveal that dynamic behaviors and reversibility are two crucial factors that influence electrocatalytic performance. By reviewing recent advances in dynamic active sites, we conclude that implementing dynamic electrocatalysis through variable reaction environments, correlating the model of dynamic evolution with catalytic properties, and developing localized and ultrafast in situ/operando techniques are keys to designing high&#8208;performance dynamic electrocatalysts. This review paves the way to the development of the next&#8208;generation electrocatalyst and the universal theory for both dynamic and static active sites.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of An Ideal Chain Antiferromagnet [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)](H3O)2Fe2F10 with Spin S=5/2</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel ideal one&#8208;dimensional (1D) S=5/2 chain antiferromagnetic compound [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)](H3O)2Fe2F10 (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) is obtained by single&#8208;step hydrothermal method at low temperature by intentionally pronating 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy ligand. The obtained compound exhibits no magnetic long&#8208;range ordering down to 0.5&#8197;K, showing the best 1D magnetism to date.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) magnets are of great interest owing to their intriguing quantum phenomena and potential application in quantum computing. We successfully synthesized an ideal antiferromagnetic spin S=5/2 chain compound [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)](H3O)2Fe2F10 (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) 1, using a single&#8208;step low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal method under conditions that favors the protonation of the bulky bidentate ligand 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy. Compound 1 consists of well&#8208;separated (Fe3+&#8722;F&#8722;)&#8734; chains with a large Fe&#8722;F&#8722;Fe angle of 174.8&#176;. Both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements show that 1 does not undergo a magnetic long&#8208;range ordering down to 0.5&#8197;K, despite the strong Fe&#8722;F&#8722;Fe intrachain spin exchange J with J/kB=&#8722;16.2(1) K. This indicates a negligibly weak interchain spin exchange J&#8242;. The J&#8242;/J value estimated for 1 is extremely small (&lt;2.8&#215;10&#8722;6), smaller than those reported for all other S=5/2 chain magnets. Our hydrothermal synthesis incorporates both [H2(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)]2+ and (H3O)+ cations into the crystal lattice with numerous hydrogen bonds, hence effectively separating the (Fe3+&#8722;F&#8722;)&#8734; spin chains. This single&#8208;step hydrothermal synthesis under conditions favoring the protonation of bulky bidentate ligands offers an effective synthetic strategy to prepare well&#8208;separated 1D spin chain systems of magnetic ions with various spin values.

         <title>Highly Active Photoreduction of Atmospheric&#8208;Concentration CO2 into CH3COOH over Palladium Particles on Nb2O5 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CO2 photoreduction towards C2 fuels is realized over a catalyst with the active metal particles anchored on the metallic oxide nanosheets, wherein the interfacial electron transfer builds dual metal active sites to boost the C&#8722;C coupling.







Abstract
The endeavor to drive CO2 photoreduction towards the synthesis of C2 products is largely thwarted by the colossal energy hurdle inherent in C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we load active metal particles on metal oxide nanosheets to build the dual metal pair sites for steering C&#8722;C coupling to form C2 products. Taking Pd particles anchored on the Nb2O5 nanosheets as an example, the high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field image and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate the presence of Pd&#8722;Nb metal pair sites on the Pd&#8208;Nb2O5 nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal these sites exhibit a low reaction energy barrier of only 1.02&#8197;eV for C&#8722;C coupling, implying that the introduction of Pd particles effectively tailors the reaction step to form C2 products. Therefore, the Pd&#8208;Nb2O5 nanosheets achieve a CH3COOH evolution rate of 13.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in photoreduction of atmospheric&#8208;concentration CO2, outshining all other single photocatalysts reported to date under analogous conditions.

     alt="Highly Active Photoreduction of Atmospheric-Concentration CO2 into CH3COOH over Palladium Particles on Nb2O5 Nanosheets"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction towards C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuels is realized over a catalyst with the active metal particles anchored on the metallic oxide nanosheets, wherein the interfacial electron transfer builds dual metal active sites to boost the C&#8722;C coupling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endeavor to drive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction towards the synthesis of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products is largely thwarted by the colossal energy hurdle inherent in C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we load active metal particles on metal oxide nanosheets to build the dual metal pair sites for steering C&#8722;C coupling to form C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products. Taking Pd particles anchored on the Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets as an example, the high-angle annular dark-field image and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate the presence of Pd&#8722;Nb metal pair sites on the Pd-Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal these sites exhibit a low reaction energy barrier of only 1.02&#8197;eV for C&#8722;C coupling, implying that the introduction of Pd particles effectively tailors the reaction step to form C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products. Therefore, the Pd-Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets achieve a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH evolution rate of 13.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in photoreduction of atmospheric-concentration CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, outshining all other single photocatalysts reported to date under analogous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Front Cover: Mechanochemical &#8220;Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; Strategy for Enhancing Gas Adsorption and Separation through Aperture Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of MOF@PCC composites was synthesized through mechanochemical reactions, as reported by Hang Xing, Yu Fang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202416884). This strategic placement of PCCs on the MOF surface optimized the pore structure of the composites, while the incorporation of polar functional groups facilitated specific interactions with targeted gas molecules. By carefully aligning the aperture sizes of both PCCs and MOFs, a significant enhancement in gas adsorption capacities was obtained, leading to improved binary gas separation capabilities and expanding the potential applications of these composites.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fused Star&#8208;Shape Giant Trimer Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy has developed novel non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shaped trimer, which has significantly improved solubility and synthetic yield, and effectively inhibited excessive molecular aggregation. The resulting based on 3BTT6F exhibit superior photovoltaic performance. Importantly, the non&#8208;fused 3D skeleton is conducive to improving intermolecular interactions, thereby contributing to the exceptional stability of the binary devices.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on giant molecular acceptors (GMAs) have attracted extensive attention due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operation stability. However, the large conjugated plane of GMAs poses great challenges in regulating the solubility, over&#8208;size aggregation and yield, which in turn further constrains their development in commercial products. Herein, we employ a non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy to develop novel non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape trimers (3BTT6F and 3BTT6Cl) for improving device performance. Single&#8208;bond linkage can break the rigid planarity to form a 3D architecture, generating multidimensional charge transfer pathways. Importantly, the non&#8208;fused skeleton strategy can not only significantly improve solubility and synthesis yield, but also effectively suppress molecular excessive aggregation. Consequently, due to the optimized film&#8208;forming process and charge dynamics, 3BTT6F&#8208;based binary device obtains a high PCE of 17.52&#8201;%, which is significantly higher than the reported fully fused trimers. Excitingly, 3BTT6F&#8208;based ternary device even obtains a top&#8208;level PCE of 19.26&#8201;%. Furthermore, the non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape configuration also endows these acceptors with enhanced intermolecular interaction in the active layer, demonstrating excellent operational stability. Our work emphasizes the potential of non&#8208;fused star&#8208;shape trimers, providing a new pathway for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs.

Photocatalysis seeing red! A copper&#8208;based complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4 exhibits two&#8208;photon upconversion promoting energy transfer photocatalysis enabling oxidative dimerization of benzylic amines, sulfide oxidation, phosphine oxidation, boronic acid oxidation and atom&#8208;transfer radical addition.







Abstract
Photocatalysis mediated by low energy light wavelengths has potential to enable safer, sustainable synthetic methods. A phenanthroline&#8208;derived ligand bathocupSani, with a large two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross section was used to construct a heteroleptic complex [Cu(bathocupSani)(DPEPhos)]BF4 and a homoleptic complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4. The ligand and the respective homoleptic complex with copper exhibit two&#8208;photon upconversion with an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 1.2&#8197;eV using red light. The complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4 promoted energy transfer photocatalysis enabling oxidative dimerization of benzylic amines, sulfide oxidation, phosphine oxidation, boronic acid oxidation and atom&#8208;transfer radical addition.

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Oxidation of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine in DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a photocatalytic method to selectively oxidise 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) to 5&#8208;formylcytosine under mild, aqueous conditions. At the single&#8208;nucleotide level, this C&#8722;H oxidation is highly selective for 5mC while leaving T and G intact. At the oligonucleotide level, some off&#8208;target oxidation was observed. Base&#8208;resolution proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept sequencing of 5mC was demonstrated on a synthetic oligonucleotide.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;H activation on complex biological macromolecules is a key goal in the field of organic chemistry. It requires thermodynamically challenging chemical transformations to be delivered under mild, aqueous conditions. 5&#8208;Methylcytosine (5mC) is a fundamentally important epigenetic modification in DNA that has major implications for biology and has emerged as a vital biomarker. Selective functionalisation of 5mC would enable new chemical approaches to tag, detect and map DNA methylation to enhance the study and exploitation of this epigenetic feature. We demonstrate the first example of direct and selective chemical oxidation of 5mC to 5&#8208;formylcytosine (5fC) in DNA, employing a photocatalytic system. This transformation was used to selectively tag 5mC. We also provide proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for deploying this chemistry for single&#8208;base resolution sequencing of 5mC and genetic bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) in DNA on a next&#8208;generation sequencing system. This work exemplifies how photocatalysis has the potential to transform the analysis of DNA.

         <title>Anticancer Tetranuclear Cu(I) Complex Catalyzes a Click Reaction to Synthesize a Chemotherapeutic Agent in situ to Achieve Targeted Dual&#8208;Agent Combination Therapy for Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) was developed based on apoferritin, which not only inhibited tumor growth through cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;induced immunity, but also possessed significant CuAAC reaction to synthesize a chemotherapeutic resveratrol analogue in situ for achieving targeted dual&#8208;drug combination therapy for cancer.







Abstract
To develop next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based drugs and dual&#8208;drug combination therapy for cancer, we proposed to develop a copper (Cu) complex that exerts anticancer function by integrating chemotherapy, immunotherapy and catalyzes a click reaction for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent, thereby achieving targeted dual&#8208;agent combination therapy. We designed and synthesized a tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) with remarkable cytotoxicity and notable catalytic ability for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent via Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC). We also constructed an apoferritin (AFt)&#8208;Cu4 nanoparticles (NPs) delivery system. Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs not only showed an enhanced performance of tumor growth inhibition, but also improved the targeting ability and reduced the systemic toxicity of Cu4 in vivo. Importantly, the anticancer effect was enhanced by combining the Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs with the resveratrol analogue obtained from the CuAAC reaction in situ.

     alt="Anticancer Tetranuclear Cu(I) Complex Catalyzes a Click Reaction to Synthesize a Chemotherapeutic Agent in situ to Achieve Targeted Dual-Agent Combination Therapy for Cancer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) was developed based on apoferritin, which not only inhibited tumor growth through cuproptosis and cuproptosis-induced immunity, but also possessed significant CuAAC reaction to synthesize a chemotherapeutic resveratrol analogue in situ for achieving targeted dual-drug combination therapy for cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop next-generation metal-based drugs and dual-drug combination therapy for cancer, we proposed to develop a copper (Cu) complex that exerts anticancer function by integrating chemotherapy, immunotherapy and catalyzes a click reaction for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent, thereby achieving targeted dual-agent combination therapy. We designed and synthesized a tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) with remarkable cytotoxicity and notable catalytic ability for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent via Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne 1,3-cycloaddition (CuAAC). We also constructed an apoferritin (AFt)-Cu4 nanoparticles (NPs) delivery system. Aft-Cu4 NPs not only showed an enhanced performance of tumor growth inhibition, but also improved the targeting ability and reduced the systemic toxicity of Cu4 in vivo. Importantly, the anticancer effect was enhanced by combining the Aft-Cu4 NPs with the resveratrol analogue obtained from the CuAAC reaction in situ. Finally, we revealed the anticancer mechanism of the Cu4/Aft-Cu4 NPs, which involves both cuproptosis and cuproptosis-induced systemic immune response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Lasing from Helical Superstructures of Chiral Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular chirality drives supramolecular helicity for intrinsic circularly polarized lasing. The supramolecular microcrystals exhibit circularly polarized laser emission with deterministic chirality and high dissymmetry factors up to ~1.0.







Abstract
Chiral supramolecular aggregates have the potential to explore circularly polarized lasing with large dissymmetry factors. However, the controllable assembly of chiral superstructures towards deterministic circularly polarized laser emission remains elusive. Here, we design a pair of chiral organic molecules capable of stacking into a pair of definite helical superstructures in microcrystals, which enables circularly polarized lasing with deterministic chirality and high dissymmetry factors. The microcrystals function as optical cavities and gain media simultaneously for laser oscillations, while the supramolecular helices endow the laser emission with strong and opposite chirality. As a result, the microcrystals of two enantiomers allow for circularly polarized laser emission with opposite chirality and high dissymmetry factors up to ~1.0. This work demonstrates the chiral supramolecular assemblies as an excellent platform for high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasers.

         <title>Molecular Imaging of Renin Activity using Fluorogenic Nanoprobes for Precision Antihypertensive Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable renin nanoprobes (ARNs) that specifically react with renin to liberate the renal clearable NIRF reporter are developed. ARNs not only enable non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time profiling of renin activity through near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) in vivo imaging, but also permit ultrasensitive detection of both plasma and urinary renin, facilitating renin&#8208;guided precision treatment and significantly improving hypertension control rate.







Abstract
Life&#8208;threatening hypertension remains inadequately controlled in clinics due to its heterogeneous renin levels. Rapid stratification of hypertension through renin analysis is crucial for effective personalized treatment, yet an ultrasensitive detection approach is currently lacking. Here, we report activatable renin nanoprobes (ARNs) for non&#8208;invasive and ultrasensitive profiling of renin activity and guiding antihypertensive treatment decision through near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) in vivo imaging and in vitro urinalysis. ARNs are intrinsically non&#8208;fluorescent due to NIRF reporter connected to a gold nanocluster through a renin&#8208;responsive peptide. In hyperreninemia mouse models, ARNs specifically react with renin to liberate the renal clearable NIRF reporter for accurate renin detection that outperforms the gold standard radioimmunoassay. Such specific and sensitive detection also enables imaging&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening of antihypertensive drugs. In hypertensive rat models, ARNs enable ultrasensitive detection of both plasma and urinary renin, facilitating renin&#8208;guided precision treatment and significantly improving hypertension control rate (90&#8201;% versus 58&#8201;%). Our nanoprobe platform holds great potential for assisting clinicians in rapidly and accurately classifying hypertensive patients and improving outcomes through tailored treatment selection.

         <title>Sulfonated Hydroxyaryl&#8208;Tetrazines with Increased pKa for Accelerated Bioorthogonal Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Reactions in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines for cellular click&#8208;to&#8208;release activations is described. These derivatives are easily accessible, stable, and achieve complete release of TCO&#8208;caged molecules within minutes. The introduced sulfo groups provide a versatile handle for modification, equipping the resulting sulfonamides with useful properties. These sulfo&#8208;tetrazines find applications in bioorthogonal prodrug and fluorophore activation.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal reactions that enable switching molecular functions by breaking chemical bonds have gained prominence, with the tetrazine&#8208;mediated cleavage of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged compounds (click&#8208;to&#8208;release) being particularly noteworthy for its high versatility, biocompatibility, and fast reaction rates. Despite several recent advances, the development of highly reactive tetrazines enabling quantitative elimination from trans&#8208;cyclooctene linkers remains challenging. In this study, we present the synthesis and application of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines, a class of derivatives featuring phenolic hydroxyl groups with increased acidity constants (pKa). This unique property leads to accelerated elimination and complete release of the caged molecules within minutes. Moreover, the inclusion of sulfonate groups provides a valuable synthetic handle, enabling further derivatization into sulfonamides, modified with diverse substituents. Significantly, we demonstrate the utility of sulfo&#8208;tetrazines in efficiently activating fluorogenic compounds and prodrugs in living cells, offering exciting prospects for their application in bioorthogonal chemistry.

         <title>The Hidden Mechanism: Excited&#8208;State Proton&#8208;Electron Pair Transfer in Metal Nanocluster Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Comprehending the underlying factors that govern photoluminescence (PL) in metal nanoclusters (NCs) under physiological conditions remains a highly intriguing and unresolved challenge, particularly for their biomedical applications. In this study, we evaluate the critical role of excited&#8208;state proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer in the emission of metal NCs. Our findings demonstrate that hydronium ion (H3O+) binding can trigger a nonlinear, pH&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state concerted electron proton transfer (CEPT) reaction. This involves simultaneous electron transfer from the Au(0) core to the Au(I)&#8208;ATT (ATT denotes 6&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;thiothymidine) surface and proton transfer from H3O+ to the ATT ligand in a single step, greatly promoting vibrations and rotations of the Au(I)&#8208;ATT surface, resulting in substantial PL quenching of Au10(ATT)6 NCs. Further analyses show that the unique CEPT dynamics are strongly influenced by the opposing effects of increased reorganization energy and a larger pre&#8208;exponential factor on the electron transfer rate. Moreover, the proposed excited&#8208;state CEPT process is found to be prevalent in core&#8208;shell relaxation metal NCs, such as Au25(SR)18 (SR denotes thiolate) NCs, and serves as an important factor in limiting their PL emission. By simply controlling the pKa of the ligands, the emission performance of Au25(SR)18 can be easily regulated in physiological environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Charge&#8208;Carriers Dynamics by Relaxed Lattice Strain in A&#8208;site&#8208;doped Halide Perovskite for Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because of the unique and superior optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted great interests in photocatalysis. Element doping strategy is adopted to modify perovskite materials to improve their photocatalytic performance. However, the contribution of bare doping&#8208;site onto photocatalytic efficiency, and the correlation between doping locations and activity have not yet to be demonstrated. This&#160;promoted us to explore the potential of A&#8208;site&#8208;doped MHPs for photocatalysis. Herein, we dope potassium (K+) into CsPbBr3 and first reveal that the occupied locations of K+ in CsPbBr3 is lattice incorporation rather than surface segregation, which would change from A&#8208;site substitution to interstitial site in lattice with the increase of K+ concentrations. Taking H2 evolution as a model reaction, photocatalytic activity of CsPbBr3 after K+ doping could be significantly improved ~11&#8208;fold with A&#8208;site substitution, which is superior to that of interstitial site doping. Moreover, other alkali metals including Li, Na, and Rb doping give the same results. The structure of photocatalysts during reaction confirmed the contribution of A&#8208;site doping onto enhanced photocatalytic activity. Mechanistic insights show it is a result of the relaxed residual lattice strain induced promoted charge&#8208;carriers dynamics and formed upward shifting of band after K+ A&#8208;site doping.</dc:description>

         <title>Corannulene&#8208;based Quintuple [6]/[7]helicenes: Well&#8208;preserved Bowl Core, Inhibited Bowl Inversion and Supramolecular Assembly with Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, corannulene&#8208;based quintuple [6]helicenes (Q[6]H&#8208;1 andQ[6]H&#8208;2) and [7]helicene (Q[7]H) were synthesized via penta&#8208;fold Heck and Mallory reaction. Notably, Q[7]H represents the highest reported helicene based on corannulene. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that Q[6]H&#8208;2 adopts a propeller&#8208;shaped conformation with a well&#8208;preserved corannulene core, while Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[7]H exhibit quasi&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped conformations. Upon heating, conformer Q[6]H&#8208;1 undergoes conversion to the thermodynamically more stable conformer Q[6]H&#8208;2, whereas conformer Q[7]H remains unchanged due to larger steric congestion. Racemization of the enantiomer of Q[6]H&#8208;1 and conformational conversion were observed simultaneously at elevated temperature, with DFT studies indicating a racemization barrier of 28.64 kcal&#183;mol&#8208;1. In contrast, the racemization barrier for Q[6]H&#8208;2 was calculated to be 45.46 kcal&#183;mol&#8208;1, indicating exceptional chiral stability. Surprisingly, the bowl inversions of Q[6]H&#8208;1 and Q[6]H&#8208;2 conformers are somewhat inhibited by the helical blades, whereas this was not observed for other possible conformers of Q[6]H. These results first demonstrated that subtle conformational variations can lead to significant changes in chiral stability and bowl inversions of multihelicenes. Due to the well&#8208;preserved corannulene core, propeller&#8208;shaped conformation and electron complementarity, Q[6]H&#8208;2 can recognize fullerenes in both solution and solid state, which is a rare instance of co&#8208;crystallization assembly between multiple helicenes and fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline NiO for Industrial&#8208;Scale Electrocatalytic PET Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of plastic waste into valuable chemicals through innovative and selective nano&#8208;catalysts offers significant economic benefits and positive environmental impacts. However, our current understanding of catalyst design capable of achieving industrial&#8208;grade current densities is limited. Herein, we develop a self&#8208;supported amorphous&#8208;crystalline NiO electrocatalyst for the electrocatalytic upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into formate and hydrogen (H2) fuel. The catalyst achieves an industrial current density of over 1 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE, with an 80% Faradaic efficiency and a formate production rate of 7.16 mmol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1. In situ Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations reveal that the rapid transformation of amorphous&#8208;crystalline NiO into &#947;&#8208;NiOOH at the amorphous&#8208;crystalline interface provides a thermodynamic advantage for formate desorption, leading to the high activity required for industrial applications, which is difficult to achieve for fully crystalline NiO. A techno&#8208;economic analysis indicates that recycling waste PET using this catalytic process could generate a profit of $501 per ton. This work presents a cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient approach to promoting the sustainable utilization of waste PET.</dc:description>

         <title>A Crystalline Mesoionic Diazasilole Featuring Low&#8208;Valent Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole containing a low&#8208;valent silicon atom has been synthesized employing a bulky imino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand. This molecular structure is characterized by a mesoionic C2N2Si five&#8208;membered ring, notable for its delocalized &#960; electrons, intrinsic charge&#8208;separated zwitterionic properties, and a distinctly nucleophilic silicon center, culminating in 6&#960; aromaticity. This compound manifests either mesoionic silylene or silylone characteristics upon coordination with transition metals. Demonstrating extraordinary versatility, this compound engages in diverse reactions such as coordination with iron or iridium, oxidation by S8, intramolecular ring saturation under the coordination influence of iridium, silicon atom transfer facilitated by Ph2Se2, ring contraction induced by Ph2Te2, and skeletal rearrangement triggered by Et3N&#8226;HCl. These reactions culminate in the formation of a variety of unprecedented silicon&#8208;based heterocycles, which are typically formidable to achieve using conventional methods. This study unveils previously unexplored facets of low&#8208;valent 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole, positioning it as a promising foundational building block for future innovations in unique silicon compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Homologation of Alkenyl Carbonyls via a Cyclopropanation/Light&#8208;Mediated Selective C&#8208;C Cleavage Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein our studies on the direct photoactivation of carbonyl cyclopropanes to give biradical intermediates, leading to selective cleavage of the more substituted carbon&#8208;carbon bond. Depending on the substrate structure, extended alkenes were isolated or directly reacted in a photo&#8208;Nazarov process to give bicyclic products. Based on these results, a unified reductive ring&#8208;opening reaction was developed by using diphenyl disulfide as a HAT reagent. By performing a sequential cyclopropanation/selective ring opening reaction, we achieved a CH2 insertion into the &#945;,&#946; bond of both acyclic and cyclic unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Our protocol provides a further tool for the modification of the carbon framework of organic compounds, complementing the recent progress in &#8220;skeletal editing&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>The Operando Nature of Isobutene Adsorbed in Zeolite&#160; H&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13 Unraveled by Machine Learning Potentials Beyond DFT&#160; Accuracy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the nature of adsorbed olefins in zeolites is crucial to understand numerous zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. A well&#8208;grounded theoretical description critically depends on both an accurate determination of the potential energy surface (PES) and a reliable account of entropic effects at operating conditions. Herein, we propose a transfer learning approach to perform random phase approximation (RPA) quality enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, thereby approaching chemical accuracy on both the determination and exploration of the PES. The proposed methodology is used to investigate isobutene adsorption in H&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13 as prototypical system to estimate the relative stability of physisorbed olefins, carbenium ions and surface alkoxide species (SAS) in Br&#246;nsted&#8208;acidic zeolites. We show that the tert&#8208;butyl carbenium ion formation is highly endothermic and no entropic stabilization is observed compared to the physisorbed complex within H&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13. Hence, its predicted concentration and lifetime are negligible, making a direct experimental observation unlikely. Yet, it remains a shallow minimum on the free energy surface over the whole considered temperature range (273&#8208;&#8208;873 K), being therefore a short&#8208;lived reaction intermediate rather than a transition state species.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Generation of Alkoxide Radical from Alcohols on Microdroplets Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water microdroplets have been demonstrated to exhibit extraordinary chemical behaviors, including the abilities to accelerate chemical reactions by several orders of magnitude and to trigger reactions that cannot occur in bulk water. One of the most striking examples is the spontaneous generation of hydroxyl radical from hydroxide ions. Alcohols and alkoxide ions, being structurally similar to water and hydroxide ions, might exhibit similar behavior on microdroplets. Here, we report the spontaneous generation of alkoxide radicals from alcohols (RCH2OH) in aqueous microdroplets through quantum chemical calculations, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ab initio MD simulations, and mass spectrometry. Our results show that an electric field (EF) on the order of 10&#8208;1 V/&#197; and partial solvation at the air&#8210;water interface jointly promote the dissociation of RCH2OH into RCH2O&#8208; and H3O+ ions. QM/MM MD simulations indicate that RCH2O&#8208; can be ionized to produce RCH2O&#8226; radicals on the microdroplet surface. Furthermore, partial solvation and the EF collaboratively catalyze the isomerization of the RCH2O&#8226; radical into a more stable tautomer, R&#8226;CHOH. This study highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the widespread generation of radicals at the microdroplet surface and provides insights into the importance of fundamental alcohol chemistry in the atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;H &#945;&#8208;Acetylation: Generation of Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;substituted ketones are important chemical targets as synthetic intermediates as well as functionalities in in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We report the &#945;&#8208;acetylation of C(sp3)&#8208;H substrates R&#8208;H with arylmethyl ketones ArC(O)Me to provide &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones ArC(O)CH2R at RT with&#160;tBuOOtBu as oxidant via copper(I) &#946;&#8208;diketiminato catalysts. Proceeding via alkyl radicals R&#8226;, this method enables &#945;&#8208;substitution with bulky substituents without competing elimination that occurs in more traditional alkylation reactions between enolates and alkyl electrophiles. DFT studies suggest the intermediacy of copper(II) enolates [CuII](CH2C(O)Ar) that capture alkyl radicals R&#8226; to give R&#8208;CH2C(O)Ar under competing dimerization of the copper(II) enolate to give the 1,4&#8208;diketone ArC(O)CH2CH2C(O)Ar.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte for All&#8208;Carbon Rechargeable Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries with Durable Interfacial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;based rechargeable dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) based on graphite anode&#8208;cathode combinations have received much attention due to their high resource abundance and low cost. Currently, the practical realization of the batteries is hindered by easy oxidation of the electrolyte at the cathode interface, and solvent co&#8208;intercalation at the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Configuration of a &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte with a high concentration of Li salt is expected to stabilize the electrolyte chemistry versus both electrodes, yet inevitably reduces the mobility of the solvated working ions and increases the cost of the electrolyte. Herein, we propose to build a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte by adding hydrofluoroether as the diluent to reduce the salt content while improving the solvation structure, allowing more anions to enter the inner solvation sheath. The new electrolyte helps to form uniform and thin interfaces, with elevated contents of inorganic fluorides, on both electrodes, which effectively suppress electrolyte oxidation at the cathode and optimize electrolyte&#8208;electrode compatibility at the anode while facilitating charge transfer across the interface. Consequently, the DIBs with graphite as anode and cathode operate for 3000 cycles and retain a high&#8208;capacity retention of 95.7%, highlighting the importance of stable interfacial chemistry in boosting the electrochemical performance of DIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural Polyphenol&#8208;Reinforced Ion&#8208;Selective Separators for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with High Sulfur Loading and Lean Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;selective separators are promising to inhibit soluble intermediates shuttle in practical lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. However, designing and fabricating such high&#8208;performance ion&#8208;selective separators using cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly, and versatile methods remains a formidable challenge. Here we present ion&#8208;selective separators fabricated via the spontaneous deposition of green tea&#8208;derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator, aimed at enhancing the stability of Li&#8208;S batteries. The resulting natural polyphenol&#8208;reinforced ion&#8208;selective (NPRIS24) separators exhibit rapid Li ion transport and high soluble intermediates inhibition capability with an ultralow shuttle rate of 0.67% for Li2S4, 0.19% for Li2S6 and 0.10% for Li2S8. This superior ion&#8208;selectivity arises from the high electronegativity and strong lithiophilic nature of the phenolic compounds. Consequently, we have achieved high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries that are steadily cyclable under the challenging conditions of an S loading of 5.7 mg cm&#8722;2, an electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;S ratio of 5.1 &#956;L mg&#8722;1, and a 50 &#956;m Li foil anode. Furthermore, the NPRIS24 separator enhances the performance of other Li metal batteries utilizing commercial LiFePO4 (5.3 mg cm&#8722;2) and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (9.9 mg cm&#8722;2) cathodes. This work underscores the potential of utilizing natural polyphenols for the design of advanced ion&#8208;selective separators in energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Anthracene&#8208;Fused Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole: Synthesis, Structure, Assembly with C60, and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of bowl&#8208;shaped antiaromatic molecules represents a formidable challenge, because the molecular distortion further destabilizes these already inherently reactive molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of bowl&#8208;shaped fused anthrylnorcorroles that exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption reaching 1900 nm. The oxidation of meso&#8208;anthryldibromodipyrrin provides fused anthryldibromodipyrrin, which was converted to the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles through Ni(0)&#8208;mediated intramolecular coupling with a bis(dibromodipyrrin) Ni(II) complex. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed bowl&#8208;shaped structures for the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles, which enables them to act as suitable receptors for C60 with bonding constants of 2.89 &#215; 103 M&#8211;1 and 1.59 &#215; 103 M&#8211;1, respectively. The formation of a 1:1 complex between the fused monoanthrylnorcorrole and C60 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The effective expansion of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the triple fusion of the norcorrole with the anthracene units substantially enhances the near&#8208;infrared absorption bands, which endows these anthrylnorcorroles with effective photothermal conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen Generation with Low Cost</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Here, we develop an innovative and efficient membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis system to overcome these two obstacles simultaneously. This system utilizes the thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to generate clean N2 over a new class of Cu&#8208;based catalyst (CuXO), fundamentally eliminating the explosion risk of H2 and O2 mixing while removing the need for membranes. Notably, this membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system exhibits the highest H2 Faradaic efficiency among reported membrane&#8208;free electrolysis work. In situ spectroscopic studies reveal that the new N2Hy intermediate&#8208;mediated UOR mechanism on the CuXO catalyst ensures its unique N2 selectivity and OER inertness. More importantly, an industrial&#8208;type membrane&#8208;free water electrolyser (MFE) based on this system successfully reduces electricity consumption to only 3.87 kWh Nm&#8722;3, significantly lower than the 5.17 kWh Nm&#8722;3 of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE). Comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) suggests that the membrane&#8208;free design and reduced electricity input of the MFE plants reduce the green H2 production cost to US$1.81 kg&#8722;1, which is lower than those of grey H2 while meeting the technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50 kg&#8722;1) set by European Commission and United States Department of Energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Structure&#8208;Induced Selective Interactions Enables High&#8208;Performance and Burn&#8208;in&#8208;Free Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomeric acceptors (OAs) have attracted considerable attention in the organic photovoltaics (OPV) field owing to their capacity in balancing the merits from both monomeric and polymeric acceptors. A delicate control over the distortion between blocks of OAs usually determines the performance and stability of relevant OPV devices. However, it imposes great complexity to realize a controllable degree of distortion by tuning the skeleton of blocks and the position of linker between blocks. Herein, we developed a facile strategy to rationally control the geometry distortion of OAs via a straightforward substitution of alkoxy side&#8208;chains on their blocks. This helps elucidate the integrated influences of molecular distortion and non&#8208;bonded contacts on the selective interactions between OA molecules and between OA and host acceptor in ternary blend. We demonstrate the alkoxy&#8208;OA molecules having stronger self&#8208;interactions would mitigate their interactions with host acceptor, therefore alleviating the kinetic diffusion and excessive aggregation of total acceptors. Combining with a composite&#8208;interlayer strategy by introducing a phenyl&#8208;substituted self&#8208;assembled monolayer to enhance the doping with polyoxometalate, an impressive efficiency of 20.1% is achieved accompanied by a negligible burn&#8208;in loss against physical aging. This study demonstrates the validation of tuning of selective interactions towards high&#8208;performance and burn&#8208;in&#8208;free OPV.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium Carbonate as an Ionic Molecular Lock for Ultrastrong Fluorescence of Single Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Locking molecular conformation are widely applied in molecular engineering for improved performance. However, locking via organic functional groups often changes the original molecular properties. Following the rigidity and stability of ionic interaction in ionic compounds, we suggested the use of a molecular&#8208;scale ionic compound, calcium carbonate oligomer, as a robust molecular segment to functionalize organic molecules. The rigid structure of the ionic molecular segments locked the organic molecules, which could remarkably limit the intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions. This ensured a stable and ultrastrong fluorescence of the single organic molecule while preserving its original maximum emission wavelength. The locking strategy was general and extendable to multiple organic molecules. Additionally, the ultrastrong single&#8208;molecular fluorescence can be maintained in inorganic solids with even higher quantum yields and almost unchanged maximum emission wavelength. The highest quantum yield of the investigated molecules reached 99.9%, superior to all reported organic&#8210;inorganic fluorescent composite under air conditions. This work demonstrates a general strategy to restrict intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions by using ionic oligomers as molecular locks, providing an alternative method for realizing ultraemissive molecules. This further demonstrates a fascinating example of molecular engineering in the presence of inorganic ionic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Ethane&#8208;like Dianionic Diborane(6) in Monometallic Titanium Complexes and its Subsequent B(sp3)&#8208;B(sp3) Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Treatment of [Cp*TiCl3] with [LiBH4&#8729;THF] followed by thermolysis with [Ph2E2] (E = S or Se) resulted in the formation of classical diborane(6) complexes, [(Cp*Ti)(&#951;4&#8208;B2H4LL')] (L = C6H4E; L' = C6H5E; 1a: E = S, 1b: E = Se), stabilized at titanium template. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first examples of mono&#8208;metallic classical diborane(6) complexes. The bonding analysis and theoretical studies suggest that the stabilization of these diborane(6) species is due to the presence of four bridging ligands in &#312;4&#8208;fashion, where two of them are phenyl thiolates/selenolates that provide more electrons to the electron&#8208;deficient titanium center. Reactions of these diborane(6) species with [M(CO)5&#8729;THF] (M = Mo, W) led to the cleavage of &#160;electron&#8208;precise B(sp3)&#8208;B(sp3) bond that yielded &#312;3&#8208;hydridoborato complexes [(Cp*Ti)(&#312;3&#8208;BH3R)(&#956;&#8208;EPh)2{M(CO)4}] (2a&#8208;c: R = H, 3a&#8208;c: R = Ph). In an attempt to isolate the Te&#8208;analogue of 1a&#8208;b, a similar reaction was performed; however, the complex was too unstable to be isolated. Interestingly, the treatment of this unstable intermediate with [W(CO)5&#8729;THF] yielded [(Cp*Ti)(&#312;3&#8208;BH3R)(&#956;&#8208;TePh)2{W(CO)4}] (2d: R = H, 3d: R = Ph) that are analogues of 2a&#8208;c and 3a&#8208;c, respectively. Formation of these species provide indirect evidence for&#160;existence of unstable [(Cp*Ti)(&#951;4&#8208;B2H4LL')] (L = C6H4Te; L' = C6H5Te; 1c).</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone Catalyzed by a Simple Organoaluminum Complex to Prepare Closed&#8208;loop Recyclable Functional Polyester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) as a bio&#8208;renewable bifunctional monomer has shown great promise to prepare closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyester with pendent functionalizable double bond. However, the chemoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of MVL still faces challenges including low polymerization temperature, expensive catalyst as well as high catalyst loading. In this contribution, we present the chemoselective and controlled ROP of MVL using a simple organoaluminum complex [MeAl(BHT)2] (BHT = 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy), which can be easily prepared from commercially available trimethylaluminum and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol without purification. MeAl(BHT)2 exhibits much higher catalytic activity (TOF = 668 h&#8208;1) than that of MeAl[Salen] (TOF = 89 h&#8208;1), a commonly used organoaluminum catalyst. The high chemoselectivity and activity of MeAl(BHT)2 is proposed to originate from the cooperative activation of propagating chain&#8208;ends and monomers via the "coordination&#8208;insertion" mechanism. Remarkably, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight P(MVL)ROP can be prepared in bulk using MeAl(BHT)2, which is not accessible by the previous catalysts. This study may advance the development of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers considering the easy preparation, low cost and good catalytic performance of MeAl(BHT)2.</dc:description>

         <title>Nuclear Quantum Effects Have a Significant Impact on UV/Vis Absorption Spectra of Chromophores in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the broadly acknowledged importance of solvation&#160;effects on measured UV/Vis spectra in the context of&#160;solvatochromism or chemical reactions in solution, it is still an open challenge to calculate UV/Vis spectra with predictive accuracy. This is particularly true when it comes to the&#160;impact of nuclear quantum effects on these experimental&#160;observables. In the present work, we calculate the UV/Vis&#160;absorption spectrum of indole in aqueous solution with a&#160;combination of a correlated wavefunction method for computing electronic excitation energies&#160;and enhanced path integral&#160;simulations for rigorous&#160;sampling of nuclear configurations including&#160;the quantum effects in solution.&#160;After&#160;validating our approach based on gas&#8208;phase benchmarking, we demonstrate that the lineshape of&#160;the spectrum measured in aqueous solution is quantitatively recovered,&#160;without the application of any shifting, scaling, or broadening,&#160;only after including nuclear quantum effects in addition&#160;to thermal fluctuations and solvation at ambient conditions.&#160;Our findings demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects are&#160;"visible" in UV/Vis spectra of chromophores measured in solution even at room temperature and, therefore, that&#160;they must be considered computationally to achieve predictive accuracy.</dc:description>

         <title>Multidentate Chelating Ligands Enable High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Bromine Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc bromine flow battery (ZBFB) is a promising battery technology for stationary energy storage. However, challenges specific to zinc anodes must be resolved, including zinc dendritic growth, hydrogen evolution reaction, and the occurrence of "dead zinc". Traditional additives suppress side reactions and zinc dendrite formation by altering the solvation structure of Zn2+ and adsorbing onto the zinc surface through only a limited number of zincophilic sites, resulting in weak adsorption on zinc metal and potential inability to simultaneously optimize the solvation structure of zinc ions. Obviously, increasing the number of potential zincophilic sites in the additive can significantly enhance the interaction with zinc. Herein, we propose a strong chelate, ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMPA) as the additive, which boasts six potent zincophilic sites, not only promotes the formation of the water&#8208;deficient inner Helmholtz plane but also plays a crucial role in restructuring the solvation environment of Zn2+. As a result, the zinc symmetric flow battery with EDTMPA exhibited exceptional coulombic efficiency of 99.4% over 800 cycles, surpassing the previous studies by a significant margin. Furthermore, the assembled ZBFB has showcased a dendrite&#8208;free and enduring cycling over 400 cycles at 80 mA cm&#8722;2.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zinc bromine flow battery (ZBFB) is a promising battery technology for stationary energy storage. However, challenges specific to zinc anodes must be resolved, including zinc dendritic growth, hydrogen evolution reaction, and the occurrence of "dead zinc". Traditional additives suppress side reactions and zinc dendrite formation by altering the solvation structure of Zn2+ and adsorbing onto the zinc surface through only a limited number of zincophilic sites, resulting in weak adsorption on zinc metal and potential inability to simultaneously optimize the solvation structure of zinc ions. Obviously, increasing the number of potential zincophilic sites in the additive can significantly enhance the interaction with zinc. Herein, we propose a strong chelate, ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMPA) as the additive, which boasts six potent zincophilic sites, not only promotes the formation of the water-deficient inner Helmholtz plane but also plays a crucial role in restructuring the solvation environment of Zn2+.

         <title>Binary Iron&#8208;Manganese Cocatalyst for Simultaneous Activation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O Bonds to Maximally Utilize Lignin for Syngas Generation over InGaN</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;powered lignin reforming offers a carbon&#8208;neutral route for syngas production. This study explores a dual non&#8208;precious iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst to simultaneously activate both C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O bonds for maximizing the utilization of various substituents of native lignin to yield syngas. By assembling with InGaN nanowires on a Si wafer, the as&#8208;designed dual FeMn cocatalyst affords a measurable syngas evolution rate of 42.4 mol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 from native lignin in distilled water with a high selectivity of 93% and tunable H2/CO ratios under concentrated light, leading to a considerable light&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency of 11.8%. The high FeMn atom efficiency arising from the 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructure of InGaN enables the achievement of a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 220896 mol syngas per mol FeMn per hour. By correlating exploration&#160;experiments,&#160;the critical role of the dual FeMn cocatalyst in the evolving mechanism of lignin and water toward syngas is disclosed at the atomic level. It is discovered that the synergetic iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst supported by InGaN nanowires enables simultaneous activation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O bonds with comparable minimized dissociation energies.&#160;This work demonstrates a new and earth&#8208;abundant bifunctional cocatalyst for utilizing various substituents of lignin to produce syngas powered by sunlight beyond fossil fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Masked Divalent Reactivity of Heterobimetallic Lanthanide Isocarbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new rare&#8208;earth reduction system is described in which trivalent yttrium and dysprosium react as though present in their unstable divalent oxidation state. This masked divalent reactivity is achieved using the isocarbonyl&#8208;bridged dimers [(Cpttt2M)(&#956;&#8208;Fp)]2 (M = Y, 1Y; M = Dy, 1Dy; Cpttt = 1,2,4&#8208;C5tBu3H2; Fp = CpFe(CO)2), where the reducing electrons originate from the bridging [Fp]&#8211; ligands. The reactivity of 1Y and 1Dy is showcased by reducing the N&#8208;heterocycles 2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (bipy), phenazine (phnz) and hexaazatrinaphthylene (HAN) to give corresponding mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;metallic rare&#8208;earth complexes, respectively, with the heterocyclic ligands present in their singly, doubly and triply reduced forms, respectively. The dynamic magnetic properties of the dysprosium compounds are described. Compound 1Dy is a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) with an appreciable energy barrier of 449(17) cm&#8211;1, whereas [(Cpttt2Dy)2(m&#8208;phnz)] (3Dy) is not an SMM because of a strong, competing equatorial crystal field. Surprisingly, [(Cpttt2Dy)3(HAN)] (4Dy) is also not an SMM, the origins of which are traced to the impact of the tert&#8208;butyl substituents on the dysprosium centre and its interaction with the radical [HAN]3&#8211; ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar order in a fluid like ferroelectric with a tilted lamellar structure &#8211; observation of a polar smectic C (SmCP) phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of fluid states of matter with spontaneous bulk polar order is appreciated as a major discovery in the fields of soft matter and liquid crystals. Typically, this manifests as polar order superimposed atop conventional phase structures and is thus far limited to orthogonal phase types. Here we report a family of materials which exhibit a previously unseen state of matter which we conclude is a polar smectic C phase, and so we term it SmCP. The spontaneous polarisation of the SmCP phase is over two orders of magnitude larger than that found in conventional ferroelectric SmC phase of chiral materials used in some LCD devices. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations faithfully and spontaneously reproduce the proposed structure and associated bulk properties; comparison of experimental and simulated X&#8208;ray scattering patterns shows excellent agreement. The materials disclosed here have significantly smaller dipole moments than typical polar liquid crystals such as RM734 which suggests the role of molecular electrical polarity in generating polar order is perhaps overstated, a view supported by consideration of other molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Deuteration and Tritiation of Pharmaceutically Relevant Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pharmaceutical&#8208;aligned research endeavors continue to diversify, including via the installation of new chemical functionality and non&#8208;classical bioisosteres within drug design. With this, an equally high demand emerges for the direct installation of isotopic substituents into these scaffolds within drug discovery programmes, as isotopologues are essential for the elucidation of the biological efficacy and metabolic fate of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The sulfoximine functional group has recently become established as a high&#8208;value unit in this context; however, general and effective methods for the synthesis of deuterium (2H, D) and tritium (3H, T) labelled analogues have remained elusive. Herein, we disclose the design and development of the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed sulfoximine&#8208;directed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) systems that permit the site&#8208;selective integration of a distinguishing atomic label at aromatic C(sp2)&#8211;H and more challenging C(sp3)&#8211;H moieties. Moreover, we exemplify the broad applicability of these methods within a spectrum of molecular settings, as well as in the late&#8208;stage generation of isotopically&#8208;enriched complex bioactive architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Interweavable Metalloporphyrin&#8208;based Fibers for Indirect Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The applications of indirect electrocatalysis toward potential industrial processes are drastically limited by the utilization or processing forms of electrocatalysts. The remaining challenges of electrocatalysts like the recycling in homogeneous systems or pulverization in heterogeneous systems call for advanced processing forms to meet the desired requirements. Here, we report a series of metalloporphyrin&#8208;based polymer fibers (M&#8208;PF, M = Ni, Cu and Zn) through a rigid&#8208;flexible polymerization strategy based on rigid metalloporphyrin and flexible thiourea units that can be applied as heterogenous redox&#8208;mediators in indirect electrocatalysis. These functional fibers with high strength and flexibility exhibit interweavable and designable functions that can be processed into different fiber&#8208;forms like knotted, two&#8208;spiral, three&#8208;ply, five&#8208;ply fibers or even interweaved networks. Interestingly, they can be readily applied in S&#8208;S bond cleaving/cyclization reaction or extended oxidative self&#8208;coupling reaction of thiols with high efficiency. Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (1.25 g in a batch&#8208;experiment) under laboratory conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction on Cup&#8208;Stacked Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes feature one&#8208;dimensional nature of collective excitations, wherein strong confinement of surface plasmons severely hinders the liberation of hot electrons (HEs), posing grand challenges for their utilization in photochemistry. In this study, we prototypically achieved directed HEs flow and extraction in hybrid plasmonic CNN based on cup&#8208;stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs), taking advantage of their privileged edge&#8208;plane sites. The localized pz electronic states and accessible intersubband plasmon excitations in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regime stands in striking contrast to the conventional concentric carbon nanotubes, as evidenced by combined photo&#8208;induced force microscopy (PiFM) and transient photocurrent response. The hybrid comprising intimately integrated CSCNTs&#8208;C3N4 effectively sustains interfacial electronic states and underlies the energy extraction out of plasmonic components.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanotubes feature one-dimensional nature of collective excitations, wherein strong confinement of surface plasmons severely hinders the liberation of hot electrons (HEs), posing grand challenges for their utilization in photochemistry. In this study, we prototypically achieved directed HEs flow and extraction in hybrid plasmonic CNN based on cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs), taking advantage of their privileged edge-plane sites. The localized pz electronic states and accessible intersubband plasmon excitations in the near-infrared (NIR) regime stands in striking contrast to the conventional concentric carbon nanotubes, as evidenced by combined photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM) and transient photocurrent response. The hybrid comprising intimately integrated CSCNTs-C3N4 effectively sustains interfacial electronic states and underlies the energy extraction out of plasmonic components. The CNN demonstrates almost near-unity NIR light-driven CO2 reduction to CO with a rate of 1.35 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1. This work sheds light on the exploitation of metal-free carbon-based plasmonic nanostructures for photocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Quantum Efficiency via Co&#8208;substitution in Sr2[MgAl5N7]:Eu2+ for Spectroscopic Applications including Laser Displays with Ultra&#8208;high Luminescence Saturation Threshold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of Sr2[Mg1&#8208;xLixAl5&#8208;xSixN7]:0.01Eu2+ (SMAN&#8208;xLS, 0&#8804;x&#8804;0.5) red phosphors were devised and synthesized via the high temperature solid state reaction and the effects of the co&#8208;substitution of [Mg&#8208;Al]5+ by [Li&#8208;Si]5+ on structural and luminescence properties is investigated. With the entry of [Li&#8208;Si]5+ into theSr2[MgAl5N7]:0.01Eu2+ (SMAN) lattice, the substitution of Al3+ by Si4+ shifts the emission peak from 657 nm to 647 nm and reduces the excitation in green region. When the amount of [Li&#8208;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution is x=0.1, the luminescence intensity and thermal stability of the sample are enhanced, in which the external quantum efficiency is elevated by 49.6%. The increase in lattice rigidity gives rise to higher luminescence intensity, and the introduced trap levels for the compensation of luminescence enhances the thermal stability. Under blue laser excitation, the SMAN&#8208;0.1LS can achieve an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22W/mm2, which is a breakthrough performance that has enormous potential for application in high&#8208;power laser display light sources. By measuring the pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS, the emission peak can be shifted from 650 nm to 702 nm with the increase of pressure, and the sensitivity d&#955;/dP is 5.07 nm/GPa, which is indicative of the potential application of this system as an optical pressure sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Norbornadiene&#8208;Derived Infrared Transparent Polymers by Inverse Vulcanization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared (IR) transparent polymer materials prepared by inverse vulcanization, as a promising candidate to replace inorganic materials, are new materials for constructing key devices in IR optics. However, it is difficult to achieve a balance between infrared optical and thermal properties in polymers due to the intrinsic infrared absorption of organic materials. Herein, our strategy is to construct a high boiling point symmetrical molecular norbornadiene derivative cross&#8208;linking agent (DMMD) which can be inverse vulcanized with molten sulfur, and obtain Poly(S&#8208;r&#8208;DMMD) with different sulfur content by controlling the feed ratio of sulfur. With the rigid core and low IR activity in DMMD, the prepared polymers exhibit tunable thermal properties (Tg: 98.3&#8208;119.8 &#176;C) and high IR transmittance (medium&#8208;wave infrared region (MWIR): 42.9&#8208;52.6 %; long&#8208;wave infrared region (LWIR): 1.5&#8208;5.29 %). In addition, Poly(S&#8208;r&#8208;DMMD) can be used to prepare large&#8208;size free&#8208;standing Fresnel lenses for IR imaging by simple hot&#8208;pressing, which provides flexibility in the design and production of IR fine lenses. This study provides a novel strategy for balancing the thermal and optical properties of IR transparent polymer materials, while providing relevant references for balancing the IR optical and thermal properties of polymer materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Modulation and Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Engineering of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Driving Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and durable single&#8208;atom catalysts is vitally important for the sulfur redox reaction (SROR) in Li&#8208;S battery, while it remains enormous challenging. Herein, undercoordinated Ni&#8208;N3 moieties anchored on N,S&#8208;codoped porous carbon (Ni&#8208;NSC) is obtained to enhance the SROR. The experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer in Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst originates from tuning effect of sulfur atoms mediated Ni&#8208;N3 moieties, which can both facilitate the chemical adsorption by formation of N&#8208;Ni&#8943;Sn2&#8208;, and achieve a rapid redox conversion of polysulfides because of the enhanced electron transfer. As results, the Ni&#8208;NSC based Li&#8208;S battery delivers a very high initial reversible capacity (1025 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 C), as well as outstanding cycling&#8208;stability for 2400 cycles at 2 C and 3 C, respectively. Noteworthy, the areal capacity can reach 7.8 mAh cm&#8208;2 at 0.05 C and a retention capacity of 4.7 mAh cm&#8208;2 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C for Ni&#8208;NSC based Li&#8208;S battery with sulfur loading of 5.88 mg cm&#8208;2. This work provides profound insight for rational optimizing microscopic electronic density of active site to promoting SROR in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Infusion Induced Reconstruction Enhancing Multifunctional Thermally Conductive Films with Robust Low&#8208;Frequency Electromagnetic Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deterministic fabrication of highly thermally conductive composite film with satisfying low&#8208;frequency electromagnetic (EM) absorption performance exhibits great potential in advancing the application of 5G smart electric devices but persists challenge. Herein, a multifunctional flexible film combined with hetero&#8208;structured Fe6W6C&#8208;FeWO4@C (FWC&#8208;O@C) as the absorber and aramid nanofibers (ANFs) as the matrix was prepared. Driven by an atomic gradient infusion reduction strategy, the carbon atoms of absorbers can be precisely relocated from carbon shell to core oxometallate lattice and trigger in&#8208;situ carbothermic reduction for customizing unique oxometallate&#8208;carbide heterojunctions and deforming the surface geometrical structure. Such an atoms reconstruction process effectively regulates interface electronic structure and magnetic configuration, resulting in enhanced polarization loss from abundant heterointerfaces and crystal defects and magnetic loss from hierarchical structure endowed magnetic coupling interaction, which jointly contributes to the efficient low&#8208;frequency EM absorption performance. Eventually, optimized FWC&#8208;O@C microplate exhibits a broad absorption bandwidth surpassed the entire C band, and the assembled Fe6W6C&#8208;FeWO4@C/ANF composite film also performs a high thermal conductivity over 2500% higher than that of the pure ANF. These findings provide a new insight into the atomic reconstruction affected EM properties and a generalized methodological guidance for preparing multifunctional thermally conductive composite films.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of Anhydrotuberosin as a STING Antagonist for Treating Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excessive activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway has been identified as a significant contributor to various autoimmune diseases, such as STING&#8208;associated vasculopathy with infantile&#8208;onset (SAVI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, discovering effective STING antagonists for treating STING&#8208;mediated autoimmune disorders remains challenging. Herein, we identified the natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) as a potent STING antagonist by a high&#8208;throughput chemical screen and follow&#8208;up biological validations. However, the limited supply from natural product isolation impeded the pharmacological evaluations of ATS. Accordingly, we developed a concise and scalable total synthesis of ATS in 6 steps.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Excessive activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway has been identified as a significant contributor to various autoimmune diseases, such as STING-associated vasculopathy with infantile-onset (SAVI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, discovering effective STING antagonists for treating STING-mediated autoimmune disorders remains challenging. Herein, we identified the natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) as a potent STING antagonist by a high-throughput chemical screen and follow-up biological validations. However, the limited supply from natural product isolation impeded the pharmacological evaluations of ATS. Accordingly, we developed a concise and scalable total synthesis of ATS in 6 steps. Enabled by total synthesis, we further extensively investigated ATS&#8217;s mode of action and evaluated its therapeutic potential. Remarkably, ATS inhibits STING signaling in PBMCs derived from three SAVI patients.&#160; ATS showed decent pharmacokinetic parameters and strongly alleviated tissue inflammation in DSS-induced IBD colitis and Trex1-/- autoimmune animal models with low toxicity. Collectively, this research lays the foundation for developing novel STING antagonists as an effective therapy for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Electric Double Layer via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Stable Solid/Electrolyte Interphase on Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the cationic solvation structure with high donor&#8208;number (DN) additive is an effective strategy to construct a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Mg anode, which necessitates meticulous consideration of electrolyte chemistry and substantial quantities of additives. Notably, the electric double layer (EDL) adjacent to anode is pivotal role in SEI formation yet remains understudied. In this study, we propose a novel self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy by utilizing (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFTMS, only 2 vol%, 1.4 mol%, 0.135 mol L&#8208;1), a low DN but strong Mg metal absorbability through electron&#8208;withdrawing groups(&#8722;CF3), to modulate the complex structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane. Through dipole&#8722;dipole interaction between the electronegative fluorine (&#8722;CF3 of TFTMS) and electropositive hydrogen (&#8722;CH3/&#8722;CH2 of solvents), TFTMS weakens solvent&#8722;Mg2+ coordination and thus enhances anion&#8722;Mg2+ interaction, inducing a stable and dense SEI with superior electronic insulation to realize horizontal Mg plating/stripping. Consequently, the designed electrolytes enable the symmetric cells to cycle stable for up to 1000 hours and reversible Mg plating/stripping under 5 mA cm&#8208;2, they show favorable compatibility with various cathodes. More importantly, the SAM strategy has good generality in other electrolyte systems, demonstrating a simple and effective route to promote the practical application of rechargeable magnesium battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive C(sp2)&#8211;Si Cross&#8208;Couplings by Catalytic Sodium&#8208;Bromine Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;halogen exchange reaction constitutes one of the most important preparative routes towards polar organometallic reagents such as aryllithium or Grignard reagents. However, despite extensive developments over the past eight decades, this fundamental organometallic elementary step has only been exploited stoichiometrically. Against this background, we demonstrate that the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction can be implemented in a catalytic setting as a mean to activate C(sp2)&#8211;Br bonds in a transition metal&#8208;free manner en route to the regioselective and general preparation of (hetero)aryl silanes. Simply treating structurally diverse (hetero)aryl bromides with N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes (tBu&#8211;N=N&#8211;Si) as silylating reagents and inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters yields a range of aromatic organosilicon compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies provide solid evidence for the involvement of tert&#8208;butyl sodium as the C(sp2)&#8211;Br metalating agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Photooxidation of Polyolefins to Produce Materials with In&#8208;chain Ketones and Improved Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a selective photooxidation of commodity postconsumer polyolefins to produce polymers with in&#8208;chain ketones. The reaction does not involve the use of catalyst, metals, or expensive oxidants, and selectively introduces ketone functional groups. Under mild and operationally simple conditions, yields up to 1.23 mol% of in&#8208;chain ketones were achieved. Installation of in&#8208;chain ketones resulted in materials with improved adhesion of the materials and miscibility of mixed plastics relative to the unfunctionalized plastics. The introduction of ketone groups into the polymer backbone allows these materials to react with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks. This strategy allows for the upcycling of mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced performance properties compared to polyolefin blends. Mechanistic studies support the involvement of photoexcited nitroaromatics in consecutive hydrogen and oxygen atom transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Pt Loaded on MOF&#8208;Derived Porous TiO2 with Maxim&#8208;ized Pt Atom Utilization for Selective Hydrogenation of Halonitro&#8208;benzene</title>

         <dc:description>The location control of single atoms relative to supports is challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts, leading to a large proportion of inaccessible single atoms buried under supports. Herein, a &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; strategy is developed to afford single&#8208;atom Pt preferentially dispersed on the outer surface of TiO2. Specifically, a Ti&#8208;MOF confining Pt nanoparticles is converted to PtNPs and TiO2 composite coated by carbon (PtNPs&amp;TiO2@C&#8208;800) at 800 &#176;C in N2. Subsequent thermal&#8208;driven atomization of PtNPs at 600 &#176;C in air produce single&#8208;atom Pt decorated TiO2 (Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600). The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 exhibits superior p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN) selectivity (99%) to PtNPs/TiO2&#8208;400 (45%) and much better activity than Pt1@TiO2&#8208;600 with randomly dispersed Pt1 both outside and inside TiO2 in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB). Mechanism investigations reveal that Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 achieves 100% accessibility of Pt1 and preferably adsorbs the &#8211;NO2 group of p&#8208;CNB while weakly adsorbs &#8211;Cl group of p&#8208;CNB and p&#8208;CAN, promoting catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction between Pt and TiO2 over High&#8208;temperature CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic activities and stability of oxide&#8208;supported metal catalysts are significantly affected by metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI) between oxidic supports and supported metals. The surface properties of the support, such as its phase and defects, are crucial in MSI, including both the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) and electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). In this study, modulation of SMSI was achieved on rutile&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles (NP) over high&#8208;temperature CO2 hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO2&#8722;x overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It is found that oxygen vacancy defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by inhibiting the occurrence of SMSI. Pt/rutile with oxygen vacancies achieves a 301 molCO&#215;gM&#8208;1&#215;h&#8208;1 space time yield and considerably catalytic stability (decreased by 8%) at 800 &#176;C over 100 h time&#8208;on&#8208;stream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the adsorption capacity of Pt NP on the rutile overlayer can be reduced by increasing electron density. Experimental results combined with DFT calculations show that electron transfer from Pt NP to rutile is reduced by the oxygen vacancy defects on Pt/R, preserving the metallic nature of Pt species during CO2 hydrogenation, thereby preventing the formation of SMSI.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Ag/Cu2O interface for efficient neutral CO2 electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbons (C2+) offers a promising pathway to reduce the CO2 and energy losses originating from the carbonate formation. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8211;C coupling brings a significant challenge of achieving high selectivity of a single product (such as ethylene), especially at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt; 300 mA cm&#8722;2). Here, we reported an optimized Ag&#8208;Cu2O interfacial catalyst that exhibited C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.6% at 650 mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Remarkably, it obtained FEC2H4 of 66.0% with a partial current density of 429.1 mA cm&#8722;2, making it stand out among the reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. In situ Raman spectra uncovered that the Ag/Cu2O interfaces enabled a high coverage of *CO around the partially reduced Cu+/Cu0 active sites.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neutral CO2 electroreduction to multi-carbons (C2+) offers a promising pathway to reduce the CO2 and energy losses originating from the carbonate formation. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8211;C coupling brings a significant challenge of achieving high selectivity of a single product (such as ethylene), especially at industrial-relevant current densities (&amp;gt; 300 mA cm&#8722;2). Here, we reported an optimized Ag-Cu2O interfacial catalyst that exhibited C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.6% at 650 mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Remarkably, it obtained FEC2H4 of 66.0% with a partial current density of 429.1 mA cm&#8722;2, making it stand out among the reported Cu-based electrocatalysts. In situ Raman spectra uncovered that the Ag/Cu2O interfaces enabled a high coverage of *CO around the partially reduced Cu+/Cu0 active sites. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrated the enhanced CO formation and C&#8211;C coupling at the Ag/Cu2O interface. This work reported an unprecedented neutral CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 performance and provided an in-depth comprehension of the role of the bimetallic interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Copper(I)&#8208;Iodide Cluster Scintillators for Efficient X&#8208;ray Luminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient scintillators with environmentally friendly compositions, adaptable bandgaps, and robust chemical stability is crucial for modern X&#8208;ray radiography. While copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster crystals show promise, the vast design space of inorganic cores and organic ligands poses challenges for conventional approaches. In this study, we present machine learning&#8208;guided discovery of copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators for efficient X&#8208;ray luminescence imaging. Our findings reveal that combining base learning models with fused features enhances model generalization, achieving an impressive determination coefficient of 0.88. By leveraging this approach, we obtain a high&#8208;performance Cu(I)&#8208;I cluster scintillator, named copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;Butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, which exhibit radioluminescence 56 times stronger than that of PbWO4, and enables a detection limit for X&#8208;rays of 19.6 nGyair s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these scintillators by incorporating them as microfillers in the fabrication of flexible composite scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20 lp mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating promising performance for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppression of Structural Heterogeneity in High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The key to fully realizing the potential of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) lies in balancing their inherent local chemical disordering with the long&#8208;range ordering required for electrochemical applications. Herein, we synthesized a distinctive L10&#8208;(PtIr)(FeMoBi) high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEIs) exhibiting nanoscale long&#8208;range order and atomic scale short&#8208;range disorder via a lattice compensation strategy to mitigate the entropy reduction tendency. The (PtIr)(FeMoBi) catalyst exhibited remarkable activity and selectivity of glycollic acid (GA) production via electrocatalytic waste polymer&#8208;derived ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR). With a mass activity of 5.2 A mgPt&#8211;1 and a Faradic efficiency (FE) for GA of 95 %, it outperformed most previously reported electrocatalysts for selective GA production. The lattice&#8208;compensation effect promotes the homogeneity of Pt and Fe actives sites, facilitating co&#8208;adsorption of EG and OH and reducing the energy barriers for dehydrogenation and OH&#8208;combination processes. This approach effectively avoids the formation of low&#8208;active sites commonly encountered in HEA solid solutions, offering a promising avenue for exploring the complex interplay between catalytic activity and HEI structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Strength in Numbers: A Giant NIR&#8208;II AIEgen with One&#8208;for&#8208;All Phototheranostic Features for Exceptional Orthotopic Bladder Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics that allows the simultaneous implementations of multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities by utilizing a single component, is growing into a sparkling frontier in cancer treatment. Of particular interest is phototheranostic agent with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. Nevertheless, the practical uses of those conventional NIR&#8208;II agents are severely impeded by their unsatisfactory features including insufficient stability, low synthetic yield, to be extended absorption/ emission wavelengths, and inefficient phototheranostic outcomes. Developing exceptional phototheranostic agents is thus highly desirable yet remains formidably challenging. Herein, we synthesized two novel N&#8208;heteroacenes&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II luminogens, namely 2TT&#8208;PPT and 4TT&#8208;PBPT, by respectively employing pyrene&#8208;fused phenaziothiadiazoles and pyrene&#8208;fused bisphenaziothiadiazoles as acceptor skeletons. There is strength in numbers by increasing the fusing rings in N&#8208;heteroacenes moieties and numbers of appended donors. Compared to less ring&#8208;fused 2TT&#8208;PPT, the giant molecule 4TT&#8208;PBPT shows improved photophysical characteristics, such as enhanced light absorbance, red&#8208;shifted wavelengths, higher brightness, favorable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and elevated photothermal conversion efficiency, which render 4TT&#8208;PBPT nanoparticles excellent fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging guided photodynamic&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy for orthotopic bladder cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced UV Light Responsivity in &lt;110&gt;&#8208;Oriented 2D Perovskites Realized by Pressure&#8208;induced Ultrafast Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &lt;100&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites exhibit superior optoelectronic properties, offering significant potential in photovoltaic, light&#8208;emitting, and photodetection applications. Nevertheless, their enlarged interlayer spacing restricts longitudinal carrier transport, thereby limiting its potential applications. While &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskites provide a prospective solution with their compact interlayer spacing, their inherent structure, characterized by octahedra tilting, indirectly hinders carrier transport due to the generation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) caused by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. Here, we adeptly regulate the photoluminescence (PL) from STEs to free excitons (FEs) emission within the 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented (API)PbBr4 single crystal through structure optimization under pressure treatment. Besides, we observed anisotropic FE transport with an anisotropy ratio of 4.97. The exciton mobility reaches a peak of 93.6 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1s&#8208;1 at 2.7 GPa, a value comparable to those of their three&#8208;dimensional (3D) counterparts, which is attributed to a reduction in electron&#8208;phonon coupling and exciton reduced mass. Additionally, this ultrafast exciton transport significantly enhances UV light responsivity, exhibiting an increase of approximately 5000 times at 2.7 GPa in comparison to ambient conditions. These findings highlight the prospective application of 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices through intrinsic structural modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Metal Self&#8208;assemblies of Zirconium&#8208;Tetrahedra and Their Second Harmonic Generation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chirality of metal&#8208;organic cages holds enormous potential for novel applications in diverse fields, while it is relatively rare to employ such asymmetric units for the construction of noncentrosymmetric materials. Herein, by self&#8208;assembling the 4,4',4''&#8208;nitrilotribenzoic acid (H3NBA) with bis(cyclopentadienyl)&#8208;zirconium dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2, Cp = &#951;5&#8208;C5H5) in different solvent conditions, we have obtained three hierarchical packing modes of metallo&#8208;tetrahedra with distinct spatial symmetry groups (designated as Zr&#8208;&#945;, Zr&#8208;&#946;, and Zr&#8208;&#947;). Among them, Zr&#8208;&#945; employs a simple cubic arrangement and is a common centrosymmetric superstructure, which consists of a pair of equimolar metallo&#8208;tetrahedra enantiomers in its unit cell. While Zr&#8208;&#946; results in conglomerates with spontaneous resolution without using any resolving agents, giving rise to two enantiopure entities separately (Zr&#8208;&#946;&#8208;P, Zr&#8208;&#946;&#8208;M). More importantly, Zr&#8208;&#947; breaks the inversion center of symmetry and crystallizes into a racemic yet non&#8208;centrosymmetric superstructure with face&#8208;centered cubic packing mode. Based on the non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature, the hierarchical superstructure Zr&#8208;&#947; displayed good second harmonic generation activities. This work presents a successful instance wherein the reaction solvent induces the modulation of intermolecular packing mode to afford non&#8208;centrosymmetric solid materials, which can greatly promote the development of noncentrosymmetric solid (NCS) materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Energy Transfer from Quantum Dots to Closely&#8208;Bound Dye Molecules without Spectral Overlap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose optical properties can be tuned by altering their size. By combining QDs with dyes we can make hybrid QD&#8208;dye systems exhibiting energy transfer (ET) between QDs and dyes, which is important in sensing and lighting applications. In conventional QDs that need a shell to passivate surface defects, ET usually proceeds through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that requires significant spectral overlap between QD emission and dye absorbance, as well as large oscillator strengths of those transitions. This considerably limits the choice of dyes. In contrast, perovskite QDs do not require passivating shells for bright emission, which makes ET mechanisms beyond FRET accessible. This work explores the design of a CsPbBr3 QD&#8208;dye system to achieve efficient ET from CsPbBr3 QDs to dyes with dimethyl iminium binding groups where the close binding of dyes surface facilitates spatial wavefunction overlap. Using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence experiments, we demonstrate that efficient ET from CsPbBr3 to dyes with minimal spectral overlap proceeds via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type mechanism, which overcomes the conventional restriction of spectral overlap that severely limits the tunability of these systems. This approach opens new avenues for QD&#8208;molecule hybrids for a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Autocatalysis&#8208;Integrated Bioorthogonal (Poly)Catalyst&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Living Cell Membrane Antigens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunoassay methods, notably enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs),&#160;renowned for their signal amplification capabilities, are extensively employed in scientific research and clinical diagnostics. However, the instability of enzymes and their sensitivity to cellular environments present significant challenges for the broad application of ELISA in living cells. In this work, we present a bioorthogonal (poly)catalysis&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (BCLISA) designed for the detection of cell membrane antigens, which&#160;involves&#160;coupling bioorthogonal catalysts based on small molecules or polymers to antibodies. After screening, we opted for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) as the core reaction system. The polymer&#8208;based catalysts exhibit enhanced reactivity at the same molecular concentration due to their multiple catalytic sites. Polytriazoles formed during the CuAAC reaction have the ability to chelate Cu(I),&#160;therebypromoting faster catalysis. By harnessing this autocatalytic feature, we successfully increased the signal amplification potential of BCLISA. Ultimately, this autocatalysis&#8208;integrated BCLISA technique was employed for antigen detection and imaging on both&#160;in vitro&#160;and living cell membranes. This approach&#160;offers&#160;a new method for the detection and imaging of low&#8208;abundance antigens on living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Light (1200&#8197;nm) Irradiation and a Ruthenium&#8208;Intercalated NiAl&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide</title>

         <dc:description>
A NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH photocatalyst showed impressive infrared&#8208;driven CO2 reduction activity at &#955;=1200&#8197;nm (CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;%) and good stability over 50 re&#8208;use cycles. In situ DRIFTs, fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and DFT calculations showed that compressed anionic Ru complexes in LDH interlayers induced a dual charge redistribution phenomenon, narrowing the band gap (0.89&#8197;eV) in the hybrid photocatalyst system to enable efficient infrared&#8208;driven CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction (NIR&#8208;CO2PR) holds tremendous promise for the production of valuable commodity chemicals and fuels. However, designing photocatalysts capable of reducing CO2 with low energy NIR photons remains challenging. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;driven photocatalyst comprising an anionic Ru complex intercalated between NiAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH) is shown to deliver efficient CO2 photoreduction (0.887&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) with CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;% under 1200&#8197;nm illumination and excellent stability over 50 testing cycles. This remarkable performance results from the intercalated Ru complex lowering the LDH band gap (0.98&#8197;eV) via a compression&#8208;related charge redistribution phenomenon. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy data verified light&#8208;induced electron transfer from the Ru complex towards the LDH sheets, increasing the availability of electrons to drive CO2PR. The presence of hydroxyl defects in the LDH sheets promotes the adsorption of CO2 molecules and lowers the energy barriers for NIR&#8208;CO2PR to CO. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of NIR&#8208;CO2PR at wavelengths up to 1200&#8197;nm in LDH&#8208;based photocatalyst systems.

         <title>Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores a unique co&#8208;functionalization approach using ruthenium single atoms (Ru1) and nanoparticles (RuNP) to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of crystalline red phosphorus. Employing &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221;&#8208;inspired tactics, the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 combats defect&#8208;induced charge deep trapping and fosters RuNP growth, forming effective charge transfer interfaces. This research illustrates the transformative impact of metal atom pre&#8208;anchoring in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Crystalline red phosphorus (CRP), known for its promising photocatalytic properties, faces challenges in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) due to undesired inherent charge deep trapping and recombination effects induced by defects. This study overcomes these limitations through an innovative strategy in integrating ruthenium single atoms (Ru1) within CRP to simultaneously repair the intrinsic undesired vacancy defects and serve as the uniformly distributed anchoring sites for a controllable growth into ruthenium nanoparticles (RuNP). Hence, a highly functionalized CRP with Ru1 and RuNP (Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP) with concerted effects in regulating electronic structures and promoting interfacial charge transfer has been achieved. Advanced characterizations unveil the pioneering dual role of pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 (analogous to the &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221; principle) in transforming CRP photocatalysis. The regulations of vacancy defects on the surface of CRP minimize the detrimental deep charge trapping, resulting in the prolonged lifetime of active charges. With the well&#8208;distributed in situ growth of RuNP on Ru1 sites, the constructed robust &#8220;bridge&#8221; that connects CRP and RuNP facilitates constructive interfacial charge transfer. Ultimately, the synergistic effect induced by the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 endows Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP with an exceptional PHE rate of 3175&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, positioning it as one of the most efficient elemental&#8208;based photocatalysts available. This breakthrough underscores the crucial role of pre&#8208;anchoring metal single atoms at defect sites of catalysts in enhancing sustainable hydrogen production.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Supported Low&#8208;Nuclearity Cluster Catalysts for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;based MOFs with unstable Cu coordination centers is electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported onto the remaining MOFs with 3D coordination bonds by the pore space limitation. The synergistic effect of Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8722;*CO coupling generation *CH2CHO species, leading to excellently electrocatalytic CO2&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH performance.







Abstract
It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF&#8208;based supported low&#8208;nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microporous Cu&#8208;based MOF, that achieves a single&#8208;product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi&#8208;site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C&#8722;C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2&#8211;to&#8211;ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH.

&lt;p&gt;Cu-based MOFs with unstable Cu coordination centers is electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported onto the remaining MOFs with 3D coordination bonds by the pore space limitation. The synergistic effect of Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8722;*CO coupling generation *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHO species, leading to excellently electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction reactions (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products. Here, we report a MOF-based supported low-nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three-dimensional (3D) microporous Cu-based MOF, that achieves a single-product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi-site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C&#8722;C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;to&#8211;ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes via Sequential Povarov Reaction and Aromatizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular and efficient enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes has been developed through the sequential chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed Povarov reaction and subsequent aromatizations. With the excellent compatibility of the Povarov reaction and the development of distinct aromatization methods, a wide range of structurally diverse novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes were produced with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes represent a unique type of chiral molecules with significant applications, yet their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains largely underexplored. We report herein the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes through the sequential organocatalyzed enantioselective Povarov reaction and aromatizations. The chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed three&#8208;component Povarov reaction involving amino group&#8208;substituted calix[4]arenes, aldehydes and (di)enamides desymmetrized the prochiral calix[4]arene substrates, which was followed by various aromatization methods, resulting in a diverse array of novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 75&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee). The large&#8208;scale enantioselective synthesis and diverse derivatizations of the chiral calix[4]arene products highlight the value of this method. Furthermore, preliminary exploration into their photophysical and chiroptical properties demonstrate the potential applications of these novel calix[4]arene molecules.

The multisite and adaptive Al8 macrocycle demonstrates a groundbreaking capacity to sequentially encapsulate molecules, complexes, and polymers through &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; interactions. This progressive encapsulation culminates in the formation of an endless polyrotaxane structure, &#8220;the Al8 rock sugar gourd&#8221;. These distinct host&#8211;guest interactions bestow the Al8 macrocycles with customizable optical&#8208;limiting functionalities.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules, such as rotaxanes, have drawn significant attention within supramolecular chemistry. Although a variety of macrocycles have been thoroughly explored in rotaxane synthesis, metal&#8208;organic macrocycles remain relatively under&#8208;investigated. Aluminum molecular rings, with their inner cavities and numerous binding sites, present a promising option for constructing rotaxanes. Here, we introduce an innovative &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; motif utilizing Al8 molecular rings, enabling the stepwise assembly of molecules, complexes, and polymers through tailored coordination chemistry. This novel approach can not only be applied to macrocycle&#8208;based systems like catenanes but also enhance specific functionalities progressively.

         <title>Ambient Synthesis of Vanadium&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogues Nanocubes for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Eutectic Electrolytes</title>

The V&#8208;PBA cathode, prepared by in situ growth and conversion strategy, with eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose and 3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2 could maintain 55&#8201;% of the highest discharge specific capacity after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides a new strategy to prepare pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction to enhance the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current density for industrialization prospects.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely studied in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to the characteristics of large specific surface area, open aperture, and straightforward synthesis. In this work, vanadium&#8208;based PBA nanocubes were firstly prepared using a mild in situ conversion strategy at room temperature without the protection of noble gas. Benefiting from the multiple&#8208;redox active sites of V3+/V4+, V4+/V5+, and Fe2+/Fe3+, the cathode exhibited an excellent discharge specific capacity of 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in AZIBs, which is much higher than those of other metal&#8208;based PBAs nanocubes. To further improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of the V&#8208;PBA cathode, a high concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte (4.5&#8197;M ZnSO4+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2), and a water&#8208;based eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2) were designed to successfully inhibit the dissolution of vanadium and improve the deposition of Zn2+ onto the zinc anode. More importantly, the assembled AZIBs maintained 55&#8201;% of their highest discharge specific capacity even after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with superior rate capability. This study provides a new strategy for the preparation of pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction for enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current densities for industrialization prospects.

         <title>Hybrid Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Material with Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Efficient Organic Afterglow Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) and organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) in a molecule leads to a long OURTP lifetime up to 251&#8197;ms and a high total quantum efficiency over 80&#8201;%. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQEtotal) of ~12&#8201;%, OURTP efficiency (EQEOURTP) of 3.11&#8201;% and electroluminescent lifetime up to 201&#8197;ms, respectively.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials capable of combining various emission behaviors for diversified optoelectronic properties and applications have recently gained a vigorous development, but it remains a forbidden challenge in designing OURTP molecules with hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, possibly due to the elevated difficulties in simultaneously meeting the stringent requirements of both HLCT and OURTP emitters. Here, through introducing multiple heteroatoms into one&#8208;dimensional fused ring of coumarin with moderate charge transfer perturbation in donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor architecture, we demonstrate a HLCT&#8208;featured OURTP molecule showing both promoted fluorescence with a quantum yield of 77&#8201;% in solution and long&#8208;lived OURTP with a lifetime of 251&#8197;ms in conventional host material used in electroluminescent device. Thus, efficient OURTP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated, exhibiting bright electroluminescence with an exciton utilization efficiency of 85&#8201;% and yellow OURTP lasting over 2&#8197;s for afterglow. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP&#8208;OLEDs can be further optimized to reach an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~12&#8201;% and OURTP EQE up to 3.11&#8201;%, representing the highest performance among the reported OURTP&#8208;OLEDs. These impressive results highlight the significance to fuse HLCT and OURTP together in enriching OURTP materials and improving the afterglow OLED performances.

Impressively, the HLCT OURTP light-emitting diodes exhibit an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;) of ~12&#8201;%, OURTP efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;OURTP&lt;/sub&gt;) of 3.11&#8201;% and electroluminescent lifetime up to 201&#8197;ms, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials capable of combining various emission behaviors for diversified optoelectronic properties and applications have recently gained a vigorous development, but it remains a forbidden challenge in designing OURTP molecules with hybrid local and charge-transfer (HLCT) feature, possibly due to the elevated difficulties in simultaneously meeting the stringent requirements of both HLCT and OURTP emitters. Here, through introducing multiple heteroatoms into one-dimensional fused ring of coumarin with moderate charge transfer perturbation in donor-&#960;-acceptor architecture, we demonstrate a HLCT-featured OURTP molecule showing both promoted fluorescence with a quantum yield of 77&#8201;% in solution and long-lived OURTP with a lifetime of 251&#8197;ms in conventional host material used in electroluminescent device. Thus, efficient OURTP organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated, exhibiting bright electroluminescence with an exciton utilization efficiency of 85&#8201;% and yellow OURTP lasting over 2&#8197;s for afterglow. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP-OLEDs can be further optimized to reach an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~12&#8201;% and OURTP EQE up to 3.11&#8201;%, representing the highest performance among the reported OURTP-OLEDs. These impressive results highlight the significance to fuse HLCT and OURTP together in enriching OURTP materials and improving the afterglow OLED performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rhodamine&#8208;Spiropyran Conjugate Empowering Tunable Mechanochromism in Polymers under Multiple Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugating rhodamine and spiropyran rings through a xanthene scaffold offers a new &#960;&#8208;fused mechanochromophore Rh&#8722;SP. High&#8208;contrast and broad&#8208;spectrum mechanochromism in Rh&#8722;SP&#8208;crosslinked elastomers corresponding to different (de)activated states are illustrated, highlighting the power of this mechanophore design in developing polymeric materials with mechanochromic programmability and recognition of multiple stimuli.







Abstract
Mechanochromic functionality realized via the force&#8208;responsive mechanophores in polymers has great potential for damage sensing and information storage. Mechanophores with the ability to recognize multiple stimuli for tunable chromic characteristics are highly sought after for versatile sensing ability and color programmability. Nevertheless, the majority of mechanophores are based on single&#8208;component chromophores with limited sensitivity, or require additional fabrication technology for multi&#8208;modal chromism. Here, we report a novel multifunctional mechanophore capable of vividly detectable and tunable mechanochromism in polymers. This synergistic optical coupling relies on strategically fusing rhodamine and spiropyran (Rh&#8722;SP), and tethering polymer chains on both subunits. The mechanochromic behaviors of the Rh&#8722;SP&#8208;linked polymers under sonication and compression are thoroughly evaluated in response to changes in force and the light&#8208;controlled relaxation process. Non&#8208;sequential ring&#8208;opening of the two subunits under force is identified, endowing high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism. Light&#8208;induced differential ring&#8208;closing reactions of the two subunits, together with the acidichromism of the SP moiety, are employed to engineer elastomers with programmable and wide&#8208;spectrum colors. Our work presents an effective strategy for highly appreciable and regulable mechanochromic functionality, and also provides new insights into the rupture mechanisms of &#960;&#8208;fused mechanophores, as well as how the stimuli history controls stress accumulation in polymers.

         <title>Recyclable Polythioesters and Poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s via Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Polymerization of Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens a new paradigm for polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydride based on a S&#8208;to&#8208;N shift reaction, producing unexpected recyclable polythioesters and unprecedent poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s.







Abstract
Polythioesters (PTEs) are emerging sustainable polymers for their degradability and recyclability. However, low polymerizability of monomers and extensive side reactions often hampered the polymerization process. Moreover, copolymers containing both thioester and other types of functional groups in the backbone are highly desirable but rarely accomplished owing to several synthetic challenges. Here, we report the ring&#8208;opening cascade polymerization (ROCAP) of N&#8208;(2&#8208;(acetylthio)ethyl)&#8208;glycine N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (TE&#8208;NCA) to afford recyclable PTEs and unprecedented poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s (P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s) in a controlled manner. By developing appropriated carboxylic acid&#8208;tertiary amine dual catalysts, intramolecular S&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift is coupled into the ROCAP process of TE&#8208;NCA to yield products with dispersity below 1.10, molecular weight (Mn) up to 84.5&#8197;kDa, and precisely controlled ratio of thioester to peptoids. Random copolymerization of sarcosine NCA (Sar&#8208;NCA) and TE&#8208;NCA gives thioester&#8208;embedded polysarcosine with facile backbone degradation while maintaining the water solubility. This work represents a paradigm shift for the ROP of NCAs, enriches the realm of cascade polymerizations, and provides a powerful synthetic approach to functional PTEs and P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s that are otherwise difficult or impossible to make.

         <title>A Planar&#8208;Structured Dinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex with Indirect Synergy for Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>

A planar&#8208;structured dinuclear cobalt(II) complex exhibits an indirect synergistic catalysis effect between two Co(II) sites for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, with TON and TOF values of 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, which is 8.6&#8208;fold improvement than that of the corresponding mononuclear counterpart.







Abstract
Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) has been proved an effective approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, while it remains challenge to design dinuclear metal complexes that can show DMSC effect. The main reason is that the influence of the microenvironment around dinuclear metal centres on catalytic activity has not been well recognized and revealed. Herein, we report a dinuclear cobalt complex featuring a planar structure, which displays outstanding catalytic efficiency for photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values reach as high as 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, 8.6&#8197;times higher than those of the corresponding mononuclear cobalt complex. Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of the dinuclear cobalt complex is due to the indirect DMSC effect between two CoII ions, energetically feasible one step two&#8208;electron transfer process by Co2I,I intermediate to afford Co2II,II(CO22&#8722;) intermediate and fast mass transfer closely related with the planar structure.

         <title>Redox and Kinetic Properties of Composition&#8208;Dependent Active Sites in Copper&#8208;Exchanged Chabazite for Direct Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity tests and advanced in situ/operando spectroscopic techniques are employed to elucidate the Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites with varying Cu loading and Si/Al ratio and its influence on CH4 partial oxidation to CH3OH. An improved CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency of materials containing primarily monomeric Cu(II) active sites in contrast to zeolites with a significant fraction of dimeric Cu(II) centers has been found.







Abstract
The CH4 oxidation performance of Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites characterized by distinct Si/Al ratios and Cu loadings has been studied and the observed variations in reactivity have been correlated to the differences in the nature of the formed active centers. Plug flow reactor tests, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that a decrease in Cu loading shifts the reactivity/redox profile to higher temperatures and increases the CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance, Raman, ultraviolet&#8208;visible, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and photoluminescence spectroscopies reveal that this behavior is associated with the presence of monomeric Cu active sites, including bare Cu2+ and [CuOH]+ present at low Si/Al ratio and Cu loading. Formation of two distinct [Cu2(&#956;&#8208;O)]2+ moieties at higher Si/Al ratio or Cu loading forces these trends into the opposite direction. Operando electron paramagnetic resonance and ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy show that the apparent activation energy of monomeric Cu active species decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, whereas the one of dimeric centers is unaffected.

Plug flow reactor tests, in situ Fourier-transform infrared, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that a decrease in Cu loading shifts the reactivity/redox profile to higher temperatures and increases the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH selectivity and Cu-efficiency. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance, Raman, ultraviolet-visible, Fourier-transform infrared, and photoluminescence spectroscopies reveal that this behavior is associated with the presence of monomeric Cu active sites, including bare Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [CuOH]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; present at low Si/Al ratio and Cu loading. Formation of two distinct [Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; moieties at higher Si/Al ratio or Cu loading forces these trends into the opposite direction. Operando electron paramagnetic resonance and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy show that the apparent activation energy of monomeric Cu active species decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, whereas the one of dimeric centers is unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In situ Construction of Single&#8208;Atom Electronic Bridge on COF to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the photocatalytic process, Ru atoms are anchored in situ by COF&#8208;Cu3TG, forming a single&#8208;atom electronic bridge between layers. This, combined with the selection of small&#8208;sized metal cluster, facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic HER capability.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most valuable technologies in the future energy system. Here, we designed a metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with both small&#8208;sized metal clusters and nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, named COF&#8208;Cu3TG. Based on our design, small&#8208;sized metal clusters were selected to increase the density of active sites and shorten the distance of electron transport to active sites. While another building block containing nitrogen&#8208;rich organic ligands acted as a node that could in situ anchor metal atoms during photocatalysis and form interlayer single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) to accelerate electron transport. Together, they promoted photocatalytic performance. This represented the further utilization of Ru atoms and was an additional application of the photosensitizer. N2&#8208;Ru&#8208;N2 electron bridge (Ru&#8208;SAEB) was created in situ between the layers, resulting in a considerable enhancement in the hydrogen production rate of the photocatalyst to 10.47&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through theoretical calculation and EXAFS, the existence position and action mechanism of Ru&#8208;SAEB were reasonably inferred, further confirming the rationality of the Ru&#8208;SAEB configuration. A sufficiently proximity between the small&#8208;sized Cu3 cluster and the Ru&#8208;SAEB was found to expedite electron transfer. This work demonstrated the synergistic impact of small molecular clusters with Ru&#8208;SAEB for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Synthesis of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Cored Graphdiyne Nanosheets through Dehydrogenative Coupling on Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexabenzocoronene core&#8208;expanded graphdiyne nanosheets with a sixfold symmetry were synthesized on Au(111) via dehydrogenative coupling reactions of ethyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene. Their chemical and electronic configurations were thoroughly investigated using scanning probe microscopy, providing a band gap (2.8&#8197;eV) of a single&#8208;layer graphdiyne&#8208;like nanosheet.







Abstract
Thermally&#8208;induced dehydrogenative coupling of polyphenylenes on metal surfaces is an important technique to synthesize

&#8208;conjugated carbon nanostructures with atomic precision. However, this protocol has rarely been utilized to fabricate structurally defined carbon nanosheets composed of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Here, we present the synthesis of butadiyne&#8208;linked hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) on Au(111) surfaces as core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes. The reaction started from hexa(4&#8208;ethylphenyl)benzene, which undergoes dehydrogenation toward hexa(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)benzene, followed by planarization to hexabenzocoronene, coupling between the vinyl groups, and further dehydrogenation. In addition to butadiyne linkages, benzene groups were also found as another type of linker. The reaction sequences were monitored by scanning tunneling microscopy and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, which disclose the structures of intermediates and final products. In combination with density functional theory simulations, the key steps from ethyl substituents to butadiyne and benzene linkers were elucidated. This is a new on&#8208;surface synthesis of core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes with unprecedented electronic properties.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Dissociation&#8208;Reconstruction Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Continuity for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstruction of COFs into separation membranes: A 2D covalent organic framework (COF) is designed and dissociated into high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Reconstruction of COF nanosheets gives an ordered and defect&#8208;free membrane. The synthesized membrane exhibits superior CO2/N2 separation performance of high selectivity and large permeance owing to optimized microstructures.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), at the forefront of porous materials, hold tremendous potential in membrane separation; however, achieving high continuity in COF membranes remains crucial for efficient gas separation. Here, we present a unique approach termed assembly&#8208;dissociation&#8208;reconstruction for fabricating COF membranes tailored for CO2/N2 separation. A parent COF is designed from two&#8208;node aldehyde and three&#8208;node amine monomers and dissociated to high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Subsequently, COF nanosheets are orderly reconstructed into a crack&#8208;free membrane by surface reaction under water evaporation. The membrane exhibits high crystallinity, open pores and a strong affinity for CO2 adsorption over N2, resulting in CO2 permeance exceeding 1060 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity surpassing 30.6. The efficacy of this strategy offers valuable guidance for the precise fabrication of gas&#8208;separation membranes.

         <title>Chirality and Curvature on Protein Adsorption and Osteogenesis</title>

Lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid enantiomers (L/D&#8208;UG) are designed to self&#8208;assemble into vesicles and 2D nanocrystals with different chirality and curvature, which showed differentiated protein adsorption and subsequent osteogenesis. L&#8208;2D nanocrystal exhibits as one of the most effective materials to promote bone regeneration.







Abstract
Here we designed enantiomeric lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid derivatives (L/D&#8208;UG) and investigated their self&#8208;assembled chiral nanostructures&#8217; interaction with the protein adsorption as well as the osteogenesis. It was found that L or D&#8208;UG molecules can self&#8208;assemble into vesicle bilayers and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals via a kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. These chiral vesicles and 2D crystals showed differentiated adsorption of proteins, determined by their curvature and chirality. Specifically, fibronectin constituted by L&#8208;amino acids adsorbed preferentially on L&#8208;UG 2D crystal in a semi&#8208;random pattern and L&#8208;2D nanocrystal show as the most effective structures to promote bone regeneration. The controlled vesicle and 2D crystal assemblies with different chirality and curvature helps to clarify their determine roles in protein adsorption and osteogenesis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Electrochemiluminescence for Imaging the Corrosion of Protective Coating of Metal and Quantitative Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Galvanized iron was exploited as both power source and electrodes to achieve self&#8208;powered electrochemiluminescence (ECL) for the first time. The elimination of external power source enables protective coating corrosion imaging using a smartphone. This self&#8208;powered ECL also enables ECL analysis and holds great promise for corrosion imaging and analytical applications.







Abstract
In almost all electrochemical systems for electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analysis, electrodes are connected with an external power source, either directly or via wireless energy transfer circuit. That is inconvenient and makes some applications impossible. Herein, we use galvanized iron with two different metals as both power source and electrodes to achieve a self&#8208;powered ECL and exploit ECL for the imaging of the corrosion of protective coating of widely used metal (e.g. galvanized iron) for the first time. The self&#8208;powered ECL enables the visualization of the deterioration of galvanic coating on iron using a smartphone and the detection of ascorbic acid with a linear range of 0.5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.31&#8197;&#956;M. The devices based on self&#8208;powered approach do not require external power supply, thus effectively reducing their volume and cost. The self&#8208;powered ECL holds great promise for metal corrosion imaging and analytical applications.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Chemical Self&#8208;Rechargeable Zinc Ion Batteries with High Charging and Discharging Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;charging zinc ion battery system for the first time, the photo&#8208;assisted process during chemical self&#8208;charging promotes the transfer of electrons from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction, and enables it to exhibit excellent performance, providing a new strategy for zinc ion battery in energy storage.







Abstract
Chemical self&#8208;recharging zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), which are capable of auto&#8208;recharging in ambient air, are promising in self&#8208;powered battery systems. Nevertheless, the exclusive reliance on chemical energy from oxygen for ZIBs charging often would bring some obstacles in charging efficiency. Herein, we develop photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging aqueous ZIBs with a heterojunction of MoS2/SnO2 cathode, which are favorable to enhancing both the charging and discharging efficiency as well as the chemical self&#8208;charging capabilities under illumination. The photo&#8208;assisted process promotes the electron transfer from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction during chemical self&#8208;charging. Furthermore, the electrons within the MoS2/SnO2 cathode exhibit a low transfer impedance under illumination, which is beneficial to reducing the migration barrier of Zn2+ within the cathode and thereby facilitating the uniform inserting of Zn2+ into MoS2/SnO2 cathode during discharging. This photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging mechanism enables ZIBs to attain a maximum self&#8208;charging potential of 0.95&#8197;V within 3&#8197;hours, a considerable self&#8208;charging capacity of 202.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling performance in a self&#8208;charging mode. This work not only provides a route for optimizing chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage, but also broadens the potential application of aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Emissive B&#8211;N Lewis Pair&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes via Selective LUMO Extension in Conjugated Dimer and Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of B&#8211;N Lewis pair functionalized anthracene into a vinylene&#8208;linked dimer and polymer leads to selective extension of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), thus significantly lowering the band gap, shifting the emission into the near&#8208;infrared region, and modulating the self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward oxygen and release of singlet oxygen from the corresponding endoperoxides.







Abstract
Acenes are attractive as building blocks for low gap organic materials with applications, for example, in organic light emitting diodes, solar cells, bioimaging and diagnostics. Previously, we have shown that modification of dipyridylanthracene via B&#8211;N Lewis pair fusion (BDPA) strongly redshifts the emission, while facilitating self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward O2 to reversibly generate the corresponding endoperoxides. Herein, we report on the further expansion of the &#960;&#8208;system of BDPA to a vinyl&#8208;substituted monomer, vinylene&#8208;bridged dimer, and a polymer with an average of 20 chromophores. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation results in largely reduced band gaps of 1.8&#8197;eV for the dimer and 1.7&#8197;eV for the polymer, the latter giving rise to NIR emission with a maximum at 731&#8197;nm and an appreciable quantum yield of 7&#8201;%. Electrochemical and computational studies reveal efficient delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) along the pyridyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;pyridyl axis, which results in effective electronic communication between BDPA units, selectively lowers the LUMO, and ultimately narrows the band gap. Time&#8208;resolved emission and transient absorption (TA) measurements offer insights into the pertinent photophysical processes. Extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation also slows down the self&#8208;sensitized formation of endoperoxides, while significantly accelerating the thermal release of singlet oxygen to regenerate the parent acenes.

         <title>Exploring Geometric Chirality in Nanocrystals for Boosting Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of geometric chiral effect was explored to enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution using a chiral composite of geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) and C3N4 nanosheets. The chiral Au NPs enable efficient charge carrier separation and high&#8208;activity facets, boosting performance over achiral counterparts and resulting in a quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performance was also revealed.







Abstract
Advancing catalyst design is pivotal for the enhancement of photocatalytic processes in renewable energy conversion. The incorporation of structural chirality into conventional inorganic solar hydrogen nanocatalysts promises a significant transformation in catalysis, a feature absent in this field. Here we unveil the unexplored potential of geometric chirality by creating a chiral composite that integrates geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) with two&#8208;dimensional C3N4 nanosheets, significantly boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution beyond the achiral counterparts. The superior performance is driven by the geometric chirality of Au NPs, which facilitates efficient charge carrier separation through the favorable C3N4&#8208;chiral Au NP interface and chiral induced spin polarization, and exploits high&#8208;activity facets within the concave surfaces of chiral Au NPs. The resulting synergistic effect leads to a remarkable increase in photocatalytic H2 evolution, with an apparent quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Furthermore, we explore the selective polarized photo&#8208;induced carrier separation behavior, revealing a distinct chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic HER performance. Our work advances the design and utilization of chiral inorganic nanostructures for superior performance in energy conversion processes.

Triangulenes as neutral radicals are becoming promising candidates for future applications such as spintronics and quantum technologies. To extend the potential of the advanced materials, it is of importance to control their electronic and magnetic properties by multiple graphitic nitrogen doping. Here, we synthesize triaza[5]triangulene on Au(111) by cyclodehydrogenation, and its derivatives by cleaving C&#8722;N bonds. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy provided detailed structural information and evidence for open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. The antiferromagnetic arrangement of the spins in positively doped triaza[5]triangulene was further confirmed by density function theory calculations. The key aspect of triangulenes with multiple graphitic nitrogen is the extra pz electrons composing the &#960; orbitals, favoring charge transfer to the substrate and changing their low&#8208;energy excitations. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phases of matter in heteroatom doped organic systems.

         <title>Encapsulation of Sn Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters in Multichannel Carbon Matrix for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF, a flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries, is synthesized with uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in a multichannel carbon matrix. This design ensures a size&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance with enhanced K+ diffusion kinetics and cycling stability. Theoretical calculations clarify electron transfer and energy barriers of intermediates. In situ XRD and XANES analysis reveals the K+ storage mechanisms.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability ( around 331&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of around 167&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Enhanced Alkene Oxidative Cleavage in Water via Photoexcited FeIV Species within Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the catalytic activity of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O towards alkene scission in water, facilitated by the hydrophobic COF backbone. The COF acts as a photosensitizer and structural support, enhancing reaction efficiency by proximity effect. The method achieves up to 75&#8201;% yield, producing selectively aldehydes or ketones, and is recyclable for four cycles.







Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8722;O&#8722;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8722; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et4N)2[FeIII(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8722;B and C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization of PolyBorylated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents site&#8208;, and stereoselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed strategies for synthesizing stereodefined polysubstituted alkenes using poly&#8208;boron&#8208;containing alkenes. Four protocols were developed to generate reactive alkenyl&#8208;Rh and aryl&#8208;Rh intermediates, enabling diverse stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formations. The study introduces Z&#8722;Rh species, facilitating stereoselective coupling reactions and remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization.







Abstract
Alkenes are fundamental functional groups which feature in various materials and bioactive molecules; however, efficient divergent strategies for their stereodefined synthesis are difficult. In this regard, numerous synthetic methodologies have been developed to construct carbon&#8211;carbon bonds with regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, enabling the predictable and efficient synthesis of stereodefined alkenes. In fact, an appealing alternative approach for accessing challenging stereodefined alkene molecular frameworks could involve the sequential selective activation and cross&#8208;coupling of strong bonds instead of conventional C&#8722;C bond formation. In this study, we introduce a series of programmed site&#8208; and stereoselective strategies that capitalizes on the versatile reactivity of readily accessible polymetalloid alkenes (i.e. polyborylated alkenes), through a tandem cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which is catalyzed by an organometallic Rh&#8208;complex to produce complex molecular scaffolds. By merging selective C&#8722;B and remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization, we achieve the in situ generation of polyfunctional C(sp2)&#8208;nucleophilic intermediates. These species can be further modified by selective coupling reactions with various C&#8208;based electrophiles, enabling the formation of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond for the generation of even more complex molecular architectures using the readily available starting polyborylated&#8208;alkenes. Mechanistic and computational studies provide insight into the origins of the stereoselectivities and C&#8722;H activation via a 1,4&#8208;Rh migration process.

         <dc:description>
A series of switchable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereodivergent cycloadditions of allenes have been developed. These mechanistically distinct cycloadditions enabled to rapidly access structurally and stereochemically diverse 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazine species with high efficiency and selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we report a strategy enabling triple switchable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereodivergence in newly developed palladium&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of allenes. An asymmetric pseudo&#8208;stereodivergent cycloaddition of allenes bearing a primary leaving group at the &#945;&#8208;position, where a dynamic kinetic asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of racemic unactivated allenes was the enantio&#8208;determining step, is realized, providing four stereoisomers [(Z,R), (Z,S), (E,S), and (E,R)] containing a di&#8208;substituted alkene scaffold and a stereogenic center. By tuning reaction conditions, a mechanistically distinctive cycloaddition is uncovered selectively with the same set of substrates. By switching the position of the leaving group of allenes, a cycloaddition involving an intermolecular O&#8208;attack is disclosed. Diverse mechanisms of the cycloaddition reactions of allenes enable rapid access to structurally and stereochemically diverse 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high efficiency and selectivity.

Core&#8208;shell MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with highly adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure were constructed by innovatively exploiting C&#8722;C linkage, demonstrating much better degradation performance than their parent components, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Moreover, the in situ grown MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V films exhibited broad&#8208;spectrum, reusable and significantly enhanced removal capabilities for diverse pollutants in river water by solar drive.







Abstract
Diversifying the connecting junctions will be feasible for the controllable collaboration of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to rationally design multifunction&#8208;integrated heterostructures with enhanced performance, yet it is in the nascent stage. Herein, by intelligently exploiting the polymerization of vinyl group, C&#8722;C bond is innovatively introduced to construct the core&#8211;shell MOF@COF heterostructures with adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure. The unique structure endows prepared C&#8722;C&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with more superior visible&#8208;light harvesting and photogenerated carrier separation capability, leading to significantly higher photocatalytic activity and faster degradation rate than pristine MIL&#8208;68&#8208;C=Cs, COF&#8722;V, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Further, the customized MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V is in situ grown as reusable films with dramatically boosted performance under ambient conditions, which realize the highly efficient degradation of tetracycline within 15&#8197;min (96.5&#8201;%), rhodamine 6G within 25&#8197;min (97.6&#8201;%), and phenol within 40&#8197;min (95.3&#8201;%) by solar drive. This work exhibits the distinctive advantages of C&#8722;C junction in the MOF@COF construction, and highlights the application prospect of rational&#8208;designed heterostructure in the treatment of persistent organic pollutants.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Pd&#8208;Catalyzed sp3 C&#8722;H Macrocyclization: Synthesis and Evaluation of Macrocyclic Sulfonamide for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination, and arylation macrocyclization is reported, which provided a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. A combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide, which demonstrated a potential efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of SIRT3.







Abstract
The development of simplified synthetic strategy to create structurally and functionally diverse pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic molecules is highly appealing but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by natural scaffolds, herein, we describe a practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination and arylation macrocyclization, which could offer a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. Interestingly, the potential of ligand acceleration in C&#8722;H activation is also demonstrated by an unprecedented enantioselective sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation macrocyclization. Moreover, a combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide 2&#8201;a, which showed a promising efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of silent information regulator sirtuin 3 (SIRT3).

         <title>Electron&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;Electrosynthesis of Formates from CO2 and Methanol Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer coupling acidic CO2RR with alkaline MOR to effectively co&#8208;produce formate. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR system exhibits high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;h of continuous operation and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro&#8208;synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide&#8208;decorated Cu2Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of only 2.1&#8197;V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system. This study illuminates an innovative electron&#8208;efficiency and energy&#8208;saving techniques for CO2 electrolysis, as well as the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Main&#8208;Group Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Dynamic Proton Bridges Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A main&#8208;group metal&#8208;nonmetal proton bridge catalyst (O&#8722;In&#8722;S), featuring the In&#8722;S polarization pair as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites and electronegative oxygen as an electron pool, enables the asymmetric In&#8722;S dual&#8208;sites to back&#8208;donate electrons to the &#960;x* and &#960;y* antibonding orbitals of nitrogen (N2), achieving exceptional N2 fixation activity. This discovery paves the way for efficient electrocatalysts for activating inert molecules.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is a crucial process for the sustainable production of ammonia (NH3) for energy and agriculture applications. However, the reaction's efficiency is highly dependent on the activation of the inert N&#8801;N bond, which is hindered by the electron back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* orbitals of the N&#8801;N bond, resulting in low eNRR capacity. Herein, we report a main&#8208;group metal&#8208;nonmetal (O&#8722;In&#8722;S) eNRR catalyst featuring a dynamic proton bridge, with In&#8722;S serving as the polarization pair and O functioning as the dynamic electron pool. In situ spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the In&#8722;S polarization pair acts as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites, polarizing the N&#8801;N bond by concurrently back&#8208;donating electrons to both the &#960;x* and &#960;y* orbitals of N2, thereby overcoming the significant band gap limitations, while inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the O dynamic electron pool acts as a &#8220;repository&#8221; for electron storage and donation to the In&#8722;S polarization pair. As a result, the O&#8722;In&#8722;S dynamic proton bridge exhibits exceptional NH3 yield rates and Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) across a wide potential window of 0.3&#8197;V, with an optimal NH3 yield rate of 80.07&#177;4.25&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and an FE of 38.01&#177;2.02&#8201;%, outperforming most previously reported catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;A main-group metal-nonmetal proton bridge catalyst (O&#8722;In&#8722;S), featuring the In&#8722;S polarization pair as asymmetric dual-sites and electronegative oxygen as an electron pool, enables the asymmetric In&#8722;S dual-sites to back-donate electrons to the &#960;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;* and &#960;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;* antibonding orbitals of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), achieving exceptional N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation activity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is a crucial process for the sustainable production of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) for energy and agriculture applications. However, the reaction's efficiency is highly dependent on the activation of the inert N&#8801;N bond, which is hindered by the electron back-donation to the &#960;* orbitals of the N&#8801;N bond, resulting in low eNRR capacity. Herein, we report a main-group metal-nonmetal (O&#8722;In&#8722;S) eNRR catalyst featuring a dynamic proton bridge, with In&#8722;S serving as the polarization pair and O functioning as the dynamic electron pool.

Meanwhile, the O dynamic electron pool acts as a &#8220;repository&#8221; for electron storage and donation to the In&#8722;S polarization pair.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Concentration Distribution in Sb&#8722;Cu Alloy Nanoarrays for Robust Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D coral&#8208;like alloy nanoarray featuring decreasing Sb and increasing Cu concentrations from bottom to top has been established. The former endows high capacity, while the latter acts as a protective layer maintaining high stability at the electrolyte/electrode interface. It also facilitates smooth distribution and release of stress, thereby exhibiting superior cycling stability and high&#8208;rate capability for sodium storage.







Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type materials are attractive for anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and overall performance. However, the accumulation of stress/strain during repeated cycling results in electrode pulverization, leading to rapid capacity decay and eventual disintegration, thus hindering their practical applications. Herein, we report a 3D coral&#8208;like Sb&#8722;Cu alloy nanoarray with gradient distribution of both elements. The array features a Sb&#8208;rich bottom and a Cu&#8208;rich top with increasing Sb and decreasing Cu concentrations from top to bottom. The former is the active component that provides the high capacity, whereas the latter serves as an inert additive that acts against volume variation. The gradual transition in composition within the electrode introduces a ladder&#8208;type volume expansion effect, facilitating a smooth distribution and effective release of stress, thereby ensuring the wanted mechanical stability and structural integrity. The as&#8208;developed nanoarray affords a high reversible capacity (460&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), stable cycling (89&#8201;% retention over 120&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C), and superior rate capability (354&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C). The concentration dual&#8208;gradient strategy paves a new pathway of designing alloy&#8208;type materials for
SIBs.

         <title>Thermal Effect Management via Entropy Variation Strategy to Improve the Catalyst Stability in Acetylene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provided an entropy variation strategy to realize thermal effect management and developed a long&#8208;term stable CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst for acetylene hydrogenation. Its essence is that the heat sensitive but non active Co nano&#8208;islands experienced an entropy increasing process of slowly redispersion via capturing and utilizing the reaction heat generated on the active CuZn alloys, thus solving the deactivation problem of Cu&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
The dynamic structure evolution of heterogeneous catalysts during reaction has gained great attention recently. However, controllably manipulating dynamic process and then feeding back catalyst design to extend the lifetime remains challenging. Herein, we proposed an entropy variation strategy to develop a dynamic CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst, in which the non&#8208;active Co nano&#8208;islands play a crucial role in controlling thermal effect via timely capturing and utilizing reaction heat generated on the adjacent active CuZn alloys, thus solving the deactivation problem of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Specifically, heat sensitive Co nano&#8208;islands experienced an entropy increasing process of slowly redispersion during the reaction. Under such heat dissipation effect, the CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst exhibited 95.7&#8201;% ethylene selectivity and amazing long&#8208;term stability (&gt;530&#8197;h) in the typical exothermic acetylene hydrogenation. Aiming at cultivating it as a catalyst with promising industrial potential, we proposed a simple regeneration approach via an entropy decreasing process.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Sulfur&#8208;Doped Double [7]Helicene Photosensitizer: Synthesis, Structure and Chiral Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a deep&#8208;red emissive sulfur&#8208;doped double [7]helicene with a high photoluminescence yield and large Stokes shift, as well as aromatic behaviors of various oxidation states. Its chiroptical properties are also studied. High spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants between the singlet and triplet states enable the double helicene to act as an efficient singlet oxygen photosensitizer.







Abstract
Doping of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with sulfur atoms is becoming more and more important as a means of creating unique functional materials. Recently, thiophene&#8208;containing multiple helicenes have garnered enormous attention due to their intriguing electronic and (chir)optical properties compared with carbohelicenes. However, the efficient synthesis of thiopyran&#8208;containing multiple helicenes and the underlying sulfur doping mechanisms are rather unexplored. Herein, the synthesis and structural analysis of a thiopyran&#8208;containing double [7]helicene 3 are reported. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals 3 and its dication with C2&#8208;symmetric propeller&#8208;shape structures and compact interactions in the solid state. 3 exhibits deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission. Tunable aromaticity of the central benzene ring and thiopyran rings is found by chemical oxidation, which is further confirmed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS), anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) analysis. Furthermore, the chiral and photosensitizing characters of 3 are investigated. The excellent deep&#8208;red to NIR fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and photosensitizing activities suggest that 3 can be used as an outstanding photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and bioimaging, especially paving the way for future CPL&#8208;PDT and CPL&#8208;bio&#8208;probe applications.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Catalyst Mimicking the Two&#8208;Component Architecture of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst, composed of S&#8722;C&#8208;supported ruthenium single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs), was designed for electrochemical nitrate reduction. Leveraging the synergistic effects of SAs and NPs, this two&#8208;component M&#8722;S&#8722;C catalyst exhibits an exceptional ammonia yield rate of 37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen sources involves competitive adsorption of different intermediates and multiple electron and proton transfers, presenting grand challenges in catalyst design. In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. Such process results in a more energetically accessible pathway for NO3&#8722; reduction on Ru NPs co&#8208;existing with SAs. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8722;S&#8722;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>Helix&#8208;Sense&#8208;Selective Memory Polymerization of Biphenylylacetylenes Bearing Carboxy and Amino Groups in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization of achiral monomers with carboxy and amino groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively, was developed for the rapid synthesis of one&#8208;handed helicity&#8208;memorized polymers. The carboxy&#8208;bound polymer forms a cholesteric liquid crystal in water, in which basic achiral dyes further co&#8208;assemble to form helical aggregates showing induced circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
We report the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization (HSMP) of achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing carboxy and amino pendant groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively. The HSMP proceeds in a highly helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective manner driven by noncovalent chiral ionic interactions between the monomers and guests under kinetic control, producing the one&#8208;handed helical polymers with a static memory of helicity in one&#8208;pot during the polymerization in a very short time, accompanied by amplification of asymmetry. The carboxy&#8208;bound helicity&#8208;memorized polymer self&#8208;assembles into a cholesteric liquid crystal in concentrated water, in which a variety of basic achiral fluorophores further co&#8208;assembles to form supramolecular helical aggregates that exhibit an induced circularly polarized luminescence in a color tunable manner.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of High&#8208;Rate Copper Electrochemical Machining in Nitrate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dissolution mechanism of copper during high&#8208;rate electrochemical machining in nitrate electrolyte is investigated and proposed to change to overcome mass transport limitation. Prerequisites are derived from polarization measurements under various (hydrodynamic) conditions. A new complexation mechanism involving nitrate ions is proposed at overlimiting currents.







Abstract
The high&#8208;rate electrochemical dissolution of copper in nitrate electrolytes is investigated primarily via polarization curves, while varying parameters such as the electrolyte flow velocity, the electrolyte resistance, the anode geometry, and the temperature. This study focuses on the re&#8208;rise in current at high voltages after the limiting current plateau. As a result of the studies, a change in the complexation mechanism from hydration to &#8220;solvo&#8208;nitration&#8221; is proposed, which requires an additional potential drop within the electrochemical double layer.

         <title>Tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficiently Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine based covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time. They displayed superior H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in H2O and O2 under AM&#8197;1.5G through the combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have recently emerged as fascinating scaffolds for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion because of their customizable structures and functionalities. Herein, two tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials (namely COF&#8208;JLU51 and COF&#8208;JLU52) featuring large surface area, high crystallinity, excellent stability and photoelectric properties were designed and constructed for the first time. Remarkably, COF&#8208;JLU51 gave an outstanding H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in pure water and O2 under one standard sun light, that higher than its isomorphic COF&#8208;JLU52 and most of the reported metal&#8208;free materials, owing to its superior generation, separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Experimental and theoretical researches prove that the photocatalytic process undergoes a combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction (WOR). Specifically, an ultrahigh yield of 7624.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with apparent quantum yield of 18.2&#8201;% for COF&#8208;JLU52 was achieved in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio of benzyl alcohol and water system. This finding contributes novel, nitrogen&#8208;rich and high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials, and also designate their bright future in photocatalytic solar transformations.

         <title>Progressive Endergonic Synthesis of Diels&#8211;Alder Adducts Driven by Chemical Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going uphill. While most chemical reactions proceed towards equilibrium, we describe herein how to drive Diels&#8211;Alder reactions away from equilibrium (&#916;G &gt;0) using the hydration energy of carbodiimides. Our strategy yielded products up to 400&#8201;% of what thermodynamics would allow at equilibrium. Progressive accumulation upon repeated fueling cycles unlocks adaptive behaviors in chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
The overwhelming majority of artificial chemical reaction networks respond to stimuli by relaxing towards an equilibrium state. The opposite response&#8212;moving away from equilibrium&#8212;can afford the endergonic synthesis of molecules, of which only rare examples have been reported. Here, we report six examples of Diels&#8211;Alder adducts formed in an endergonic process and use this strategy to realize their stepwise accumulation. Indeed, systems respond to repeated occurrences of the same stimulus by increasing the amount of adduct formed, with the final network distribution depending on the number of stimuli received. Our findings indicate how endergonic processes can contribute to the transition from responsive to adaptive systems.

The opposite response&#8212;moving away from equilibrium&#8212;can afford the endergonic synthesis of molecules, of which only rare examples have been reported. Here, we report six examples of Diels&#8211;Alder adducts formed in an endergonic process and use this strategy to realize their stepwise accumulation. Indeed, systems respond to repeated occurrences of the same stimulus by increasing the amount of adduct formed, with the final network distribution depending on the number of stimuli received. Our findings indicate how endergonic processes can contribute to the transition from responsive to adaptive systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks for Robust Light Harvesting and Efficient Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes afforded covalently waved 2D lattices and crystalline &#960; layers. The helicene frameworks are highly red emissive, enable intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;state energy transfer, and facilitate intermolecular triplet state energy transfer to convert molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species, thereby offering a method for the design of helicene materials for light&#8208;harvesting and photoenergy applications.







Abstract
Helicenes represent a class of fascinating &#960; compounds with fused yet folded backbones. Despite their broad structural diversity, harnessing helicenes to develop well&#8208;defined materials is still a formidable challenge. Here we report the synthesis of crystalline porous helicene materials by exploring helicenes to synthesize covalent 2D lattices and layered &#960; frameworks. Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene&#8208;porphyrin alignment along the x and y directions at a 1.5&#8208;nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti&#8208;AA stack along the z direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields. The [6]helicene frameworks trigger effieicnt intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet state energy transfer from [6]helicene to porphyrin and facilitate intermolecular triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state energy transfer from frameworks to molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, harvesting a wide range of photons from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions for light emitting and photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. This study introduces a new family of extended frameworks, laying the groundwork for exploring well&#8208;defined helicene materials with unprecedented structures and functions.

         <title>A Coupling&#8208;Induced Assembly Strategy for Constructing Artificial Shell on Mitochondria in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently cross&#8208;linked artificial shells with multiple binding sites were constructed in situ on mitochondria by a coupling&#8208;induced assembly (CIA) strategy. Under ultrasonic (US) irradiation, a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was generated, which acted on the neighboring mitochondrial membranes and thus induced mitochondrial apoptosis.







Abstract
The strategy of in vivo self&#8208;assembly has been developed for improved enrichment and long&#8208;term retention of anticancer drug in tumor tissues. However, most self&#8208;assemblies with non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions are susceptible to complex physiological environments, leading to weak stability and loss of biological function. Here, we develop a coupling&#8208;induced assembly (CIA) strategy to generate covalently crosslinked nanofibers, which is applied for in situ constructing artificial shell on mitochondria. The oxidation&#8208;responsive peptide&#8208;porphyrin conjugate P1 is synthesized, which self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles. Under the oxidative microenvironment of mitochondria, the coupling of thiols in P1 causes the formation of dimers, which is further ordered and stacked into crosslinked nanofibers. As a result, the artificial shell is constructed on the mitochondria efficiently through multivalent cooperative interactions due to the increased binding sites. Under ultrasound (US) irradiation, the porphyrin molecules in the shell produce a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that act on the adjacent mitochondrial membrane, exhibiting ~2&#8208;fold higher antitumor activity than nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the mitochondria&#8208;targeted CIA strategy provides a novel perspective on improved sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and shows potential applications in antitumor therapies.

Abstract
We report a highly crystalline self&#8208;assembled multilayer (SAMUL) that is fundamentally different from the conventional monolayer or disordered bilayer used for hole&#8208;extraction in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SAMUL can be easily formed on ITO substrate to establish better surface coverage to enhance the performance and stability of PSCs. A detailed structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of molecules used for SAMUL is established through a systematic study of their crystallinity, molecular packing, and hole&#8208;transporting properties. These SAMULs are rationally optimized by varying their molecular structures and deposition methods through thermal evaporation or spin&#8208;coating for fabricating PSCs. The CbzNaphPPA&#8208;based SAMUL was chosen for fabricating inverted PSCs due to it exhibiting the highest crystallinity and hole mobility which is derived from the ordered H&#8208;aggregation. This resulted in a remarkably high fill factor of 86.45&#8201;%, which enables a very impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.07&#8201;% to be achieved along with excellent device stability (94&#8201;% of its initial PCE retained after continuous operation for 1200&#8197;h under 1&#8208;sun irradiation at maximum power point at 65&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, a record&#8208;high PCE of 23.50&#8201;% could be achieved by adopting a thermally evaporated SAMUL.

         <title>Achieving Record C2H2 Packing Density for Highly Efficient C2H2/C2H4 Separation with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Prepared by a Scalable Synthesis in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that achieves a record acetylene packing density, which is pivotal for the highly efficient purification of ethylene. The synthesis of this material is readily scalable to the kilogram level using pure water as solvent, thereby establishing it as a leading candidate for practical industrial applications.







Abstract
Adsorptive C2H2/C2H4 separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged as a promising technology for the removal of C2H2 (acetylene) impurity (1&#8201;%) from C2H4 (ethylene). The practical application of these materials involves the optimization of separation performance as well as development of scalable and green production protocols. Herein, we report the efficient C2H2/C2H4 separation in a MOF, Cu(OH)INA (INA: isonicotinate) which achieves a record C2H2 packing density of 351&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 0.01&#8197;bar through high affinity towards C2H2. DFT (density functional theory) calculations reveal the synergistic binding mechanism through pore confinement and the oxygen sites in pore wall. The weakly basic nature of binding sites leads to a relatively low heat of adsorption (Qst) of approximately 36&#8197;kJ/mol, which is beneficial for material regeneration and thermal management. Furthermore, a scalable and environmentally friendly synthesis protocol with a high space&#8208;time yield of 544&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3 day&#8722;1 has been developed without using any modulating agents. This material also demonstrates enduring separation performance for multiple cycles, maintaining its efficacy after exposure to water or air for three months.

The weakly basic nature of binding sites leads to a relatively low heat of adsorption (Q&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt;) of approximately 36&#8197;kJ/mol, which is beneficial for material regeneration and thermal management. Furthermore, a scalable and environmentally friendly synthesis protocol with a high space-time yield of 544&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; has been developed without using any modulating agents. This material also demonstrates enduring separation performance for multiple cycles, maintaining its efficacy after exposure to water or air for three months.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rigid&#8208;Flexible Coupled Dendritic Molecule Doping: General Approach to Activate Commercial Polymers into Harsh Condition&#8208;Tolerant Multi&#8208;Reusable Strong Supramolecular Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy is proposed to activate commercial polymers into a new family of harsh condition&#8208;tolerant, multi&#8208;reusable and strong supramolecular adhesives by simple physical doping of rigid&#8208;flexible coupled dendritic molecule (named M4C8OH). Such M4C8OH doping overcomes commonly&#8208;seen trade&#8208;off between cohesion and interface adhesion. The rigid&#8208;flexible dendritic structure, branch number, and OH&#8208;terminated alkyl chain length for molecule dopants are key structural factors for superior adhesion properties.







Abstract
Developing functional adhesives combining strong adhesion, good recyclability and diverse harsh&#8208;condition adaptability is a grand challenge. Here, we introduce a general dendritic molecule doping strategy to activate commercial polymers into a new family of supramolecular adhesives integrating high adhesion strength, ultralow temperature, water resistant and multi&#8208;reusable properties. Our method involves rational design of a new rigid&#8208;flexible coupled dendritic molecule&#8212;M4C8OH as a versatile dopant, while simple M4C8OH doping into commercial polymers can modulate internal and external non&#8208;covalent interaction to enable H&#8208;bonding enhanced interchain cross&#8208;linking for tough cohesion along with enhanced interphase interaction. This endows 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% M4C8OH&#8208;doped polycaprolactone (PCL) adhesives (PCL&#8208;M4C8OH) with improved adhesion strength on various substrates with the maximum increase up to 2.87&#8197;times that of PCL. In particular, the adhesion strengths of PCL&#8208;M4C8OH on polymethyl methacrylate at 25&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C reach 4.67 and 3.58&#8197;MPa&#8212;1.9 and 2.3&#8197;times those of PCL and superior to diverse commercial adhesives and most reported adhesives. PCL&#8208;M4C8OH also displays markedly&#8208;improved multi&#8208;usability and tolerance against ultralow temperature and diverse wet environments. Mechanism studies reveal the crucial role of M4C8OH molecular structures toward superior adhesion. Our method can be expanded to other polymer matrices, yielding diverse new supramolecular adhesives.

         <title>Leap&#8208;Type Response of Redox/Photo&#8208;Active Lanthanide&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Early and Accurate Screening of Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating mixed&#8208;valent redox metal center, charge/energy donor and photo&#8208;active center in one interface, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;amplified sensitivity is developed for precisely distinguishing the negative and positive acid phosphatase (ACP, prostate cancer marker), which exhibits bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence (&#8220;leap&#8221; response from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221;) at ACP threshold.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;accuracy technologies to distinguish the quite tiny concentration change of tumor markers between negative and positive is of vital significance for early screening and diagnosis of cancers, but is still a great challenge for the conventional biosensors because of their &#8220;gradual&#8221; detection mode. Herein, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (designated as Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;/photo&#8208;activities is developed for precisely identifying acid phosphatase (ACP), an early pathological marker of prostate cancer (PCa) in serum. The engineered Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X probe achieves a bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence at the critical concentration of ACP (9&#8197;U&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), while keeping silent below this threshold, undergoing a qualitative signal change from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221; between negative and positive indicators and thus significantly improving the identification precision. Significantly, such &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; response performance can be further edited and amplified by rational defect engineering in the crystal structure to improve the accessibility of active centers, consequently maximizing the detection sensitivity toward ACP in the complex biological media. This study proposes the first paradigm for the development of &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; biosensors with ultra&#8208;sensitive differentiation capability between negative and positive, and provides a potentially valuable tool for early and accurate screening of PCa.

         <title>Insulator&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Degradation of Pyrochlore Ruthenates in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution and Stabilization through Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulator&#8208;transition companied with lattice contraction induces the degradation of pyrochlore ruthenates (Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. With Ir substitution, the adjustment of electron configuration in newly formed [RuO6]&#8208;[IrO6] suppresses the interior and surface reconstruction of pyrochlores, thus endowing Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; with superior stability during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;based pyrochlores (e.g., Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) are promised to replace IrO2 in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. It is significant to reveal the cliff attenuation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these pyrochlores. In this work, we monitor the structure changes and electrochemical behavior of Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; over the OER process, and it is found that the reason of decisive OER inactivation is derived from an insulator transition occurred within Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; due to its inner &#8220;perfecting&#8221; lattice induced by continuous atom rearrangement. Therefore, a stabilization strategy of the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; is proposed to alleviate this undesirable behavior. The double&#8208;exchange interaction between Ru and Ir in [RuO6] and [IrO6] octahedra leads the charge redistribution with simultaneous spin configuration adjustment. The electronic state in newly formed octahedrons centered with Ru 4d3 (with the state of eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8593;a1g&#8593; eg0) and Ir 5d6 (eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8595;&#8593;&#8595;a1g&#8593;&#8595; eg0) relieves the uneven electron distributions in [RuO6] orbital. The attenuated Jahn&#8211;Teller effect alleviates atom rearrangement, represented as the mitigation of insulator transition, surface reconstruction, and metal dissolution. As results, the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; presents the greatly improved OER stability and PEM durability. This study unveils the OER degradation mechanism and stabilization strategy for material design of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts for electrochemical applications.

         <title>Conformational Locking Induced Enantioselective Diarylcarbene Insertion into B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bonds Using a Cationic Rh(I)/Diene Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cationic rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system has been developed, and the first example of rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;diarylcarbenes has been realized. The computational study indicates that the combination of a stereochemically favored &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction and a rotation&#8208;restricted conformation is crucial to the reaction enantio&#8208;discrimination.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective transformations of aryl/aryl carbene are inherently challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing between two arene rings in the reaction process thus remain largely less explored. The few successful examples reported so far, without exception, have all been catalyzed by Rh(II)&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe our successful development of a novel cationic Rh(I)/chiral diene catalytic system capable of efficient enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H insertions with diaryl diazomethanes, allowing the access to a broad range of gem&#8208;diarylmethine boranes and gem&#8208;diarylmethine ethers in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Notably, previously unattainable asymmetric diarylcarbene insertion into the O&#8722;H bond was achieved for the first time. A remarkable feature of this newly designed Rh(I)/diene catalyst bearing two ortho&#8208;amidophenyl substitutents is that it can distinguish between two arene rings of the diaryl carbene through a stereochemically selective control of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. DFT calculations indicate that the rotation&#8208;restricted conformation of Rh(I)/diene complex played an important role in the highly enantioselective carbene transformations. This work provides an interesting and unprecedented stereocontrol mode in diaryl metal carbene transformations.

         <title>Leveraging Ion Pairing and Transport in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Reversible Lithium Metal Anodes at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Along with the desolvation barrier, bulk transport properties also determine Li deposition behavior at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. The combination of moderately weak solvent and low viscosity diluent allows for low desolvation energy and high Li+ transference number while maintaining adequate ion conduction and diffusion. Therefore, exceptional Li metal Coulombic efficiency at extremely low temperatures is achieved.







Abstract
Coulombic efficiency of over 99&#8201;% is rarely achieved for Li metal anode below &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, hindering the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries under extreme conditions. Herein, limiting factors for Li metal reversibility are investigated utilizing ether&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes of different solvent&#8208;diluent combinations. We find that along with the desolvation barrier, bulk ion transport properties including ionic conductivity, transference number, and diffusivity are also crucial factors for low&#8208;temperature Li deposition behavior. Superior Li metal reversibility was observed within the combination of the solvent with moderately weak solvating power and the diluent with minimal viscosity, highlighting the role of ion transport and the necessity for a trade&#8208;off with desolvation. The optimized electrolyte composed of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, methyl n&#8208;propyl ether, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether delivers exceptional Coulombic efficiency of 99.34&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and 98.96&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C under a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, Li||LiCoO2 (2.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cells demonstrate impressive reversible capacity and cycling stability at these temperatures. This work sheds light on the less&#8208;recognized relevance of bulk ion transport to low&#8208;temperature performance and provides guidelines for the electrolyte design of Li metal batteries operating in cold environments.

         <title>A Cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H Annulation Involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;Palladacycle Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a unprecedented cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles. In this protocol, C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles formed by alkene&#8208; or indole&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can be captured by &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids to access tricyclic and pentacyclic fused pyridinediones. In addition, alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can also be used to construct a tricyclic skeleton containing a four&#8208;membered ring.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond functionalization involving C,C&#8208;palladacycle intermediates provides a unique platform for developing novel reactions. However, the vast majority of studies have been limited to the transformations of C(aryl),C&#8208;palladacycles. In sharp contrast, catalytic reactions involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles have rarely been reported. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles. In this protocol, alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides undergo intramolecular Heck/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation to generate C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles, which can be captured by &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids to afford tricyclic fused pyridinediones. In addition, this strategy can also be applied to indole&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides to construct pentacyclic fused pyridinediones via suquential Heck dearomatization/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization. Notably, the removal of &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids in the reaction of alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can build an interesting tricyclic skeleton containing a four&#8208;membered ring. Preliminary mechanistic experiments indicate that five&#8208;membered C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles serve as the key intermediates. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway.

Confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with copper single atoms (CuSAs) inside defective UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 nanocrystals is achieved by the straightforward method of low&#8208;temperature thermolysis. The prepared composite CuSAs@PCN@UiO, combining the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis, exhibits an excellent photocatalytic performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added fuels displays an attractive scenario to enhance energy supply and reduce global warming. We report herein the confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with Cu single atoms (CuSAs) inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which combines the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis (SAC) to achieve high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. A series of spectral studies displays the formation of CuSAs@PCN inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, the ternary composite shows an excellent photocatalytic turnover frequency of 4.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the doping of CuSAs, as well as the formation of type&#8208;II heterojunction, are causal factors to achieve CH3OH generation. The study provides new insights designing high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for CO2 conversion to fuels at atomic scale.

Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the doping of CuSAs, as well as the formation of type-II heterojunction, are causal factors to achieve CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH generation. The study provides new insights designing high-performance photocatalyst for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to fuels at atomic scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Protein Assembly with Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>

In living systems, protein assemblies serve essential functions. Controlling their construction in biotechnology is challenging. We show that anionic boron clusters act as reversible molecular glue for proteins, forming 2D assemblies and preventing temperature denaturation of myoglobin. Nano&#8208;ion concentration controls assembly size with minimal impact on structures, introducing boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions as tools for protein assembly and stabilization.







Abstract
In living systems, protein assemblies have essential functions, serving as structural supports, transport highways for molecular cargo, and containers of genetic material. The construction of protein assemblies, which involves control over space and time, remains a significant challenge in biotechnology. Here, we show that anionic boron clusters, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;commo&#8208;bis[closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;3&#8208;cobaltadodecaborane] (COSAN&#8722;), and halogenated closo&#8208;dodecarboranes (B12X122&#8722;, X=H, Cl, or I), described as super&#8208;chaotropic nano&#8208;ions, induce the formation of 2D assemblies of model proteins, myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and trypsin inhibitor. We found that the nano&#8208;ion concentration reversibly controls the size of the protein assemblies. Furthermore, the secondary structures of the proteins are only slightly affected by assembly formation. For myoglobin, the formation of these assemblies even prevents temperature denaturation, highlighting a preservation effect of nano&#8208;ions. Our study reveals that inorganic boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions act as a reversible molecular glue for proteins, providing a potential starting point for the further development of controlled protein assemblies.

         <title>Highly Potent and Intestine Specific P&#8208;Glycoprotein Inhibitor to Enable Oral Delivery of Taxol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taxol is widely used in chemotherapy but couldn't be orally administrated. In this protocol, a series of benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and compound 16&#8201;c was identified as potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor, which could enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency and offers high therapeutic effects in breast cancer xenograft model along with almost none oral absorption itself. Therefore, this work provides a valuable strategy of Taxol's oral delivery and chemotherapy.







Abstract
Taxol is widely used in cancer chemotherapy; however, the oral absorption of Taxol remains a formidable challenge. Since the intestinal p&#8208;glycoprotein (P&#8208;gp) mediated drug efflux is one of the primary causes, the development of P&#8208;gp inhibitor is emerging as a promising strategy to realize Taxol's oral delivery. Because P&#8208;gp exists in many tissues, the non&#8208;selective P&#8208;gp inhibitors would lead to toxicity. Correspondingly, a potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor would be an ideal solution to boost the oral absorption of Taxol and avoid exogenous toxicity. Herein, we would like to report a highly potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor to enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency. Through a multicomponent reaction and post&#8208;modification, various benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and the biological evaluation identified 16&#8201;c with potent P&#8208;gp inhibitory activity. Notably, 16&#8201;c was intestine specific and showed almost none absorption (F=0.82&#8201;%), but possessing higher efficacy than Encequidar to improve the oral absorption of Taxol. In MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft model, the oral administration of Taxol and 16&#8201;c showed high therapeutic efficiency and low toxicity, thus providing a valuable chemotherapy strategy.

Pre&#8208;anchoring ruthenium (Ru) single atoms in crystalline red phosphorus boosts its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Yun Hau Ng, Lin Jing et al. highlight in their Research Article (e202409179) the dual role of this innovative strategy in repairing undesired phosphorus defects and enabling Ru nanoparticle anchoring. This results in extended charge lifetimes and enhanced interfacial charge transfer, leading to a "simple" yet highly efficient photocatalytic system for hydrogen production.

Subtractive two&#8208;photon biofabrication facilitates spatiotemporal tissue engineering and drug testing in the laboratory. However, it necessitates the rational design of cell&#8208;compatible, photolabile macromolecular networks that cleave rapidly upon laser exposure. In their Communication (e202404599), Xiao&#8208;Hua Qin and co&#8208;workers develop coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels that enable two&#8208;photon direct laser writing of complex 3D microfluidic networks at 300&#160;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept laser&#8208;guided tissue morphogenesis is demonstrated at micron&#8208;scale resolution.

Copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with unstable Cu coordination centers are electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported on the remaining MOF structure. The synergistic effect of the Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8211;*CO coupling to generate *CH2CHO species, leading to an excellent electrocatalytic CO2&#8722;to&#8722;EtOH performance, as reported by Jin Huang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409270).

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Adenine Derived Secondary Nucleic Acid Frameworks: From Structural Characteristics to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>

Supramolecular oligo&#8208;adenine structures, including A&#8208;motif, T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex, adenine&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, and adenine&#8208;coralyne&#8208;adenine complex, find growing interest in the area of DNA&#8208;nanotechnology, and significant recent advances and applications of these frameworks are demonstrated.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208;adenine (polyA) is primarily known for its critical role in mRNA stability, translational status, and gene regulation. Beyond its biological functions, extensive research has unveiled the diverse applications of polyA. In response to environmental stimuli, single polyA strands undergo distinctive structural transitions into diverse secondary configurations, which are reversible upon the introduction of appropriate counter&#8208;triggers. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances of noncanonical structures derived from polyA, including A&#8208;motif duplex, A&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, A&#8208;coralyne&#8208;A duplex, and T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex. The structural characteristics and mechanisms underlying these conformations under specific external stimuli are addressed, followed by examples of their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA hydrogels, supramolecular fibre assembly, molecular electronics and switches, biosensing and bioengineering, payloads encapsulation and release, and others. A detailed comparison of these polyA&#8208;derived noncanonical structures is provided, highlighting their distinctive features. Furthermore, by integrating their stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and conformational characteristics, advanced material development, such as pH&#8208;cascaded DNA hydrogels and supramolecular fibres exhibiting dynamic structural transitions adapting environmental cues, are introduced. An outlook for future developments is also discussed. These polyA derived, stimuli&#8208;responsive, noncanonical structures enrich the arsenal of DNA &#8220;toolbox&#8221;, offering dynamic DNA frameworks for diverse future applications.

         <title>Stable Silica&#8208;Based Zeolites with Three&#8208;Dimensional Systems of Extra&#8208;Large Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the discovery and properties of the first stable, silica&#8208;based zeolites with 3D systems of extra&#8208;large pores. A hydrothermal synthesis using a large phosphonium cation affords the direct synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 and chain silicate ZEO&#8208;2. A 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation of ZEO&#8208;2 yields zeolite ZEO&#8208;3, while its silylation followed by topotactic condensation affords the zeolite of lowest density, ZEO&#8208;5.







Abstract
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12&#8197;SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.

         <title>Coumarin&#8208;Based Photodegradable Hydrogels Enable Two&#8208;Photon Subtractive Biofabrication at 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1</title>

Coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels enable fast two&#8208;photon subtractive 3D microprinting and laser&#8208;guided cell outgrowth on demand, opening new avenues for bio&#8208;applications, such as spatiotemporal tissue engineering.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally controlled two&#8208;photon photodegradation of hydrogels has gained increasing attention for high&#8208;precision subtractive tissue engineering. However, conventional photolabile hydrogels often have poor efficiency upon two&#8208;photon excitation in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region and thus require high laser dosage that may compromise cell activity. As a result, high&#8208;speed two&#8208;photon hydrogel erosion in the presence of cells remains challenging. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of efficient coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels to overcome these limitations. A set of photolabile coumarin&#8208;functionalized polyethylene glycol linkers are synthesized through a Passerini multicomponent reaction. After mixing these linkers with thiolated hyaluronic acid, semi&#8208;synthetic photodegradable hydrogels are formed in situ via Michael addition crosslinking. The efficiency of photodegradation in these hydrogels is significantly higher than that in nitrobenzyl counterparts upon two&#8208;photon irradiation at 780&#8197;nm. A complex microfluidic network mimicking the bone microarchitecture is successfully fabricated in preformed coumarin hydrogels at high speeds of up to 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1 and low laser dosage down to 10&#8197;mW. Further, we demonstrate fast two&#8208;photon printing of hollow microchannels inside a hydrogel to spatiotemporally direct cell migration in 3D. Collectively, these hydrogels may open new avenues for fast laser&#8208;guided tissue fabrication at high spatial resolution.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalating Supramolecular Hydrogels for Tunable Thermal and Viscoelastic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce DNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) that leverage the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA as a cross&#8208;linking mechanism. These DISHs exhibit tunable endothermic or exothermic driven material properties via strategic choice of intercalator. Interestingly, acridine&#8208;PEG cross&#8208;linkers showing increasing elasticity with increasing temperature, suggesting these materials are joined by purely entropic forces.







Abstract
Polymeric supramolecular hydrogels (PSHs) leverage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains to govern their structural characteristics. As these materials are formed via endothermic or exothermic equilibria, their thermal response is challenging to control without drastically changing the nature of the chemistry used to join them. In this study, we introduce a novel class of PSHs utilizing the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the primary dynamic non&#8208;covalent interaction. The resulting dsDNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) can be tuned to exhibit both endothermically or exothermically driven binding through strategic selection of intercalators. Bifunctional polyethylene glycol (MW~2000&#8197;Da) capped with intercalators of varying hydrophobicity, charge, and size (acridine, psoralen, thiazole orange, and phenanthridine) produced DISHs with comparable moduli (500&#8211;1000&#8197;Pa), but unique thermal viscoelastic responses. Notably, acridine&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkers displayed invariant and even increasing relaxation times with temperature, suggesting an endothermic binding mechanism. This methodology expands the set of structure&#8208;properties available to biomass&#8208;derived DNA biomaterials and promises a new material system where a broad set of thermal and viscoelastic responses can be obtained due to the sheer number and variety of intercalating molecules.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial enzymes that operate with pnictogen bonds or &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in general are introduced: Transfer hydrogenation of quinolines accelerates with biotinylated pnictogen&#8208;bonding cofactors and their interfacing with streptavidin and mutants, shows saturation behavior with transition&#8208;state recognition three orders of magnitude beyond substrate recognition, and the emergence of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The objective of this study was to create artificial enzymes that capitalize on pnictogen bonding, a &#963;&#8208;hole interaction that is essentially absent in biocatalysis. For this purpose, stibine catalysts were equipped with a biotin derivative and combined with streptavidin mutants to identify an efficient transfer hydrogenation catalyst for the reduction of a fluorogenic quinoline substrate. Increased catalytic activity from wild&#8208;type streptavidin to the best mutants coincides with the depth of the &#963; hole on the Sb(V) center, and the emergence of saturation kinetic behavior. Michaelis&#8211;Menten analysis reveals transition&#8208;state recognition in the low micromolar range, more than three orders of magnitude stronger than the millimolar substrate recognition. Carboxylates preferred by the best mutants contribute to transition&#8208;state recognition by hydrogen&#8208;bonded ion pairing and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with the emerging pyridinium product. The emergence of challenging stereoselectivity in aqueous systems further emphasizes compatibility of pnictogen bonding with higher order systems catalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of an Unlikely Occurring Quadrangular Tube by Modulating Intramolecular Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor with a central dibenzothiophene moiety, functionalized at the 3,7&#8208;positions with m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. Combining this with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine at high concentrations produced a quadrangular tube, driven by intramolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions within the framework. This research highlights how modulating these forces can yield products previously deemed difficult or impossible to synthesize.







Abstract
One of the central focuses in self&#8208;assembly is precisely controlling the self&#8208;assembly pathway so that the target molecules can be produced exclusively. Trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine contains two amino units that form a 60&#176; angle when projected on a plane. This angle naturally favors the formation of triangular products in most cases when trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine is used as a bisamino building block in the synthesis of macrocycles and tubes. Here, we synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor bearing a central dibenzothiophene moiety, whose 3,7&#8208;positions are functionalized with two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. We observed that combining this tetraformyl building block with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine yielded a quadrangular tube when the concentrations of the precursors were relatively high. Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the formation of this unlikely occurring quadrangular product was driven by the intramolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the dibenzothiophene building blocks within the tube framework. This driving force, however, was disturbed in the triangular tube, a smaller counterpart whose formation was considered previously much more thermodynamically favored. These results improved our fundamental understanding on how to create those products whose syntheses are considered difficult or impossible, by modulating the intramolecular driving forces.

         <title>P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15): A Phosphorus Tantalum Nitride Featuring Mixed&#8208;Valent Tantalum and P/Ta Disorder Visualized by Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first phosphorus tantalum nitride P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15) was obtained at high&#8208;pressure conditions. It features a three&#8208;dimensional network that exhibits PN6 octahedra and occupational disorder of P and Ta atoms visualized by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Mixed&#8208;valent Ta atoms result in metallic behavior with rather high resistivity.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis, crystal, and electronic structure, as well as the magnetic, and electric properties of the phosphorus&#8208;containing tantalum nitride P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15). A high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction (8&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8201;&#176;C) of Ta3N5 and P3N5 with NH4F as a mineralizing agent yields the compound in the form of black, rod&#8208;shaped crystals.

         <title>Copper(I) Catalysed Diboron(4) Reduction of Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new process for the deoxygenation of nitrous oxide is presented which uses copper(I) boryl complexes as highly productive catalysts and leverages the oxophilicity of boron as a thermodynamic driving force. Selective N&#8722;O bond activation of nitrous oxide is mediated by O&#8208;atom insertion into the metal&#8211;boron bond and turnover numbers over 800 can be achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
A process for the catalytic reduction of nitrous oxide using NHC&#8208;ligated copper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide precatalysts and B2pin2 as the reductant is reported. These reactions proceed under mild conditions via copper(I)&#8208;boryl intermediates which react with N2O by facile O&#8208;atom insertion into the Cu&#8722;B bond and liberate N2. Turnover numbers &gt;800 can be achieved at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 1&#8197;bar N2O.

         <title>Electrolyte Composition&#8208;Dependent Product Selectivity in CO2 Reduction with a Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major product of electrochemical CO2 reduction on a porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework catalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was found to switch from CO to formic acid upon electrolyte composition changing. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies indicates pathway steering by addition of extra proton source to the electrolyte.







Abstract
A copper porphyrin&#8208;derived metal&#8211;organic framework electrocatalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was synthesized and its catalytic activity for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) was investigated. FICN&#8208;8 selectively catalyzed electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in anhydrous acetonitrile electrolyte. However, formic acid became the dominant CO2RR product with the addition of a proton source to the system. Mechanistic studies revealed the change of major reduction pathway upon proton source addition, while catalyst&#8208;bound hydride (*H) species was proposed as the key intermediate for formic acid production. This work highlights the importance of electrolyte composition on CO2RR product selectivity.

         <title>Wiring Covalent Organic Frameworks with Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing pyrrole units to pore walls followed by polymerization integrates spatially segregated six single file molecular wires in each pore of covalent organic frameworks. This wiring strategy offers a distinct electronic channel to enable electronic conduction along the z direction in the pores and to achieve an exceptional charge carrier stability and motion. This result highlights a new aspect and dimension for designing &#960; electronic organic materials based on molecular wiring.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks are a class of crystalline porous polymers formed by linking organic units into periodically aligned skeletons and pores. Here we report a strategy for wiring these frameworks with conducting polymers via wall engineering and polymerization. We anchored each edge site with one pyrrole unit, which is densely packed along the z direction yet protruded from pore walls. This assembly enables the polymerization of pyrrole units to form polypyrrole and creates a new polypyrrole chain conformation. The resultant framework constitutes six single file polypyrrole chains in each pore and develop spatially segregated yet built&#8208;in single molecular wires with exceptional stable polarons. Hall effect measurements revealed that the materials are p&#8208;type semiconductors, increase conductivity by eight orders of magnitude compared to the pristine frameworks, and achieve a carrier mobility as large as 13.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Our results open an avenue to &#960; electronic frameworks by interlayer molecular wiring with conducting polymers.

         <title>Boosting Stimulated Emission via a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Co&#8208;Crystallization Approach in Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stimulated emission of molecular crystals was boosted via a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Structural and theoretical analyses revealed that the higher radiative transition rate and shorter excited&#8208;lifetime in the cocrystal lead to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, thereby facilitating the occurrence of stimulated emission.







Abstract
Stimulated emission (SE) of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule in solid state remains a significant challenge, mainly involving the mode of molecular stacking that invariably alters the photo&#8208;physical processes. Herein, we successfully realized stimulated emission in molecular crystals using a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Two hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals, obtained from 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;p&#8208;cyanostyrylbenzene (CNDSB) and two types of co&#8208;formers, can boost stimulated emission and show decent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), whereas the parent CNDSB crystal is not SE&#8208;active. Crystal structural analysis demonstrated that the co&#8208;crystallization eliminated excimer formation. The resulting higher kr and shorter excited lifetime led to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, which benefited to the occurrence of ASE. Simultaneously, the uniaxial arrangements along the long axis of co&#8208;crystal together contributed to highly polarized emission. This system presents very rare evidence of boosting stimulated emission by binary co&#8208;crystallization, which enriches our insights into organic solid&#8208;state lasers.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Vesicle Microreactors for Oscillating ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered vesicle microreactors with multiple functional proteins are constructed for bioenergy oscillation. Modulating biocatalytic reaction involved with each fuel (glucose, urea) generates and consumes protons respectively, which facilitates ATP synthesis and hydrolysis of ATPase in a tunable fashion.







Abstract
We construct a compartmentalized nanoarchitecture to regulate bioenergy level. Glucose dehydrogenase, urease and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are encapsulated inside through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. ATPase and glucose transporter embedded in hybrid liposomes are attached at the surface. Glucose is transported and converted to gluconic acid catalyzed by glucose dehydrogenase, resulting in an outward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP synthesis. In parallel, urease catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to generate ammonia, which leads to an inward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP hydrolysis. These processes lead to a change of the direction of proton gradient, thus achieving artificial ATP oscillation. Importantly, the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillation can be programmed. The work explores nanoarchitectonics integrating multiple components to realize artificial and precise oscillation of bioenergy level.

The deoxygenative geminal silylboration of amides using silylboronates in the presence of alkoxide base catalyst, producing &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines, is reported herein. Both silicon and boron groups from &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines were found useful in the context of further chemoselective transformations, such as protonation and alkylation.

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Styrenes Installing a Terminal NH2 Group Alongside Unprotected Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes is described that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles at the internal position, including primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and an ammonia surrogate. Two complementary set of conditions allow embedding both electronically activated and deactivated styrenes bearing diverse functional groups.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Diamination of alkenes represents an attractive way to generate differentiated vicinal diamines, which are prevalent motifs in biologically active compounds and catalysts. However, existing methods are usually limited in scope and produce diamines where one or both nitrogens are protected, adding synthetic steps for deprotection and further N&#8208;functionalization to reach a desired target. Furthermore, the range of amino groups that can be introduced at the internal position is fairly limited. Here we describe a 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles (primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and ammonia surrogate) at the internal position. Two complementary sets of conditions encompass electronically activated and deactivated styrenes with diverse substitution patterns and functional groups. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to the 1,2&#8208;aminothiolation of styrenes.

         <title>Solvent Attenuation of London Dispersion in Polycyclic Aromatic Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic attenuation of polycyclic aromatic stacking due to solvent competition is measured experimentally. Interaction energies scale with surface contact area but are attenuated by an order of magnitude in solution. The extent of attenuation scales with the bulk polarisability of the solvent.







Abstract
Solvent competition for London dispersion attenuates its energetic significance in molecular recognition processes. By varying both the stacked contact area and the solvent, here we experimentally deconvolute solvent attenuation using molecular balances. Experimental stacking energies (phenyl to pyrene) correlated strongly with calculations only when dispersion was considered. Such calculations favoured stacking by up to &#8722;27&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in the gas phase, but it was weakly disfavoured in our solution&#8208;phase experiments (+0.5 to +4.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Nonetheless, the propensity for stacking increased with contact area and in solvents with lower bulk polarisabilities that compete less for dispersion. Experimental stacking energies per unit change in solvent accessible area ranged from &#8722;0.02&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CS2, to &#8722;0.05&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CD2Cl2, but were dwarfed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase energy of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2. The results underscore the challenge facing the exploitation of dispersion in solution. Solvent competition strongly but imperfectly cancels dispersion at molecular recognition interfaces, making the energetic benefits difficult to realise.

         <title>Iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;7 Selective NH2 Amination of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indole via directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS), enabled by identifying N&#8211;P(O)t&#8722;Bu2 (TBPO) as the directing group. Important features of this reaction include the broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, good functional groups tolerance, use of earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst and low catalyst loading, and the ease to scale up.







Abstract
7&#8208;Aminoindoles are important synthetic intermediates to a broad range of bioactive molecules. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H amination is among the most straightforward route for their synthesis, whereas methods that could directly incorporate an NH2 group in a highly selective manner remains elusive. Moreover, there is still high demand for the development of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis for such attractive reactivity. We present here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indoles through a directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) with iron&#8208;aminyl radical. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerates variety of functional groups, and is readily scalable with catalyst loading down to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover number (TON) up to 4500.

Transition metal-catalyzed directed C&#8722;H amination is among the most straightforward route for their synthesis, whereas methods that could directly incorporate an NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group in a highly selective manner remains elusive. Moreover, there is still high demand for the development of earth-abundant metal catalysis for such attractive reactivity. We present here the first C-7 selective NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amination of indoles through a directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) with iron-aminyl radical. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerates variety of functional groups, and is readily scalable with catalyst loading down to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover number (TON) up to 4500.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Spatial Surface Energy in Porous Skeletons: a Pathway to Bridging Electronic Circuits from 2D to 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing maskless surface energy manipulation on a porous skeleton to guide PEDOT conductive ink deposition, electric circuits with high precision, density, stability, and adaptability are effortlessly engineered within or atop the porous skeleton. This facilitates transitions between 2D and 3D circuit configurations in electronic devices, whether rigid or flexible.







Abstract
Conventional approaches to creating high&#8208;resolution electric circuits face challenges such as the requirement for skilled personnel and expensive equipment. In response, we propose an innovative strategy that leverages a photochemically modified porous polymer skeleton for in&#8208;situ circuit fabrication. By developing maskless surface energy manipulation that guides PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based conductive ink deposition, electric circuits with high precision, density, stability and adaptability are effortlessly engineered within or atop the porous skeleton, enabling transitions between 2D and 3D circuit configurations. This process simplifies prototyping while significantly reducing costs and maintaining efficiency, promising advancements across various technological sectors.
