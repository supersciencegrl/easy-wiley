         <title>Strategies for Achieving Ultra&#8208;long ORR Durability &#8208; Rh Activates Interatomic Interactions in Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of platinum&#8208;based alloy catalysts is crucial for the future development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, considering the potential dissolution of transition metals under complex operating conditions. Here, we report on a Rh&#8208;doped Pt3Co alloy that exhibits strong interatomic interactions, thereby enhancing the durability of fuel cells. The Rh&#8208;Pt3Co/C catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) (1.31 A mgPt&#8208;1 at 0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and maintaining 92% of its mass activity after 170,000 potential cycles). Long&#8208;term testing has shown direct inhibition of Co dissolution in Rh&#8208;Pt3Co/C. Furthermore, tests on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have shown excellent performance and long&#8208;term durability with low Pt loading. After 50,000 cycles, there was no voltage loss at 0.8 A cm&#8208;2 for Rh&#8208;Pt3Co/C, while Pt3Co/C experienced a loss of 200 mV. Theoretical calculations suggest that introducing transition metal atoms through doping creates a stronger compressive strain, which in turn leads to increased catalytic activity. Additionally, Rh doping increases the energy barrier for Co diffusion in the bulk phase, while also raising the vacancy formation energy of the surface Pt. This ensures the long&#8208;term stability of the alloy over the course of the cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient One&#8208;pot Electrosynthesis of Oxime Ethers from NOx over Ultrafine MgO Nanoparticles Derived from Mg&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxime ethers are attractive compounds in medicinal scaffolds due to the biological and pharmaceutical properties, however, the crucial and widespread step of industrial oxime formation using explosive hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is insecure and troublesome. Herein, we present a convenient method of oxime ether synthesis in a one&#8208;pot tandem electrochemical system using magnesium based metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#8208;derived magnesium oxide anchoring in self&#8208;supporting carbon nanofiber membrane catalyst (MgO&#8208;SCM), the in situ NH2OH from nitrogen oxides electrocatalytic reduction couples with aldehyde to produce 4&#8208;cyanobenzaldoxime with a selectivity of 93% and Faraday efficiency up to 65.1%, which further reacted with benzyl bromide to directly give oxime ether precipitate with a purity of 97% by convenient filtering separation. The high efficiency was attributed to the ultrafine MgO nanoparticles in MgO&#8208;SCM, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerating the production of NH2OH, which rapidly attacked carbonyl of aldehydes to form oximes, but hardly crossed the hydrogenation barrier of forming amines, thus leading to a high yield of oxime ether when coupling benzyl bromide nucleophilic reaction. This work highlights the importance of kinetic control in complex electrosynthetic organonitrogen system and demonstrates a green and safe alternative method for synthesis of organic nitrogen drug molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Boost the Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Chiral Organometallic Platinum Complexes by Hierarchical Assembly into Fibrillar Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active molecular materials have drawn increasing attention due to their promising applications for next&#8208;generation display and optoelectronic technologies. Currently, it is challenging to obtain CPL materials with both large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and high quantum yield (&#934;). A pair of enantiomeric N^N^C&#8208;type Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;1 modified with chiral Leucine methyl ester are presented herein. Though the solutions of these complexes are CPL&#8208;inactive, the spin&#8208;coated thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 exhibit giantly&#8208;amplified circularly polarized phosphorescences with |glum| of 0.53 at 560 nm and &#934;air of ~50%, as well as appealing circular dichroism (CD) signals with the maximum absorption dissymmetry factor |gabs| of 0.37&#8722;0.43 at 480 nm. This superior CPL performance benefits from the hierarchical formation of crystalline fibrillar networks upon spin coating. Comparative studies of another pair of chiral Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;2 with a symmetric N^C^N coordination mode suggest that the asymmetric N^N^C coordination of (L/D)&#8208;1 are favorable for the efficient exciton delocalization to amplify the CPL performance. Optical applications of the thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 in CPL&#8208;contrast imaging and inducing CP light generation from achiral emitters and common light&#8208;emitting diode lamps have been successfully realized.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Scaling Relationship in C&#8208;N Coupling via the Doping Effects for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical C&#8208;N coupling reaction based on carbon dioxide and nitrate have been emerged as a new &#8216;&#8216;green synthetic strategy&#8217;&#8217; for the synthesis of urea, but the catalytic efficiency is seriously restricted by the inherent scaling relations of adsorption energies of the active sites, the improvement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by the decrease in selectivity. Herein, a doping engineering strategy was proposed to break the scaling relationship of intermediate binding and minimize the kinetic barrier of C&#8208;N coupling. A thus designed SrCo0.39Ru0.61O3&#8208;&#948; catalyst achieves a urea yield rate of 1522 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 and faradic efficiency of 34.1% at &#8208;0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. A series of characterizations revealed that Co doping not only induces lattice distortion but also creates rich oxygen vacancies (OV) in the SrRuO3. The oxygen vacancies weaken the adsorption of *CO and *NH2 intermediates on the Co and Ru sites respectively, and the strain effects over the Co&#8208;Ru dual sites promoting the occurrence of C&#8208;N coupling of the two monomers instead of selective hydrogenating to form by&#8208;products. This work presents an insight into molecular coupling reactions towards urea synthesis via the doping engineering on SrRuO3.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pallamolides A&#8722;E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential Michael addition reactions formed the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core of pallamolides A&#8722;E in the first total synthesis of these densely functionalized natural products. The approach also featured a SmI2&#8208;mediated intramolecular ketyl&#8211;enoate cyclization to generate the oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety and an acid&#8208;mediated deprotection/oxa&#8208;Michael addition/&#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination cascade to assemble the tetracyclic skeleton of the pallamolides.







Abstract
We have achieved the first total synthesis of pallamolides A&#8722;E. Of these compounds, pallamolides B&#8722;E possess intriguing tetracyclic skeletons with novel intramolecular transesterifications. Key transformations include highly diastereoselective sequential Michael addition reactions to construct the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core with the simultaneous generation of two quaternary carbon centers, a one&#8208;pot SmI2&#8208;mediated intramolecular ketyl&#8211;enoate cyclization/ketone reduction to generate the key oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety, and an acid&#8208;mediated deprotection/oxa&#8208;Michael addition/&#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination cascade sequence to assemble the tetracyclic pallamolide skeleton. Kinetic resolution of ketone 14 through Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata reduction enabled the asymmetric synthesis of pallamolides A&#8722;E.

The electrochemical reductive valorization of CO2 (CO2RR) has been studied and compared using copper surfaces and graphene&#8208;embedded, N&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (MNC) catalysts. This study explains the reaction mechanisms of CO2RR and identifies future challenges in optimizing catalyst design to improve efficiency and selectivity.







Abstract
The electrochemical reductive valorization of CO2, referred to as the CO2RR, is an emerging approach for the conversion of CO2&#8208;containing feeds into valuable carbonaceous fuels and chemicals, with potential contributions to carbon capture and use (CCU) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Copper surfaces and graphene&#8208;embedded, N&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (MNC) catalysts exhibit distinctive reactivity, attracting attention as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2RR. This review offers a comparative analysis of CO2RR on copper surfaces and MNC catalysts, highlighting their unique characteristics in terms of CO2 activation, C1/C2(+) product formation, and the competing hydrogen evolution pathway. The assessment underscores the significance of understanding structure&#8211;activity relationships to optimize catalyst design for efficient and selective CO2RR. Examining detailed reaction mechanisms and structure&#8208;selectivity patterns, the analysis explores recent insights into changes in the chemical catalyst states, atomic motif rearrangements, and fractal agglomeration, providing essential kinetic information from advanced in/ex situ microscopy/spectroscopy techniques. At the end, this review addresses future challenges and solutions related to today's disconnect between our current molecular understanding of structure&#8211;activity&#8208;selectivity relations in CO2RR and the relevant factors controlling the performance of CO2 electrolyzers over longer times, with larger electrode sizes, and at higher current densities.

         <title>Carrier Protein Interaction with Competing Adenylation and Epimerization Domains in a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Analyzed by FRET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nonribosomal peptide synthetases, the peptidyl&#8208;carrier&#8208;protein (PCP) of each module tethers the amino acid to be incorporated into the peptide product. Its interaction with multiple catalytic domains is barely studied. We reveal a surprising competition of the adenylation (A) and epimerization (E) domains for the PCP in an A&#8208;PCP&#8208;E module. New principles of conformational equilibria emerge that can contrast the anticipated catalytic logic.







Abstract
In multi&#8208;domain nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) the order of domains and their catalytic specificities dictate the structure of the peptide product. Peptidyl&#8208;carrier proteins (PCPs) bind activated amino acids and channel elongating peptidyl intermediates along the protein template. To this end, fine&#8208;tuned interactions with the catalytic domains and large&#8208;scale PCP translocations are necessary. Despite crystal structure snapshots of several PCP&#8208;domain interactions, the conformational dynamics under catalytic conditions in solution remain poorly understood. We report a FRET reporter of gramicidin S synthetase 1 (GrsA; with A&#8208;PCP&#8208;E domains) to study for the first time the interaction between PCP and adenylation (A) domain in the presence of an epimerization (E) domain, a competing downstream partner for the PCP. Bulk FRET measurements showed that upon PCP aminoacylation a conformational shift towards PCP binding to the A domain occurs, indicating the E domain acts on its PCP substrate out of a disfavored conformational equilibrium. Furthermore, the A domain was found to preferably bind the D&#8208;Phe&#8208;S&#8208;Ppant&#8208;PCP stereoisomer, suggesting it helps in establishing the stereoisomeric mixture in favor of the D&#8208;aminoacyl moiety. These observations surprisingly show that the conformational logic can deviate from the order of domains and thus reveal new principles in the multi&#8208;domain interplay of NRPSs.

         <title>Control of the Hydroquinone/Benzoquinone Redox State in High&#8208;Mobility Semiconducting Conjugated Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel synthetic strategy to modulate the electronic band structure of conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs) through control of the redox state of hydroquinone/benzoquinone ligands during synthesis. We successfully synthesized two distinct semiconducting c&#8208;CPs, Ag4TTBQ(TTBQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolbenzoquinone) and Ag4TTHQ(TTHQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolhydroquinone), by reacting TTHQ with silver nitrate and silver acetate, respectively. Despite sharing the same topological structure, charge transport measurements and DFT calculations reveal significant differences in their electronic structures. Notably, Ag4TTHQ demonstrates superior thermoelectric performance compared to other silver&#8208;based c&#8208;CPs. This research unveils a pioneering approach to finely tune the electronic band structure and properties of c&#8208;CPs, and paves the way for advanced applications in high&#8208;performance thermoelectric and electronic devices.







Abstract
Conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs) are unique organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid semiconductors with intrinsically high electrical conductivity and excellent charge carrier mobility. However, it remains a challenge in tailoring electronic structures, due to the lack of clear guidelines. Here, we develop a strategy wherein controlling the redox state of hydroquinone/benzoquinone (HQ/BQ) ligands allows for the modulation of the electronic structure of c&#8208;CPs while maintaining the structural topology. The redox&#8208;state control is achieved by reacting the ligand TTHQ (TTHQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolhydroquinone) with silver acetate and silver nitrate, yielding Ag4TTHQ and Ag4TTBQ (TTBQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolbenzoquinone), respectively. In spite of sharing the same topology consisting of a two&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8722;S network and HQ/BQ layer, they exhibit different band gaps (1.5&#8197;eV for Ag4TTHQ and 0.5&#8197;eV for Ag4TTBQ) and conductivities (0.4 S/cm for Ag4TTHQ and 10 S/cm for Ag4TTBQ). DFT calculations reveal that these differences arise from the ligand oxidation state inhibiting energy band formation near the Fermi level in Ag4TTHQ. Consequently, Ag4TTHQ displays a high Seebeck coefficient of 330&#8197;&#956;V/K and a power factor of 10&#8197;&#956;W/m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K2, surpassing Ag4TTBQ and the other reported silver&#8208;based c&#8208;CPs. Furthermore, terahertz spectroscopy demonstrates high charge mobilities exceeding 130&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s in both Ag4TTHQ and Ag4TTBQ.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of MOF&#8208;Derived Bimetallic Oxide Solid Solution Anchored with Au Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas and C2 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through crystal engineering and MOF derivation, the Zr/Ti bimetallic oxide solid solution anchored with Au nanoparticles can be elaborately designed and synthesized to integrate multiple active sites, achieving photocatalytic CO2 reduction to syngas and eventually C2 hydrocarbons under simulated solar light irradiation.







Abstract
Considering that CO2 reduction is mostly a multielectron reaction, it is necessary for the photocatalysts to integrate multiple catalytic sites and cooperate synergistically to achieve efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to various products, such as C2 hydrocarbons. Herein, through crystal engineering, we designed and constructed a metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;derived Zr/Ti bimetallic oxide solid solution support, which was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. After anchoring Au nanoparticles, the composite photocatalyst exhibited excellent performances toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction to syngas (H2 and CO production rates of 271.6 and 260.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and even C2 hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6 production rates of 6.80 and 4.05&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). According to the control experiments and theoretical calculations, the strong interaction between bimetallic oxide solid solution support and Au nanoparticles was found to be beneficial for binding intermediates and reducing CO2 reduction, highlighting the synergy effect of the catalytic system with multiple active sites.

A catalyst&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;acetyl cinnamate/acetoacetate exchange reaction featuring high energy barrier in bulk was developed, enabling the production of vitrimers with high creep resistance and reprocessability.

Vitrimers represent an emerging class of polymeric materials that combine the desirable characteristics of both thermoplastics and thermosets achieved through the design of dynamic covalent bonds within the polymer networks. However, these materials are prone to creep due to the inherent instability of dynamic covalent bonds. Consequently, there are pressing demands for the development of robust and stable dynamic covalent chemistries. Here, we report a catalyst&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;acetyl cinnamate/acetoacetate (&#945;&#8208;AC/A) exchange reaction to develop vitrimers with remarkable creep resistance. Small&#8208;molecule model studies revealed that the &#945;&#8208;AC/A exchange occurred at temperatures above 140&#8201;&#176;C in bulk, whereas at 120&#8201;&#176;C, this reaction was absent. For demonstration in the case of polymers, copolymers derived from common vinyl monomers were crosslinked with terephthalaldehyde to produce &#945;&#8208;AC/A vitrimers with tunable thermal and mechanical performance. All resulting &#945;&#8208;AC/A vitrimers exhibited high stability, especially in terms of creep resistance at 120&#8201;&#176;C, while retaining commendable reprocessability when subjected to high temperatures. This work showcases the &#945;&#8208;AC/A exchange reaction as a novel and robust dynamic covalent chemistry capable of imparting both reprocessability and high stability to cross&#8208;linked networks.

         <title>Synthetic Peptides: Promising Modalities for the Targeting of Disease&#8208;Related Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acids play pivotal roles in life processes. Their dysregulation is implicated in numerous diseases while therapeutic compounds targeting them remain limited. In this review we focus on synthetic peptides which offer potential solutions for targeting double&#8208;stranded DNA, regulatory G&#8208;quadruplexes and non&#8208;coding RNAs.







Abstract
DNA and RNA play pivotal roles in life processes by storing and transferring genetic information, modulating gene expression, and contributing to essential cellular machinery such as ribosomes. Dysregulation and mutations in nucleic acid&#8208;related processes are implicated in numerous diseases. Despite the critical impact on health of nucleic acid mutations or dysregulation, therapeutic compounds addressing these biomolecules remain limited. Peptides have emerged as a promising class of molecules for biomedical research, offering potential solutions for challenging drug targets. This review focuses on the use of synthetic peptides to target disease&#8208;related nucleic acids. We discuss examples of peptides targeting double&#8208;stranded DNA, including the clinical candidate Omomyc, and compounds designed for regulatory G&#8208;quadruplexes. Further, we provide insights into both library&#8208;based screenings and the rational design of peptides to target regulatory human RNA scaffolds and viral RNAs, emphasizing the potential of peptides in addressing nucleic acid&#8208;related diseases.

Enhance immune&#8208;killing: A ultra&#8208;galactocation to sialic acid strategy is designed by using a penta&#8208;functional dendritic probe (Den@5F) to simultaneously block sialic acid and hugely introduce galactose on tumor cells in vivo for the enhancement of immune&#8208;killing.







Abstract
Glycans on tumor cell surface have significant impacts in the immune&#8208;killing process. Here an ultra&#8208;galactocation to sialic acid (Sia) strategy is designed to hugely introduce galactose (Gal) to Sia and on tumor cells in vivo by using a penta&#8208;functional dendritic probe (Den@5F), which efficiently enhances the immune&#8208;killing of tumor cells. The Den@5F contains five different kinds of functional groups, including Gal, Cy5, amino, phenylboronic acid (PBA) and 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;nitrophenoxy) butanoate (mNB), which can be conveniently prepared through a two&#8208;step reaction. After injecting into the tumor&#8208;bearing mouse, Den@5F can efficiently block Sia through the specific recognition between PBA and Sia on tumor cells and hugely introduce Gal through the subsequent photo&#8208;crosslinking between mNB and amino groups to multiply conjugate excessive Den@5Fs. The comprehensively blocked Sia can prevent the immune escape, and the hugely introduced Gal can promote the immune stimulation of the immune cells, which lead to an efficient enhancement of the immune&#8208;killing. The proposed strategy provides a significant and promising tool to promote the clinical immunotherapy of tumor.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Viral Detection Using Electrochemical Kinetic Profiling of Aptamer&#8208;Antigen Recognition in Clinical Samples and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimeric aptamers, real&#8208;time kinetic profiling, and machine learning enable high precision analysis of viruses in a single pot directly in clinical samples.







Abstract
High&#8208;precision viral detection at point of need with clinical samples plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of infectious diseases and the control of a global pandemic. However, the complexity of clinical samples that often contain very low viral concentrations makes it a huge challenge to develop simple diagnostic devices that do not require any sample processing and yet are capable of meeting performance metrics such as very high sensitivity and specificity. Herein we describe a new single&#8208;pot and single&#8208;step electrochemical method that uses real&#8208;time kinetic profiling of the interaction between a high&#8208;affinity aptamer and an antigen on a viral surface. This method generates many data points per sample, which when combined with machine learning, can deliver highly accurate test results in a short testing time. We demonstrate this concept using both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza A viruses as model viruses with specifically engineered high&#8208;affinity aptamers. Utilizing this technique to diagnose COVID&#8208;19 with 37 real human saliva samples results in a sensitivity and specificity of both 100&#8201;% (27 true negatives and 10 true positives, with 0 false negative and 0 false positive), which showcases the superb diagnostic precision of this method.

         <title>Fundamental Structural and Electronic Understanding of Palladium Catalysts on Nitride and Oxide Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of the support type (nitride and oxide) on the charge state of isolated Pd sites has been explored in this work. Furthermore, a correlation was established between the formal oxidation state, the vibrational frequency of adsorbed CO, and the computed Bader charge based on the periodic trends in electronegativity, allowing the identification of appropriate models for the understanding of the coordination structure of Pd center.







Abstract
The nature of the support can fundamentally affect the function of a heterogeneous catalyst. For the novel type of isolated metal atom catalysts, sometimes referred to as single&#8208;atom catalysts, systematic correlations are still rare. Here, we report a general finding that Pd on nitride supports (non&#8208;metal and metal nitride) features a higher oxidation state compared to that on oxide supports (non&#8208;metal and metal oxide). Through thorough oxidation state investigations by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CO&#8208;DRIFTS, and density functional theory (DFT) coupled with Bader charge analysis, it is found that Pd atoms prefer to interact with surface hydroxyl group to form a Pd(OH)x species on oxide supports, while on nitride supports, Pd atoms incorporate into the surface structure in the form of Pd&#8722;N bonds. Moreover, a correlation was built between the formal oxidation state and computational Bader charge, based on the periodic trend in electronegativity.

         <title>Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzymes Catalyze Heterobicyclic and Spirocyclic Isoquinolone Core Formation in Piperazine Alkaloid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of newly identified alkaloids featuring unique heterobicyclic and spirocyclic isoquinolone skeletons, arizonamides and arizolidines, has been characterized. Notably, the non&#8208;heme iron enzyme ParG demonstrated catalytic versatility in multiple oxidative reactions, including cyclization and ring reconstruction. This study has elucidated efficient strategies used by Nature to construct complex multicyclic heterocycle scaffolds.







Abstract
We report the discovery and biosynthesis of new piperazine alkaloids&#8208;arizonamides, and their derived compounds&#8208;arizolidines, featuring heterobicyclic and spirocyclic isoquinolone skeletons, respectively. Their biosynthetic pathway involves two crucial non&#8208;heme iron enzymes, ParF and ParG, for core skeleton construction. ParF has a dual function facilitating 2,3&#8208;alkene formation of helvamide, as a substrate for ParG, and oxidative cleavage of piperazine. Notably, ParG exhibits catalytic versatility in multiple oxidative reactions, including cyclization and ring reconstruction.

     alt="Non-Heme Iron Enzymes Catalyze Heterobicyclic and Spirocyclic Isoquinolone Core Formation in Piperazine Alkaloid Biosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biosynthesis of newly identified alkaloids featuring unique heterobicyclic and spirocyclic isoquinolone skeletons, arizonamides and arizolidines, has been characterized. Notably, the non-heme iron enzyme ParG demonstrated catalytic versatility in multiple oxidative reactions, including cyclization and ring reconstruction. This study has elucidated efficient strategies used by Nature to construct complex multicyclic heterocycle scaffolds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the discovery and biosynthesis of new piperazine alkaloids-arizonamides, and their derived compounds-arizolidines, featuring heterobicyclic and spirocyclic isoquinolone skeletons, respectively. Their biosynthetic pathway involves two crucial non-heme iron enzymes, ParF and ParG, for core skeleton construction. ParF has a dual function facilitating 2,3-alkene formation of helvamide, as a substrate for ParG, and oxidative cleavage of piperazine. Notably, ParG exhibits catalytic versatility in multiple oxidative reactions, including cyclization and ring reconstruction. A key amino acid residue Phe67 was characterized to control the formation of the constrained arizonamide B backbone by ParG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epoxide Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions for Abundant Production of Mugineic Acids and Nicotianamine Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise synthetic approach to mugineic acid and 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was established. Unlike all other synthetic methods, this approach utilized epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions to form two C&#8722;N bonds without redox reactions. Mugineic acid was synthesized on a gram scale, and the dansyl&#8208;labeled nicotianamine (NA) iron complexes were taken up by oocytes overexpressing transporters ZmYS1 (from maize) or PAT1 (from human).







Abstract
A succinct synthetic approach to mugineic acids and 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was established. Unlike all other synthetic methods, this approach utilized epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions to form two C&#8722;N bonds and is characterized by the absence of redox reactions. Mugineic acid was synthesized from three readily available fragments on a gram scale in 6 steps. The protected 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was also synthesized in 4 steps, and the dansyl group, serving as a fluorophore, was introduced through a click reaction after propargylation of the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy group. The dansyl&#8208;labeled nicotianamine (NA) iron complexes were internalized by oocytes overexpressing ZmYS1 (from maize) or PAT1 (from human) transporters, indicating successful transport of the synthesized NA&#8208;probe through these transporters.

         <title>Enhanced Proximity of Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn Ensembles Encaged in UiO&#8208;67 Boosting Catalytic Conversion of Syngas to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monometallic Rh catalyst encapsulated in UiO&#8208;67 was prepared for direct syngas conversion. With the enhanced proximity of the dual&#8208;site Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn ensembles formed spontaneously in the nanocavity of UiO&#8208;67, we obtained, for the first time, a high oxygenate selectivity of 72.0&#8201;% with a remarkable CO conversion of 50.4&#8201;% on the monometallic Rh catalyst.







Abstract
Maintaining high conversion under the premise of high oxygenates selectivity in syngas conversion is important but a formidable challenge in Rh catalysis. Monometallic Rh catalysts provide poor oxygenate conversion efficiency, and efforts have been focused on constructing adjacent polymetallic sites; however, the one&#8208;pass yields of C2+ oxygenates over the reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts were mostly &lt;20&#8201;%. In this study, we constructed a monometallic Rh catalyst encapsulated in UiO&#8208;67 (Rh/UiO&#8208;67) with enhanced proximity to dual&#8208;site Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn ensembles. Unexpectedly, this catalyst exhibited high efficacy for oxygenate synthesis from syngas, giving a high oxygenate selectivity of 72.0&#8201;% with a remarkable CO conversion of 50.4&#8201;%, and the one&#8208;pass yield of C2+ oxygenates exceeded 25&#8201;%. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterizations further revealed the spontaneous formation of an ensemble of Rh single atoms/dimers (Rh1,2) in the proximity of ultrasmall Rh clusters (Rhn) confined within the nanocavity of UiO&#8208;67, providing adjacent Rh+&#8208;Rh0 dual sites dynamically during the reaction that promote the relay of the undissociated CHO species to the CHx species. Thus, our results open a new route for designing highly efficient Rh catalysts for the conversion of syngas to oxygenates by precisely tuning the ensemble and proximity of the dual active sites in a confined space.

         <title>Metabolic&#8208;Glycoengineering&#8208;Enabled Molecularly Specific Acoustic Tweezing Cytometry for Targeted Mechanical Stimulation of Cell Surface Sialoglycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DBCO&#8208;functionalized microbubbles were attached to azide&#8208;tagged sialoglycans on the cell surface generated by cell metabolic engineering to enable molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry. This novel technology was utilized to study the roles of sialoglycans in mechanotransduction, revealing different mechanical properties and mechanoregulatory activities of sialoglycans from protein sensors like integrins.







Abstract
In this study, we developed a novel type of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;functionalized microbubbles (MBs) and validated their attachment to azide&#8208;labelled sialoglycans on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated by metabolic glycoengineering (MGE). This enabled the application of mechanical forces to sialoglycans on hPSCs through molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry (mATC), that is, displacing sialoglycan&#8208;anchored MBs using ultrasound (US). It was shown that subjected to the acoustic radiation forces of US pulses, sialoglycan&#8208;anchored MBs exhibited significantly larger displacements and faster, more complete recovery after each pulse than integrin&#8208;anchored MBs, indicating that sialoglycans are more stretchable and elastic than integrins on hPSCs in response to mechanical force. Furthermore, stimulating sialoglycans on hPSCs using mATC reduced stage&#8208;specific embryonic antigen&#8208;3 (SSEA&#8208;3) and GD3 expression but not OCT4 and SOX2 nuclear localization. Conversely, stimulating integrins decreased OCT4 nuclear localization but not SSEA&#8208;3 and GD3 expression, suggesting that mechanically stimulating sialoglycans and integrins initiated distinctive mechanoresponses during the early stages of hPSC differentiation. Taken together, these results demonstrated that MGE&#8208;enabled mATC uncovered not only different mechanical properties of sialoglycans on hPSCs and integrins but also their different mechanoregulatory impacts on hPSC differentiation, validating MGE&#8208;based mATC as a new, powerful tool for investigating the roles of glycans and other cell surface biomolecules in mechanotransduction.

         <title>Catalytic Ring Expanding Difluorination: An Enantioselective Platform to Access &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Difluorinated Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I(I)/I(III)&#8208;catalysed ring expanding fluorination of cyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters has been developed to generate gem&#8208;difluorinated 6&#8211;10 membered rings (up to 95&#8201;%). Validation of an enantiodivergent variant is also disclosed using a chiral C2&#8208;symmetric resorcinol catalyst (up to 7&#8201;:&#8201;93&#8197;e.r.) and X&#8208;ray analyses of selected products reveals the subtle impact of difluorination on widening the internal &#8736;CCC angle (&#8736;C&#8722;CF2&#8722;C&gt;&#8736;C&#8722;CH2&#8722;C).







Abstract
Cyclic &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;carbonyl compounds have a venerable history as drug discovery leads, but limitations in the synthesis arsenal continue to impede chemical space exploration. This challenge is particularly acute in the arena of fluorinated medium rings where installing the difluoromethylene unit subtly alters the ring conformation by expanding the internal angle (&#8736;C&#8722;CF2&#8722;C&gt;&#8736;C&#8722;CH2&#8722;C): this provides a handle to modulate physicochemistry (e.g. pKa). To reconcile this disparity, a highly modular ring expansion has been devised that leverages simple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides, and processes them to one&#8208;carbon homologated rings with concomitant geminal difluorination (6 to 10 membered rings, up to 95&#8201;% yield). This process is a rare example of the formal difluorination of an internal alkene and is enabled by sequential I(III)&#8208;enabled O&#8208;activation. Validation of enantioselective catalysis in the generation of unprecedented medium ring scaffolds is reported (up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7&#8197;e.r.) together with X&#8208;ray structural analyses and product derivatization.

         <title>From Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2 to Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2: Controlling Sulfur Content in Thiocyanate Systems Significantly Improves the Overall Performance of UV Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first UV NLO crystalline material thiocyanate Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2, with a phase&#8208;matching ability non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) structure was obtained by reducing the sulfur (S) content in the centrosymmetric (CS) structure Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2, achieving the process from 0 (CS) to 1 (NCS) and unprecedented improvement in comprehensive performance, suggesting Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2 is an excellent UV NLO candidate, demonstrating the modulation of the sulfur content of CS thiocyanates is an effective strategy to develop UV NLO crystals.







Abstract
Combining a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) effect (&gt;1&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP)), a large band gap (&gt;4.2&#8197;eV), and a moderate birefringence in ultraviolet (UV) NLO crystals remains a formidable challenge. Herein, Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2, the first example of a thiocyanate capable of realizing a phase&#8208;matched UV NLO crystal material, is obtained by reducing the sulfur (S) content in the centrosymmetric (CS) structure of Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2. Compared to the &#8220;shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder&#8221; one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2, Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2 has a different sawtooth 1D chain structure. Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2 has second harmonic generation (SHG) inertia with a band gap of 3.90&#8197;eV and a UV cutoff edge of 342&#8197;nm, however, it possesses a large birefringence (0.35@546&#8197;nm). In contrast, the symmetry center breaking of Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2 leads to remarkably strong SHG intensity (10&#8197;times that of KDP). Furthermore, it has a wide band gap (4.74&#8197;eV), short UV cutoff edge (234&#8197;nm), and moderate birefringence capable of phase matching (0.17@546&#8197;nm). This research indicates that thiocyanates are a promising class of UV NLO crystal materials, and that modulation of the sulfur content of CS thiocyanates is an effective strategy for the development of UV NLO crystals with excellent overall performances.

         <title>Stabilizing Diluted Active Sites of Ultrasmall High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Efficient Formic Acid Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the synthesis of ultrasmall high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoparticles using sintering&#8208;tolerance dopant elements. The diluted active sites on HEI promote the formic acid oxidation reaction and deliver superior poisoning tolerance due to the weak binding of carbon monoxide intermediates and the sluggish diffusion behavior.







Abstract
The poisoning of undesired intermediates or impurities greatly hinders the catalytic performances of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, high&#8208;entropy intermetallics i&#8208;(PtPdIrRu)2FeCu (HEI) are constructed to inhibit the strongly adsorbed carbon monoxide intermediates (CO*) during the formic acid oxidation reaction. As probed by multiple&#8208;scaled structural characterizations, HEI nanoparticles are featured with partially negative Pt oxidation states, diluted Pt/Pd/Ir/Ru atomic sites and ultrasmall average size less than 2&#8197;nm. Benefiting from the optimized structures, HEI nanoparticles deliver more than 10&#8197;times promotion in intrinsic activity than that of pure Pt, and well&#8208;enhanced mass activity/durability than that of ternary i&#8208;Pt2FeCu intermetallics counterpart. In situ infrared spectroscopy manifests that both bridge and top CO* are favored on pure Pt but limited on HEI. Further theoretical elaboration indicates that HEI displayed a much weaker binding of CO* on Pt sites and sluggish diffusion of CO* among different sites, in contrast to pure Pt that CO* bound more strongly and was easy to diffuse on larger Pt atomic ensembles. This work verifies that HEIs are promising catalysts via integrating the merits of intermetallics and high&#8208;entropy alloys.

         <title>Electrochemical Azo&#8208;free Mitsunobu&#8208;type Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable electrochemical Mitsunobu&#8208;type reaction, featuring azo&#8208;free alcohol activation and broad substrate scope, is reported. This practical method allows facial enantiospecific coupling of diverse heterepcycles and chiral alcohols. This useful method is readily used in the modification of diverse bioactive natural products and multiple&#8208;step synthesis of a drug candidate.







Abstract
The classic chemical Mitsunobu reaction suffers from the need of excess alcohol activation reagents and the generation of significant by&#8208;products. Efforts to overcome these limitations have resulted in numerous creative solutions, but the substrate scope of these catalytic processes remains limited. Here we report an electrochemical Mitsunobu&#8208;type reaction, which features azo&#8208;free alcohol activation and broad substrate scope. This user&#8208;friendly technology allows a vast collection of heterocycles as the nucleophile, which can couple with a series of chiral cyclic and acyclic alcohols in moderate to high yields and excellent ee's. This practical reaction is scalable, chemoselective, uses simple Electrasyn setup with inexpensive electrodes and requires no precaution to exclude air and moisture. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated on the structural modification of diverse bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical derivatives and its straightforward application in a multiple&#8208;step synthesis of a drug candidate.

         <title>Recent Advances in Dearomative Partial Reduction of Benzenoid Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative partial reduction of benzenoid arenes, historically used for reactions like the Birch reduction and Crich addition, has experienced a significant revival with the advent of electrochemistry and photochemistry. Recent advances in this area are depicted, highlighting reduction processes such as dihydrogenation, hydroalkylation, and other hydrofunctionalizations, while also showcasing their applications in natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Dearomative partial reduction is an extraordinary approach for transforming benzenoid arenes and has been well&#8208;known for many decades, as exemplified by the dehydrogenation of Birch reduction and the hydroarylation of Crich addition. Despite its remarkable importance in synthesis, this field has experienced slow progress over the last half&#8208;century. However, a revival has been observed with the recent introduction of electrochemical and photochemical methods. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advancements in dearomative partial reduction of benzenoid arenes, including dihydrogenation, hydroalkylation, arylation, alkenylation, amination, borylation and others. Further, the intriguing utilization of dearomative partial reduction in the synthesis of natural products is also emphasized. It is anticipated that this Minireview will stimulate further progress in arene dearomative transformations.

         <title>Robust Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts for H2O2 Production: Linkage Position Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linkage position matters: Changing para&#8208; to ortho&#8208;position linkage in covalent organic framework photocatalysts results in a high hydrogen peroxide rate of 4396&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in water without sacrificial reagents, and significantly improved long&#8208;term continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance from about 6 to 48&#8197;h.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. However, the nature of organic polymers makes the balance between high activity and stability challenging. We demonstrate that the linkage position matters in the design of robust COF photocatalysts with durable high activity without sacrificial reagents. COFs with ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;linkages (o&#8208;COFs and p&#8208;COFs) were constructed by 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol with benzene&#8208;, pyridine&#8208;, pyrazine&#8208;orthodiamines and paradiamines. The pyrzaine&#8208;containing o&#8208;COFs with two pyridinic nitrogen atoms exhibited a H2O2 production rate of 4396&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 together with long&#8208;time continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance in pure water (48&#8197;h), superior to the corresponding p&#8208;COFs. A four&#8208;step reaction mechanism is proposed by density function calculations. Moreover, the active sites and origin of stability enhancement for o&#8208;COFs are clarified. This work provides a simple and effective molecular design strategy in the design of robust COF photocatalysts for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;The linkage position matters: Changing para- to ortho-position linkage in covalent organic framework photocatalysts results in a high hydrogen peroxide rate of 4396&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in water without sacrificial reagents, and significantly improved long-term continuous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis performance from about 6 to 48&#8197;h.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) synthesis. However, the nature of organic polymers makes the balance between high activity and stability challenging. We demonstrate that the linkage position matters in the design of robust COF photocatalysts with durable high activity without sacrificial reagents. COFs with ortho- and para-linkages (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-COFs and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-COFs) were constructed by 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol with benzene-, pyridine-, pyrazine-orthodiamines and paradiamines. The pyrzaine-containing &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-COFs with two pyridinic nitrogen atoms exhibited a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 4396&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; together with long-time continuous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis performance in pure water (48&#8197;h), superior to the corresponding &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-COFs.

         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atomic Al&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts is developed for ORR, featuring a well&#8208;designed Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No active center with the axial pyrrolyl N ligands (No). The dynamic covalency competition of axial Al&#8208;No and Al&#8208;O bonding could endow the Al center with moderate hybridization between Al 3p orbital and O 2p orbital, alleviating the binding energy of ORR intermediates. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No catalysts exhibit excellent ORR activity, selectivity, and durability







Abstract
The main group metals are commonly perceived as catalytically inert in the context of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) due to the delocalized valence orbitals. Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (M&#8208;Nx) is a promising approach to accelerate catalytic dynamics. Herein, we, for the first time, report the atomically dispersed Al catalysts coordinated with N and C atoms for 4&#8208;electron ORR. The axial coordinated pyrrolyl N group (No) is constructed in the Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No moiety to regulate the p&#8208;band structure of Al center, effectively steering the local environment and structure of the square planar Al&#8208;N4 sites, which typically exhibit too strong interaction with ORR intermediates. The dynamic covalency competition of axial Al&#8208;No and Al&#8208;O bonding could endow the Al center with moderate hybridization between Al 3p orbital and O 2p orbital, alleviating the binding energy of ORR intermediates. The as&#8208;prepared Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No electrocatalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity, selectivity, and durability, along with the rapid kinetics as demonstrated by in situ Raman spectroscopy. This work offers a fundamental comprehension of the fine regulation on p&#8208;band and guides the rational design of main&#8208;group metal&#8208;based single atom catalysts.

         <title>Light&#8208;Regulated Nucleation for Growing Highly Uniform Single&#8208;Crystalline Microrods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of light&#8208;regulated nuclei generation as seeds for living self&#8208;assembly is presented, which is in contrast to conventional methods of restricting spontaneous nucleation and adding seeds. By simply increasing photoirradiation duration or intensity, the number of nuclei can be produced in a controlled manner, thus yielding uniform microrods of varying sizes through seeded growth.







Abstract
We report a light&#8208;irradiation method to control the synchronous nucleation of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) fluorophore for growing highly uniform single&#8208;crystalline microrods, which is in sharp contrast to the prevailing methods of restricting spontaneous nucleation and additionally adding seeds. The D&#8208;A fluorophore was observed to undergo photoinduced electron transfer to CrCl3, leading to the generation of HCl and the subsequent protonation of the D&#8208;A fluorophore. By intensifying photoirradiation or prolonging its duration, the concentration of protonated D&#8208;A fluorophores can be rapidly increased to a high supersaturation level. This results in the formation of a controlled number of nuclei in a synchronous manner, which in turn kickstart the epitaxial growth of protonated D&#8208;A fluorophores towards uniform single&#8208;crystalline microrods of controlled sizes. The light&#8208;regulated synchronous nucleation and uniform growth of microrods are a unique phenomenon that can only be achieved by specific Lewis acids, making it a novel probing method for sensitively detecting strong Lewis acids such as chromium chloride.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of the [NCCCO]&#8722; Cyanoketenate Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of the fundamental cyanoketenate anion from the functionalization of CO with simple reagents in &gt;90&#8201;% yields on a multigram scale. The reactivity with electrophiles is explored, which lead to dimeric products. The neutral cyanoketene, which is actively being sought in the interstellar medium, could also be isolated stabilized by a carbene.







Abstract
Cyanoketene is a fundamental molecule that is actively being searched for in the interstellar medium. Its deprotonated form (cyanoketenate) is a heterocumulene that is isoelectronic to carbon suboxide whose structure has been the subject of debate. However, the investigation of cyanoketene and its derivatives is hampered by the lack of practical synthetic routes to these compounds. We report the first synthesis of the cyanoketenate anion in [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][NCCCO] (1) as a stable molecule on a multigram scale in excellent yields (&gt;90&#8201;%). The structure of this molecule is probed crystallographically and computationally. We also explore the protonation of 1, and its reaction with triphenylsilylchloride and carbon dioxide. In all cases, anionic dimers are formed. The cyanoketene could be synthesized and crystallographically characterized when stabilized by a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. The cyanoketenate is a very useful unsaturated building block containing N, C and O atoms that can now be explored with relative ease and will undoubtedly unlock more interesting reactivity.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of Protonated Sulfur Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemi&#8208; and monoprotonated SO2 cations have been isolated as Sb2F11&#8722; salts. The preparation of the salts was achieved by recrystallization of [FS(OH)2][SbF6] in weakly basic, aprotic solvents at low temperatures. The elusive structures of both cationic species have been investigated by X&#8208;ray structure analysis and Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
Salts of protonated sulfur dioxide were synthesized by recrystallization of [FS(OX)2][SbF6] (X=H, D) in aprotic solvents at low temperatures. Hemiprotonated sulfur dioxide [(SO2)2H][Sb2F11] was obtained from the solvent SO2 and the monoprotonated sulfur dioxide [OSOD][Sb2F11], using 1,1,1,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethane as solvent. For both compounds, single crystals were obtained and an X&#8208;ray structure analysis was conducted. Furthermore, the salts were characterized by Raman spectroscopy and the results were discussed together with quantum chemical calculations on the M06&#8208;2X/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory.

         <title>Modification of Polysulfide Surfaces with Low&#8208;Power Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light touch: A photosensitive copolymer made from elemental sulfur and low&#8208;cost dienes such as cyclopentadiene could be rapidly modified with low&#8208;power lasers operating in the visible and infrared wavelengths. Erasable information coding and direct laser lithography were demonstrated.







Abstract
The modification of polymer surfaces using laser light is important for many applications in the nano&#8208;, bio&#8208; and chemical sciences. Such capabilities have supported advances in biomedical devices, electronics, information storage, microfluidics, and other applications. In most cases, these modifications require high power lasers that are expensive and require specialized equipment and facilities to minimize risk of hazardous radiation. Additionally, polymer systems that can be easily modified by lasers are often complex and costly to prepare. In this report, these challenges are addressed with the discovery of low&#8208;cost sulfur copolymers that can be rapidly modified with lasers emitting low&#8208;power infrared and visible light. The featured copolymers are made from elemental sulfur and either cyclopentadiene or dicyclopentadiene. Using a suite of lasers with discreet wavelengths (532, 638 and 786&#8197;nm) and powers, a variety of surface modifications could be made on the polymers such as controlled swelling or etching via ablation. The facile synthesis and laser modification of these polymer systems were exploited in applications such as direct laser lithography and erasable information storage.

         <title>Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen through Mn Doping in NiCo2O4&#8208;&#948; Spinel Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Durable Acid Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiMn1.5Co3O4&#8208;&#948; electrocatalyst with stable lattice oxygen was designed and fabricated by co&#8208;electrochemical deposition method. The results demonstrate lattice Mn species can enhance the formation energy of oxygen vacancy leading to a significant increase in lattice oxygen stability. The Mn&#8722;O structure adjacent Co octahedral sites show synergetic adsorbate evolution mechanism (SAEM) and promote the formation of *OO from *OOH.







Abstract
Design the electrocatalysts without noble metal is still a challenge for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid media. Herein, we reported the manganese (Mn) doping method to decrease the concentration of oxygen vacancy (VO) and form the Mn&#8722;O structure adjacent octahedral sites in spinel NiCo2O4&#8208;&#948; (NiMn1.5Co3O4&#8208;&#948;), which highly enhanced the activity and stability of spinel NiCo2O4&#8208;&#948; with a low overpotential (&#951;) of 280&#8197;mV at j=10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability of 80&#8197;h in acid media. The isotopic labelling experiment based on differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) clearly demonstrated the lattice oxygen in NiMn1.5Co3O4&#8208;&#948; is more stable due to strong Mn&#8722;O bond and shows synergetic adsorbate evolution mechanism (SAEM) for acid OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal highly increased oxygen vacancy formation energy (EVO) of NiCo2O4&#8208;&#948; after Mn doping. More importantly, the highly hydrogen bonding between Mn&#8722;O and *OOH adsorbed on adjacent Co octahedral sites promote the formation of *OO from *OOH due to the greatly enhanced charge density of O in Mn substituted sites.

         <title>Cover Picture: Modular Weaving DNAzyme in Skeleton of DNA Nanocages for Photoactivatable Catalytic Activity Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal control of catalytic DNAzyme activity has been achieved in the Research Article (e202404064) by Lele Li, Mengyuan Li et&#8197;al. Molecular weaving activatable DNAzyme into the skeleton of tetrahedral DNA nanocages not only enables efficient intracellular delivery with improved biostability, but also allows for light&#8208;triggered on&#8208;demand liberation of DNAzyme and thus conditional control of catalytic gene regulation function.

         <dc:description>
Silole (C4Si ring) and disila&#8208;cyclooctene (C6Si2 ring) derivatives were synthesized through reactions between silicon atoms and dibrominated molecules at the bay and peri positions on Au(111), as reported by Kewei Sun, Adam&#8197;S. Foster, Shigeki Kawai et&#8197;al. (e202401027). This study demonstrates the robustness of a synthetic approach in obtaining various low&#8208;dimensional Si&#8208;incorporated nanostructures by direct on&#8208;surface coupling.

         <title>Taylor&#8208;dispersion induced phase separation for efficient characterisation of protein condensate formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomolecular condensates have emerged as important structures in cellular function and disease, and are thought to form through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Thorough and efficient in vitro experiments are therefore needed to elucidate the driving forces of protein LLPS and the possibility to modulate it with drugs. Here we present Taylor dispersion induced phase separation (TDIPS), a method to robustly measure condensation phenomena using a commercially available microfluidic platform. It uses only nano&#8208;liters of sample, does not require extrinsic fluorescent labels, and is straightforward to implement. We demonstrate TDIPS by screening the phase behaviour of two proteins that form biomolecular condensates in vivo, PGL&#8208;3 and Ddx4. Uniquely accessible to this method, we find an unexpected re&#8208;entrant behaviour at very low ionic strength, where LLPS is inhibited for both proteins. TDIPS can also probe the reversibility of assemblies, which was shown for both &#945;&#8208;synuclein and for lysozyme, relevant for health and biotechnology, respectively. Finally, we highlight how effective inhibition concentrations and partitioning of LLPS&#8208;modifying compounds can be screened highly efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded G&#8226;C&#8226;G&#8226;C Quadruplex within a Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Based Octacationic Spirobicycle in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In biological systems, nucleotide quadruplexes (such as G&#8208;quadruplexes) in DNA and RNA that are held together by multiple hydrogen bonds play a crucial functional role. The biomimetic formation of these hydrogen&#8208;bonded quadruplexes captured by artificial systems in water poses a significant challenge but can offer valuable insights into these complex functional structures. Herein, we report the formation of biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded G&#8226;C&#8226;G&#8226;C quadruplex captured by a tetraphenylethene (TPE) based octacationic spirobicycle (1). The spirobicyclic compound possesses a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crossing dual&#8208;cavity structure, which enables the encapsulation of four d(GpC) dinucleotide molecules, thereby realizing 1:4 host&#8208;guest complexation in water. The X&#8208;ray structure reveals that four d(GpC) molecules further form a two&#8208;layer G&#8226;C&#8226;G&#8226;C quadruplex with Watson&#8208;Crick hydrogen bonds, which are stabilized within the dual hydrophobic cavities of 1 through the cooperative non&#8208;covalent interactions of hydrogen bonds, CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, and hydrophobic effect. Due to the dynamically&#8208;rotational propeller chirality of TPE units, 1 with adaptive chirality can further serve as a chiroptical sensor to exhibit opposite Cotton effects with mirror&#8208;image CD spectra for the pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies of d(GpC) including the Watson&#8208;Crick G&#8226;C&#8226;G&#8226;C (pH 9.22) and Hoogsteen G&#8226;C+&#8226;G&#8226;C+ (pH 5.74) quartets through the host&#8208;guest chirality transfer in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Z&#8208;Enynes via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes constitute an enabling motif in organic synthesis, as they can be functionalized to form highly substituted molecules. Z&#8208;alkenes are generally challenging to access due to the thermodynamic preference for the formation of E&#8208;alkenes compared to Z&#8208;alkenes. Dehydrogenation methodologies to selectively form Z&#8208;alkenes have not yet been reported. Herein, we report a Z&#8208;selective, propargylic dehydrogenation that provides 1,3&#8208;enynes through the invention of a Co&#8208;catalyzed oxidation system. Observation of a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) revealed that deprotonation of the propargylic position is the rate limiting step. Additionally, isomerization experiments were conducted and confirmed that the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect. A proposed stereomechanistic model for the Z&#8208;selectivity is included.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroatom substitution strategy modulates thermodynamics towards chemically recyclable polyesters and monomeric unit sequence by temperature switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, we proposed a heteroatom substitution strategy (HSS) in the &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) system to modulate thermodynamics toward chemically recyclable polyesters. In this system, three VL&#8208;based monomers containing different heteroatoms (M1 (N), M2 (S), and M3 (O)), instead of C&#8208;5 carbon, were designed and synthesized to verify our proposed HSS. All three monomers undergo organocatalytic living/controlled ROP and controllable depolymerization. Impressively, the resulting P(M1) achieved over 99% monomer recovery under both mild solution depolymerization and high vacuum pyrolysis conditions without any side reactions, and the recycled monomers can be polymerized again forming new polymers. The systematic study of the relationship between heteroatom substitution and recyclability shows that introducing heteroatoms does change the thermodynamics of the monomers (&#916;Hpo, &#916;Spo and Tc values), thereby adjusting the polymerizability and depolymerizability. DFT calculations found that the introduction of heteroatoms adjusts the ring strain by changing the angular strain of the monomers, and the order of their angular strain (M2&gt;M1&gt;M3) is consistent with the order of the experimentally obtained enthalpy change. Notably, the one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step copolymerization of two of each of the three monomers enables the synthesis of sequence&#8208;controlled copolymers from gradient to random to block structures, by simply switching the copolymerization temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Small molecule&#8208;inducible and photoactivatable cellular RNA N1&#8208;methyladenosine editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) modification is one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications on RNA. Given the vital role of m1A modification in RNA processing such as splicing, stability and translation, developing a precise and controllable m1A editing tool is pivotal for in&#8208;depth investigating the biological functions of m1A. In this study, we developed an abscisic acid (ABA)&#8208;inducible and reversible m1A demethylation tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A), which targets specific transcripts by combining the chemical proximity&#8208;induction techniques with the CRISPR/dCas13b system and ALKBH3. We successfully employed AI&#8208;dm1A to selectively demethylate the m1A modifications at MALAT1 A8422, and this demethylation process could be reversed by removing ABA. Furthermore, we validated its demethylating function on various types of cellular RNAs including mRNA, rRNA and lncRNA. Additionally, we used AI&#8208;dm1A to specifically demethylate m1A on ATP5D mRNA, which promoted ATP5D expression and enhanced the glycolysis activity of tumor cells. Conversely, by replacing the demethylase ALKBH3 with methyltransferase TRMT61A, we also developed a controllable m1A methylation tool, namely AI&#8208;m1A. Finally, we caged ABA by 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) to achieve light&#8208;inducible m1A methylation or demethylation on specific transcripts. Collectively, our m1A editing tool enables us to flexibly study how m1A modifications on specific transcript influence biological functions and phenotypes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Inorganic Dimensionality of Ultrastable Lead Halide Coordination Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a coordination chemistry strategy to modulate the 2D to 3D transformation of lead iodide sublattices in robust coordination polymers. The synthetic strategy enhances the charge&#8208;transport properties for efficient carrier accumulation and introduces asymmetric charge distribution for C&#8722;C coupling, leading to efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction to C2 products.







Abstract
Lead halide hybrids have shown great potentials in CO2 photoreduction, but challenging to afford C2+ reduced products, especially using H2O as the reductant. This is largely due to the trade&#8208;off problem between instability of the benchmark 3D structures and low carrier mobility of quasi&#8208;2D analogues. Herein, the lead halide dimensionality of robust coordination polymers (CP) was modulated by organic ligands differing in a single&#8208;atom change (NH vs. CH2), in which the NH groups coordinate with interlamellar [PbI2] clusters to achieve the important 2D&#8594;3D transition. This first CP based on 3D cationic lead iodide sublattice possesses both high aqueous stability and a low exciton binding energy of 25&#8197;meV that is on the level of ambient thermal energy, achieving artificial photosynthesis of C2H5OH. Photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations suggest the bridging [PbI2] clusters in the 3D structure not only results in enhanced carrier transport, but also promotes the intrinsic charge polarization to facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling. With trace loading of Rh cocatalyst, the apparent quantum efficiency of the 3D CP reaches 1.4&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm with a high C2H5OH selectivity of 89.4&#8201;% (product basis), which presents one of the best photocatalysts for C2 products to date.

In this work, we described a multi&#8208;functional photoenzymatic nanoreactor CALB@COF&#8208;Ir, which was developed through the encapsulation of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) in a photosensitive covalent organic framework material COF&#8208;Ir. The bio&#8208;nanoreactor could serve as efficient catalyst in dynamic kinetic resolution of secondary amines to give a series of chiral amines in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The heterogeneous photoenzymatic nanoreactor showed high stability and reusability.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;catalysis represents a highly efficient and stereoselective method for the synthesis of valuable chiral compounds, however, the poor stability and limited reaction types of free enzymes restrict their wide application in industrial production. In this work, to overcome these problems, a multifunctional photoenzymatic nanoreactor CALB@COF&#8208;Ir was developed through the encapsulation of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) in a photosensitive covalent organic framework COF&#8208;Ir. This bio&#8208;nanocluster serves as efficient catalysts in asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of secondary amines to give a series of chiral amines in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The well&#8208;designed COF&#8208;Ir not only acts as safety cover to prevent CALB from deactivation but promotes racemization of secondary amines via photo&#8208;induced hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process. Photoelectric characterization and TDDFT calculation revealed that (ppy)2Ir units in COF&#8208;Ir play crucial role in this photocatalytic system which enhance its photo&#8208;redox properties through facilitating the separation between photoelectrons (e&#8722;) and holes (h+). Furthermore, the heterogeneous photoenzymatic nanoreactor could be recycled for five rounds with slight decline of catalytic reactivity.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Utilization of Latent Heat in Erythritol&#8208;based Phase Change Materials as Solar Thermal Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an erythritol&#8208;based phase change material as a new type of solar thermal fuels. The material can harvest, convert, and store solar energy as latent heat, which can be released as thermal energy on demand. The composite material is cost&#8208;effective, easy to synthesize, and has a superior solar thermal energy utilization performance. This new concept could promote related solar energy utilization techniques.







Abstract
Solar thermal fuels (STFs) have been particularly concerned as sustainable future energy due to their impressive ability to store solar energy in chemical bonds and controllably release thermal energy. However, currently studied STFs mainly focus on molecule&#8208;based materials with high photochemical activity, toxicity, and compromised features, which greatly restricts their applications in practical scenarios of solar energy utilization. Herein, we present a novel erythritol&#8208;based composite phase change material (PCM) as a new type of STFs with an outstanding capability to store solar energy as latent heat in its stable supercooling state and release thermal energy as needed. This composite PCM with stored thermal energy can be maintained stably at room temperature and subsequently release latent heat as high as 224.9&#8197;J/g during the crystallization process triggered by thermal stimuli. Remarkably, solar energy can be converted into latent heat stored in the composite PCM over months. Through mechanical stimulations, the released latent heat can increase the temperature of the composite up to 91&#8201;&#176;C. This work presents a new concept of using spatiotemporal storage and release of latent heat in PCMs for solar energy utilization, making it a potential candidate as STFs for developing future clean energy techniques.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Linker Strategy for Selective Activation of Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a strategy to overcome the off&#8208;target toxicity of antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) based on a hypoxia&#8208;activated, azobenzene&#8208;based linker for the tumour&#8208;specific release of cytotoxic payload monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The novel ADC exhibits potent antitumor efficacy and dramatically increases the therapeutic window compared with a traditional ADC, providing a dual&#8208;targeting antibody/linker double prodrug (pro&#8208;prodrug).







Abstract
Existing antibody&#8211;drug conjugate (ADC) linkers, whether cleavable or non&#8208;cleavable, are designed to release highly toxic payloads or payload derivatives upon internalisation of the ADCs into cells. However, clinical studies have shown that only &lt;1&#8201;% of the dosed ADCs accumulate in tumour cells. The remaining &gt;99&#8201;% of ADCs are nonspecifically distributed in healthy tissue cells, thus inevitably leading to off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, we describe an intelligent tumour&#8208;specific linker strategy to address these limitations. A tumour&#8208;specific linker is constructed by introducing a hypoxia&#8208;activated azobenzene group as a toxicity controller. We show that this azobenzene&#8208;based linker is non&#8208;cleavable in healthy tissues (O2 &gt;10&#8201;%), and the corresponding payload derivative, cysteine&#8208;appended azobenzene&#8208;linker&#8211;monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), can serve as a safe prodrug to mask the toxicity of MMAE (switched off). Upon exposure to the hypoxic tumour microenvironment (O2&lt;1&#8201;%), this linker is cleaved to release MMAE and fully restores the high cytotoxicity of the ADC (switched on). Notably, the azobenzene linker&#8208;containing ADC exhibits satisfactory antitumour efficacy in vivo and a larger therapeutic window compared with ADCs containing traditional cleavable or non&#8208;cleavable linkers. Thus, our azobenzene&#8208;based linker sheds new light on the development of next&#8208;generation ADC linkers.

         <title>A Hybrid Redox&#8208;Mediated Zinc&#8208;Air Fuel Cell for Scalable and Sustained Power Generation</title>

         <dc:description>
A hybrid redox&#8208;mediated zinc&#8208;air fuel cell that liberates the zinc reaction from the electrode to a separate fuel tank was demonstrated, which enabled a facile zinc refueling in the tank and attained a record&#8208;high power density of 0.51&#8197;W/cm2 and discharge capacity of 48.82&#8197;Ah by optimizing system kinetics. The zinc evolution mechanism during redox&#8208;mediated reaction was unveiled for the first time using various in situ characterization techniques.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have attracted considerable attention for their high energy density, safety, low noise, and eco&#8208;friendliness. However, the capacity of mechanically rechargeable ZABs was limited by the cumbersome procedure for replacing the zinc anode, while electrically rechargeable ZABs suffer from issues including low depth of discharge, zinc dendrite and dead zinc formation, and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, etc. To address these issues, we report a hybrid redox&#8208;mediated zinc&#8208;air fuel cell (HRM&#8208;ZAFC) utilizing 7,8&#8208;dihydroxyphenazine&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (DHPS) as the anolyte redox mediator, which shifts the zinc oxidation reaction from the electrode surface to a separate fuel tank. This approach decouples fuel feeding and electricity generation, providing greater operation flexibility and scalability for large&#8208;scale power generation applications. The DHPS&#8208;mediated ZAFC exhibited a superior peak power density of 0.51&#8197;W/cm2 and a continuous discharge capacity of 48.82&#8197;Ah with ZnO as the discharge product in the tank, highlighting its potential for power generation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Oxo Electronic Tuning via In Situ CO Decoration for Promoting Methane Conversion to Oxygenates over Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ CO decoration can significantly tune the electronic state of metal&#8208;oxo center in single&#8208;atom catalysts for promoting oxygenates production. CO activated Pd1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 displays the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&#8722;1 and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H2O2 as oxidant at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Direct methane conversion (DMC) to oxygenates at low temperature is of great value but remains challenging due to the high energy barrier for C&#8722;H bond activation. Here, we report that in situ decoration of Pd1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 single atom catalyst (SAC) by CO molecules significantly promoted the DMC reaction, giving the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&#8722;1 ever reported at room temperature and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H2O2 as oxidant. Combined characterizations and DFT calculations illustrate that the C&#8208;atom of CO prefers to coordinate with Pd1, which donates electrons to the Pd1&#8722;O active center (L&#8722;Pd1&#8722;O, L=CO) generated by H2O2 oxidation. The correspondingly improved electron density over Pd&#8722;O pair renders a favorable heterolytic dissociation of C&#8722;H bond with low energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV. Applying CO decoration strategy to M1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 (M=Pd, Rh, Ru, Fe) enables improvement of oxygenates productivity by 3.2&#8211;11.3&#8197;times, highlighting the generalizability of this method in tuning metal&#8208;oxo electronic structure of SACs for efficient DMC process.

&lt;p&gt;In situ CO decoration can significantly tune the electronic state of metal-oxo center in single-atom catalysts for promoting oxygenates production. CO activated Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-ZSM-5 displays the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as oxidant at 25&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct methane conversion (DMC) to oxygenates at low temperature is of great value but remains challenging due to the high energy barrier for C&#8722;H bond activation. Here, we report that in situ decoration of Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-ZSM-5 single atom catalyst (SAC) by CO molecules significantly promoted the DMC reaction, giving the highest turnover frequency of 207&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; ever reported at room temperature and ~100&#8201;% oxygenates selectivity with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as oxidant. Combined characterizations and DFT calculations illustrate that the C-atom of CO prefers to coordinate with Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which donates electrons to the Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O active center (L&#8722;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O, L=CO) generated by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation. The correspondingly improved electron density over Pd&#8722;O pair renders a favorable heterolytic dissociation of C&#8722;H bond with low energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV. Applying CO decoration strategy to M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-ZSM-5 (M=Pd, Rh, Ru, Fe) enables improvement of oxygenates productivity by 3.2&#8211;11.3&#8197;times, highlighting the generalizability of this method in tuning metal-oxo electronic structure of SACs for efficient DMC process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>COF&#8208;Topological Quantum Material Nano&#8208;heterostructure for CO2 to Syngas Production under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>

COF&#8208;topological quantum material (COF@TI) nano&#8208;heterostructure serves as an efficient catalyst for solar enegy driven syngas production with controllable ratios (CO: H2) from CO2 and H2O.







Abstract
Efficient solar&#8208;driven syngas production (CO+H2 mixture) from CO2 and H2O with a suitable photocatalyst and fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism are the desired approach towards the carbon recycling process. Herein, we report the design and development of an unique COF&#8208;topological quantum material nano&#8208;heterostructure, COF@TI with a newly synthesized donor&#8208;acceptor based COF and two dimensional (2D) nanosheets of strong topological insulator (TI), PbBi2Te4. The intrinsic robust metallic surfaces of the TI act as electron reservoir, minimising the fast electron&#8208;hole recombination process, and the presence of 6s2 lone pairs in Pb2+ and Bi3+ in the TI helps for efficient CO2 binding, which are responsible for boosting overall catalytic activity. In variable ratio of acetonitrile&#8208;water (MeCN&#8201;:&#8201;H2O) solvent mixture COF@TI produces syngas with different ratios of CO and H2. COF@TI nano&#8208;heterostructure enables to produce higher amount of syngas with more controllable ratios of CO and H2 compared to pristine COF. The electron transfer route from COF to TI was realized from Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analysis, charge density difference calculation, excited state lifetime and photoelectrochemical measurements. Finally, a probable mechanistic pathway has been established after identifying the catalytic sites and reaction intermediates by in situ DRIFTS study and DFT calculation.

         <title>An N&#8208;Heterocyclic Quinodimethane: A Strong Organic Lewis Base Exhibiting Diradical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of an N&#8208;heterocyclic quinodimethane (NHQ) is reported. In its closed&#8208;shell ground state, the NHQ is a strong organic base whose proton affinity exceeds that of analogous N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. Moreover, the NHQ exhibits radical reactivity and undergoes dehydrogenative head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization via an open&#8208;shell singlet pathway.







Abstract
We report the preparation of a new organic &#963;&#8208;donor with a C6H4&#8208;linker between an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and an exocyclic methylidene group, which we term N&#8208;heterocyclic quinodimethane (NHQ). The aromatization of the C6H4&#8208;linker provides a decisive driving force for the reaction of the NHQ with an electrophile and renders the NHQ significantly more basic than analogous NHCs or N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs), as shown by DFT computations and competition experiments. In solution, the NHQ undergoes an unprecedented dehydrogenative head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization by C&#8722;C coupling of the methylidene groups. DFT computations indicate that this reaction proceeds via an open&#8208;shell singlet pathway revealing the diradical character of the NHQ. The product of this dimerization can be described as conjugated N&#8208;heterocyclic bis&#8208;quinodimethane, which according to cyclic voltammetry is a strong organic reducing agent (E1/2=&#8722;1.71&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+) and exhibits a remarkable small singlet&#8211;triplet gap of &#916;ES&#8594;T=4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of Nucleic Acids in a Diffusiophoretic Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steep salt gradient generated by an electrolyte&#8208;filled micropipette can be utilized for diffusiophoretic trapping of charged colloids and molecules. The trap can localize, concentrate and promote hybridization between complementary DNA strands, and facilitate the self&#8208;assembly of DNA nanostructures into DNA gels. Assembly of the gel only occurs under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions, when the salt gradient is present.







Abstract
The formation and dissociation of duplexes or higher order structures from nucleic acid strands is a fundamental process with widespread applications in biochemistry and nanotechnology. Here, we introduce a simple experimental system&#8212;a diffusiophoretic trap&#8212;for the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly of nucleic acid structures that uses an electrolyte gradient as the driving force. DNA strands can be concentrated up to hundredfold by a diffusiophoretic trapping force that is caused by the electric field generated by the electrolyte gradient. We present a simple equation for the field to guide selection of appropriate trapping electrolytes. Experiments with carboxylated silica particles demonstrate that the diffusiophoretic force is long&#8208;ranged, extending over hundreds of micrometers. As an application, we explore the reversible self&#8208;assembly of branched DNA nanostructures in the trap into a macroscopic gel. The structures assemble in the presence of an electrolyte gradient, and disassemble upon its removal, representing a prototypical adaptive response to a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium state.

         <title>CO&#8208;Induced Dimer Decay Responsible for Gem&#8208;Dicarbonyl Formation on a Model Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;lapse scanning tunneling microscopy movies are combined with theoretical computations to study CO adsorption on a model Rh1/Fe3O4(001) catalyst under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Direct CO adsorption at Rh1 sites results in monocarbonyl species. Rh1&#8722;(CO)2 gem dicarbonyl species are observed, but from only via the CO&#8208;induced break&#8208;up of Rh2 dimer species.







Abstract
The ability to coordinate multiple reactants at the same active site is important for the wide&#8208;spread applicability of single&#8208;atom catalysis. Model catalysts are ideal to investigate the link between active site geometry and reactant binding, because the structure of single&#8208;crystal surfaces can be precisely determined, the adsorbates imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and direct comparisons made to density functional theory. In this study, we follow the evolution of Rh1 adatoms and minority Rh2 dimers on Fe3O4(001) during exposure to CO using time&#8208;lapse STM at room temperature. CO adsorption at Rh1 sites results exclusively in stable Rh1CO monocarbonyls, because the Rh atom adapts its coordination to create a stable pseudo&#8208;square planar environment. Rh1(CO)2 gem&#8208;dicarbonyl species are also observed, but these form exclusively through the breakup of Rh2 dimers via an unstable Rh2(CO)3 intermediate. Overall, our results illustrate how minority species invisible to area&#8208;averaging spectra can play an important role in catalytic systems, and show that the decomposition of dimers or small clusters can be an avenue to produce reactive, metastable configurations in single&#8208;atom catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Time-lapse scanning tunneling microscopy movies are combined with theoretical computations to study CO adsorption on a model Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(001) catalyst under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Direct CO adsorption at Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sites results in monocarbonyl species. Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gem dicarbonyl species are observed, but from only via the CO-induced break-up of Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dimer species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to coordinate multiple reactants at the same active site is important for the wide-spread applicability of single-atom catalysis. Model catalysts are ideal to investigate the link between active site geometry and reactant binding, because the structure of single-crystal surfaces can be precisely determined, the adsorbates imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and direct comparisons made to density functional theory. In this study, we follow the evolution of Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adatoms and minority Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dimers on Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(001) during exposure to CO using time-lapse STM at room temperature. CO adsorption at Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sites results exclusively in stable Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;CO monocarbonyls, because the Rh atom adapts its coordination to create a stable pseudo-square planar environment. Rh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gem-dicarbonyl species are also observed, but these form exclusively through the breakup of Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dimers via an unstable Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate.

         <title>Phase Identification and Discovery of an Elusive Polymorph of Drug&#8208;Polymer Inclusion Complex Using Automated 3D Electron Diffraction</title>

An automated low&#8208;dose 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) protocol was developed to identify and determine the structures of six phases of griseofulvin in a multiphasic melt&#8208;crystallisation product. 3D ED data were collected from over 230 individual nano&#8208;sized crystals and processed without supervision, enabling the discovery of a new griseofulvin polyethylene glycol inclusion complex. This study highlights 3D ED&#8242;s potential in drug development.







Abstract
3D electron diffraction (3D ED) has shown great potential in crystal structure determination in materials, small organic molecules, and macromolecules. In this work, an automated, low&#8208;dose and low&#8208;bias 3D ED protocol has been implemented to identify six phases from a multiple&#8208;phase melt&#8208;crystallisation product of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, griseofulvin (GSF). Batch data collection under low&#8208;dose conditions using a widely available commercial software was combined with automated data analysis to collect and process over 230 datasets in three days. Accurate unit cell parameters obtained from 3D ED data allowed direct phase identification of GSF Forms III, I and the known GSF inclusion complex (IC) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (GSF&#8208;PEG IC&#8208;I), as well as three minor phases, namely GSF Forms II, V and an elusive new phase, GSF&#8208;PEG IC&#8208;II. Their structures were then directly determined by 3D ED. Furthermore, we reveal how the stabilities of the two GSF&#8208;PEG IC polymorphs are closely related to their crystal structures. These results demonstrate the power of automated 3D ED for accurate phase identification and direct structure determination of complex, beam&#8208;sensitive crystallisation products, which is significant for drug development where solid form screening is crucial for the overall efficacy of the drug product.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Based Probes for Imaging Detection of Enzyme Activities by NIR Luminescence, T1&#8208; and ParaCEST MRI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that using a single ligand complexed to different lanthanide ions, successful visualization of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity is possible in complementary optical and MR modalities : NIR luminescence (Yb3+), CEST (Yb3+) and T1 (Gd3+) MR imaging.







Abstract
Applying a single molecular probe to monitor enzymatic activities in multiple, complementary imaging modalities is highly desirable to ascertain detection and to avoid the complexity associated with the use of agents of different chemical entities. We demonstrate here the versatility of lanthanide (Ln3+) complexes with respect to their optical and magnetic properties and their potential for enzymatic detection in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1 MR imaging, controlled by the nature of the Ln3+ ion, while using a unique chelator. Based on X&#8208;ray structural, photophysical, and solution NMR investigations of a family of Ln3+ DO3A&#8208;pyridine model complexes, we could rationalize the luminescence (Eu3+, Yb3+), CEST (Yb3+) and relaxation (Gd3+) properties and their variations between carbamate and amine derivatives. This allowed the design of 
 probes which undergo enzyme&#8208;mediated changes detectable in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1&#8208;weighted MRI, respectively governed by variations in their absorption energy, in their exchanging proton pool and in their size, thus relaxation efficacy. We demonstrate that these properties can be exploited for the visualization of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity in phantom samples by different imaging modalities: NIR optical imaging, CEST and T1&#8208;weighted MRI.

         <title>Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Synthesis of Propargyl&#8208; and Allenylsilanes through Catalytic Propargylic C&#8722;H Deprotonation</title>

We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular propargylic C&#8722;H silylation mediated by an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir complex. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric, synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity.







Abstract
We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H bond silylation catalyzed by a phosphoramidite&#8208;ligated iridium catalyst. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric and synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity. In the case of unsymmetrical dialkyl acetylenes, good to excellent selectivity for functionalization at the less&#8208;hindered site was also observed. A variety of electrophilic silyl sources (R3SiOTf and R3SiNTf2), either commercial or in situ&#8208;generated, were used as the silylation reagents, and a broad range of simple and functionalized alkynes, including aryl alkyl acetylenes, dialkyl acetylenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and drug derivatives were successfully employed as substrates. Detailed mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest that an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir intermediate is generated upon &#960;&#8208;complexation&#8208;assisted deprotonation and undergoes outer&#8208;sphere attack by the electrophilic silylating reagent to give propargylic silanes, with the latter step identified as the enantiodetermining step.

         <title>A Dual Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Sensor Array Formed by Poly(para&#8208;aryleneethynylene) and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Fluorophores for Sensitive Multiplexed Bacterial Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor array, assembled from poly(para&#8208;aryleneethynylene) (PPE) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) complexes through electrostatic interactions, facilitates the detection of bacteria at low concentrations. This versatile approach significantly enhances the sensitivity of sensing systems, thereby advancing clinical diagnostics.







Abstract
Bacterial infections have emerged as the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;channel fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor array, comprising six electrostatic complexes formed from one negatively charged poly(para&#8208;aryleneethynylene) (PPE) and six positively charged aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores. The 6&#8208;element array enabled the simultaneous identification of 20&#8197;bacteria (OD600=0.005) within 30s (99.0&#8201;% accuracy), demonstrating significant advantages over the array constituted by the 7 separate elements that constitute the complexes. Meanwhile, the array realized different mixing ratios and quantitative detection of prevalent bacteria associated with urinary tract infection (UTI). It also excelled in distinguishing six simulated bacteria samples in artificial urine. Remarkably, the limit of detection for E. coli and E. faecalis was notably low, at 0.000295 and 0.000329 (OD600), respectively.

&lt;p&gt;A dual fluorescence &#8220;turn-on&#8221; sensor array, assembled from poly(&lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-aryleneethynylene) (PPE) and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) complexes through electrostatic interactions, facilitates the detection of bacteria at low concentrations. This versatile approach significantly enhances the sensitivity of sensing systems, thereby advancing clinical diagnostics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial infections have emerged as the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Herein, we developed a dual-channel fluorescence &#8220;turn-on&#8221; sensor array, comprising six electrostatic complexes formed from one negatively charged poly(&lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-aryleneethynylene) (PPE) and six positively charged aggregation-induced emission (AIE) fluorophores. The 6-element array enabled the simultaneous identification of 20&#8197;bacteria (OD&lt;sub&gt;600&lt;/sub&gt;=0.005) within 30s (99.0&#8201;% accuracy), demonstrating significant advantages over the array constituted by the 7 separate elements that constitute the complexes. Meanwhile, the array realized different mixing ratios and quantitative detection of prevalent bacteria associated with urinary tract infection (UTI). It also excelled in distinguishing six simulated bacteria samples in artificial urine. Remarkably, the limit of detection for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; was notably low, at 0.000295 and 0.000329 (OD&lt;sub&gt;600&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively. Finally, optimized by diverse machine learning algorithms, the designed array achieved 96.7&#8201;% accuracy in differentiating UTI clinical samples from healthy individuals using a random forest model, demonstrating the great potential for medical diagnostic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Exploring melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids from Armillaria ostoyae in liquid and solid fermentations yielded 17 new and 21 known derivatives. A compound library enabled metabolomics, unveiling production patterns under varied culture conditions. Assessment of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, aided by innovative chemoinformatics, offered insight into structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
In this investigation, we explored the diversity of melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids produced by Armillaria ostoyae, one of the largest and oldest organisms on Earth, using extracts from liquid and solid fermentation media. The study unveiled three unprecedented dimeric bismelleolides and three novel fatty&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted congeners, along with 11 new and 21 known derivatives. The structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and HRESI&#8208;MS, and ROESY spectral analysis for relative configurations. Absolute configurations were determined from crystal structures and through ECD spectra comparison. A compound library of melleolide&#8208;type meroterpenoids facilitated metabolomics&#8208;wide associations, revealing production patterns under different culture conditions. The library enabled assessments of antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, revealing that the &#916;2,4 double bond is not crucial for antifungal activity. Cytotoxicity was linked to the presence of an aldehyde at C1, but lost with hydroxylation at C13. Chemoinformatic analyses demonstrated the intricate interplay of chemical modifications on biological properties. This study marks the first systematic exploration of Armillaria spp. meroterpenoid diversity by MS&#8208;based untargeted metabolomics, offering insight into structure&#8211;activity relationships through innovative chemoinformatics.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstruction of Two&#8208;Dimensional Defective Bi Nanosheets for Efficient Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanosheets were reconstructed in situ to defective Bi nanosheets, forming rich grain boundaries that were conducive to the C&#8722;N coupling reaction for CO2 and NO3&#8722; reduction to produce urea.







Abstract
Abstract:Catalyst surface dynamics drive the generation of active species for electrocatalytic reactions. Yet, the understanding of dominant site formation and reaction mechanisms is limited. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the dynamic reconstruction of two&#8208;dimensional defective Bi nanosheets from exfoliated Bi2Se3 nanosheets under electrochemical CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction conditions. The ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanosheets obtained by NaBH4&#8208;assisted cryo&#8208;mediated liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation are more easily reduced and reconstructed to Bi nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries (GBs; GB&#8208;rich Bi). The reconstructed GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst affords a remarkable yield rate of 4.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency of 32&#8201;% for urea production at &#8722;0.40&#8197;V vs. RHE. Notably, this yield rate is 2 and 8.2&#8197;times higher than those of the low&#8208;GB Bi and bulk Bi catalysts, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the GB sites significantly reduce the *CO and *NH2 intermediate formation energy and C&#8722;N coupling energy barrier, enabling selective urea electrosynthesis on the GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst. This work will trigger further research into the structure&#8208;activity interplay in dynamic processes using in situ techniques.

         <title>Enhancing Flavins Photochemical Activity in Hydrogen Atom Abstraction and Triplet Sensitization through Ring&#8208;Contraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of ester&#8208;modified flavins with hydroxide base leads to ring&#8208;contracted imidazolonequinoxalines with increased triplet energy (ET) and H&#8208;atom abstraction (HAT) strength in the photochemically excited state. Ring&#8208;contracted flavins are efficient catalysts in the trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic C&#8722;H positions and also in multi&#8208;step sequences, which require the combined activity as triplet sensitizer and hydrogen atom abstractor.







Abstract
The isoalloxazine heterocycle of flavin cofactors reacts with various nucleophiles to form covalent adducts with important functions in enzymes. Molecular flavin models allow for the characterization of such adducts and the study of their properties. A fascinating set of reactions occurs when flavins react with hydroxide base, which leads to imidazolonequinoxalines, ring&#8208;contracted flavins, with so far unexplored activity. We report a systematic study of the photophysical properties of this new chromophore by absorption and emission spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Excited, ring&#8208;contracted flavins are significantly stronger hydrogen atom abstractors when compared to the parent flavins, which allowed the direct trifluoromethylthiolation of aliphatic methine positions (bond dissociation energy (BDE) of 400.8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). In an orthogonal activity, their increased triplet energy (E(S0&#8592;T1)=244&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) made sensitized reactions possible which exceeded the power of standard flavins. Combining both properties, ring&#8208;contracted flavin catalysts enabled the one&#8208;pot, five&#8208;step transformation of &#945;&#8208;tropolone into trans&#8208;3,4&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentanones. We envision this new class of flavin&#8208;derived chromophores to open up new modes of reactivity that are currently impossible with unmodified flavins.

         <title>Confining Polymer Electrolyte in MOF for Safe and High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>

A polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF&#8208;8 particles through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, exhibiting unusual properties: enhanced sodium ion conductivity and transference number, wider electrochemical voltage windows, and dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal deposition, even at high working temperature.







Abstract
Nanoconfined polymer molecules exhibit profound transformations in their properties and behaviors. Here, we present the synthesis of a polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF&#8208;8 particles through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions for solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSMBs). The unique nanoconfinement effectively weakens Na ion coordination with the anions, facilitating the Na ion dissociation from salt. Simultaneously, the well&#8208;defined nanopores within ZIF&#8208;8 particles provide oriented and ordered migration channels for Na migration. As a result, this pioneering design allows the solid polymer electrolyte to achieve a Na ion transference number of 0.87, Na ion conductivity of 4.01&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and an extended electrochemical voltage window up to 4.89 V vs. Na/Na+. The assembled SSMBs (with Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode) exhibit dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal deposition, promising rate capability, and stable cycling performance with 96&#8201;% capacity retention over 300&#8197;cycles. This innovative polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF design offers a compelling strategy for advancing high&#8208;performance and safe solid&#8208;state metal battery technologies.

     alt="Confining Polymer Electrolyte in MOF for Safe and High-Performance All-Solid-State Sodium Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polymer-in-MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte for all-solid-state sodium metal batteries, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF-8 particles through Lewis acid-base interactions, exhibiting unusual properties: enhanced sodium ion conductivity and transference number, wider electrochemical voltage windows, and dendrite-free Na-metal deposition, even at high working temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoconfined polymer molecules exhibit profound transformations in their properties and behaviors. Here, we present the synthesis of a polymer-in-MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF-8 particles through Lewis acid-base interactions for solid-state sodium-metal batteries (SSMBs). The unique nanoconfinement effectively weakens Na ion coordination with the anions, facilitating the Na ion dissociation from salt. Simultaneously, the well-defined nanopores within ZIF-8 particles provide oriented and ordered migration channels for Na migration. As a result, this pioneering design allows the solid polymer electrolyte to achieve a Na ion transference number of 0.87, Na ion conductivity of 4.01&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an extended electrochemical voltage window up to 4.89 V vs. Na/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The assembled SSMBs (with Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the cathode) exhibit dendrite-free Na-metal deposition, promising rate capability, and stable cycling performance with 96&#8201;% capacity retention over 300&#8197;cycles. This innovative polymer-in-MOF design offers a compelling strategy for advancing high-performance and safe solid-state metal battery technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent Effects on Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of the interaction between H2O and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been first explored. The H2O molecular changes the electronic states of COFs and the possible catalytic center's locations. The COF based on the pyridine N linkers showed higher activity than those COFs based on other kinds of N atoms.







Abstract
Binding water molecules to polar sites in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is inevitable, but the corresponding solvent effects in electrocatalytic process have been largely overlooked. Herein, we investigate the solvent effects on COFs for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our designed COFs incorporated different kinds of nitrogen atoms (imine N, pyridine N, and phenazine N), enabling tunable interactions with water molecules. These interactions play a crucial role in modulating electronic states and altering the catalytic centers within the COFs. Among the synthesized COFs, the one with pyridine N atoms exhibits the highest activity, with characterized by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78&#8197;V and a mass activity of 0.32&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1, which surpass those from other metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the enhanced activity can be attributed to the stronger binding ability of *OOH intermediates to the carbon atoms adjacent to the pyridine N sites. This work sheds light on the significance of considering solvent effects on COFs in electrocatalytic systems, providing valuable insights into their design and optimization for improved performance.

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Using CO2&#8208;Binding Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel promiscuous activity of the phenolic acid decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis and other CO2&#8208;binding enzymes is described. The enzymes catalyze the photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the presence of a Ru(bpy)3 photosensitizer, exhibiting high selectivity for CO2 reduction over proton reduction (up to 93&#8201;%). Remarkably, BsPAD itself does not require an additional metal cofactor for this catalysis.







Abstract
Novel concepts to utilize carbon dioxide are required to reach a circular carbon economy and minimize environmental issues. To achieve these goals, photo&#8208;, electro&#8208;, thermal&#8208;, and biocatalysis are key tools to realize this, preferentially in aqueous solutions. Nevertheless, catalytic systems that operate efficiently in water are scarce. Here, we present a general strategy for the identification of enzymes suitable for CO2 reduction based on structural analysis for potential carbon dioxide binding sites and subsequent mutations. We discovered that the phenolic acid decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis (BsPAD) promotes the aqueous photocatalytic CO2 reduction selectively to carbon monoxide in the presence of a ruthenium photosensitizer and sodium ascorbate. With engineered variants of BsPAD, TONs of up to 978 and selectivities of up to 93&#8201;% (favoring the desired CO over H2 generation) were achieved. Mutating the active site region of BsPAD further improved turnover numbers for CO generation. This also revealed that electron transfer is rate&#8208;limiting and occurs via multistep tunneling. The generality of this approach was proven by using eight other enzymes, all showing the desired activity underlining that a range of proteins is capable of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Observation of Iron with Eight Coordination in Iron Trifluoride under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diminutive ionic radius of fluorine implies probable hypercoordination in Fe&#8722;F systems. Employing sophisticated crystal structure prediction and high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature experiments, a stable orthorhombic phase of FeF3 featuring rare 8&#8208;coordinated Fe is revealed under extreme conditions. This discovery advances comprehension of iron&#8208;based structure and contributes to exploring chemical hypercoordination phenomena.







Abstract
The chemistry of hypercoordination has been a subject of fundamental interest, especially for understanding structures that challenge conventional wisdom. The small ionic radii of Fe ions typically result in coordination numbers of 4 or 6 in stable Fe&#8208;bearing ionic compounds. While 8&#8208;coordinated Fe has been observed in highly compressed oxides, the pursuit of hypercoordinated Fe still faces significant challenges due to the complexity of synthesizing the anticipated compound with another suitable anion. Through first&#8208;principles simulation and advanced crystal structure prediction methods, we predict that an orthorhombic phase of FeF3 with exclusively 8&#8208;coordinated Fe is energetically stable above 18&#8197;GPa&#8212;a pressure more feasibly achieved compared to oxides. Inspired by this theoretical result, we conducted extensive experiments using a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell technique to investigate the crystal structures of FeF3 at high&#8208;pressure conditions. We successfully synthesized the predicted orthorhombic phase of FeF3 at 46&#8197;GPa, as confirmed by in situ experimental X&#8208;ray diffraction data. This work establishes a new ionic compound featuring rare 8&#8208;coordinated Fe in a simple binary Fe&#8208;bearing system and paves the way for discovering Fe hypercoordination in similar systems.

         <title>Biocatalytic Steroidal 9&#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation and Fragmentation Enable the Concise Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 9,10&#8208;Secosteroids</title>

         <dc:description>
Ten 9,10&#8208;secosteroids were synthesized from readily available steroids in three to eight steps via a chemoenzymatic approach. The key feature lies in utilizing the Rieske oxygenase 3&#8208;ketosteroid 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (KSH) as a biocatalyst to achieve efficient C9&#8722;C10 bond cleavage and A&#8208;ring aromatization of tetracyclic steroids through a 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation cascade.







Abstract
9,10&#8208;Secosteroids are an important group of marine steroids with diverse biological activities. Herein, we report a chemoenzymatic strategy for the concise, modular, and scalable synthesis of ten naturally occurring 9,10&#8208;secosteroids from readily available steroids in three to eight steps. The key feature lies in utilizing a Rieske oxygenase&#8208;like 3&#8208;ketosteroid 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (KSH) as the biocatalyst to achieve efficient C9&#8722;C10 bond cleavage and A&#8208;ring aromatization of tetracyclic steroids through 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation. With synthesized 9,10&#8208;secosteroides, structure&#8211;activity relationship was evaluated based on bioassays in terms of previously unexplored anti&#8208;infective activity. This study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that the biosynthetic pathway through which 9,10&#8208;secosteroids are formed in nature shares a similar 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation cascade. In addition to the development of a biomimetic approach for 9,10&#8208;secosteroid synthesis, this study highlights the great potential of chemoenzymatic strategies in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Significance of Vibronic Coupling that Shapes Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Double Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates how molecular vibrations influence the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of double helicenes DPC and DNH. It highlights how structural changes during electronic transitions shape CPL spectra and dissymmetry (g) factor values, emphasizing the role of Herzberg&#8208;Teller effects in enhancing CPL responses.







Abstract
The circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra of S&#8208; and X&#8208;shaped double helicenes exhibit distinct vibrational structures and overall shape variations. In this study, we conducted an in&#8208;depth investigation into the vibronic effects influencing the CPL spectra of two double helicenes, namely DPC and DNH. Employing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computations utilizing the FC&#8208;HT1|VH model at the CAM&#8722;B3LYP/def2&#8208;TZVP level, we unveiled the paramount impact of Franck&#8211;Condon (FC), Herzberg&#8208;Teller (HT), and Duschinsky effects on their chiroptical responses. Our research underscores the pivotal role of structural deformations associated with the S1&#8208;to&#8208;S0 electronic transition in molding CPL spectra and wavelength&#8208;dependent dissymmetry (g) factor values, as well as the significance of HT effects in shaping and enhancing CPL responses. This extensive investigation not only advances our comprehension of the vibronic characteristics in configurationally distinct double helicenes but also offers valuable insights for the design of chiral molecules featuring controllable or finely&#8208;tunable CPL responses.

         <title>Directing in Vitro Selection towards G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming Aptamers to Inhibit HMGB1 Pathological Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By an in vitro selection procedure applied to a doped library of G&#8208;rich oligonucleotides, effective G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming aptamers against HMGB1, a protein involved in inflammation and cancer, were identified. L12 was selected as the best performing aptamer, featured by high thermal and enzymatic stability, along with strong anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity and good HMGB1&#8208;binding affinity, which indicate it as a very promising lead candidate for in vivo studies.







Abstract
In the search for novel, effective inhibitors of High&#8208;Mobility Group Box1 (HMGB1)&#8212;a protein involved in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as in cancer&#8212;we herein discovered a set of anti&#8208;HMGB1 G&#8208;quadruplex(G4)&#8208;forming aptamers by using an in vitro selection procedure applied to a doped library of guanine&#8208;rich oligonucleotides. The selected DNA sequences were then studied in a pseudo&#8208;physiological buffer mimicking the extracellular medium, where HMGB1 exerts its pathological activity, using spectroscopic, electrophoretic, and chromatographic techniques. All the oligonucleotides proved to fold into monomeric G4s and in some cases also dimeric species, stable at physiological temperature. Remarkably, the protein preferentially recognized the sequences forming dimeric parallel G4 structures, as evidenced by a properly designed chemiluminescent binding assay which also highlighted a good selectivity of these aptamers for HMGB1. Moreover, all aptamers showed anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity, inhibiting protein&#8208;induced cell migration. The acquired data allowed identifying L12 as the best anti&#8208;HMGB1 aptamer, featured by high thermal and enzymatic stability, no toxicity at least up to 5&#8197;&#956;M concentration on healthy cells, along with potent anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity (IC50 ca. 28&#8197;nM) and good binding affinity for the protein, thus indicating it as a very promising lead candidate for in vivo studies.

         <title>Directing the Encapsulation of Single Cells with DNA Framework Nucleator&#8208;Based Hydrogel Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a bio&#8208;inspired strategy for single&#8208;cell encapsulation by using a DNA framework structure as a nucleator (DFN) to guide the growth of DNA hydrogels under cell&#8208;friendly conditions. The tetrahedral DFN could stably anchor on the cell membrane, resulting in a uniform and flexible cell encapsulation that persisted for 72&#8197;h. This encapsulation could maintain cell viability and protect cells against mechanical stress&#8208;induced autophagy.







Abstract
Encapsulating individual mammalian cells with biomimetic materials holds potential in ex vivo cell culture and engineering. However, current methodologies often present tradeoffs between homogeneity, stability, and cell compatibility. Here, inspired by bacteria that use proteins stably anchored on their outer membranes to nucleate biofilm growth, we develop a single&#8208;cell encapsulation strategy by using a DNA framework structure as a nucleator (DFN) to initiate the growth of DNA hydrogels under cell&#8208;friendly conditions. We find that among the tested structures, the tetrahedral DFN can evenly and stably reside on cell membranes, effectively initiating hybridization chain reactions which generate homogeneously dense yet flexible single&#8208;cell encapsulation for diverse cell lines. The encapsulation persists for up to 72&#8197;hours in a serum&#8208;containing cell culture environment, representing a ~70&#8208;fold improvement compared to encapsulations mediated by single&#8208;stranded DNA nucleators. The metabolism and proliferation of the encapsulated cells are suppressed, but can be restored to the original efficiencies upon release, suggesting the superior cell compatibility of the encapsulation. We also find that compared to naked cells, the encapsulated cells exhibit a lower autophagy level after undergoing mechanical stress, suggesting the protective effect of the DNA encapsulation. This method may provide a new tool for ex vivo cell engineering.

         <title>Low&#8208;coordination Nanocrystalline Copper&#8208;based Catalysts through Theory&#8208;guided Electrochemical Restructuring for Selective CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the electrochemical restructuring calculation of Cu catalysts, a customized, low&#8208;coordination Cu catalyst was prepared for the efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethylene. Benefiting from this excellent catalyst, the selectivity of CO2 conversion to ethylene reached 72% at a current density of 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a durable stability of 230 hours in an electrolyzer.







Abstract
Revealing the dynamic reconstruction process and tailoring advanced copper (Cu) catalysts is of paramount significance for promoting the conversion of CO2 into ethylene (C2H4), paving the way for carbon neutralization and facilitating renewable energy storage. In this study, we initially employed density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the restructuring behavior of a catalyst under electrochemical conditions and delineated its restructuring patterns. Leveraging insights into this restructuring behavior, we devised an efficient, low&#8208;coordination copper&#8208;based catalyst. The resulting synthesized catalyst demonstrated an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 70&#8201;% for ethylene generation at a current density of 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it showed robust stability, maintaining consistent performance for 230&#8197;hours at a cell voltage of 3.5&#8197;V in a full&#8208;cell system. Our research not only deepens the understanding of the active sites involved in designing efficient carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts but also advances CO2 electrolysis technologies for industrial application.

A non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE) was developed as a biosafe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts. SeSAE exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimic activity, effectively disrupting cellular energy and reduction equivalents to suppress tumors. The comprehensive investigation of SeSAE, from theoretical calculations to in vivo antitumor pathways, promises valuable insights into the translation of single atom nanozymes.







Abstract
Enzymes are considered safe and effective therapeutic tools for various diseases. With the increasing integration of biomedicine and nanotechnology, artificial nanozymes offer advanced controllability and functionality in medical design. However, several notable gaps, such as catalytic diversity, specificity and biosafety, still exist between nanozymes and their native counterparts. Here we report a non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE), which exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimetic activity. This novel single atom nanozyme provides a safe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts and effectively cuts off the cellular energy and reduction equivalents through its distinctive catalytic function in tumors. In this study, we have demonstrated the substantial efficacy of SeSAE as an antitumor nanomedicine across diverse mouse models without discernible systemic adverse effects. The mechanism of the NADPH oxidase&#8208;like activity of the non&#8208;metal SeSAE was rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, comprehensive elucidation of the biological functions, cell death pathways, and metabolic remodeling effects of the nanozyme was conducted, aiming to provide valuable insights into the development of single atom nanozymes with clinical translation potential.

         <title>Fe, N&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Redistribution in NiCo Spinel on Biomass&#8208;Derived Carbon for Bi&#8208;functional Oxygen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe, N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported spinel NiCo2O4 catalysts were designed through the interface electron redistribution strategy. Due to the doping of Fe and N, the Co, Ni sites promotes the coordination and dissociation of water and the oxygen reduction. The formation of Ni&#8722;VO&#8722;Fe structure accelerates the oxygen evolution reaction. Electron regulation among Multiple active sites provides positive effect on the reversible conversion of oxygen.







Abstract
Herein, an interfacial electron redistribution is proposed to boost the activity of carbon&#8208;supported spinel NiCo2O4 catalyst toward oxygen conversion via Fe, N&#8208;doping strategy. Fe&#8208;doping into octahedron induces a redistribution of electrons between Co and Ni atoms on NiCo1.8Fe0.2O4@N&#8208;carbon. The increased electron density of Co promotes the coordination of water to Co sites and further dissociation. The generation of proton from water improves the overall activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The increased electron density of Ni facilitates the generation of oxygen vacancies. The Ni&#8722;VO&#8722;Fe structure accelerates the deprotonation of *OOH to improve the activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). N&#8208;doping modulates the electron density of carbon to form active sites for the adsorption and protonation of oxygen species. Fir wood&#8208;derived carbon endows catalyst with an integral structure to enable outstanding electrocatalytic performance. The NiCo1.8Fe0.2O4@N&#8208;carbon express high half&#8208;wave potential up to 0.86&#8197;V in ORR and low overpotential of 270&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in OER. The zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) assembled with the as&#8208;prepared catalyst achieve long&#8208;term cycle stability (over 2000&#8197;cycles) with peak power density (180&#8197;mWcm&#8722;2). Fe, N&#8208;doping strategy drives the catalysis of biomass&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based catalysts to the highest level for the oxygen conversion in ZABs.

         <title>Photoresponsive Covalent Organic Frameworks: Visible&#8208;Light Controlled Conversion of Porous Structures and Its Impacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of photoresponsive porous frameworks were created by integrating protruded tetrafluoroazobenzene units onto pore walls of 1D channels, constructing a broad spectrum of photoresponsive pores. The frameworks are highly sensitive to visible lights, convert pores into new ones via photoisomerization, and achieve benchmark changes in pore size, shape, number, and environment as well as gas uptake and release, opening a way to novel smart porous materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks are a novel class of crystalline porous polymers that enable molecular design of extended polygonal skeletons to attain well&#8208;defined porous structures. However, construction of a framework that allows remote control of pores remains a challenge. Here we report a strategy that merges covalent, noncovalent, and photo chemistries to design photoresponsive frameworks with reversibly and remotely controllable pores. We developed a topology&#8208;guided multicomponent polycondensation system that integrates protruded tetrafluoroazobenzene units as photoresponsive sites on pore walls at predesigned densities, so that a series of crystalline porous frameworks with the same backbone can be constructed to develop a broad spectrum of pores ranging from mesopores to micropores. Distinct from conventional azobenzene&#8208;based systems, the tetrafluoroazobenzene frameworks are highly sensitive to visible lights to undergo high&#8208;rate isomerization. The photoisomerization exerts profound effects on pore size, shape, number, and environment, as well as molecular uptake and release, rendering the system able to convert and switch pores reversibly and remotely with visible lights. Our results open a way to a novel class of smart porous materials with pore structures and functions that are convertible and manageable with visible lights.

         <title>Air&#8208;Promoted Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production from Bioethanol over Core/Shell Cr2O3@GaN Nanoarchitecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air is explored as a promoter rather than quencher for light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from bioethanol over a core/shell Cr2O3@GaN nanoarchitecture, showing an impressive H2 evolution rate by only feeding ethanol, air, and light without notable degradation over 180&#8197;hours operation. Value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds are simultaneously generated.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from biomass derivatives offers a path towards carbon neutrality. It is often however operated with the limitations of sluggish kinetics and severe coking. Herein, a disruptive air&#8208;promoted strategy is explored for efficient and durable light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from ethanol over a core/shell Cr2O3@GaN nanoarchitecture. The correlative computational and experimental investigations show ethanol is energetically favorable to be adsorbed on the Cr2O3@GaN interface, followed by dehydrogenation toward acetaldehyde and protons by photoexcited holes. The released protons are then consumed for H2 evolution by photogenerated electrons. Afterward, O2 can be evolved into active oxygen species and promote the deprotonation and C&#8722;C cleavage of the key C2 intermediate, thus significantly lowering the reaction energy barrier of hydrogen evolution and removing the carbon residual with inhibited overoxidation. Consequently, hydrogen is produced at a high rate of 76.9&#8197;mole H2 per gram Cr2O3@GaN per hour by only feeding ethanol, air, and light, leading to the achievement of a turnover number of 266,943,000&#8197;mole H2 per mole Cr2O3 over a long&#8208;term operation of 180&#8197;hours. Notably, an unprecedented light&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 17.6&#8201;% is achieved under concentrated light illumination. The simultaneous generation of aldehyde from ethanol dehydrogenation enables the process more economically promising.

Abstract
Chemical modifications of enzymes excel in the realm of enzyme engineering due to its directness, robustness, and efficiency; however, challenges persist in devising versatile and effective strategies. In this study, we introduce a supramolecular modification methodology that amalgamates a supramolecular polymer with Candida antarctica lipase&#8197;B (CalB) to create supramolecular enzymes (SupEnzyme). This approach features the straightforward preparation of a supramolecular amphiphilic polymer (&#946;&#8208;CD@SMA), which was subsequently conjugated to the enzyme, resulting in a SupEnzyme capable of self&#8208;assembly into supramolecular nanoparticles. The resulting SupEnzyme nanoparticles can form micron&#8208;scale supramolecular aggregates through supramolecular and electrostatic interactions with guest entities, thus enhancing catalyst recycling. Remarkably, these aggregates maintain 80&#8201;% activity after seven cycles, outperforming Novozym 435. Additionally, they can effectively initiate photobiocatalytic cascade reactions using guest photocatalysts. As a consequence, our SupEnzyme methodology exhibits noteworthy adaptability in enzyme modification, presenting a versatile platform for various polymer, enzyme, and biocompatible catalyst pairings, with potential applications in the fields of chemistry and biology.

         <dc:description>
The first general method for accessing various potentially valuable and hitherto elusive trifluoromethyl carboxylic esters through the challenging O&#8208;trifluoromethylation of carboxylic acids is reported. The activation effect of ZnCl2 on acyloxy(phenyltrifluoromethyl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes has been studied by DFT calculations and control experiments. The reaction can be used for late&#8208;stage modification of drugs and bioactive carboxylic acids as well.







Abstract
Here we report the challenging O&#8208;trifluoromethylation of carboxylic acids via the formation and activation of acyloxy(phenyl)trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes. The method provides an easy access to various potentially valuable and hitherto elusive trifluoromethyl carboxylic esters. A remarkably wide range of substrates with commonly encountered functional groups are compatible with this reaction, including aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids, as well as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs and pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The reaction mechanism and the origins of the enhanced reactivity by zinc chloride (ZnCl2) were discussed from experimental evidence and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.

         <title>Independent Multiple&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Functionality in Composition Adjustable Immiscible Ru&#8208;Rh&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt Solid&#8208;Solution High&#8208;Entropy Alloys for NOx Reduction Outperforming Rh</title>

         <dc:description>
We prepared homogeneous Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt high&#8208;entropy solid solutions with adjustable compositisions as multiple&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts for NOx reduction. The elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover were well&#8208;coupled on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8722;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, mainly responsible for the superior activities over pure Rh.







Abstract
The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanoparticles with four, five or more metals significantly can yield the developments of functional materials with excellent performances in various reactions. However, the underlying reaction mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis for HEA have been rarely investigated, due to their diverse elements and complex compositions. In this study, we successfully synthesized the homogeneously dispersed Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt HEA with adjustable compositions, as the multiple&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (MASC). In the NOx reduction performance tests, Ru0.4 (Rh0.33Pd0.33Pt0.33)0.6 MASC showed the highest activity, which was significantly improved compared to that of the best monometal Rh, with the light&#8208;off temperature decreasing by ca. 50&#8201;&#176;C. The Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that the outstanding activity of Ru&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pt MASC was attributable to the well&#8208;coupled elementary steps of the CO adsorption, NO adsorption, NO dissociation and O spillover on the Ru, Rh, Rh&#8722;Pd and Pt sites, respectively, which explained the first clear reaction mechanism in heterogeneous catalysis for HEA.

         <title>Surface Lattice Modulation Enables Stable Cycling of High&#8208;Loading All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Batteries at High Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a surface&#8208;lattice&#8208;doping (SLD) strategy for the stabilization of the solid electrolyte/cathode interface for its working at a high voltage of 4.5&#8197;V. Specifically, a uniform AlPO4 coating layer was built with nanometer precision around the LiCoO2 (LCO) particle. The following sintering at high temperature induced a homogeneous Al3+ diffusion into the LCO crust, leading to a controlled degree of surface Al/Co/Li disorder together with the formed Li+&#8208;conductive Li3PO4 islands decorating the LCO surface. We found that this SLD strategy is capable of not only suppressing the structural degradation of LCO itself, but also effectively mitigating the decomposition of the chloride&#8208;based solid electrolyte at the interface, thereby ensuring the assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a LiCoO2 cathode excellent cycling stability at 4.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes, known for their high ionic conductivity at room temperature and good oxidative stability, face notable challenges in all&#8211;solid&#8211;state Li&#8211;ion batteries (ASSBs), especially with unstable cathode/solid electrolyte (SE) interface and increasing interfacial resistance during cycling. In this work, we have developed an Al3+&#8211;doped, cation&#8211;disordered epitaxial nanolayer on the LiCoO2 surface by reacting it with an artificially constructed AlPO4 nanoshell; this lithium&#8211;deficient layer featuring a rock&#8211;salt&#8211;like phase effectively suppresses oxidative decomposition of Li3InCl6 electrolyte and stabilizes the cathode/SE interface at 4.5&#8197;V. The ASSBs with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a high&#8211;loading LiCoO2 cathode demonstrated high discharge capacity and long cycling life from 3 to 4.5&#8197;V. Our findings emphasize the importance of specialized cathode surface modification in preventing SE degradation and achieving stable cycling of halide&#8211;based ASSBs at high voltages.

         <title>Engineering Anti&#8208;CRISPR Proteins to Create CRISPR&#8208;Cas Protein Switches for Activatable Genome Editing and Viral Protease Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
A panel of orthogonal protease&#8208;responsive Cas12a protein switches are presented by leveraging Anti&#8208;CRISPR proteins as modular components under the rational guidance of computational chemistry&#8208;directed protein interface engineering. The protein switches facilitate the conversion of specific proteolytic events into activation of Cas12a function high switching ratios, allowing activatable genome editing and sensitive viral protease detection.







Abstract
Proteins capable of switching between distinct active states in response to biochemical cues are ideal for sensing and controlling biological processes. Activatable CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems are significant in precise genetic manipulation and sensitive molecular diagnostics, yet directly controlling Cas protein function remains challenging. Herein, we explore anti&#8208;CRISPR (Acr) proteins as modules to create synthetic Cas protein switches (CasPSs) based on computational chemistry&#8208;directed rational protein interface engineering. Guided by molecular fingerprint analysis, electrostatic potential mapping, and binding free energy calculations, we rationally engineer the molecular interaction interface between Cas12a and its cognate Acr proteins (AcrVA4 and AcrVA5) to generate a series of orthogonal protease&#8208;responsive CasPSs. These CasPSs enable the conversion of specific proteolytic events into activation of Cas12a function with high switching ratios (up to 34.3&#8208;fold). These advancements enable specific proteolysis&#8208;inducible genome editing in mammalian cells and sensitive detection of viral protease activities during virus infection. This work provides a promising strategy for developing CRISPR&#8208;Cas tools for controllable gene manipulation and regulation and clinical diagnostics.

Guided by molecular fingerprint analysis, electrostatic potential mapping, and binding free energy calculations, we rationally engineer the molecular interaction interface between Cas12a and its cognate Acr proteins (AcrVA4 and AcrVA5) to generate a series of orthogonal protease-responsive CasPSs. These CasPSs enable the conversion of specific proteolytic events into activation of Cas12a function with high switching ratios (up to 34.3-fold). These advancements enable specific proteolysis-inducible genome editing in mammalian cells and sensitive detection of viral protease activities during virus infection. This work provides a promising strategy for developing CRISPR-Cas tools for controllable gene manipulation and regulation and clinical diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Supported Silver Catalysts through Al modification for Efficient Ethylene Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we synthesized an Ag/Al&#8722;MnO2 catalyst by metal&#8208;modification engineering to simultaneously improve the catalytic activity and selectivity for ethylene epoxidation. Experimental and theoretical results showed that the Al modification tailored the 3d state of Ag on MnO2 through strong electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs). These targeted effects enhanced the catalytic selectivity and overcame the activity&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off in heterogeneous catalysis, providing a new strategy for designing advanced catalysts for heterogeneous oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;modified catalysts have attracted extraordinary research attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their enhanced geometric and electronic structures and outstanding catalytic performances. Silver (Ag) possesses necessary active sites for ethylene epoxidation, but the catalyst activity is usually sacrificed to obtain high selectivity towards ethylene oxide (EO). Herein, we report that using Al can help in tailoring the unoccupied 3d state of Ag on the MnO2 support through strong electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs), overcoming the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off for ethylene epoxidation and resulting in a very high ethylene conversion rate (~100&#8201;%) with 90&#8201;% selectivity for EO under mild conditions (170&#8201;&#176;C and atmospheric pressure). Structural characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the EMSIs obtained by the Al modification tailor the unoccupied 3d state of Ag, modulating the adsorption of ethylene (C2H4) and oxygen (O2) and facilitating EO desorption, resulting in high C2H4 conversion. Meanwhile, the increased number of positively charge Ag+ lowers the energy barrier for C2H4(ads) oxidation to produce oxametallacycle (OMC), inducing the unexpectedly high EO selectivity. Such an extraordinary electronic promotion provides new promising pathways for designing advanced metal catalysts with high activity and selectivity in selective oxidation reactions.

         <title>&#8220;Zero&#8221; Intrinsic Fluorescence Sensing&#8208;Platforms Enable Ultrasensitive Whole Blood Diagnosis and In Vivo Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
The present work reports a versatile strategy involving engineering long&#8208;wavelength rhodol derivatives by systematically regulating the open&#8208;loop/spirocyclic forms, thereby aiding in eliminating probe intrinsic fluorescence (PIF) of far&#8208;red to NIR II probes and creating ultra&#8208;sensitive fluorescence probes with a robust turn&#8208;on response (190 to 1300&#8208;fold). These novel probes enable accurate detection and quantification of biomarkers in abnormal physiological processes (p53 abnormalities) and diseases (tumor metastases).







Abstract
Abnormal physiological processes and diseases can lead to content or activity fluctuations of biocomponents in organelles and whole blood. However, precise monitoring of these abnormalities remains extremely challenging due to the insufficient sensitivity and accuracy of available fluorescence probes, which can be attributed to the background fluorescence arising from two sources, 1) biocomponent autofluorescence (BCAF) and 2) probe intrinsic fluorescence (PIF). To overcome these obstacles, we have re&#8208;engineered far&#8208;red to NIR II rhodol derivatives that possess weak BCAF interference. And a series of &#8220;zero&#8221; PIF sensing&#8208;platforms were created by systematically regulating the open&#8208;loop/spirocyclic forms. Leveraging these advancements, we devised various ultra&#8208;sensitive NIR indicators, achieving substantial fluorescence boosts (190 to 1300&#8208;fold). Among these indicators, 8&#8208;LAP demonstrated accurate tracking and quantifying of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) in whole blood at various stages of tumor metastasis. Furthermore, coupling 8&#8208;LAP with an endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting element enabled the detection of ERAP1 activity in HCT116 cells with p53 abnormalities. This delicate design of eliminating PIF provides insights into enhancing the sensitivity and accuracy of existing fluorescence probes toward the detection and imaging of biocomponents in abnormal physiological processes and diseases.

A trisulfur radical anion (S3.&#8722;) triggered domino thienannulation strategy for the synthesis of dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]thieno[2,3&#8208;b;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes (DBTDTs) has been developed. This domino protocol is featured by no metal catalyst and the formation of six C&#8722;S and one C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;pot reaction. A plausible mechanism has been proposed by control experiments, intermediate trapping experiments, etc. The unique unsymmetric structure of DBTDT endows it with herringbone packing structure and weak S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions between molecules as well as high transfer integrals, which enables a high carrier mobility of 1.52&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Unsymmetric organic semiconductors have many advantages such as good solubility, rich intermolecular interactions for potential various optoelectronic applications. However, their synthesis is more challenging due to intricate structures thus normally suffering tedious synthesis. Herein, we report a trisulfur radical anion (S3&#8901;&#8722;) triggered domino thienannulation strategy for the synthesis of dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]thieno[2,3&#8208;b;4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes (DBTDTs) using readily available 1&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;ethynylbenzenes as starting materials. This domino protocol features no metal catalyst and the formation of six C&#8722;S and one C&#8722;C bonds in a one&#8208;pot reaction. Mechanistic study revealed a unique domino radical anion pathway. Single crystal structure analysis of unsymmetric DBTDT shows that its unique unsymmetric structure endows rich and multiple weak S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interactions between molecules, which enables the large intermolecular transfer integrals of 86&#8197;meV and efficient charge transport performance with a carrier mobility of 1.52&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This study provides a facile and highly efficient synthetic strategy for more high&#8208;performance unsymmetric organic semiconductors.

         <title>Regulating Hydrogen/Oxygen Species Adsorption via Built&#8208;in Electric Field &#8208;Driven Electron Transfer Behavior at the Heterointerface for Efficient Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>

The work&#8208;function difference&#8208;induced formation of BEF can drive the asymmetrical charge distribution of heterostructure WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF catalysts through electronic transfer behaviors and manipulate the d band structure of active sites, thereby optimizing intermediate adsorption energy and accelerating reaction kinetics of the overall water splitting process.







Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) plays a crucial role in the realization of a hydrogen economy. The design and development of efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are pivotal to achieving high&#8208;efficiency AWE. Herein, WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C nanoparticle&#8208;embedded carbon nanofiber (WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF) with abundant interfaces is successfully designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the electron transfer behavior from Mo2C to WC1&#8208;x, the electrocatalysts of WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF exhibit superior HER and OER performance. Furthermore, when employed as anode and cathode in membrane electrode assembly devices, the WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and remarkable stability for 100&#8197;hours at a high current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 towards overall water splitting. The experimental characterizations and theoretical simulation reveal that modulation of the d&#8208;band center for WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF, achieved through the asymmetric charge distribution resulting from the built&#8208;in electric field induced by work function, enables optimization of adsorption strength for hydrogen/oxygen intermediates, thereby promoting the catalytic kinetics for overall water splitting. This work provides promising strategies for designing highly active catalysts in energy conversion fields.

&lt;p&gt;The work-function difference-induced formation of BEF can drive the asymmetrical charge distribution of heterostructure WC&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C@CNF catalysts through electronic transfer behaviors and manipulate the d band structure of active sites, thereby optimizing intermediate adsorption energy and accelerating reaction kinetics of the overall water splitting process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) plays a crucial role in the realization of a hydrogen economy. The design and development of efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are pivotal to achieving high-efficiency AWE. Herein, WC&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C nanoparticle-embedded carbon nanofiber (WC&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C@CNF) with abundant interfaces is successfully designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the electron transfer behavior from Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C to WC&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;, the electrocatalysts of WC&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C@CNF exhibit superior HER and OER performance. Furthermore, when employed as anode and cathode in membrane electrode assembly devices, the WC&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C@CNF catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and remarkable stability for 100&#8197;hours at a high current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; towards overall water splitting. The experimental characterizations and theoretical simulation reveal that modulation of the d-band center for WC&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C@CNF, achieved through the asymmetric charge distribution resulting from the built-in electric field induced by work function, enables optimization of adsorption strength for hydrogen/oxygen intermediates, thereby promoting the catalytic kinetics for overall water splitting. This work provides promising strategies for designing highly active catalysts in energy conversion fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of Phase Mixing Degree in Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction on Cu&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation on defect structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationship in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction by mixing various phases. The efficiency of C&#8722;C coupling increased with phase mixing degree of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, with a maximum FE of 81&#8201;% toward C2+ products. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the increased phase mixing degree facilitated *CO formation and retention at low and high overpotential, respectively.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been identified as the most promising candidates for generation of C2+ products in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Defect engineering in catalysts is a widely employed strategy for promoting C&#8722;C coupling on Cu. However, comprehensive understanding of defect structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationship has not been obtained. In this study, controllable defects generation is achieved, which leads to a series of Cu&#8208;based catalysts with various phase mixing degrees. It is observed that the Faradaic efficiency toward C2+ products increases with the phase mixing degree, reaching 81&#8201;% at maximum. In situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the catalysts with higher phase mixing degree tend to form *CO more easily and possess higher retention of *CO under high overpotential window, thereby promoting C&#8722;C coupling. This work sheds new light on the relationship between defects and C&#8722;C coupling, and the rational developed of more advanced Cu&#8208;base catalysts.

         <title>Build a High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Battery through Introducing Competitive Coordination Induction Effect in Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>

We propose a new concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO&#8208;based PICE. The intrinsic mechanism of CCIE and its effects on both the Li+ conductivity and the interfacial stability at RT were clarified. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability and cycling performance at 30&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Polymer&#8208;inorganic composite electrolytes (PICE) have attracted tremendous attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) due to facile processability. However, the poor Li+ conductivity at room temperature (RT) and interfacial instability severely hamper the practical application. Herein, we propose a concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO&#8208;based PICE. CCIE introduction greatly enhances the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performances of ASSLBs at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Owing to the competitive coordination (Cs+&#8230;TFSI&#8722;&#8230;Li+, Cs+&#8230;C&#8722;O&#8722;C&#8230;Li+ and 2,4,6&#8208;TFA&#8230;Li&#8230;TFSI&#8722;) from the competitive cation (Cs+ from CsPF6) and molecule (2,4,6&#8208;TFA: 2,4,6&#8208;trifluoroaniline), a multimodal weak coordination environment of Li+ is constructed enabling a high efficient Li+ migration at 30&#8201;&#176;C (Li+ conductivity: 6.25&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1; tLi+=0.61). Since Cs+ tends to be enriched at the interface, TFSI&#8722; and PF6&#8722; in situ form LiF&#8208;Li3N&#8208;Li2O&#8208;Li2S enriched solid electrolyte interface with electrostatic shielding effects. The assembled ASSLBs without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability (LiFePO4: 147.44&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1@1&#8197;C and 107.41mAhg&#8722;1@2&#8197;C) and cycling stability at 30&#8201;&#176;C (LiFePO4:94.65&#8201;%@200cycles@0.5&#8197;C; LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2: 94.31&#8201;%@200&#8197;cycles@0.3&#8197;C). This work proposes a concept of CCIE and reveals its mechanism in designing PICE with high ionic conductivity as well as high interfacial compatibility at near RT for high&#8208;performance ASSLBs.

         <title>Highly Selective and Efficient Perdeuteration of n&#8208;Pentane via H/D Exchange Catalyzed by a Silica&#8208;Supported Hafnium&#8208;Iridium Bimetallic Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel hafnium&#8208;iridium complex immobilized on silica, HfIr/SiO2, is highly efficient and selective for the perdeuteration of alkanes with D2, exemplified on n&#8208;pentane, without substantial deuterogenolysis. This represents substantial advance in catalytic H/D isotope exchange (HIE) reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) approach is used to prepare a novel hafnium&#8208;iridium catalyst immobilized on silica, HfIr/SiO2, featuring well&#8208;defined [&#8801;SiOHf(CH2tBu)2(&#956;&#8208;H)3IrCp*] surface sites. Unlike the monometallic analogous materials Hf/SiO2 and Ir/SiO2, which promote n&#8208;pentane deuterogenolysis through C&#8722;C bond scission, we demonstrate that under the same experimental conditions (1&#8197;bar D2, 250&#8201;&#176;C, 3&#8197;h, 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the heterobimetallic catalyst HfIr/SiO2 is highly efficient and selective for the perdeuteration of alkanes with D2, exemplified on n&#8208;pentane, without substantial deuterogenolysis (&lt;2&#8201;% at 95&#8201;% conversion). Furthermore this HfIr/SiO2 catalyst is robust and can be re&#8208;used several times without evidence of decomposition. This represents substantial advance in catalytic H/D isotope exchange (HIE) reactions of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Multielectron Redox&#8208;Bipolar Tetranitroporphyrin Macrocycle Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin macrocycle is designed, which fuses quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties. A high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8211;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage mechanism gives the Zn&#8208;organic battery high capacity, improved average voltage, outstanding energy density and durable cyclability.







Abstract
Bipolar organics fuse the merits of n/p&#8208;type redox reactions for better Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs), but face the capacity plafond due to low density of active units and single&#8208;electron reactions. Here we report multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin (TNP) with quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties towards high&#8208;capacity&#8208;voltage ZOBs. TNP cathode initiates high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8211;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage involving four nitro sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential and two amine species coupling with SO42&#8722; ions at high potential. Consequently, Zn||TNP battery harvests high capacity (338&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), boosted average voltage (1.08&#8197;V), and outstanding energy density (365&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1TNP). Moreover, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated TNP macrocycle achieves anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, prolonging the battery life to 50,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 71.6&#8201;% capacity retention. This work expands the chemical landscape of multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar organics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs.

         <title>Singlet Fission in a New Series of Systematically Designed Through&#8208;space Coupled Tetracene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collection of through&#8208;space tetracene oligomers demonstrates sub&#8208;picosecond singlet fission, as revealed by femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. These oligomers exhibit a remarkably high yield of the triplet pair state, a characteristic seldom observed in tetracene derivatives owing to the unfavorable energetics associated with their singlet and triplet energy levels.







Abstract
Singlet fission (SF) holds great promise for current photovoltaic technologies, where tetracenes, with their relatively high triplet energies, play a major role for application in silicon&#8208;based solar cells. However, the SF efficiencies in tetracene dimers are low due to the unfavorable energetics of their singlet and triplet energy levels. In the solid state, tetracene exhibits high yields of triplet formation through SF, raising great interest about the underlying mechanisms. To address this discrepancy, we designed and prepared a novel molecular system based on a hexaphenylbenzene core decorated with 2 to 6 tetracene chromophores. The spatial arrangement of tetracene units, induced by steric hindrance in the central part, dictates through&#8208;space coupling, making it a relevant model for solid&#8208;state chromophore organization. We then revealed a remarkable increase in SF quantum yield with the number of tetracenes, reaching quantitative (196&#8201;%) triplet pair formation in hexamer. We observed a short&#8208;lived correlated triplet pair and limited magnetic effects, indicating ineffective triplet dissociation in these through&#8208;space coupled systems. These findings emphasize the crucial role of the number of chromophores involved and the interchromophore arrangement for the SF efficiency. The insights gained from this study will aid designing more efficient and technology&#8208;compatible SF systems for applications in photovoltaics.

         <title>Synergetic Modulation of Steric Hindrance and Excited State for Anti&#8208;Quenching and Fast Spin&#8208;Flip Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergetic steric&#8208;hindrance and excited&#8208;state modulation results in high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorophores (IDAD&#8208;BNCz and TIDAD&#8208;BNCz) with anti&#8208;quenching behavior and fast spin&#8208;flip. A device based on IDAD&#8208;BNCz with a high doping level of 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% shows a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 34&#8197;nm and record&#8208;setting external quantum efficiencies of 34.3&#8201;% and 31.8&#8201;% at maximum and 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials hold great promise for advanced high&#8208;resolution organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. However, persistent challenges, such as severe aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and slow spin&#8208;flip, hinder their optimal performance. We propose a synergetic steric&#8208;hindrance and excited&#8208;state modulation strategy for MR&#8208;TADF emitters, which is demonstrated by two blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters, IDAD&#8208;BNCz and TIDAD&#8208;BNCz, bearing sterically demanding 8,8&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (IDAD) and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;8,8&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (TIDAD), respectively. These rigid and bulky IDAD/TIDAD moieties, with appropriate electron&#8208;donating capabilities, not only effectively mitigate ACQ, ensuring efficient luminescence across a broad range of dopant concentrations, but also induce high&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer excited states that facilitate triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet spin&#8208;flip without causing undesired emission redshift or spectral broadening. Consequently, implementation of a high doping level of IDAD&#8208;BNCz resulted in highly efficient narrowband electroluminescence, featuring a remarkable full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 34&#8197;nm and record&#8208;setting external quantum efficiencies of 34.3&#8201;% and 31.8&#8201;% at maximum and 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively. The combined steric and electronic effects arising from the steric&#8208;hindered donor introduction offer a compelling molecular design strategy to overcome critical challenges in MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Supramolecular Modular Assembly of Imaging&#8208;Trackable Enzymatic Nanomotors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular assembly platform based on Janus hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle was synthesized by surface chemistry and physical deposition technology. Through host&#8211;guest interaction, different engine and imaging modules modified by corresponding guest or host molecules can be quickly assembled to build various imaging&#8208;trackable enzymatic nanomotors on&#8208;demand, which can readily meet the needs of different application scenarios.







Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled micro/nanomotors (MNMs) have shown great application potential in biomedicine, sensing, environmental remediation, etc. In the past decade, various strategies or technologies have been used to prepare and functionalize MNMs. However, the current preparation strategies of the MNMs were mainly following the pre&#8208;designed methods based on specific tasks to introduce expected functional parts on the various micro/nanocarriers, which lacks a universal platform and common features, making it difficult to apply to different application scenarios. Here, we have developed a modular assembly strategy based on host&#8211;guest chemistry, which enables the on&#8208;demand construction of imaging&#8208;trackable nanomotors mounted with suitable driving and imaging modules using a universal assembly platform, according to different application scenarios. These assembled nanomotors exhibited enhanced diffusion behavior driven by enzymatic reactions. The loaded imaging functions were used to dynamically trace the swarm motion behavior of assembled nanomotors with corresponding fuel conditions both in vitro and in vivo. The modular assembly strategy endowed with host&#8211;guest interaction provides a universal approach to producing multifunctional MNMs in a facile and controllable manner, which paves the way for the future development of MNMs systems with programmable functions.

These assembled nanomotors exhibited enhanced diffusion behavior driven by enzymatic reactions. The loaded imaging functions were used to dynamically trace the swarm motion behavior of assembled nanomotors with corresponding fuel conditions both in vitro and in vivo. The modular assembly strategy endowed with host&#8211;guest interaction provides a universal approach to producing multifunctional MNMs in a facile and controllable manner, which paves the way for the future development of MNMs systems with programmable functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing Coordination Number of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by d&#8208;Band Center&#8208;Regulated Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using the d&#8208;band center as a bridge, the correlation between the coordination number (CN) and the acetone cataluminescence (CTL) was established. A versatile d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated acetone CTL platform was thus developed for the rapid measurement of the CN of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs).







Abstract
It is essential to probe the coordination number (CN) because it is a crucial factor to ensure the catalytic capability of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Currently, synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely used to measure the CN. However, the scarcity of synchrotron X&#8208;ray source and complicated data analysis restrict its wide applications in determining the CN of SACs. In this contribution, we have developed a d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated acetone cataluminescence (CTL) probe for a rapid screening of the CN of Pt&#8208;SACs. It is disclosed that the CN&#8208;triggered CTL is attributed to the fact that the increased CN could induce the downward shift of d&#8208;band center position, which assists the acetone adsorption and promotes the subsequent catalytic reaction. In addition, the universality of the proposed acetone&#8208;CTL probe is verified by determining the CN of Fe&#8208;SACs. This work has opened a new avenue for exploring an alternative to synchrotron XAS for the determination of CN of SACs and even conventional metal catalysts through d&#8208;band center&#8208;regulated CTL.

         <title>A Triply Linked Porphyrin&#8208;Norcorrole Hybrid with Singlet Diradical Character</title>

meso&#8211;meso, &#946;&#8211;&#946;, &#946;&#8211;&#946; Triply&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8211;norcorrole hybrids and meso&#8211;meso singly&#8208;linked hybrids were synthesized through intramolecular homocoupling of precursors, respectively. The molecular structures of porphyrin&#8211;norcorrole hybrids have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The triply&#8208;linked hybrid exhibits a warped structure and shows a significantly small electrochemical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (0.45&#8197;eV). Furthermore, the triply&#8208;linked hybrid displays singlet diradical characteristics.







Abstract
Norcorrole Ni(II) complexes have recently received considerable attention because they are readily accessible antiaromatic molecules. Their high stability under ambient conditions and ease of synthesis have enabled the exploration of the intrinsic properties of antiaromatic molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of meso&#8211;meso singly linked porphyrin&#8208;norcorrole hybrids and a triply linked porphyrin&#8208;norcorrole hybrid. The singly linked and triply linked porphyrin&#8208;norcorrole hybrids were fully characterized, including an X&#8208;ray structural analysis. Due to their orthogonal conformation, the singly linked hybrids maintain the individual electronic properties of their porphyrin and norcorrole subunits, while the triply linked hybrid shows a significantly smaller electrochemical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (0.45&#8197;eV) than that of Ni(II) dimesitylnorcorrole (1.08&#8197;eV). Furthermore, the triply linked hybrid exhibits singlet diradical characteristics, as confirmed by VT&#8197;NMR, ESR, and SQUID experiments.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upgrading of Polylactic Acid Waste into Alanine under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot photoreforming route was reported for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value&#8208;added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP in situ grown on CdS can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole&#8208;dominated PLA oxidation for the coproduction of alanine with high activity (2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (&gt;75&#8201;%).







Abstract
Polylactic acid (PLA) has attracted increasing interest as a sustainable plastic because it can be degraded into CO2 and H2O in nature. However, this process is sluggish, and even worse, it is a CO2&#8208;emitting and carbon resource waste process. Therefore, it is highly urgent to develop a novel strategy for recycling post&#8208;consumer PLA to achieve a circular plastic economy. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot photoreforming route for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value&#8208;added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Results show the alanine production rate can reach up to 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with a high selectivity (&gt;75&#8201;%) and excellent stability. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole&#8208;dominated PLA oxidation to coproduce alanine. This study offers an appealing way for upcycling PLA waste and creates new opportunities for green synthesis of amino acids.

         <title>Formamidinium Lead Iodide&#8208;Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 25&#8201;% Enabled by An Amphiphilic Molecular Hole&#8208;Transporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>

A phenothiazine&#8208;based molecular hole&#8208;transporter (PTZ&#8722;CPA) carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid group is developed for the formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells, resulting in the highest solar&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion efficiencies of 25.35&#8201;% under standard air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight.







Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) represents an optimal absorber material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the application of FAPbI3 in inverted&#8208;structured PSCs has yet to be successful, mainly owing to its inferior film&#8208;forming on hydrophobic or defective hole&#8208;transporting substrates. Herein, we report a substantial improvement of FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs, which is realized by a multifunctional amphiphilic molecular hole&#8208;transporter, (2&#8208;(4&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid (PTZ&#8722;CPA). The phenothiazine (PTZ) based PTZ&#8722;CPA, carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid (CPA) group, forms a superwetting hole&#8208;selective underlayer that enables facile deposition of high&#8208;quality FAPbI3 thin films. Compared to a previously established carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective material (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8722;2PACz), the crystallinity of FAPbI3 is enhanced and the electronic defects are passivated by the PTZ&#8722;CPA more effectively, resulting in remarkable increases in photoluminescence quantum yield (four&#8208;fold) and Shockley&#8208;Read&#8208;Hall lifetime (eight&#8208;fold). Moreover, the PTZ&#8722;CPA shows a larger molecular dipole moment and improved energy level alignment with FAPbI3, benefiting the interfacial hole&#8208;collection. Consequently, FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieve an unprecedented efficiency of 25.35&#8201;% under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight. The PTZ&#8722;CPA based device shows commendable long&#8208;term stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation at 40&#8201;&#176;C for 2000&#8197;hours.

Compared to a previously established carbazole-based hole-selective material (2-(3,6-dimethoxy-9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8722;2PACz), the crystallinity of FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is enhanced and the electronic defects are passivated by the PTZ&#8722;CPA more effectively, resulting in remarkable increases in photoluminescence quantum yield (four-fold) and Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime (eight-fold). Moreover, the PTZ&#8722;CPA shows a larger molecular dipole moment and improved energy level alignment with FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, benefiting the interfacial hole-collection. Consequently, FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based inverted PSCs achieve an unprecedented efficiency of 25.35&#8201;% under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight. The PTZ&#8722;CPA based device shows commendable long-term stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation at 40&#8201;&#176;C for 2000&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topology Controlled All&#8208;(Meth)acrylic Thermoplastic Elastomers by Multi&#8208;Functional Lewis Pairs&#8208;Mediated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;initiating Lewis pairs are developed to realize living polymerization of both acrylates and methacrylates, achieving not only ultrahigh molecular weight polyacrylates (Mn up to 2174&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1), but also control over the polymers&#8217; topology (i.e. linear and star) in one&#8208;step manner. The produced star triblock TPEs exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and excellent AIE effects.







Abstract
It remains challenging to synthesize all&#8208;(meth)acrylic triblock thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs), due to the drastically different reactivities between the acrylates and methacrylates and inevitable occurrence of side reactions during polymerization of acrylates. By taking advantage of the easy structural modulation features of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs), we design and synthesize strong nucleophilic tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based NHOs varying in the number (i.e. mono&#8208;, dual&#8208; and tetra&#8722;) of initiating functional groups. Its combination with bulky organoaluminum [iBuAl(BHT)2] (BHT=bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tBu&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy)) constructs Lewis pair (LP) to realize the living polymerization of both acrylates and methacrylates, furnishing polyacrylates with ultrahigh molecular weight (Mn up to 2174&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1) within 4&#8197;min. Moreover, these NHO&#8208;based LPs enable us to not only realize the control over the polymers&#8217; topology (i.e. linear and star), but also achieve triblock star copolymers in one&#8208;step manner. Mechanical studies reveal that the star triblock TPEs exhibit better mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 1863&#8201;% and tensile strength up to 19.1&#8197;MPa) in comparison with the linear analogs. Moreover, the presence of tetraphenylethylene group in the NHOs entitled the triblock TPEs with excellent AIE properties in both solution and solid state.

Plasmonic photonic crystal enables efficient hydrogen evolution from water by harmonizing competing photonic and plasmonic effects to effectively trap and concentrate light onto plasmonic catalysts. This design demonstrates a remarkable H2 evolution at 560&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gAg&#8722;1, surpassing bare plasmonic catalyst by &gt;106&#8208;fold and other emerging high&#8208;performance photocatalytic designs by 280&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Integrating plasmonic nanoparticles with photonic crystals holds immense potential to enhance green hydrogen photosynthesis by amplifying localized electromagnetic field through generating surface plasmons and slow photons. Current plasmonic photonic designs primarily employ semiconductor&#8208;based structural backbone deposited with plasmonic nanoparticles. However, the competition between various optical phenomena in these ensembles hinders effective field enhancement rather than facilitating it. This limitation creates a formidable performance bottleneck that retards hydrogen evolution. Herein, we enhance plasmonic catalysis for efficient hydrogen evolution by effectively harmonizing plasmonic and photonic effects. This is achieved by using inert SiO2 opal as a non&#8208;photoabsorbing photonic framework. By aligning the excitation wavelengths of surface plasmons and slow photons, our optimized plasmonic photonic crystals demonstrates a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 560&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gAg&#8722;1, surpassing bare plasmonic Ag nanoparticles by &gt;106&#8208;fold and other high&#8208;performance photocatalytic designs by 280&#8208;fold. Mechanistic studies highlight the pivotal role of the non&#8208;photoabsorbing photonic backbone in facilitating effective light confinement through the photonic effect. This in turn boosts the plasmonic field for enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution, even without needing additional co&#8208;catalysts. Our work offers valuable insights for future design of electromagnetically hot plasmonic catalysts to achieve efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical transformations in diverse energy, chemical, and environmental applications.

         <title>Connections to the Electrodes Control the Transport Mechanism in Single&#8208;Molecule Transistors</title>

The electron&#8208;transport mechanism in a single&#8208;molecule transistor can be changed from &#8216;particle&#8208;like hopping&#8217; to &#8216;wave&#8208;like&#8217; by changing the chemical structure of the molecule&#8211;electrode interface.







Abstract
When designing a molecular electronic device for a specific function, it is necessary to control whether the charge&#8208;transport mechanism is phase&#8208;coherent transmission or particle&#8208;like hopping. Here we report a systematic study of charge transport through single zinc&#8208;porphyrin molecules embedded in graphene nanogaps to form transistors, and show that the transport mechanism depends on the chemistry of the molecule&#8211;electrode interfaces. We show that van der Waals interactions between molecular anchoring groups and graphene yield transport characteristic of Coulomb blockade with incoherent sequential hopping, whereas covalent molecule&#8211;electrode amide bonds give intermediately or strongly coupled single&#8208;molecule devices that display coherent transmission. These findings demonstrate the importance of interfacial engineering in molecular electronic circuits.

         <title>The Ferroxidase Centre of Escherichia coli Bacterioferritin Plays a Key Role in the Reductive Mobilisation of the Mineral Iron Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diiron ferroxidase centres of ferritins are required for Fe2+ oxidation and formation of the mineral core. Here, we show that the ferroxidase centres of bacterioferritin (Bfr) also play a key role in iron release, and that this is dependent on electron transfer from the Bfr heme to the ferroxidase centre.







Abstract
Ferritins are multimeric cage&#8208;forming proteins that play a crucial role in cellular iron homeostasis. All H&#8208;chain&#8208;type ferritins harbour a diiron site, the ferroxidase centre, at the centre of a 4 &#945;&#8208;helical bundle, but bacterioferritins are unique in also binding 12&#8197;hemes per 24&#8197;meric assembly. The ferroxidase centre is known to be required for the rapid oxidation of Fe2+ during deposition of an immobilised ferric mineral core within the protein's hollow interior. In contrast, the heme of bacterioferritin is required for the efficient reduction of the mineral core during iron release, but has little effect on the rate of either oxidation or mineralisation of iron. Thus, the current view is that these two cofactors function in iron uptake and release, respectively, with no functional overlap. However, rapid electron transfer between the heme and ferroxidase centre of bacterioferritin from Escherichia coli was recently demonstrated, suggesting that the two cofactors may be functionally connected. Here we report absorbance and (magnetic) circular dichroism spectroscopies, together with in vitro assays of iron&#8208;release kinetics, which demonstrate that the ferroxidase centre plays an important role in the reductive mobilisation of the bacterioferritin mineral core, which is dependent on the heme&#8208;ferroxidase centre electron transfer pathway.

All H-chain-type ferritins harbour a diiron site, the ferroxidase centre, at the centre of a 4 &#945;-helical bundle, but bacterioferritins are unique in also binding 12&#8197;hemes per 24&#8197;meric assembly. The ferroxidase centre is known to be required for the rapid oxidation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; during deposition of an immobilised ferric mineral core within the protein's hollow interior. In contrast, the heme of bacterioferritin is required for the efficient reduction of the mineral core during iron release, but has little effect on the rate of either oxidation or mineralisation of iron. Thus, the current view is that these two cofactors function in iron uptake and release, respectively, with no functional overlap. However, rapid electron transfer between the heme and ferroxidase centre of bacterioferritin from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was recently demonstrated, suggesting that the two cofactors may be functionally connected. Here we report absorbance and (magnetic) circular dichroism spectroscopies, together with in vitro assays of iron-release kinetics, which demonstrate that the ferroxidase centre plays an important role in the reductive mobilisation of the bacterioferritin mineral core, which is dependent on the heme-ferroxidase centre electron transfer pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208; and Stereoselective Glycomodification of Biomolecules through Carbohydrate&#8208;Promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycomodification strategy targeting N&#8208;terminal tryptophan of biomolecules was developed using C6&#8208;oxidized glycans through a carbohydrate&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, providing homogeneous glycoconjugates with stable linkages. This method features high efficiency, mild conditions, robustness, biocompatibility, and applicability to a wide range of substrates, including glycans, peptides, proteins, and living&#8208;cell surfaces.







Abstract
Carbohydrates play pivotal roles in an array of essential biological processes and are consequently involved in many diseases. To meet the needs of glycobiology research, chemical enzymatic and non&#8208;enzymatic methods have been developed to generate glycoconjugates with well&#8208;defined structures. Herein, harnessing the unique properties of C6&#8208;oxidized glycans, we report a straightforward and robust strategy for site&#8208; and stereoselective glycomodification of biomolecules with N&#8208;terminal tryptophan residues by a carbohydrate&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, which is not adapted to typical aldehyde substrates under biocompatible conditions. This method reliably delivers highly homogeneous glycoconjugates with stable linkages and thus has great potential for functional modulation of peptides and proteins in glycobiology research. Moreover, this reaction can be performed at the glycosites of glycopeptides, glycoproteins and living&#8208;cell surfaces in a site&#8208;specific manner. Control experiments indicated that the protected &#945;&#8208;O atom of aldehyde donors and free N&#8722;H bond of the tryptamine motif are crucial for this reaction. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that the reaction exhibited a first&#8208;order dependence on both tryptophan and glycan, and deprotonation/rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Robust, Ultrafast and Reversible Photoswitching in Bulk Polymers Enabled by Octupolar Molecule Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octupolar design paradigm is introduced to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, namely multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse Adducts (MOPSAs). Our design couples multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to overcome traditional solid&#8208;state photochromism limitations and attain robust ultrafast bidirectional photochromism in bulk polymers. This together with their high&#8208;yield and scalable synthesis and facile film processing enables versatile uses of MOPSAs as smart inks or labels for diverse applications.







Abstract
Improving the photoswitching rate and robustness of photochromic molecules in bulk solids is paramount for practical applications but remains an on&#8208;going challenge. Here, we introduce an octupolar design paradigm to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, namely multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse Adducts (MOPSAs) featuring a C3&#8208;symmetrical A3&#8208;(D&#8208;core) architecture with a dipolar donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) photochrome in each branch. Our design couples multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to enable robust ultrafast reversible photoswitching in bulk polymers. Specifically, the optimal MOPSA (4&#8197;wt&#8201;%) in commercial polyurethane films accomplishes nearly 100&#8201;% discoloration in 6&#8197;s under visible light with &#8764; 100&#8201;% thermal&#8208;recovery in 17.4&#8197;s at 60&#8201;&#176;C, while the acquired kinetics constants are 3&#8764;7&#8197;times that of dipolar DASA counterpart and 1&#8764;2&#8197;orders of magnitude higher than those of reported DASAs in polymers. Importantly, the MOPSA&#8208;doped polymer films sustain 500 discoloration/recovery cycles with slow degradation, superior to the existing DASAs in polymers (&#8804;30&#8197;cycles). We discover that multi&#8208;dipolar coupling in MOPSA enables enhanced polarization and electron delocalization, promoting the rate&#8208;determining thermal cyclization, while the branched and non&#8208;planar geometry of MOPSA induces large free volume to facilitate the isomerization. This design can be extended to develop spiropyran or azobenzene&#8208;based ultrafast photochromic films. The superior photoswitching performance of MOPSAs together with their high&#8208;yield and scalable synthesis and facile film processing inspires us to explore their versatile uses as smart inks or labels for time&#8208;temperature indicators, optical logic encryption and multi&#8208;levelled data encryption.

         <title>Peptide Stapling by Crosslinking Two Amines with &#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes through Diverse Modified Glyoxal&#8208;Lysine Dimer Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly applicable and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by the crosslinking of two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents has been developed. Except for Cys, all unprotected proteinogenic amino acids are tolerated. The reactivity of Arg side chains can be effectively suppressed. The use of HFIP solvent is the key to achieving high reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes play versatile roles in the ubiquitous natural processes of protein glycation. However, leveraging the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes for biomedical applications has been challenging. Previously, the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes with guanidine has been harnessed to design probes for labeling Arg residues on proteins in an aqueous medium. Herein, a highly effective, broadly applicable, and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by crosslinking two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents is described. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent facilitates rapid and clean reactions under mild conditions and enables unique selectivity for Lys over Arg. The naturally occurring GOLD/MOLD linkers have been expanded to encompass a wide range of modified glyoxal&#8208;lysine dimer (OLD) linkers. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial, these modular stapling reactions enabled a convenient two&#8208;round strategy to streamline the structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) study of the wasp venom peptide anoplin, leading to enhanced biological activities.

         <title>Inside Cover: Significance of Vibronic Coupling that Shapes Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Double Helicenes (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 16/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of molecular vibrations on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in double helicenes DPC and DNH is reported by Tadashi Mori in a Research Article (e202319702).

         <dc:description>
An octupolar design paradigm is proposed to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, i.e., multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse adducts (MOPSAs), as reported by Dingshan Yu, Xudong Chen, Quan Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402349). Such unique design exploits multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to overcome traditional solid&#8208;state photochromism limitations and attain robust ultrafast bidirectional photochromism in bulk polymers for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Alkene Thianthrenation Unlocks Diverse Cation Synthons: Recent Progress and New Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of alkenes into thianthrene&#8208;derived cationic electrophiles unlocks a suite of net oxidative alkene transformations that have been elusive using conventional strategies. These linchpin intermediates can be generated selectively and undergo a diverse array of mechanistically distinct reactions with abundant nucleophiles.







Abstract
Oxidative alkene functionalization reactions are a fundamental class of complexity&#8208;building organic transformations. However, the majority of established approaches rely on electrophilic reagents that limit the diversity of groups that can be installed. Recent advances have established a new approach that instead relies on the transformation of alkenes into thianthrene&#8208;derived cationic electrophiles. These linchpin intermediates can be generated selectively and undergo a diverse array of mechanistically distinct reactions with abundant nucleophiles. Taken together, this unlocks a suite of net oxidative alkene transformations that have been elusive using conventional strategies. This Minireview describes these advances and is organized around the three distinct synthons formally accessible from alkenes via thianthrenation: 1) alkenyl cations; 2) vicinal dications; 3) allyl cations. Throughout the Minireview, we illustrate how thianthrenium salts address key limitations endemic to classic alkene&#8208;derived electrophiles and highlight the mechanistic origins of these distinctions wherever possible.

         <title>Decoding Nanomaterial&#8208;Biosystem Interactions through Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions are highly complex and influenced by numerous entangled factors. The emergence of machine learning has provided a timely and unique opportunity to revisit these interactions. This minireview highlights the development and use of machine learning to decode the interactions of nanomaterials with biosystems and provides some perspectives on the current challenges and potential opportunities in this field.







Abstract
The interactions between biosystems and nanomaterials regulate most of their theranostic and nanomedicine applications. These nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions are highly complex and influenced by a number of entangled factors, including but not limited to the physicochemical features of nanomaterials, the types and characteristics of the interacting biosystems, and the properties of the surrounding microenvironments. Over the years, different experimental approaches coupled with computational modeling have revealed important insights into these interactions, although many outstanding questions remain unanswered. The emergence of machine learning has provided a timely and unique opportunity to revisit nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions and to further push the boundary of this field. This minireview highlights the development and use of machine learning to decode nanomaterial&#8208;biosystem interactions and provides our perspectives on the current challenges and potential opportunities in this field.

         <title>Development of Better Aptamers: Structured Library Approaches, Selection Methods, and Chemical Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamers are highly structured, single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides that bind to specific targets with high affinity and selectivity. We provide a comprehensive overview of aptamer development strategies that can help facilitate their translation into real world applications, including discussions on how certain secondary structures can be used as scaffolds to build more potent aptamers for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has been used to discover thousands of aptamers since its development in 1990. Aptamers are short single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides capable of binding to targets with high specificity and selectivity through structural recognition. While aptamers offer advantages over other molecular recognition elements such as their ease of production, smaller size, extended shelf&#8208;life, and lower immunogenicity, they have yet to show significant success in real&#8208;world applications. By analyzing the importance of structured library designs, reviewing different SELEX methodologies, and the effects of chemical modifications, we provide a comprehensive overview on the production of aptamers for applications in drug delivery systems, therapeutics, diagnostics, and molecular imaging.

This article discusses recent advances in developing hybrid nanomaterials for biomedicine. We highlight features and opportunities enabled by material hybridization, including the capabilities of targeting, controlled release, multiplex assay, and multi&#8208;functionality, as well as biomanufacturing. Several examples are examined to highlight the opportunities and challenges in applying this class of materials to advance biomedicine.







Abstract
Hybrid nanomaterials have found use in many biomedical applications. This article provides a comprehensive review of the principles, techniques, and recent advancements in the design and fabrication of hybrid nanomaterials for biomedicine. We begin with an introduction to the general concept of material hybridization, followed by a discussion of how this approach leads to materials with additional functionality and enhanced performance. We then highlight hybrid nanomaterials in the forms of nanostructures, nanocomposites, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and biohybrids, including their fabrication methods. We also showcase the use of hybrid nanomaterials to advance biomedical engineering in the context of nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, diagnostics, theranostics, and biomanufacturing. Finally, we offer perspectives on challenges and opportunities.

         <title>Review and Theoretical Analysis of Fluorinated Radicals in Direct CAr&#8722;H Functionalization of (Hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct installation of fluorinated motifs onto (hetero)arenes has seen widespread application in recent years. A general strategy relies on the generation of fluorinated radicals from Functional Group Transfer Reagents. This Review highlights recent contributions in this field while discussing mechanisms and providing key DFT&#8208;based parameters and a computed reactivity scale to enhance the understanding of the chemical behaviour of these radicals.







Abstract
We highlight key contributions in the field of direct radical CAr&#8722; H (hetero)aromatic functionalization involving fluorinated radicals. A compilation of Functional Group Transfer Reagents and their diverse activation mechanisms leading to the release of radicals are discussed. The substrate scope for each radical is analyzed and classified into three categories according to the electronic properties of the substrates. Density functional theory computational analysis provides insights into the chemical reactivity of several fluorinated radicals through their electrophilicity and nucleophilicity parameters. Theoretical analysis of their reduction potentials also highlights the remarkable correlation between electrophilicity and oxidizing ability. It is also established that highly fluorinated radicals (e.g. &#8901;OCF3) are capable of engaging in single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes rather than radical addition, which is in good agreement with experimental literature data. A reactivity scale, based on activation barrier of addition of these radicals to benzene is also elaborated using the high accuracy DLPNO&#8208;(U)CCSD(T) method.

         <title>Orthogonal sp3&#8208;Ge/B Bimetallic Modules: Enantioselective Construction and Enantiospecific Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acquisition of chiral sp3&#8208;Ge reagents for use in stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling represents a significant challenge. Herein, unprecedented enantioenriched sp3&#8208;Ge/B bimetallic modules were achieved through enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration, and chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling of secondary alkyl&#8208;Ge was realized in a stereospecific manner with Bpin perfectly preserved. The synthetic value of these modules highlighted the significance of Ge/B bimetallic orthogonal strategy.







Abstract
In this study, a series of enantioenriched sp3&#8208;Ge/B bimetallic modules were successfully synthesized via an enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of carbagermatrane (Ge)&#8208;containing alkenes. Orthogonal cross&#8208;coupling selectivity under different Pd&#8208;catalyzed conditions was achieved in an enantiospecific manner. Notably, the chiral secondary Ge exhibited a remarkable transmetallation ability prior to primary or secondary Bpin. The effectiveness of this Ge/B bimetallic strategy was further demonstrated through the development of new functional small molecules with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) and Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) performance. This represents the first successful example of synthesis of enantioenriched alkylgermanium reagents that permit enantiospecific cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Atom Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneer the use of real&#8208;time electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrochemical processes at individual single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with single photon sensitivity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), distinguished by their maximum atom efficiency and precise control over the coordination and electronic properties of individual atoms, show great promise in electrocatalysis. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical performance of SACs requires the screening of electron transfer process at micro/nano scale. This research pioneers the use of electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrocatalytic reactions at individual SACs. It boasts sensitivity at the single photon level and temporal resolution down to 100&#8197;ms, enabling real&#8208;time capture of the electrochemical behavior of individual SACs during potential sweeping. Leveraging the direct correlation between ECL emission and heterogeneous electron transfer processes, we introduced photon flux density for quantitative analysis, unveiling the electrocatalytic efficiency of individual SACs. This approach systematically reveals the relationship between SACs based on different metal atoms and their peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity. The outcomes contribute to a fundamental understanding of SACs and pave the way for designing SACs with diverse technological and industrial applications.

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Disila&#8208;carbocycles via Highly Selective C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;Si Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed the intermolecular &#963;&#8208;bond exchange reaction of two different C&#8722;Si bonds with high cross&#8208;redistribution selectivity, which serves as a ring expansion protocol to assemble diverse disila&#8208;carbocycles. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the presence of hydrogen on silicon of silacyclobutanes and the high ring strain for both of two substrates are critical to ensure the desired reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Herein, we successfully inhibited the preferential homodimerization and C&#8722;Si/Si&#8722;H bond cross&#8208;exchange of benzosilacyclobutenes and monohydro&#8208;silacyclobutanes and achieved the first highly selective C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;Si bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction by deliberately tuning the Ni&#8208;catalytic system, which constitutes a powerful and atom&#8208;economical ring expansion method for preparing medium&#8208;sized cyclic compounds bearing two silicon atoms at the ring junction, which are otherwise inaccessible. The DFT calculation explicitly elucidated the pivotal role of Si&#8722;H bond at silacyclobutanes and the high ring strain of two substrates in realizing the two C&#8722;Si bonds cleavage and reformation in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Lattice Strained Induced Spin Regulation in Co&#8722;N/S Coordination&#8208;Framework Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

The microenvironment in Co coordination polymers is regulated by compressive lattice strain to change the spin charge densities around S atoms, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with *OOH intermediates to promote the ORR performance.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the bottleneck of metal&#8208;air batteries and fuel cells.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the bottleneck of metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Strain regulation can change the geometry and adjust the surface charge distribution of catalysts, which is a powerful strategy to optimize the ORR activity. The introduction of controlled strain to the material is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we present a temperature-pressure-induced strategy to achieve the controlled lattice strain for metal coordination polymers. Through the systematic study of the strain effect on ORR performance, the relationship between geometric and electronic effects is further understood and confirmed. The strained Co-DABDT (DABDT=2,5-diaminobenzene-1,4-dithiol) with 2&#8201;% lattice compression exhibits a superior half-wave potential of 0.81&#8197;V. Theoretical analysis reveals that the lattice strain changes spin-charge densities around S atoms for Co-DABDT, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with intermediates to promote the ORR catalytic process. This work helps to understand the catalytic mechanism from the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

C&#8722;C linked glutarimide&#8208;containing structures with direct utility in the preparation of cereblon&#8208;based degraders (PROTACs, CELMoDs) can be assessed in a single step from inexpensive, commercial &#945;&#8208;bromoglutaramide through a unique Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid assisted Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic approach. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups that are historically problematic and can be applied to the simplified synthesis of dozens of known compounds that have only been procured through laborious, wasteful, multi&#8208;step sequences. The reaction is scalable in both batch and flow and features a trivial procedure wherein the most time&#8208;consuming aspect of reaction setup is weighing out the starting materials.

Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity. Herein we reported the complemental character of hypervalent bromines, as aryne precursors and their behavior under transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions to furnish both ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.







Abstract
Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity while using identical coupling partners. We have developed a new approach for regiodivergent synthesis using the dual character of hypervalent bromines. In addition to the recently reported reactivity of hypervalent bromines as aryne precursors, the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported. Accordingly, the development of these two complementary transformations allows for the alteration of regioselectivity to furnish both ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.

         <title>Phosphate Coordination to Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Secondary Building Units Prolongs Drug Retention for Synergistic Chemoradiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) to a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) prolongs its intratumoral retention and allows its continuous release for effective localized chemotherapy. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, GMP&#8208;loaded MOL (GMP/MOL) significantly outperforms free GMP and provides synergistic, potent chemoradiotherapy without causing side effects.







Abstract
Chemoradiotherapy combines radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy to potentiate antitumor activity but exacerbates toxicities and causes debilitating side effects in cancer patients. Herein, we report the use of a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) as a 2D nanoradiosensitizer and a reservoir for the slow release of chemotherapeutics to amplify the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Coordination of phosphate&#8208;containing drugs to MOL secondary building units prolongs their intratumoral retention, allowing for continuous release of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) for effective localized chemotherapy. In the meantime, the MOL sensitizes cancer cells to X&#8208;ray irradiation and provides potent radiotherapeutic effects. GMP&#8208;loaded MOL (GMP/MOL) enhances cytotoxicity by 2&#8208;fold and improves radiotherapeutic effects over free GMP in vitro. In a colon cancer model, GMP/MOL retains GMP in tumors for more than four days and, when combined with low&#8208;dose radiotherapy, inhibits tumor growth by 98&#8201;%. The synergistic chemoradiotherapy enabled by GMP/MOL shows a cure rate of 50&#8201;%, improves survival, and ameliorates cancer&#8208;proliferation histological biomarkers.

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;Boosted Active Hydrogen on Copper for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the severe accumulation of nitrite during nitrate reduction on Cu, S&#8208;doped Cu nanorod arrays (Cu&#8722;S NAs) were designed via an electrochemical conversion strategy. The high FE of ammonia (98.3&#8201;%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (1.4&#8201;%) can be achieved on Cu&#8722;S NAs. The introduction of S can significantly decrease the energy barrier of H2O dissociation to *H, leading to a favorable hydrogenation of *NO2 and enhanced nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia selectivity.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia is a promising approach in term of pollutant appreciation. Cu&#8208;based catalysts performs a leading&#8208;edge advantage for nitrate reduction due to its favorable adsorption with *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surface is difficult and insufficient, leading to the significant generation of by&#8208;product NO2&#8722;. Herein, sulphur doped Cu (Cu&#8722;S) is prepared via an electrochemical conversion strategy and used for nitrate electroreduction. The high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia (~98.3&#8201;%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (~1.4&#8201;%) are achieved on Cu&#8722;S, obviously superior to its counterpart of Cu (FENH3: 70.4&#8201;%, FENO2&#8722;: 18.8&#8201;%). Electrochemical in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that a small amount of S doping on Cu surface can promote the kinetics of H2O dissociation to active hydrogen. The optimized hydrogen affinity validly decreases the hydrogenation kinetic energy barrier of *NO2, leading to an enhanced NH3 selectivity.

         <title>A Platform Approach to Cleavable Macrocycles for the Controlled Disassembly of Mechanically Caged Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanical lock with many keys. We show that a single macrocyclic precursor can be converted to self&#8208;immolative macrocycles that open in response to enzymatic, chemical, or photochemical stimuli. Rotaxanes and catenanes based on these rings can be triggered to release their interlocked partner. This simple macrocycle platform can be used to accelerate the development of mechanically caged molecules.







Abstract
Inspired by interlocked oligonucleotides, peptides and knotted proteins, synthetic systems where a macrocycle cages a bioactive species that is &#8220;switched on&#8221; by breaking the mechanical bond have been reported. However, to date, each example uses a bespoke chemical design. Here we present a platform approach to mechanically caged structures wherein a single macrocycle precursor is diversified at a late stage to include a range of trigger units that control ring opening in response to enzymatic, chemical, or photochemical stimuli. We also demonstrate that our approach is applicable to other classes of macrocycles suitable for rotaxane and catenane formation.

         <title>Amperometry and Electron Microscopy show Stress Granules Induce Homotypic Fusion of Catecholamine Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC) reveals larger molecule number and slower dynamics of vesicles opening after vesicles are treated with stress granules (SGs), implying homotypic fusion between vesicles, confirmed by observation of multi&#8208;core vesicles with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This finding provides new insights into how neural cells regulate exocytosis under oxidative stress and how SGs promote neurodegeneration.







Abstract
An overreactive stress granule (SG) pathway and long&#8208;lived, stable SGs formation are thought to participate in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). To understand if and how SGs contribute to disorders of neurotransmitter release in NDs, we examined the interaction between extracellular isolated SGs and vesicles. Amperometry shows that the vesicular content increases and dynamics of vesicle opening slow down after vesicles are treated with SGs, suggesting larger vesicles are formed. Data from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) clearly shows that a portion of large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs) with double/multiple cores appear, thus confirming that SGs induce homotypic fusion between LDCVs. This might be a protective step to help cells to survive following high oxidative stress. A hypothetical mechanism is proposed whereby enriched mRNA or protein in the shell of SGs is likely to bind intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) regions of vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) driving a disrupted membrane between two closely buddled vesicles to fuse with each other to form double&#8208;core vesicles. Our results show that SGs induce homotypic fusion of LDCVs, providing better understanding of how SGs intervene in pathological processes and opening a new direction to investigations of SGs involved neurodegenerative disease.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Li2O2 Growth in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries through Regulating Oxygen Reduction Kinetics with Photo&#8208;Assisted Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept on matching ORR kinetics with Li+ migration has been proposed in this work, which provides us an in&#8208;depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for future battery design.







Abstract
Widely acknowledged that the capacity of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) should be strongly determined by growth behaviors of the discharge product of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) that follows both coexisting surface and solution pathways. However until now, it remains still challenging to achieve dynamic modulation on Li2O2 morphologies. Herein, the photo&#8208;responsive Au nanoparticles (NPs) supported on reduced oxide graphene (Au/rGO) have been utilized as cathode to manipulate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics by aid of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects. Thus, we can experimentally reveal the importance of matching ORR kinetics with Li+ migration towards battery performance. Moreover, it is found that Li+ concentration polarization caused &#8220;sudden death&#8221; of LOBs is supposed to be just a form of suspended animation that could timely recover under irradiation. This work provides us an in&#8208;depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for the future battery design.

Abstract
We report the triply selective and sequential diversification of a single Csp3 carbon carrying Cl, Bpin and GeEt3 for the modular and programmable construction of sp3&#8208;rich molecules. Various functionalizations of Csp3&#8722;Cl and Csp3&#8722;BPin (e.g. alkylation, arylation, homologation, amination, hydroxylation) were tolerated by the Csp3&#8722;GeEt3 group. Moreover, the methodological repertoire of alkyl germane functionalization was significantly expanded beyond the hitherto known Giese addition and arylation to alkynylation, alkenylation, cyanation, halogenation, azidation, C&#8722;S bond formation as well as the first demonstration of stereo&#8208;selective functionalization of a Csp3&#8208;[Ge] bond.

         <title>Double 1,2&#8208;Carbon Migration at Mixed Heavier Sn=Ge Vinylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double 1,2&#8208;carbon migration enables the isomerization of the stannagermenylidene to the germastannenylidene. Theoretical studies reveal that the isomerization process involves stepwise carboranyl group and aryl group migration. The reactivity studies demonstrate that the stannagermenylidene undergoes intriguing electron redistribution to give the germylone&#8208;stannylene adduct upon treatment with IMe4 and readily reacts with (AlCp*)4 to give the unique heteronuclear aluminyl stannagermyne.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;migration is one recurring isomerization reaction in organic chemistry. In contrast, double 1,2&#8208;migration remains rare and limited to transition&#8208;metal complexes. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of mixed heavier Sn=Ge vinylidenes. Double 1,2&#8208;carbon migration enables the isomerization of the stannagermenylidene (3) to the germastannenylidene (4). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and DFT calculations revealed that 3 and 4 feature a Sn=Ge double bond. The reaction of 3 with IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) results in the electron redistribution in the Sn=Ge core to give the germylone&#8208;stannylene adduct (5). Moreover, treatment of 3 with 0.25&#8197;equiv. of (AlCp*)4 produces the heteronuclear aluminyl stannagermyne (6).

         <title>Topologically Tunable Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Modulating Conductivity and Chemiresistive Properties for NH3 Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) are formed by incorporating electron&#8208;donating fused thiophene rings into their frameworks and extending their &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. The conductivity can be modulated by adjusting the solvent system, thus regulating the dimensions and topologies of the cMOFs. 1D Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 can be easily processed into thin membranes. The 2D kgm&#8208;Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 has an excellent response toward NH3 at room temperature.







Abstract
Electrically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) have garnered significant attention in materials science due to their potential applications in modern electrical devices. However, achieving effective modulation of their conductivity has proven to be a major challenge. In this study, we have successfully prepared cMOFs with high conductivity by incorporating electron&#8208;donating fused thiophen rings in the frameworks and extending their &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems through ring&#8208;closing reactions. The conductivity of cMOFs can be precisely modulated ranging from 10&#8722;3 to 102&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 by regulating their dimensions and topologies. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent tunable electrical properties based on topology, we successfully demonstrated the potential of these materials as chemiresistive gas sensors with an outstanding response toward 100&#8197;ppm NH3 at room temperature. This work not only provides valuable insights into the design of functional cMOFs with different topologies but also enriches the cMOF family with exceptional conductivity properties.

         <title>A Novel Homoconjugated Propellane Triimide: Synthesis, Structural Analyses, and Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 16, April 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel homoconjugated propellane comprising three imide groups embedded on a trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane, has been synthesized and characterized. This rigid propellane triimide is featured with large bathochromic shift, intense luminescence, amplified molar absorptivity, and lower reduction potential relative to the subunits. The propellane triimide readily crystallizes into porous 3D superstructure, which is promising for C2H6/C2H4 separation.







Abstract
Rigid three&#8208;dimensional (3D) polycyclic propellanes have garnered interest due to their unique conformational spaces, which display great potential use in selectivity, separation and as models to study through&#8208;space electronic interactions. Herein we report the synthesis of a novel rigid propellane, trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane triimide, which comprises three imide groups embedded on a trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane. This propellane triimide exhibits large bathochromic shift, amplified molar absorptivity, enhanced fluorescence, and lower reduction potential when compared to the subunits. Computational and experimental studies reveal that the effective through&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;orbitals interacting (homoconjugation) occurs between the subunits. Single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis reveals that the propellane triimide has a highly quasi&#8208;D3h symmetric skeleton and readily crystallizes into different superstructures by changing alkyl chains at the imide positions. In particular, the porous 3D superstructure with S&#8208;shaped channels is promising for taking up ethane (C2H6) with very good selectivity over ethylene (C2H4), which can purify C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 in a single separation step. This work showcases a new class of rare 3D polycyclic propellane with intriguing electronic and supramolecular properties.

         <title>Synthesis of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Nanosheets with Tunable Silanol Nest Contents across an Ultra&#8208;wide pH Range and Their Catalytic Validation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolite synthesis under acidic conditions has always presented a challenge. In this study, we successfully prepared series of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanosheets (Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X) over a broad pH range (4 to 13) without the need for additional supplements. This achievement was realized through aggregation crystallization of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite subcrystal (Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC) with highly short&#8208;range ordering and ultrasmall size extracted from the synthetic system of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Furthermore, the crystallization behavior of Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC was investigated, revealing its non&#8208;classical crystallization process under mildly alkaline and acidic conditions (pH &lt; 10), and the combination of classical and non&#8208;classical processes under strongly alkaline conditions (pH &#8805; 10). What's particularly intriguing is that, the silanol nest content in the resultant Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X samples appears to be dependent on the pH values during the Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC crystallization process rather than its crystallinity. Finally, the results of the furfuryl alcohol etherification reaction demonstrate that reducing the concentration of silanol nests significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X zeolite. The ability to synthesize zeolite in neutral and acidic environments without the additional mineralizing agents not only broadens the current view of traditional zeolite synthesis but also provides a new approach to control the silanol nest content of zeolite catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiopure Corral[4]BINOLs as Ultrastrong Receptors for Recognition and Differential Sensing of Steroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise recognition and sensing of steroids, a type of vital biomolecules, hold immense practical value across various domains. In this study, we introduced corral[4]BINOLs (C[4]BINOLs), a pair of enantiomeric conjugated deep&#8208;cavity hosts, as novel synthetic receptors for binding steroids. Due to the strong hydrophobic effect of their deep nonpolar, chiral cavities, the two enantiomers of C[4]BINOLs demonstrated exceptionally high recognition affinities (up to 1012 M&#8722;1) for 16 important steroidal compounds as well as good enantioselectiviy (up to 15.5) in aqueous solutions, establishing them as the most potent known steroid receptors. Harnessing their ultrahigh affinity, remarkable enantioselectivity, and fluorescence emission properties, the two C[4]BINOL enantiomers were employed to compose a fluorescent sensor array which achieved discrimination and sensing of 16 structurally similar steroids at low concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Tensile Strain&#8208;Mediated Bimetallene Nanozyme for Enhanced Photothermal Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes have demonstrated significant potential in combating malignant tumor proliferation through catalytic therapy. However, the therapeutic effect is often limited by insufficient catalytic performance. In this study, we propose the utilization of strain engineering in metallenes to fully expose the active regions due to their ultrathin nature. Here, we present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Through geometric phase analysis, electron diffraction profile, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, it is revealed that crystalline&#8211;amorphous heterophase boundaries can generate approximately 2% tensile strain in the bimetallene. The ultrathin structure and in&#8208;plane strain of the bimetallene induce an amplified strain effect. Both experimental and theoretical evidence support the notion that tensile strain promotes multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;sorting of Interfacial Compatibility in MOF&#8208;based Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have shown great promises to overcome the performance upper limit of polymeric membranes for various gas separation processes. However, the gas separation properties of the MMMs largely depend on the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility which is a metric difficult to quantify. In most cases, whether a MOF filler and a polymer matrix make a good pair is not revealed until the gas transport experiments are performed. This is because there is a lack of characterization techniques to directly probe the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility. In this work, we demonstrate a self&#8208;sorting method to rank the interface compatibility among several MOF&#8208;polymer pairs. By mixing one MOF with two polymers in an MMM, the demixing of two polymers will form two polymer domains. The MOF particles will preferably partition into the &#8220;preferred&#8221; polymer domain due to their higher interfacial affinity. By scanning different polymer pairs, a rank of MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility from high to low can be obtained. Moreover, based on this ranking, it was also found that a highly compatible MOF&#8208;polymer pair suggested by this method also corresponds to a more predictable MMM gas separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Approach Toward the C4&#8208;Selective Amination of Pyridines via Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarenes is highly desirable in streamlined synthesis. In this context, direct amination of pyridines stands as an important synthetic methodology, with particular emphasis on accessing 4&#8208;aminopyridines, a versatile pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a reaction manifold for the C4&#8208;selective amination of pyridines by employing nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (SNH). Through 4&#8208;pyridyl pyridinium salt intermediates, 4&#8208;aminopyridine products are obtained in reaction with aqueous ammonia without intermediate isolation. The notable regioselectivity was achieved by the electronic tuning of the external pyridine reagents along with maximization of polarizability in the proton elimination stage. Further mechanistic investigations provided a guiding principle for the selective C&#8211;H pyridination of additional N&#8208;heteroarenes, presenting a strategic avenue for installation of diverse functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Boryl Radical as a Catalyst in Enabling Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cascade Radical Cyclization Reactions: Construction of Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cascade radical cyclization constitutes an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route for rapid assembly of polycyclic molecular skeletons. Although an array of redox&#8208;active metal catalysts has recently shown robust applications in enabling various catalytic cascade radical processes, the use of free organic radical as the catalyst, which is capable of triggering strategically distinct cascades, has rarely been developed. Here, we disclosed that the benzimidazolium&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical is capable of catalyzing cascade cyclization reactions in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular pathways, assembling [5,5] fused bicyclic and [6,6,6] fused tricyclic molecules, respectively. The catalytic reactions start with the chemo&#8208; and regioselective addition of the boryl radical catalyst to a tethered alkene or alkyne moiety, followed by either an intramolecular formal [3+2] or an intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition process to construct bicyclo[3.3.0]octane or tetrahydrophenanthridine skeletons, respectively. Eventually, a &#946;&#8208;elimination occurs to release the boryl radical catalyst, completing a catalytic cycle. High to excellent diastereoselectivity is achieved in both catalytic reactions under substrate control.</dc:description>

         <title>Oversaturating Liquid Interfaces with Nanoparticle&#8208;Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Assemblies of nanoparticles at liquid interfaces hold promise as dynamic &#8220;active&#8221; systems when there are convenient methods to drive the system out of equilibrium via crowding. To this end, we show that oversaturated assemblies of charged nanoparticles can be realized and held in that state with an external electric field. Upon removal of the field, strong interparticle repulsive forces cause a high in&#8208;plane electrostatic pressure that is released in an explosive emulsification. We quantify the packing of the assembly as it is driven into the oversaturated state under an applied electric field. Physiochemical conditions substantially affect the intensity of the induced explosive emulsification, underscoring the crucial role of interparticle electrostatic repulsion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled modulation of electronic and magnetic properties in stimuli&#8208;responsive materials provides valuable insights for the design of magnetoelectric or multiferroic devices. This paper demonstrates the modulation of electrical and magnetic properties of a semiconductive, paramagnetic metal&#8722;organic framework Cu3(C6O6)2 with small gaseous molecules, NH3, H2S, and NO. This study merges chemiresistive and magnetic tests to reveal that the MOF undergoes simultaneous changes in electrical conductance and magnetization that are uniquely modulated by each gas. The features of response, including direction, magnitude, and kinetics, are modulated by the physicochemical properties of the gaseous molecules. This study advances the design of multifunctional materials capable of undergoing simultaneous changes in electrical and magnetic properties in response to chemical stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Beyond 900 nm from Stable Radicals in Nonconjugated Poly(diphenylmethane)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic radicals with narrow energy gaps are highly sought&#8208;after for the production of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores. However, the current repertoire of developed organic radicals is notably limited, facing challenges related to stability and low fluorescence efficiency. This study addresses these limitations by achieving stable radicals in nonconjugated poly(diphenylmethane) (PDPM). Notably, PDPM exhibits a well&#8208;balanced structural flexibility and rigidity, resulting in a robust intra&#8208;/inter&#8208;chain through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC). The stable radicals within PDPM, coupled with strong TSC, yield a remarkable full&#8208;spectrum emission spanning from blue to NIR beyond 900 nm. This extensive tunability is achieved through careful adjustments of concentration and excitation wavelength. The findings highlight the efficacy of polymerization in stabilizing radicals and introduce a novel approach for developing nonconjugated NIR emitters based on triphenylmethane subunits.</dc:description>

         <title>Buffer Chain Model for Understanding Crystallization Competition in Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains challenging to comprehensively understand the packing models of conjugated polymers, in which side chains play extremely critical roles. The side chains are typically flexible and non&#8208;conductive and are widely used to improve the polymer solubility in organic solutions. Herein, a buffer chain model is proposed to describe link between conjugated backbone and side chains for understanding the relationship of crystallization competition of conductive conjugated backbones and non&#8208;conductive side chains. A longer buffer chain is beneficial for alleviating such crystallization competition and further promoting the spontaneous packing of conjugated backbones, resulting in enhanced charge transport properties. Our results provide a novel concept for designing conjugated polymers towards ordered organization and enhanced electronic properties and highlight the importance of balancing the competitive interactions between different parts of conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>&#173;Bottlebrush Networks: A Primer for Advanced Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottlebrush networks (BBNs) are an exciting new class of materials with interesting physical properties derived from their unique architecture. While great strides have been made in our fundamental understanding of bottlebrush polymers and networks, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary for the field to accelerate advancements. This perspective aims to act as a primer to BBN chemistry and physics for both new and current members of the community. In addition to providing an overview of contemporary BBN synthetic methods, we developed a workflow and desktop application (LengthScale), enabling bottlebrush physics to be more approachable. We conclude by addressing several topical issues and asking a series of pointed questions to stimulate conversation within the community.</dc:description>

         <title>CO intermediate&#8208;assisted dynamic Cu sintering during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on Cu&#8210;N&#8210;C catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to multicarbon products has been widely recognized for Cu&#8208;based catalysts. However, the structural changes in Cu&#8208;based catalysts during the eCO2RR pose challenges to achieving an in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8208;activity relationship, thereby limiting catalyst development. Herein, we employ constant&#8208;potential density functional theory calculations to investigate the sintering process of Cu single atoms of Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts into clusters under eCO2RR conditions. Systematic constant&#8208;potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the leaching of Cu&#8208;(CO)x moieties and subsequent agglomeration into clusters can be facilitated by synergistic adsorption of H and eCO2RR intermediates (e.g., CO). Increasing the Cu2+ concentration or the applied potential can efficiently suppress Cu sintering. Both microkinetic simulations and experimental results further confirm that sintered Cu clusters play a crucial role in generating C2 products. These findings provide significant insights into the dynamic evolution of Cu&#8208;based catalysts and the origin of their activity toward C2 products during the eCO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Nanometer&#8208;Sized Pt Catalysts with an Additional Photothermy Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise ~1&#8208;nm Pt nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) with ambient stability are important in fundamental research and exhibit diverse practical applications (catalysis, biomedicine, etc.). However, synthesizing such materials is challenging. Herein, by employing the  mixture ligand protecting strategy, we successfully synthesized the largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected (~1&#8208;nm) Pt23 NCs precisely characterized with mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Interestingly, natural population analysis and Bader charge calculation indicate an alternate, varying charge &#8208;layer distribution in the sandwich&#8208;like Pt23 NC kernel. Pt23 NCs can catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions without requiring calcination and other treatments, and the resulting specific and mass activities without further treatment are sevenfold and eightfold higher than those observed for commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Density functional theory and d&#8208;band center calculations interpret the high activity. Furthermore, Pt23 NCs exhibit a photothermal conversion efficiency of 68.4% under 532&#8208;nm laser irradiation and can be used at least for six cycles, thus demonstrating great potential for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered and Self&#8208;Recoverable Multimodal Force Sensors Based on Trap State and Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing that combines intensity, location, area and the like could gather a wealth of information from mechanical stimuli. Developing materials with force&#8208;induced optical and electrical dual responses would provide unique opportunities to multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing, with electrical signals quantifying the force amplitude and the luminescence output providing spatial distribution of force. However, the reliance on external power supply and high&#8208;energy excitation source brings significant challenges to the applicability of multi&#8208;dimensional force sensors. Here we reported the mechanical energy&#8208;driven and sunlight&#8208;activated materials with force&#8208;induced dual responses, and investigated the underlying mechanisms of self&#8208;sustainable force sensing. Theoretical analysis and experimental data unraveled that trap&#8208;controlled luminescence and interfacial electron transfer play a major role in force&#8208;induced optical and electrical output. These materials were manufactured into pressure sensor with renewable dual&#8208;mode output for quantifying and visualization of pressures by electrical and optical output, respectively, without power supply and high&#8208;energy irradiation. The quantification of tactile sensation and stimuli localization of mice highlighted the multi&#8208;dimensional sensing ability of the sensor. Overall, this self&#8208;powered pressure sensor with multimodal output provides more modalities of force sensing, poised to change the way that intelligent devices sense with the world.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Spin Gates of Transition Metal Oxides via Strain Stimuli to Augment Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are key in electrochemical energy storage, offering cost&#8208;effectiveness and a broad potential window. However, their full potential is limited by poor understanding of their slow reaction kinetics and stability issues. This study diverges from conventional complex nano&#8208;structuring, concentrating instead on spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions to enhance the reaction dynamics and stability of TMOs during energy storage processes. We successfully reconfigured the orbital degeneracy and spin&#8208;dependent electronic occupancy by disrupting the symmetry of magnetic cobalt (Co) sites through straightforward strain stimuli. The key to this approach lies in the unfilled Co 3d shell, which serves as a spin&#8208;dependent regulator for carrier transfer and orbital interactions within the reaction. We observed that the opening of these 'spin gates' occurs during a transition from a symmetric low&#8208;spin state to an asymmetric high&#8208;spin state, resulting in enhanced reaction kinetics and maintained structural stability. Specifically, the spin&#8208;rearranged Al&#8208;Co3O4 exhibited a specific capacitance of 1371 F g&#8208;1, which is 38% higher than that of unaltered Co3O4. These results not only shed light on the spin effects in magnetic TMOs but also establish a new paradigm for designing electrochemical energy storage materials with improved efficiency.</dc:description>

This study diverges from conventional complex nano-structuring, concentrating instead on spin-related charge transfer and orbital interactions to enhance the reaction dynamics and stability of TMOs during energy storage processes. We successfully reconfigured the orbital degeneracy and spin-dependent electronic occupancy by disrupting the symmetry of magnetic cobalt (Co) sites through straightforward strain stimuli. The key to this approach lies in the unfilled Co 3d shell, which serves as a spin-dependent regulator for carrier transfer and orbital interactions within the reaction. We observed that the opening of these 'spin gates' occurs during a transition from a symmetric low-spin state to an asymmetric high-spin state, resulting in enhanced reaction kinetics and maintained structural stability. Specifically, the spin-rearranged Al-Co3O4 exhibited a specific capacitance of 1371 F g-1, which is 38% higher than that of unaltered Co3O4. These results not only shed light on the spin effects in magnetic TMOs but also establish a new paradigm for designing electrochemical energy storage materials with improved efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Ultraselective and Highly Permeable Fully Aromatic Polyamide Nanofiltration Membranes for Antibiotic Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membranes are important in the pharmaceutical industry for the separation of antibiotics and salts. However, its widespread adoption has been hindered by limited control of the membrane microstructure (pore architecture and free&#8208;volume elements), separation threshold, scalability, and operational stability. In this study, 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;methanetetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) (MTLB) as prepared as a molecular building block for fabricating thin&#8208;film composite membranes (TFCMs) via interfacial polymerization. The relatively large molecular size and rigid molecular structure of MTLB, along with its non&#8208;coplanar and distorted conformation, produced thin and defect&#8208;free selective layers (~27 nm) with ideal microporosities for antibiotic desalination. These structural advantages yielded an unprecedented high performance with a water permeance of 45.2 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1 and efficient antibiotic desalination (NaCl/adriamycin selectivity of 422). We demonstrated the feasibility of the industrial scaling of the membrane into a spiral&#8208;wound module (with an effective area of 2.0 m2). This module exhibited long&#8208;term stability and performance that surpassed those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes used for antibiotic desalination. This study provides a scientific reference for the development of high&#8208;performance TFCMs for water purification and desalination in the pharmaceutical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>The Tandem Nitrate and CO2 Reduction for Urea Electrosynthesis: Role of Surface N&#8208;Intermediates in CO2 Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of CO2 and nitrate offers a promising avenue to produce valuable chemicals through the using of greenhouse gas and nitrogen&#8208;containing wastewater. However, the generally proposed reaction pathway of concurrent CO2 and nitrate reduction for urea synthesis requires the catalysts to be both efficient in both CO2 and nitrate reduction, thus narrowing the selection range of suitable catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct mechanism in urea synthesis, a tandem NO3&#8208; and CO2 reduction, in which the surface amino species generated by nitrate reduction play the role to capture free CO2 and subsequent initiate its activation. When using the TiO2 electrocatalyst derived from MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, it intrinsically exhibits low activity in aqueous CO2 reduction, however, in the presence of both nitrate and CO2, this catalyst achieves an excellent urea yield rate of 43.37 mmol&#65381;g&#8208;1&#65381;h&#8208;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 48.88% at &#8208;0.9 V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Even at a low CO2 level of 15%, the Faradaic efficiency of urea synthesis remains robust at 42.33%. The tandem reduction procedure was further confirmed by in&#8208;situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. This research provides new insights into the selection and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Computational Pipeline for Accurate Prioritization of Protein&#8208;Protein Binding Candidates in High&#8208;Throughput Protein Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IIdentifying the interactome for a protein of interest is challenging due to the large number of possible binders. High&#8208;throughput experimental approaches narrow down possible binding partners but often include false positives. Furthermore, they provide no information about what the binding region is (e.g., the binding epitope). We introduce a novel computational pipeline based on an AlphaFold2 (AF) Competition Binding Assay (AF&#8208;CBA) to identify proteins that bind a target of interest from a pull&#8208;down experiment and the binding epitope. Our focus is on proteins that bind the Extraterminal (ET) domain of Bromo and Extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, but we also introduce nine additional systems to show transferability to other peptide&#8208;protein systems. We describe a series of limitations to the methodology based on intrinsic deficiencies of AF and AF&#8208;CBA to help users identify scenarios where the approach will be most useful. Given the method's speed and accuracy, we anticipate its broad applicability to identify binding epitope regions among potential partners, setting the stage for experimental verification.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Synthesis of Organic Terminal 2D Ti3C2T x  MXene Nanosheets by Etching of Ti3AlC2 in an Organic Lewis Acid Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface and interface chemistry are critical for controlling the properties of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes). Numerous efforts have been devoted to the functionalization of MXenes with small inorganic ligands; however, few etching methods have been reported on the direct bonding of organic groups to MXene surfaces. In this work, we demonstrated an efficient and rapid strategy for the direct synthesis of 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with organic terminal groups in an organic Lewis acid (trifluoromethanesulfonic acid) solvent, without introducing additional intercalations. The dissolution of aluminum and the subsequent in&#8208;situ introduction of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid resulted in the extraction of Ti3C2Tx MXene (T = CF3SO3&#8722;) (denoted as CF3SO3H&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) flakes with sizes reaching 15 &#181;m and high productivity (over 70%) of monolayers or few layers. More importantly, the large CF3SO3H&#8208;Ti3C2TxMXene nanosheets had high colloidal stability, making them promising as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Preserving Mesoporosity in Type III Porous Liquids through Dual&#8208;layer Surface Weaving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fundamental limitation for pore preservation in a Type III porous liquid (T3PL) is the need for a small aperture from the porous filler to realize size exclusion of a bulky solvent. We present a dual&#8208;layer surface weaving strategy that can disregard this limitation and achieve micro&#8208; and mesoporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based T3PLs even with apertures much larger than the solvent molecules. By first weaving a tight network of poly(tert&#8208;butyl methacrylate) on the MOF surface, the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) solvent can be effectively excluded from the pores while smaller guest molecules such as CO2, C2H4, and H2O can freely access the interior, as confirmed by low&#8208;pressure adsorption isotherms. Further application of a PDMS&#8208;containing polymer coating helps lower the viscosity of the PL due to increased particle dispersibility. This strategy has resulted in the successful construction of T3PLs with aperture sizes up to 3.1 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Recycling Valuable Alkylbenzenes from Polystyrene through Methanol&#8208;Assisted Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast bulk of polystyrene (PS), a major type of plastic polymers,&#160;ends up in landfills, which takes up to thousands of years to decompose in nature. Chemical recycling promises to enable lower&#8208;energy pathways and minimal environmental impacts compared with traditional incineration and mechanical recycling. Herein, we demonstrated that methanol as a hydrogen supplier assisted the depolymerization&#160;of PS&#160;(denoted as PS&#8208;MAD) into alkylbenzenes&#160;over a heterogeneous catalyst composed of Ru nanoparticles on SiO2. PS&#8208;MAD achieved a high yield of liquid products which accounted for 93.2 wt% of virgin PS at 280 oC for 6 h&#160;with&#160;the production rate of 118.1 mmolcarbon&#160;gcatal.&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1. The major components were valuable alkylbenzenes (monocyclic aromatics and diphenyl alkanes), the sum of which occupied 84.3 wt% of liquid products. According to mechanistic studies,&#160;methanol decomposition dominates the hydrogen supply during PS&#8208;MAD, thereby restraining PS aromatization which generates&#160;by&#8208;products of fused polycyclic arenes and polyphenylenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Strategies to Diversification of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally ordered soft materials that respond to complementary stimuli are susceptible to control over their spatial and temporal morphostructural configurations via intersectional or combined effects such as gating, feedback, shape&#8208;memory, or programming. In absence of general and robust design and prediction strategies for their mechanical properties, at present, combined chemical and crystal engineering approaches could provide useful guidelines to identify effectors that determine both the magnitude and time of their response. Here, we capitalize on the purported ability of soft intermolecular interactions to instigate mechanical compliance by using halogenation to elicit both mechanical and photochemical activity of organic crystals. Starting from (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diphenylbut&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, whose crystals are brittle and photoinert, we use double and quadruple halogenation to introduce halogen&#8208;bonded planes that become interfaces for molecular gliding, rendering the material mechanically and photochemically plastic. Fluorination diversifies the mechanical effects further, and crystals of the tetrafluoro derivative are also elastic but also motile, displaying the rare photosalient effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive&#160;and Robust&#160;Vitrimers Fabricated by Synergy of Traditional and Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers offer a unique combination of mechanical performance, reprocessability, and recyclability that makes them highly promising for a wide range of applications. However, achieving dynamic behavior in vitrimeric materials at their intended usage temperatures, thus combining reprocessability with adaptivity through associative dynamic covalent bonds, represents an attractive but formidable objective. Herein, we couple boron&#8211;nitrogen&#160;(B&#8722;N) dative bonds and B&#8722;O covalent bonds to generate a new class of vitrimers, boron&#8211;nitrogen vitrimers (BNVs), to endow them with dynamic features at usage temperatures. Compared with boron&#8722;ester vitrimers (BEVs) without B&#8722;N dative bonds, the BNVs with B&#8722;N dative bonds showcase enhanced mechanical performance. The excellent mechanical properties come from the synergistic effect of the dative B&#8722;N supramolecular polymer and covalent boron&#8210;ester networks.&#160;Moreover, benefiting from the associative exchange of B&#8722;O dynamic covalent bonds above their topological freezing temperature (Tv), the resultant BNVs also possess the processability. This study leveraged the structural characteristics of a boron&#8208;based vitrimer to achieve material reinforcement and toughness enhancement, simultaneously providing novel design concepts for the construction of new vitrimeric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Transfer Dehydrogenation Method Enables a Family of High Crystalline Benzimidazole&#8208;linked Cu (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we proposed a transfer dehydrogenation method to prepare a novel series of imidazole&#8208;linked phthalocyanine Cu (II)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (BICuPc&#8208;COFs) films and powders. The high crystalline BICuPc&#8208;COFs films that possess intrinsic conductivity (0.022&#8211;0.218&#8197;S/m) were fabricated into synaptic devices, which have small source&#8208;drain voltage (VDS=1&#8197;V) and response light from visible to near&#8208;infrared.







Abstract
Heterocycle&#8208;linked phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs with close&#8208;packed &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated structures are a kind of material with intrinsic electrical conductivity, and they are considered to be candidates for photoelectrical devices. Previous studies have revealed their applications for energy storage, gas sensors, and field&#8208;effect transistors. However, their potential application in photodetector is still not fully studied. The main difficulty is preparing high&#8208;quality films. In our study, we found that our newly designed benzimidazole&#8208;linked Cu (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs (BICuPc&#8208;COFs) film can hardly formed with a regular aerobic oxidation method. Therefore, we developed a transfer dehydrogenation method with N&#8208;benzylideneaniline (BA) as a mild reagent. With this in hand, we successfully prepared a family of high crystalline BICuPc&#8208;COFs powders and films. Furthermore, both of these new BICuPc&#8208;COFs films showed high electrical conductivity (0.022&#8211;0.218&#8197;S/m), higher than most of the reported COFs materials. Due to the broad absorption and high conductivity of BICuPc&#8208;COFs, synaptic devices with small source&#8208;drain voltage (VDS=1&#8197;V) were fabricated with response light from visible to near&#8208;infrared. Based on these findings, we expect this study will provide a new perspective for the application of conducting heterocycle&#8208;linked COFs in synaptic devices.

         <title>Molecule and Microstructure Modulations of Cyano&#8208;Containing Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Fully Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule and microstructure modulations of cyano&#8208;containing electrodes craft a groundbreaking CNT@PFDCB with core&#8211;shell heterostructure, which breaks through the limitations of cyano&#8208;containing electrodes including inevitable self&#8208;dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. As a result, the novel CNT@PFDCB achieves high capacity, elevated voltage, superior rate ability, and exceptional cycling stability, standing out among the reported organic cathodes.







Abstract
Cyano&#8208;containing electrodes usually promise high theoretical potentials while suffering from uncontrollable self&#8208;dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, to remedy their limitations, an unprecedented core&#8211;shell heterostructured electrode of carbon nanotubes encapsulated in poly(1,4&#8208;dicyanoperfluorobenzene sulfide) (CNT@PFDCB) is rationally crafted via molecule and microstructure modulations. Specifically, the linkage of sulfide bridges of PFDCB prevents the active cyano groups from dissolving, resulting in a robust structure. The fluorinations modulate the electronic configurations in frontier orbitals, allowing higher electrical conductivity and elevated output voltage. Combined with the core&#8211;shell architecture to unlock the sluggish diffusion kinetics for both electrons and guest ions, the CNT@PFDCB exhibits an impressive capacity (203.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), remarkable rate ability (127.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and exceptional cycling stability (retaining 81.1&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Additionally, the Li&#8208;storage mechanisms regarding PFDCB are thoroughly revealed by in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations, which involve the coordination interaction between Li ions and cyano groups and the electron delocalization along the conjugated skeleton. More importantly, a practical fully organic cell based on the CNT@PFDCB is well&#8208;validated that demonstrates a tremendous potential of cyanopolymer as the cathode to replace its inorganic counterparts.

         <title>Copper Nanodrugs by Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several copper (Cu) complexes with anticancer activity were employed as catalysts for miniemulsion atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in aqueous medium, producing Cu&#8208;loaded nanodrugs with simple steps and precise physiochemical property. The product showed prolonged blood circulation&#160;and&#160;improved&#160;tumor accumulation,&#160;with&#160;superior anticancer efficacy compared&#160;to cisplatin, showing great potential for clinical transition.







Abstract
In this study, some copper catalysts used for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) were explored as efficient anti&#8208;tumor agents. The aqueous solution of copper&#8208;containing nanoparticles with uniform spheric morphology was in situ prepared through a copper&#8208;catalyzed activator generated by electron transfer (AGET) ATRP in water. Nanoparticles were then directly injected into tumor&#8208;bearing mice for antitumor chemotherapy. The copper nanodrugs had prolonged blood circulation time and enhanced accumulation at tumor sites, thus showing potent antitumor activity. This work provides a novel strategy for precise and large&#8208;scale preparation of copper nanodrugs with high antitumor activity.

         <title>Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock: A Rebuilding&#8208;free Electrochemical Chip with a Customizable Decoding Probe for Real&#8208;Time and Portable Pathogen Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop an electrochemical sensing strategy (Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock) and a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use multichannel instrument (BioAlex PHE&#8722;T) for portable isothermal amplification detection. Our method provides high sensitivity &amp; selectivity, signal&#8208;on response, &#8220;zero&#8221; background, one&#8208;pot operation and real&#8208;time signal collection.







Abstract
In order to realize portable pathogen diagnostics with easier quantitation, digitization and integration, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use electrochemical sensing strategy (Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock) for real&#8208;time detection of isothermal nucleic acid amplification. Bridged by a branched DNA as codelock, the isothermal amplicon is transduced into increased current of an electrochemical probe, holding multiple advantages of high sensitivity, high selectivity, signal&#8208;on response, &#8220;zero&#8221; background and one&#8208;pot operation. Through a self&#8208;designed portable instrument (BioAlex PHE&#8722;T), the detection can be implemented on a multichannel microchip and output real&#8208;time amplification curves just like an expensive commercial PCR machine. The microchip is a rebuilding&#8208;free and disposable component. The branch codelock probe can be customized for different targets and designs. Such high performance and flexibility have been demonstrated utilizing four virus (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, African swine fever, FluA and FluB) genes as targets, and two branch (3&#8208;way and 4&#8208;way) DNAs as codelock probes.

         <title>Abiotic Methane Production Driven by Ubiquitous Non&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Type Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We elucidate a ubiquitous yet previously unappreciated source of abiotic CH4 production via non&#8208;Fenton chemistry reactions, which not only substantially broadens CH4 production in complex natural environments, but also offers an innovative, simple and sustainable approach for engineering CH4 production as a high&#8208;value energy resources.







Abstract
Abiotic CH4 production driven by Fenton&#8208;type reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been confirmed to be an indispensable component of the atmospheric CH4 budget. While the chemical reactions independent of Fenton chemistry to ROS are ubiquitous in nature, it remains unknown whether the produced ROS can drive abiotic CH4 production. Here, we first demonstrated the abiotic CH4 production at the soil&#8208;water interface under illumination. Leveraging this finding, polymeric carbon nitrides (CNx) as a typical analogue of natural geobattery material and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a natural methyl donor were used to unravel the underlying mechanisms. We revealed that the ROS, photocatalytically produced by CNx, can oxidize DMSO into CH4 with a high selectivity of 91.5&#8201;%. Such an abiotic CH4 production process was further expanded to various non&#8208;Fenton&#8208;type reaction systems, such as electrocatalysis, pyrocatalysis and sonocatalysis. This work provides insights into the geochemical cycle of abiotic CH4, and offers a new route to CH4 production via integrated energy development.

         <title>A Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Elastomer Bearing Loop Structures with Dissipating Characteristics and Enhanced Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that a special loop structure of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 incorporated into the network enables substantial energy dissipation and exceptional elasticity, significantly enhancing mechanical performance, while the recognition of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and guest molecules, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts, significantly enhances the recovery performance of the material.







Abstract
Loops are prevalent topological structures in cross&#8208;linked polymer networks, resulting from the folding of polymer chains back onto themselves. Traditionally, they have been considered as defects that compromise the mechanical properties of the network, leading to extensive efforts in synthesis to prevent their formation. In this study, we introduce the inclusion of cyclic dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moieties within the polymer network strands to form CCNs, and surprisingly, these loops enhance the mechanical performances of the network, leading to tough elastomers. The toughening effect can be attributed to the unique cyclic structure of DB24C8. The relatively small size and the presence of rigid phenyl rings provide the loops with relatively stable conformations, allowing for substantial energy dissipation upon the application of force. Furthermore, the DB24C8 rings possess a broad range of potential conformations, imparting the materials with exceptional elasticity. The synergistic combination of these two features effectively toughens the materials, resulting in a remarkable 66&#8208;fold increase in toughness compared to the control sample of covalent networks. Moreover, the mechanical properties, particularly the recovery performance of the network, can be effectively tuned by introducing guests to bind with DB24C8, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts.

         <title>Universal Design and Efficient Synthesis for High Ambipolar Mobility Emissive Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a universal design principle and synthetic shortcut towards HAME&#8208;CPs are developed. A series of simple non&#8208;fused polymers composed of charge transfer units, &#960; bridges and emissive units are synthesized via a two&#8208;step microwave assisted C&#8722;H arylation and direct arylation polymerization protocol with high total yields up to 61&#8201;%. The synthetic protocol is verified valid among 7 monomers and 8 polymers. Most importantly, all 8 conjugated polymers have strong solid&#8208;state emission with high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 24&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4 polymers exhibit high ambipolar field effect mobility up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High ambipolar mobility emissive conjugated polymers (HAME&#8208;CPs) are perfect candidates for organic optoelectronic devices, such as polymer light emitting transistors. However, due to intrinsic trade&#8208;off relationship between high ambipolar mobility and strong solid&#8208;state luminescence, the development of HAME&#8208;CPs suffers from high structural and synthetic complexity. Herein, a universal design principle and simple synthetic approach for HAME&#8208;CPs are developed. A series of simple non&#8208;fused polymers composed of charge transfer units, &#960; bridges and emissive units are synthesized via a two&#8208;step microwave assisted C&#8722;H arylation and direct arylation polymerization protocol with high total yields up to 61&#8201;%. The synthetic protocol is verified valid among 7 monomers and 8 polymers. Most importantly, all 8 conjugated polymers have strong solid&#8208;state emission with high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 24&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4 polymers exhibit high ambipolar field effect mobility up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and can be used in multifunctional optoelectronic devices. This work opens a new avenue for developing HAME&#8208;CPs by efficient synthesis and rational design.

         <title>Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Bearing Quinuclidinium for High&#8208;performance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic ammonium molecule 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenyl quinuclidinium and a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with excellent alkaline stability were successfully developed. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based (PGM&#8208;free) anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs) with PAQ&#8208;5 achieved the highest current density (8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 2&#8197;V and the longest durability among all PGM&#8208;free AEM&#8208;WEs reported so far.







Abstract
Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are core components in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs). However, the stability of functional quaternary ammonium cations, especially under high temperatures and harsh alkaline conditions, seriously affects their performance and durability. Herein, we synthesized a 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenylquinuclidinium molecular building unit. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and accelerated aging analysis indicated that the quinine ring structure was exceedingly stable, and the SN2 degradation mechanism dominated. Through acid&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts polymerization, a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) AEMs with controllable molecular weight and adjustable ion exchange capacity (IEC) were prepared. The stable quinine structure in PAQ&#8208;x was verified and retained in the ex situ alkaline stability.

     alt="Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Bearing Quinuclidinium for High-performance Water Electrolysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cyclic ammonium molecule 1-methyl-3,3-diphenyl quinuclidinium and a series of branched poly(aryl-quinuclidinium) (PAQ-x) anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with excellent alkaline stability were successfully developed. Non-noble metal-based (PGM-free) anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM-WEs) with PAQ-5 achieved the highest current density (8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 2&#8197;V and the longest durability among all PGM-free AEM-WEs reported so far.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are core components in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM-WEs). However, the stability of functional quaternary ammonium cations, especially under high temperatures and harsh alkaline conditions, seriously affects their performance and durability. Herein, we synthesized a 1-methyl-3,3-diphenylquinuclidinium molecular building unit. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and accelerated aging analysis indicated that the quinine ring structure was exceedingly stable, and the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 degradation mechanism dominated. Through acid-catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts polymerization, a series of branched poly(aryl-quinuclidinium) (PAQ-x) AEMs with controllable molecular weight and adjustable ion exchange capacity (IEC) were prepared. The stable quinine structure in PAQ-x was verified and retained in the ex situ alkaline stability. Furthermore, the branched polymer structure reduces the swelling rate and water uptake to achieve a tradeoff between dimensional stability and ionic conductivity, significantly improving the membrane's overall performance. Importantly, PAQ-5 was used in non-noble metal-based AEM-WE, achieving a high current density of 8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2&#8197;V and excellent stability over 2446&#8197;h in a gradient constant current test. Based on the excellent alkaline stability of this diaryl-quinuclidinium group, it can be further considered as a multifunctional building unit to create multi-topological polymers for energy conversion devices used in alkaline environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rocking&#8208;Chair Aqueous Fluoride&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Hydrogen Bonding Competition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room temperature rocking&#8208;chair aqueous fluoride ion battery with the development of electrolytes with KOAc&#8208;KF binary salts is constructed, which exhibits concurrent fluorination or defluorination reactions occurring at both cathode and anode electrodes. Weakening of the F&#8722;&#8722;H2O hydrogen bonding by OAc&#8722; anion in the electrolyte is responsible for the optimized electrochemical process.







Abstract
Aqueous fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) have garnered attention for their high theoretical energy density, yet they are challenged by sluggish fluorination kinetics, active material dissolution, and electrolyte instability. Here, we present a room temperature rocking&#8208;chair aqueous FIBs featuring KOAc&#8208;KF binary salt electrolytes, enabling concurrent fluorination and defluorination reactions at both cathode and anode electrodes. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that acetate ions in the electrolyte compete with fluoride ions in hydrogen bonding formation, weakening the excessively strong solvation between H2O and F&#8722; ions. This results in the suppression of detrimental HF formation and a reduced desolvation energy of F&#8722; ions, enhancing the electrochemical reaction kinetics. The bismuth&#8208;based cathode exhibits direct conversion in the optimized electrolyte, effectively suppressing the detrimental disproportionation reactions from Bi2+ intermediates. Additionally, zinc anode undergoes a typical fluorination process, forming solid KZnF3 as the electrode product, minimizing the risks of hydrogen evolution. The proposed aqueous FIBs with the optimized electrolyte demonstrate high discharge capacity, long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate capabilities.

         <title>Dimethyl Carbonate Synthesis from CO2 over CeO2 with Electron&#8208;Enriched Lattice Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron enriched lattice oxygen species provided abundant base sites for CO2 adsorption and simultaneously facilitated the weakly absorbed methoxy formation, thus shifting the rate determining&#8208;step from *CH3OCOO formation to *CH3OCOO dissociation and lowering the energy barrier of dimethyl carbonate synthesis.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from CO2 plays an important role in carbon neutrality, but its efficiency is still far from the practical application, due to the limited understanding of the reaction mechanism and rational design of efficient catalyst. Herein, abundant electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen species were introduced into CeO2 catalyst by constructing the point defects and crystal&#8208;terminated phases in the crystal reconstruction process. Benefitting from the acid&#8208;base properties modulated by the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen, the optimized CeO2 catalyst exhibited a much higher DMC yield of 22.2 mmol g&#8208;1 than the reported metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based catalysts at the similar conditions. Mechanistic investigations illustrated that the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen can provide abundant sites for CO2 adsorption and activation, and was advantageous of the formation of the weakly adsorbed active methoxy species. These were facilitating to the coupling of methoxy and CO2 for the key *CH3OCOO intermediate formation. More importantly, the weakened adsorption of *CH3OCOO on the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen can switch the rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS) of DMC synthesis from *CH3OCOO formation to *CH3OCOO dissociation, and lower the corresponding activation barriers, thus giving rise to a high performance. This work provides insights into the underlying reaction mechanism for DMC synthesis from CO2 and methanol and the design of highly efficient catalysts.

         <title>Turning Non&#8208;Emissive Schiff Bases Into Aggregate Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cocrystallization&#8208;induced emission strategy to turn non&#8208;emissive Schiff bases into aggregate emitters has been realized. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.







Abstract
Schiff bases are a crucial component in various functional materials but often exhibit non&#8208;emissive behavior which significantly limits their potential applications as luminescent materials. However, traditional approaches to convert them into aggregate emitters often require intricate molecular design, tedious synthesis, and significant time and resource consumption. Herein, we present a cocrystallization&#8208;induced emission strategy that can transform non&#8208;emissive (hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted Schiff bases into green&#8208;yellow to yellow aggregate emitters via even simple grinding of a mixture of Schiff bases and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCB) mixtures. The combined experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that the cocrystallization inhibits the C=N isomerization and promotes face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, which restricts access to both the dark state and canonical intersection to ultimately induce emission. Furthermore, the induced emission enables the observation of solid&#8208;state molecular diffusion through fluorescence signals, advancing white light emission diodes, and notably, solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on cocrystal for the first time. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.

         <title>Programming of Supercrystals Using Replicable DNA&#8208;Functionalized Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile enthalpy&#8208;mediated strategy to control the replication and catalytic assembly of DNA&#8208;functionalized colloids in a time&#8208;dependent manner by integrating a template system containing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal seeds with a simplified DNA strand&#8208;displacement circuit programmed subsystem for producing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal copies.







Abstract
The development of self&#8208;replicating systems is of great importance in research on the origin of life. As the most iconic molecules, nucleic acids have provided prominent examples of the fabrication of self&#8208;replicating artificial nanostructures. However, it is still challenging to construct sophisticated synthetic systems that can create large&#8208;scale or three&#8208;dimensionally ordered nanomaterials using self&#8208;replicating nanostructures. By integrating a template system containing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal seeds with a simplified DNA strand&#8208;displacement circuit programmed subsystem to produce DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal copies, we developed a facile enthalpy&#8208;mediated strategy to control the replication and catalytic assembly of DNA&#8208;functionalized colloids in a time&#8208;dependent manner. The replication efficiency and crystal quality of the resulting superlattice structures can be effectively increased by regulating the molar ratio of the template to the copy colloids. By constructing binary systems from two types of gold nanoparticles (or proteins), superlattice structures with different crystal symmetries can be obtained through the replication and catalytic assembly processes. This programmable enthalpy&#8208;mediated approach was easily leveraged to achieve the phase transformation and catalytic amplification of colloidal crystals starting from different initial template crystals. This work offers a potential way to construct self&#8208;replicating artificial systems that exhibit complicated phase behaviors and can produce large&#8208;scale superlattice nanomaterials.

         <title>Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond&#8208;Forming for the Synthesis of Skipped Dienes with Synergistic Aminocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A synergistic catalytic strategy has addressed the great challenge in Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;C bond coupling. A variety of structurally diverse skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes are furnished in synthetically useful yields and good enantioselectivity. This strategy has also been applied for the total synthesis of the analogues of (&#8722;)&#8208;Blepharocalyxin D.







Abstract
Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions represent a great challenge in homogeneous catalysis primarily due to a limited understanding of its mechanistic principles. Herein, we have developed an interesting catalytic strategy that leverages a synergistic combination of a dimeric manganese(I) catalyst and a chiral aminocatalyst to address this issue. A range of conjugated dienals and trienals can exclusively proceed 1,4&#8208;hydroalkenylation by using readily available aromatic and aliphatic alkenyl boronic acids as coupling partners, producing a rich library of skipped diene aldehydes in synthetically useful yields and high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, downstream transformations of these products can not only afford a concise approach to construct enantioenriched skipped trienes but also realize enantioselective total synthesis of analogues to (&#8722;)&#8208;Blepharocalyxin D in four steps. DFT calculations suggest the 1,4&#8208;hydroalkenylation is kinetically more favorable than 1,6&#8208;hydroalkenylation.

         <title>N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Fluoroalkylation through Ligand Coupling Reaction of Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoroalkylated N&#8208;heteroarenes are efficiently synthesized from fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;azaheteroarylsulfones via Grignard reagent&#8208;promoted formal SO2 extrusion reaction. The reaction proceeds through the ligand coupling of a pentacoordinate sulfur(VI) intermediate and exhibits unique fluorine effect.







Abstract
Ligand coupling on hypervalent main group elements has emerged as a pivotal methodology for the synthesis of functionalized N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds in recent years due to the avoidance of transition metals and the mildness of the reaction conditions. In this direction, the reaction of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfur(IV) and N&#8208;heteroaryl phosphorus(V) compounds has been well studied. However, the ligand coupling of sulfur(VI) is still underdeveloped and the reaction of alkyl N&#8208;heteroarylsulfones is still elusive, which does not match the high status of sulfones as the chemical chameleons in organic synthesis. Here we present a ligand coupling&#8208;enabled formal SO2 extrusion of fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;azaheteroarylsulfones under the promotion of Grignard reagents, which not only enriches the chemistry of sulfones, but also provides a novel and practical synthetic tool towards N&#8208;heteroaromatic fluoroalkylation.

         <title>Dual Enhancement of Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Entropically Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropically driven self&#8208;assembled system based on a platinum complex displays a dual enhancement of phosphorescence and chiroptical response, both in the ground state and excited state (glum value increases from 0.04&#215;10&#8722;2 to 0.06), upon elevating the temperature of the supramolecular system. The strategy developed in this work overcomes the customary trade&#8208;off between QY and glum, a prevalent challenge in most CPL materials.







Abstract
Addressing the dual enhancement of circular polarization (glum) and luminescence quantum yield (QY) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) systems poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present an innovative strategy utilizing the entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes (L&#8722;Pt) with tetraethylene glycol chains, resulting in unique temperature dependencies. The entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of L&#8722;Pt leads to a synergistic improvement in phosphorescence emission efficiency (QY was amplified from 15&#8201;% at 25&#8201;&#176;C to 53&#8201;% at 60&#8201;&#176;C) and chirality, both in the ground state and the excited state (glum value has been magnified from 0.04&#215;10&#8722;2 to 0.06) with increasing temperature. Notably, we observed reversible modulation of phosphorescence and chirality observed over at least 10&#8197;cycles through successive heating and cooling, highlighting the intelligent control of luminescence and chiroptical properties by regulating intermolecular interactions among neighboring L&#8722;Pt molecules. Importantly, the QY and glum of the L&#8722;Pt assembly in solid state were measured as 69&#8201;% and 0.16 respectively, representing relatively high values compared to most self&#8208;assembled CPL systems. This study marks the pioneering demonstration of dual thermo&#8208;enhancement of phosphorescence and CPL and provides valuable insights into the thermal effects on high&#8208;temperature and switchable CPL materials.

         <title>How to Deal with Charge in the Ranking of Lewis Acidity: Critical Evaluation of an Extensive Set of Cationic Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge of a compound strongly influences the affinity towards anionic donors. Accordingly, comparing vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) for Lewis acids of varying charge states is of limited use. Here, the systematic evaluation of the FIA of &gt;700 literature&#8208;known cationic Lewis acids suggests how to tackle this charge problem and explores the influence of counteranions.







Abstract
The quantification of Lewis acidity is of fundamental and applied importance in chemistry. However, if neutral and charged Lewis acids are compared, a coherent ranking has been elusive, and severe uncertainties were accepted. With this study, we present a systematic computational analysis of Lewis base affinities of 784 mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tricationic Lewis acids and their comparison with 149 representative neutral Lewis acids. Evaluating vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) reveals a charge&#8208;caused clustering that prohibits any meaningful ranking. Instead, solvation&#8208;corrected FIAsolv is identified as a metric that overcomes charge sensitivity in a balanced manner, allowing for a coherent evaluation of Lewis acidity across varying charge states. Analyzing the impact of molecular volume on solvation&#8208;induced FIA damping provides rationales for fundamental trends and guidelines for the choice or design of neutral and cationic Lewis acids in the condensed phase. Exploring alternative scales, explicit counteranion effects, and selected experimental case studies reaffirms the advantages of solvation&#8208;corrected FIAsolv as the most versatile and practical approach for the quantitative ranking of general (thermodynamic) Lewis acidity.

         <title>Bridged Bicyclic Lactam Enables Chemically Recyclable Nylon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the ROP of bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), yielding chemically recyclable nylon with high molecular weight (up to 75.7&#8197;kDa) and impressive thermostability (up to 283&#8201;&#176;C). Notably, the 5/6&#8208;LM can be scaled to 50&#8197;g per batch in the lab, with the efficient recycling of the Pd/C catalyst and methanol over 8 cycles, highlighting the process&#8216;s efficiency and promising scalability for future applications.







Abstract
Nylon, a widely&#8208;used high&#8208;performance thermoplastic, boasts exceptional durability and resistance to various solvents and weak acids, making it indispensable across diverse applications. However, its nonbiodegradable nature has led to alarming environmental pollution in land and oceans. Chemical recycling to monomers (CRM) stands as a crucial strategy for establishing a circular plastic economy, but the CRM of nylon remains largely unexplored. Herein, we introduce the bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), evolved from &#948;&#8208;valerolactam and pyrrolidone, to solve the trade&#8208;off in depolymerizability and performance. Notably, 5/6&#8208;LM exhibits nearly 95&#8201;% conversion in mild polymerization conditions and efficient depolymerization catalyzed by lewis acids. This compound is synthetically accessible from commercially available chemicals in a single step at room temperature, demonstrating high efficiency and scalability up to 50&#8197;g in laboratory. Furthermore, the resulting polyamide displays remarkable attributes including high crystallinity and thermostability up to 283&#8201;&#176;C, significantly broadening the scope of chemically recyclable nylons.

         <title>Photocatalytic Functionalization of Dehydroalanine&#8208;Derived Peptides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic hydroarylation of dehydroalanine (Dha) and Dha&#8208;containing peptides with versatile arylthianthrenium salts was developed in batch and in flow, enabling expedient scale&#8208;up. The mild nature of the photocatalytic approach allowed the diversification of peptides featuring various sensitive functional groups and the effective stitching of Dha&#8208;containing peptides with a myriad of arenes and drug scaffolds.







Abstract
Unnatural amino acids, and their synthesis by the late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of peptides, play a crucial role in areas such as drug design and discovery. Historically, the LSF of biomolecules has predominantly utilized traditional synthetic methodologies that exploit nucleophilic residues, such as cysteine, lysine or tyrosine. Herein, we present a photocatalytic hydroarylation process targeting the electrophilic residue dehydroalanine (Dha). This residue possesses an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated moiety and can be combined with various arylthianthrenium salts, both in batch and flow reactors. Notably, the flow setup proved instrumental for efficient scale&#8208;up, paving the way for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids and peptides in substantial quantities. Our photocatalytic approach, being inherently mild, permits the diversification of peptides even when they contain sensitive functional groups. The readily available arylthianthrenium salts facilitate the seamless integration of Dha&#8208;containing peptides with a wide range of arenes, drug blueprints, and natural products, culminating in the creation of unconventional phenylalanine derivatives. The synergistic effect of the high functional group tolerance and the modular characteristic of the aryl electrophile enables efficient peptide conjugation and ligation in both batch and flow conditions.

         <title>Introducing Carborane Clusters into Crystalline Frameworks via Thiol&#8208;Yne Click Chemistry for Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through thiol&#8208;yne click chemistry, the energy&#8208;rich and reductive carborane subunits were covalently incorporated into the pores of energetic frameworks. This innovative decoration approach enables integrate multiple functionalities, ultimately achieving enhanced energy density, improved safety and shortened ignition delay time of the energetic frameworks.







Abstract
Crystalline frameworks represent a cutting&#8208;edge frontier in material science, and recently, there has been a surge of interest in energetic crystalline frameworks. However, the well&#8208;established porosity often leads to diminished output energy, necessitating a novel approach for performance enhancement. Thiol&#8208;yne coupling, a versatile metal&#8208;free click reaction, has been underutilized in crystalline frameworks. As a proof of concept, we herein demonstrate the potential of this approach by introducing the energy&#8208;rich, size&#8208;matched, and reductive 1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaborane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol (CB&#8722;SH) into an acetylene&#8208;functionalized framework, Zn(AIm)2, via thiol&#8208;yne click reaction. This innovative decoration strategy resulted in a remarkable 46.6&#8201;% increase in energy density, a six&#8208;fold reduction in ignition delay time (4&#8197;ms) with red fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer, and impressive enhancement of stability. Density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanism by which CB&#8722;SH promotes hypergolic ignition. The thiol&#8208;yne click modification strategy presented here permits engineering of crystalline frameworks for the design of advanced energetic materials.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Photo&#8208;driven Sequential Sigmatropic Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here report a highly stereoselective method for the synthesis of polysubstituted conjugated dienes from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo alkynyl ketones and pyrazole&#8208;substituted unsymmetric aminals under mild conditions, which was driven by photo and involved 1,6&#8208;dipolar ion intermediate and quadruple sigmatropic rearrangements, was successfully developed. In this transformation, the cleavage of four bonds and the recombination of five bonds were achieved in one operational step. This protocol also provided a modular tool for constructing dienes via &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy from the three components of amines, pyrazol and &#945;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones. The mechanistic investigation combining control experiments and therotical calculations indicated that the plausible reaction path underwent the 1,6&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;dipolar ion intermediate instead of the 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5&#8208;dipolar ion intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Responsive Colorimetric and Fluorometric Red&#8208;Shift in Triarylborane Derivatives: Dual Role of Phenazaborine as Lewis Acid and Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photophysical modulation of triarylboranes (TABs) through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions is a fundamental approach in sensing anions. Yet, design principles for anion&#8208;responsive TABs displaying significant red&#8208;shift in absorption and photoluminescence (PL) have remained elusive. Herein, a new strategy for modulating photophysical properties of TABs in red&#8208;shift mode has been presented, endowing a nitrogen&#8208;bridged triarylborane (1,4&#8208;phenazaborine: PAzB) with a contradictory dual role as a Lewis acid and an electron donor. Following the strategy, PAzB derivatives connected with an electron&#8208;deficient azaaromatic have been developed, and these compounds display distinct red&#8208;shift in absorption and PL in response to an anion. Spectroscopic analyses and quantum chemical calculations have revealed the formation of tetracoordinate borate upon the addition of fluoride, narrowing the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and enhancing charge transfer character in the excited state. This approach has also been demonstrated in modulating photophysical properties of solid&#8208;state films.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective defluorination of trifluoromethyl substituents by conformationally induced remote substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective reduction of an aromatic trifluoromethyl substituent to a difluoromethyl substituent may be achieved by base&#8208;promoted elimination to form a difluoro&#8208;p&#8208;quinomethide which is trapped by an intramolecular nucleophile. High yields are obtained when the nucleophilic trap entails the conformationally favoured cyclisation of an aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) derivative. The resulting cyclised difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted arylimidazolidinone products are readily converted to versatile difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted aldehydes by reduction and hydrolysis. Defluorination is successful on a range of benzenoid (both para and ortho CF3 substituted) and heterocyclic substrates. Double defluorination may likewise be achieved sequentially, or in a single step from an Aib dipeptide derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Thermal and Hydrolytic Resistance in Chemically Circular Polyesters via In&#8208;Chain 1,3&#8208;Cyclobutyl Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyesters, a highly promising class of circular polymers for achieving a closed&#8208;loop sustainable plastic economy, inherently exhibit material stability defects, especially in thermal and hydrolytic instability. Here, we introduce a class of polyesters, P(4R&#8208;BL) (R = Ph, Bu), featuring conformationally rigid 1,3&#8208;cyclobutyl rings in the backbone. These polyesters not only exhibit superior thermostability (Td,5% = 376&#8722;380 &#176;C) but also demonstrate exceptional hydrolytic resistance with good integrity even after 1 year in basic and acidic aqueous solutions, distinguishing themselves from typical counterparts. Tailoring the flexibility of the side group R enables the controlled thermal and mechanical performance of P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Bu&#8208;BL) to rival durable syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), respectively. Significantly, despite their high stability, both polyesters can be effectively depolymerized into pristine monomers, establishing a circular life cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transannulation En Route to N&#8208;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reactions triggered by the extrusion of small gaseous molecules have emerged as a powerful strategy for the efficient construction of heterocyclic compounds. However, it&#8217;s asymmetric synthesis remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8211;N atropisomers by the denitrogenative transannulation of benzotriazones with internal alkynes. A broad range of N&#8211;N atropisomers was obtained with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild conditions. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction mechanism and enantioselectivity control.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Environmentally Friendly Dual&#8208;crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Environmentally friendly crosslinked polymer networks feature degradable covalent or non&#8208;covalent bonds, with many of them manifesting dynamic characteristics. These attributes enable convenient degradation, facile reprocessibility, and self&#8208;healing capabilities. However, the inherent instability of these crosslinking bonds often compromises the mechanical properties of polymer networks, limiting their practical applications. In this context, environmentally friendly dual&#8208;crosslinking polymer networks (denoted EF&#8208;DCPNs) have emerged as promising alternatives to address this challenge. These materials effectively balance the need for high mechanical properties with the ability to degrade, recycle, and/or self&#8208;heal. Despite their promising potential, investigations into EF&#8208;DCPNs remain in their nascent stages, and several gaps and limitations persist. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis, properties, and applications of recent progress in EF&#8208;DCPNs. Firstly, synthetic routes to a rich variety of EF&#8208;DCPNs possessing two distinct types of dynamic bonds (i.e., imine, disulfide, ester, hydrogen bond, coordination bond, and other bonds) are introduced. Subsequently, complex structure&#8208; and dynamic nature&#8208;dependent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of EF&#8208;DCPNs are discussed, followed by their exemplary applications in electronics and biotechnology. Finally, future research directions in this rapidly evolving field are outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Hetero&#8208;Phase Nanostructure via a Secondary Building Unit (SBU) Regulating Strategy for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an effective method to modulate the physicochemical properties of materials, crystal phase engineering, especially hetero&#8208;phase, plays an important role in developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. However, it is still a huge challenge but significant to construct porous hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures with adjustable band structures. As a kind of unique porous crystalline materials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) might be the appropriate candidate, but the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase is rarely reported. Herein, we developed a secondary building unit (SBU) regulating strategy to prepare two crystal phases of Ti&#8208;MOFs constructed by titanium and 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene, i.e., COK and MIL&#8208;125. Besides, COK/MIL&#8208;125 hetero&#8208;phase was further constructed. In the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, COK/MIL&#8208;125 possessed the highest H2 yield compared to COK and MIL&#8208;125, ascribing to the Z&#8208;scheme homojunction at hetero&#8208;phase interface. Furthermore, by decorating with amino groups (i.e., NH2&#8208;COK/NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125), the light absorbing capacity was broadened to visible&#8208;light region, and the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 yield was greatly improved.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As an effective method to modulate the physicochemical properties of materials, crystal phase engineering, especially hetero-phase, plays an important role in developing high-performance photocatalysts. However, it is still a huge challenge but significant to construct porous hetero-phase nanostructures with adjustable band structures. As a kind of unique porous crystalline materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) might be the appropriate candidate, but the MOF-based hetero-phase is rarely reported. Herein, we developed a secondary building unit (SBU) regulating strategy to prepare two crystal phases of Ti-MOFs constructed by titanium and 1,4-dicarboxybenzene, i.e., COK and MIL-125. Besides, COK/MIL-125 hetero-phase was further constructed. In the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, COK/MIL-125 possessed the highest H2 yield compared to COK and MIL-125, ascribing to the Z-scheme homojunction at hetero-phase interface. Furthermore, by decorating with amino groups (i.e., NH2-COK/NH2-MIL-125), the light absorbing capacity was broadened to visible-light region, and the visible-light-driven H2 yield was greatly improved. Briefly, the MOF-based hetero-phase possesses periodic channel structures and molecularly adjustable band structures, which is scarce in traditional organic or inorganic materials. As a proof of concept, our work not only highlights the development of MOF-based hetero-phase nanostructures, but also paves a novel avenue for designing high-performance photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Photocatalyst Based on Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Induced Intersystem Crossing Enables Rapid and Efficient Polymerization Under Low&#8208;Power Excitation Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, most photoredox catalysis polymerization systems are limited by high excitation power, long polymerization time, or the requirement of electron donors due to the precise design of efficient photocatalysts still poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach: the creation of efficient photocatalysts having high ground state oxidation potentials and high excited state energy levels, along with through&#8208;space charge transfer induced intersystem crossing (ISC) properties. Using this strategy, a cabazole&#8208;naphthalimide (NI) dyad (NI&#8208;1) characterized by long triplet excited state lifetime (tT = 62 &#956;s), satisfactory ISC efficiency (&#934;&#916; = 54.3%) and powerful reduction capacity [Singlet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC) = &#8208;1.93 eV, Triplet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC) = &#8208;0.84 eV] was obtained. An efficient and rapid polymerization (83% conversion of 1 mM monomer in 30 s) was observed under the conditions of without electron donor, low excitation power (10 mW cm&#8208;2) and low catalyst (NI&#8208;1) loading (&lt; 50 mM). In contrast, the conversion rate was lower at 29% when the reference catalyst (NI&#8208;4) was used for photopolymerization under the same conditions, demonstrating the advantage of the TSCT photocatalyst. Finally, the TSCT material was used as a photocatalyst in practical lithography for the first time, achieving pattern resolutions of up to 10 &#956;m.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance Pyroelectric Property Accompanied by Spin Crossover in a Single Crystal of Fe(II)&#160;Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyroelectric materials hold significant potential for energy harvesting, sensing, and imaging applications. However, achieving high&#8208;performance pyroelectricity across a wide temperature range near room temperature&#160;remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a single crystal of Fe(II) spin&#8208;crossover compound shows remarkable pyroelectric properties accompanied by a thermally controlled spin transition. In this material, the uniaxial alignment of polar molecules results in a polarization of the lattice. As the molecular geometry is modulated during a gradual spin transition, the polar axis experiences a colossal thermal expansion with a coefficient of 796 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1. Consequently, the material&#8217;s polarization undergoes significant modulation as a secondary pyroelectric effect. The considerable shift in polarization (pyroelectric coefficient,&#160;p = 3.7~22 nC K&#8722;1cm&#8722;2), coupled with a low dielectric constant (&#949;' = 4.4~5.4) over a remarkably wide temperature range of 298 to 400 K, suggests this material is a high&#8208;performance pyroelectric. The demonstration of pyroelectricity combined with magnetic switching in this study will inspire further investigations in the field of molecular electronics and magnetism.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando&#160;Spectroscopic Monitoring of Metal Chalcogenides for Overall Water Splitting: New Views of Active Species and Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based chalcogenides exhibit great promise for overall water splitting, yet their intrinsic catalytic reaction mechanisms remain to be fully understood. In this work, we employed operando X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationships of low&#8208;crystalline cobalt sulfide (L&#8208;CoS) catalysts toward overall water splitting. The operando results for L&#8208;CoS catalyzing the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) demonstrate that the cobalt centers in the bulk are predominantly coordinated by sulfur atoms, which undergo a kinetic structural rearrangement to generate metallic cobalt in S&#8208;Co&#8208;Co&#8208;S moieties as the true catalytic active species. In comparison, during the acidic HER, L&#8208;CoS undergoes local structural optimization of Co centers, and H2 production proceeds with adsorption/desorption of key intermediates atop the Co&#8208;S&#8208;Co configurations. Further operando characterizations highlight the crucial formation of high&#8208;valent Co4+ species in L&#8208;CoS for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the formation of such active species was found to be far more facile than in crystalline Co3O4 and Co&#8208;LDH references. These insights offer a clear picture of the complexity of active species and site formation in different media, and demonstrate how their restructuring influences the catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering sp&#8208;Carbon Content in Graphdiynes for Enhanced Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to sp2&#8208;hybridized graphene, graphdiynes (GDYs) composed of sp and sp2 carbon are highly promising as efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction into oxygen peroxide because of the high catalytic reactivity of the electron&#8208;rich sp&#8208;carbon atoms. The desired catalytic capacity of GDY, such as catalytic selectivity and efficiency, can theoretically be achieved by strategically steering the sp&#8208;carbon contents or the topological arrangement of the acetylenic linkages and aromatic bonds. Herein, we successfully tuned the electrocatalytic activity of GDYs by regulating the sp&#8208;to&#8208;sp2 carbon ratios with different organic monomer precursors. As the active sp&#8208;carbon atoms possess electron&#8208;sufficient &#960; orbitals, they can donate electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbitals of O2 molecules and initiate subsequent O2 reduction, GDY with the high sp&#8208;carbon content of 50 at% exhibits excellent capability of catalyzing O2 reduction into H2O2. It demonstrates exceptional H2O2 selectivity of over 95.0% and impressive performance in practical H2O2 production, Faraday efficiency (FE) exceeding 99.0%, and a yield of 83.3 nmol s&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2. Our work holds significant importance in effectively steering the inherent properties of GDYs by purposefully adjusting the sp&#8208;to&#8208;sp2 carbon ratio and highlights their immense potential for research and applications in catalysis and other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into the Terpene Cyclization Domains of Two Fungal Sesterterpene Synthases and Enzymatic Engineering for Sesterterpene Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Little is known about the structures and catalytic mechanisms of sesterterpene synthases (StTSs), which greatly hinders the structure&#8208;based engineering of StTSs for structural diversity expansion of sesterterpenes. We here report on the crystal structures of the terpene cyclization (TC) domains of two fungal StTSs: sesterfisherol synthase (NfSS) and sesterbrasiliatriene synthase (PbSS). Both TC structures contain benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BTAC), pyrophosphate (PPi), and magnesium ions (Mg2+), clearly defining the catalytic active sites. A combination of theory and experiments including carbocationic intermediates modeling, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and isotope labeling provided detailed insights into the structural basis for their catalytic mechanisms. Structure&#8208;based engineering of NfSS and PbSS resulted in the formation of 20 sesterterpenes including 13 new compounds and four pairs of epimers with different configurations at C18. These results expand the structural diversity of sesterterpenes and provide important insights for future synthetic biology research.</dc:description>

However, achieving this goal remains a formidable challenge because of the electrochemical instability observed in most PCPs. Herein, we develop a &#8220;modular design&#8221; strategy to construct electrochemically stable semiconducting PCP, namely, Fe&#8208;pyNDI, which incorporates a chain&#8208;type Fe&#8208;pyrazole metal cluster and &#960;&#8208;stacking column with effective synergistic effects. The three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) technique resolves the precise structure. Both theoretical and experimental investigation confirms that the &#960;&#8208;stacking column in Fe&#8208;pyNDI can provide an efficient electron transport path and enhance the structural stability of the material. As a result, Fe&#8208;pyNDI can serve as an efficient model electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia with a superior ammonia yield of 339.2 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 (14677 &#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1) and a faradaic efficiency of 87 % at neutral electrolyte, which is comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that during the reaction, the structure of Fe&#8208;pyNDI can be kept, while part of the Fe3+ in Fe&#8208;pyNDI was reduced in situ to Fe2+, which serves as the potential active species for NO3RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Observation of Polaritonic Chemistry by 

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polaritonic chemistry is emerging as a powerful approach to modifying the properties and reactivity of molecules and materials. However, probing how the electronics and dynamics of molecular systems change under strong coupling has been challenging due to the narrow range of spectroscopic techniques that can be applied in situ. Here we develop microfluidic optical cavities for vibrational strong coupling (VSC) that are compatible with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using standard liquid NMR tubes. VSC is shown to influence the equilibrium between two conformations of a molecular balance sensitive to London dispersion forces, revealing an apparent change in the equilibrium constant under VSC. In all compounds studied, VSC does not induce detectable changes in chemical shifts, J&#8208;couplings, or spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times. This unexpected finding indicates that VSC does not substantially affect molecular electron density distributions, and in turn has profound implications for the possible mechanisms at play in polaritonic chemistry under VSC and suggests that the emergence of collective behavior is critical.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical synthesis of Acetobacter pasteurianus lipid A with a unique tetrasaccharide backbone and evaluation of its&#160;immunological functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell surface component of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, activates innate immunity. Its active principle is the terminal glycolipid lipid A. Acetobacter pasteurianus is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium used in the fermentation of traditional Japanese black rice vinegar (kurozu). In this study, we focused on A. pasteurianus lipid A, which is a potential immunostimulatory component of kurozu. The active principle structure of A. pasteurianus lipid A has not yet been identified. Herein, we first systematically synthesized three types of A. pasteurianus lipid As containing a common and unique tetrasaccharide backbone. We developed an efficient method for constructing the 2&#8208;trehalosamine skeleton utilizing borinic acid&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation to afford 1,1&#8217;&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;glycoside in high yield and stereoselectivity. A common tetrasaccharide intermediate with an orthogonal protecting group pattern was constructed via [2+2] glycosylation. After introducing various fatty acids, all protecting groups were removed to achieve the first chemical synthesis of three distinct types of A. pasteurianus lipid As. After evaluating their immunological function using both human and murine cell lines, we identified the active principles of A. pasteurianus LPS. We also found the unique anomeric structure of A. pasteurianus lipid A contributes to its high chemical stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Interlayer Spacings as Perfectly Selective Artificial Proton Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological proton channels have perfect selectivity in aqueous environment against almost all ions and molecules, a property that differs itself from other biological channels and a feature that remains challenging to realize for bulk artificial materials. The biological perfect selectivity originates from the fact that the channel has almost no free space for ion or water transport but generates a hydrogen bonded wire in the presence of protons to allow the proton hopping. Inspired by this, we used the interlayer spacings of covalent organic framework materials consisting of hydrophilic functional groups as perfectly selective artificial proton channels. The interlayer spacings are so narrow that no atoms or molecules can diffuse through. However, protons exhibit a diffusivity in the same order of magnitude as that in bulk water. Density functional theory calculations show that water molecules and the COF material form hydrogen bonded wires, allowing the proton hopping. We further demonstrate that the proton transport rate can be tuned by adjusting the acidity of the functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of Palmarumycin Spirobisnaphthalene&#160;Biosynthesis Reveals a Set of Previously Unrecognized Oxidases and Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spirobisnaphthalenes (SBNs) are a class of highly oxygenated, fungal bisnaphthalenes containing an unique spiroketal bridge, that displayed diverse bioactivities. Among the reported SBNs, palmarumycins are the major type, which are precursors for the other type of SBNs structurally. However, the biosynthesis of SBNs is unclear. In this study, we elucidated the biosynthesis of palmarumycins, using gene disruption, heterologous expression, and substrate feeding experiments. The biosynthetic gene cluster for palmarumycins was identified to be distant from the polyketide synthase gene cluster, and included two cytochrome P450s (PalA and PalB), and one short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (PalC) encoding genes as key structural genes. PalA is an unusual, multifunctional P450 that catalyzes the oxidative dimerization of 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene to generate the spiroketal linkage and 2,3&#8208;epoxy group. Chemical synthesis of key intermediate and in vitro biochemical assays proved that the oxidative dimerization proceeded via a binaphthyl ether. PalB installs the C&#8208;5 hydroxyl group, widely found in SBNs. PalC catalyzes 1&#8208;keto reduction, the reverse 1&#8208;dehydrogenation, and 2,3&#8208;epoxide reduction. Moreover, an FAD&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase, encoded by palD, which locates outside the cluster, functions as 1&#8208;dehydrogenase. These results provided the first genetic and biochemical evidence&#160;for the biosynthesis of palmarumycin SBNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Titanium on Mesoporous Nitrogen, Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Photo&#8208;thermal Catalytic CO2 Cycloaddition by a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for CO2 fixation to high value&#8208;added chemicals is meaningful but challenging. Styrene carbonate has great market value, but the cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide is difficult due to the high steric hindrance and weak electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the phenyl group. To utilize clean energy (such as optical energy) directly and effectively for CO2 value&#8208;added process, we introduce earth&#8208;abundant Ti single&#8208;atom into the mesoporous nitrogen, oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (Ti&#8208;CNO) by a two&#8208;step method. The Ti&#8208;CNO exhibits excellent photothermal catalytic activities and stability for cycloaddition of CO2 and styrene oxide to styrene carbonate. Under light irradiation and ambient pressure, an optimal Ti&#8208;CNO produces styrene carbonate with a yield of 98.3%, much higher than CN (27.1%). In addition, it shows remarkable stability during 10 consecutive cycles. Its enhanced catalytic performance stems from the enhanced photothermal effect and improved Lewis acidic/basic sites exposed by the abundant mesopores. The experiments and theoretical simulations demonstrate the styrene oxide&#8226;+ and CO2&#8226;&#8208; radicals generated at the Lewis acidic (Ti&#948;+) and basic sites of Ti&#8208;CNO under light irradiation, respectively. This work furnishes a strategy for synthesizing advanced single&#8208;atom catalysts for photo&#8208;thermal synergistic CO2 fixation to high value products via a cycloaddition pathway.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of a methodology for synthesizing value&#8208;added urea (CO(NH2)2) via a renewable electricity&#8208;driven C&#8208;N coupling reaction under mild conditions is highly anticipated. However, the complex catalytic active sites that act on the carbon and nitrogen species make the reaction mechanism unclear, resulting in a low efficiency of C&#8208;N coupling from the co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8208;). Herein,we propose a novel tandem catalyst of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co), in which the Mo sites serve to facilitate nitrate reduction to the *NH2 intermediate, while the Co sites enhance CO2 reduction to carbonic oxide (CO), thus synergistically promoting C&#8208;N coupling. The synthesized Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) catalyst exhibited a noteworthy urea yield rate of 844.11mg h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, alongside a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 33.90% at &#8722;0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By combining in situ spectroscopic techniques with density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that efficient C&#8208;N coupling is attributed to a tandem system in which the *NH2 and *CO intermediates produced by the Mo and Co active sites of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) stabilize the formation of the *CONH2 intermediate. This study provides an effective avenue for the design and synthesis of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic urea synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Formation of Silver Nanoclusters and Their Transformation to the Same Product</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, two atomically precise silver nanoclusters, Ag54 and Ag33, directed by inner anion templates (CrO42&#8208; and/or Cl&#8208;), are initially isolated as a mixed phase from identical reactants across a wide temperature range (20&#8208;80 &#176;C). Interestingly, fine&#8208;tuning the reaction temperature can realize  pure phase synthesis of the two nanoclusters; that is, a metastable Ag54 is kinetically formed at a low temperature (20 &#176;C), whereas such a system is steered towards a thermodynamically stable Ag33 at a relatively high temperature (80 &#176;C). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry illustrates that the stability of Ag33 is superior to that of Ag54, which is further supported by density functional theory calculations. Importantly, the difference in structural stability can influence the pathway of 1,4&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene induced transformation reaction starting from Ag54 and Ag33. The former undergoes a dramatic breakage&#8208;reorganization process to form an Ag31 dimer (Ag31), while the same product can be also achieved from the latter following a noninvasive ligand exchange process. Both the Ag54 and Ag33 have the potential for further remote laser ignition applications. This work not only demonstrates how temperature controls the isolation of a specific phase, but also sheds light on the structural transformation pathway of nanoclusters with different stability.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Butadiene Purification in a Sulfonate&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Synergistic Separation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials that could recognize specific molecules from complex mixtures are of great potential in improving the current energy&#8208;intensive multistep separation processes. However, due to the highly similar structures and properties of the mixtures, the design of desired porous materials remains challenging. Herein, a sulfonate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework ZU&#8208;609 with suitable pore size and pore chemistry is designed for 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6) purification from complex C4 mixtures. The sulfonate anions decorated in the channel achieve selective recognition of C4H6 from other C4 olefins with subtle polarity differences through C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#8208;S interactions, affording recorded C4H6/trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 selectivity (4.4). Meanwhile, the shrunken mouth of the channel with a suitable pore size (4.6 &#197;) exhibits exclusion effect to the larger molecules cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8, iso&#8208;C4H8, n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10. Benefiting from the moderate C4 olefins binding affinity exhibited by sulfonate anions, the adsorbed C4H6 could be easily regenerated near ambient conditions. Polymer&#8208;grade 1,3&#8208;butadiene (99.5%) is firstly obtained from 7&#8208;component C4 mixtures via one adsorption&#8208;desorption cycle. The work demonstrates the great potential of synergistic recognition of size&#8208;sieving and thermodynamically equilibrium in dealing with complex mixtures.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Mysteries: Acetonitrile's Dance with Weakly&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes in Shaping Gas Evolution and Electrochemical Performance of Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetonitrile electrolyte additive is found to delay hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution reactions in aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs). It also suppresses vanadium (V) dissolution, or V&#8208;ion crosstalk, from the vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) cathode. Practically, acetonitrile&#8208;added electrolyte enabled a high and stable areal capacity of 3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using a 26&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 V2O5 dry&#8208;film cathode.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal battery (AZMB) is a promising candidate for future large&#8208;scale energy storage with commendable capacity, exceptional safety characteristics, and low cost. Acetonitrile (AN) has been widely used as an effective electrolyte constituent to improve AZMBs&#8217; performance. However, its functioning mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we unveiled the critical roles of AN in AZMBs via comparative in situ electrochemical, gaseous, and morphological analyses. Despite its limited ability to solvate Zn ions, AN&#8208;modulated Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheath with increased anions and decreased water achieves a weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte. As a result, the Zn||Zn cell with AN addition exhibited 63&#8197;times longer cycle life than cell without AN and achieved a 4&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 accumulated capacity with no H2 generation. In V2O5||Zn cells, for the first time, AN suppressing CO2 generation, elevating CO2&#8208;initiation voltage from 2&#8594;2.44&#8197;V (H2: 2.43&#8594;2.55&#8197;V) was discovered. AN&#8208;impeded transit and Zn&#8208;side deposition of dissolved vanadium ions, known as &#8220;crosstalk,&#8221; ameliorated inhomogeneous Zn deposition and dendritic Zn growth. At last, we demonstrated an AN&#8208;enabled high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity AZMB (3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) using high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading V2O5 cathode (26&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This study shed light on the strategy of constructing fast&#8208;desolvation electrolytes and offered insights for future electrolyte accommodation for high&#8208;voltage AZMB cathodes.

         <title>6&#8208;Strand to Stable 10/12 Helix Conformational Switch by Incorporating Flexible &#946;&#8208;hGly in the Homooligomers of Camphor Derived &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid: NMR and X&#8208;Ray Crystallographic Evidence</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks (CDA) derived from naturally occuring camphor are introduced as new design tools to construct diverse secondary structures. Specifically, the conformational switching to a robust 10/12&#8208;helix, by simply inserting flexible achiral &#946;&#8208;hGly spacers in a 6&#8208;strand stabilizing CDA&#8208;homooligomers, exemplifies the potential of the CDAs in backbone regulation and in developing functional foldamers.







Abstract
Rational design of unnatural amino acid building blocks capable of stabilizing predictable secondary structures similar to protein fragments is pivotal for foldamer chemistry/catalysis. Here, we introduce novel &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks: [1S,2R,4R]exoCDA and [1S,2S,4R]endoCDA, derived from the abundantly available R(+)&#8208;camphor, which is traditionally known for its medicinal value. Further, we demonstrate that the homooligomers of exoCDA adopt 6&#8208;strand conformation, which switches to a robust 10/12&#8208;helix simply by inserting flexible &#946;&#8208;hGly spacer at alternate positions (1&#8201;:&#8201;1 &#946;&#8208;hGly/exoCDA heterooligomers), as evident by DFT&#8208;calculations, solution&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of crystalline&#8208;state structure of left&#8208;handed 10/12&#8208;mixed helix, that is free from the conventional approach of employing &#946;&#8208;amino acids of either alternate chirality or alternate &#946;2/&#946;3 substitutions, to access the 10/12&#8208;helix. The results also show that the homooligomers of heterochiral exoCDA don&#8242;t adopt helical fold, instead exhibit banana&#8208;shaped strands, whereas the homodimers of the other diastereomer endoCDA, nucleate 8&#8208;membered turns. Furthermore, the homo&#8208;exoCDA and hetero&#8208;[&#946;&#8208;hGly&#8208;exoCDA] oligomers are found to exhibit self&#8208;association properties with distinct morphological features. Overall, the results offer new possibilties of constructing discrete stable secondary and tertiary structures based on CDAs, which can accommodate flexible residues with desired side&#8208;chain substitutions.

Further, we demonstrate that the homooligomers of &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA adopt 6-strand conformation, which switches to a robust 10/12-helix simply by inserting flexible &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hGly spacer at alternate positions (1&#8201;:&#8201;1 &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hGly/&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA heterooligomers), as evident by DFT-calculations, solution-state NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of crystalline-state structure of left-handed 10/12-mixed helix, that is free from the conventional approach of employing &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-amino acids of either alternate chirality or alternate &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; substitutions, to access the 10/12-helix. The results also show that the homooligomers of heterochiral &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA don&#8242;t adopt helical fold, instead exhibit banana-shaped strands, whereas the homodimers of the other diastereomer &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;CDA, nucleate 8-membered turns. Furthermore, the homo-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA and hetero-[&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hGly-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;CDA] oligomers are found to exhibit self-association properties with distinct morphological features. Overall, the results offer new possibilties of constructing discrete stable secondary and tertiary structures based on CDAs, which can accommodate flexible residues with desired side-chain substitutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;ion Anchor Induced Highly Reversible Zn Anodes for High Performance Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unstable Zn interface with serious detrimental parasitic side&#8208;reactions and uncontrollable Zn dendrites severely plagues the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The interface stability was closely related to the electrolyte configuration and Zn2+ depositional behavior. In this work, a unique Zn&#8208;ion anchoring strategy is originally proposed to manipulate the coordination structure of solvated Zn&#8208;ions and guide the Zn&#8208;ion depositional behavior. Specifically, the amphoteric charged ion additives (denoted as DM), which act as zinc&#8208;ion anchors, can tightly absorb on the Zn surface to guide the uniform zinc&#8208;ion distribution by using its positively charged &#8208;NR4+ groups.&#160;While the negatively charged &#8208;SO3&#8208; groups of DM on the other hand, reduces the active water molecules within solvation sheaths of Zn&#8208;ions. Benefiting from the special synergistic effect, Zn metal exhibits highly ordered and compact (002) Zn deposition and negligible side&#8208;reactions. As a result, the advanced Zn||Zn symmetric cell delivers extraordinarily 7000 hours long lifespan (0.25 mAh cm&#8208;2, 0.25 mAh cm&#8208;2). Additionally, based on this strategy, the NH4V4O10llZn pouch&#8208;cell with low negative/positive capacity ratio (N/P ratio=2.98) maintains 80.4% capacity retention for 180 cycles. A more practical 4 cm*4 cm sized pouch&#8208;cell could be steadily cycled in a high output capacity of 37.0 mAh over 50 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>An Expanded Palette of Fluorescent COS/H2S&#8208;Releasing Donors for H2S Delivery, Detection, and In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important reactive sulfur species that is involved in many biological functions, and H2S imbalances have been indicated as a potential biomarker for various diseases. Different H2S donors have been developed to deliver H2S directly to biological systems, but few reports include donors with optical responses that allow for tracking of H2S release. Moreover, donor systems that use the same chemistry to deliver H2S across a palette of fluorescent responses remain lacking. Here we report five thiol&#8208;activated fluorescence turn&#8208;on COS/H2S donors that utilize blue, yellow, orange, red, and near infrared&#8208;emitting dyes functionalized with an H2S&#8208;releasing sulfenyl thiocarbonate scaffold. Upon treatment with thiols, each donor provides a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response (3&#8211;310&#8208;fold) and high H2S release efficiencies (&gt;60%). Using combined electrode and fluorescence experiments, we directly correlate the measured H2S release with the fluorescence response. All donors are biocompatible and release H2S in live cell environments. In addition, we demonstrate that the NIR donor allows for imaging H2S release in live rats via subcutaneous injection of the donor loaded into an alginate gel, which to the best of our knowledge is the first in vivo tracking of H2S release from a fluorogenic donor in non&#8208;transparent organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Finding Natural, Dense, and Stable Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Wurtzite Crystal Surfaces&#160;for Small&#8208;Molecule Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) open up new opportunities for substituting noble metals in the activation and conversion of stable molecules. However, the applications of SFLPs on a larger scale are impeded by the complex construction process, low surface density, and sensitivity to the reaction environment. Herein, wurtzite&#8208;structured crystals such as GaN, ZnO, and AlP are found for developing natural, dense, and stable SFLPs. It is revealed that the SFLPs can naturally exist on the (100) and (110) surfaces of wurtzite&#8208;structured crystals. All the surface cations and anions serve as the Lewis acid and Lewis base in SFLPs, respectively, contributing to the surface density of SFLPs as high as 7.26 &#215; 1014 cm&#8208;2. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the SFLPs can keep stable under high temperatures and the reaction atmospheres of CO and H2O. Moreover, outstanding performance for activating the given small molecules is achieved on these natural SFLPs, which originates from the optimal orbital overlap between SFLPs and small molecules. Overall, these findings not only provide a simple method to obtain dense and stable SFLPs but also unfold the nature of SFLPs toward the facile activation of small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Implanting colloidal nanoparticles into single&#8208;crystalline zeolites&#160;for Catalytic Dehydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The encapsulation of functional colloidal nanoparticles (100 nm) into single&#8208;crystalline ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites, aiming to create uniform core&#8208;shell structures, is a highly sought&#8208;after yet formidable objective due to significant lattice mismatch and distinct crystallization properties. In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of a core&#8208;shell structured single&#8208;crystal zeolite encompassing an Fe3O4 colloidal core via a novel confinementstepwise crystallization methodology. By engineering a confined nanocavity, anchoring nucleation sites, and executing stepwise crystallization, we have successfully encapsulated colloidal nanoparticles (CN) within single&#8208;crystal zeolites. These grafted sites, alongside the controlled crystallization process, compel the zeolite seed to nucleate and expand along the Fe3O4 colloidal nanoparticle surface, within a meticulously defined volume (1.5 &#215; 107 &#8804; V &#8804; 1.3 &#215; 108 nm3). Our strategy exhibits versatility and adaptability to an array of zeolites, including but not restricted to ZSM&#8208;5, NaA, ZSM&#8208;11, and TS&#8208;1 with polycrystalline zeolite shell. We highlight the uniformly structured magnetic&#8208;nucleus single&#8208;crystalline zeolite, which displays pronounced superparamagnetism (14 emu/g) and robust acidity (~0.83 mmol/g). This innovative material has been effectively utilized in a magnetically stabilized bed (MSB) reactor for the dehydration of ethanol, delivering an exceptional conversion rate (98%), supreme ethylene selectivity (98%), and superior catalytic endurance (in excess of 100 hours).</dc:description>

         <title>Light Induced Proton Coupled Charge Transfer Triggers Counterion Directional Translocation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate directed translocation of ClO4&#8208; anions from cationic to neutral binding site along the synthetized BPym&#8208;OH dye molecule that exhibits coupled excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) reaction (PCCT). The results of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy together with computer simulation and modeling show that in low polar toluene the excited&#8208;state redistribution of electronic charge enhanced by ESIPT generates the driving force, which is much stronger than by CT reaction itself and provides more informative gigantic shifts of fluorescence spectra signaling on ultrafast ion motion. The associated with ion translocation red&#8208;shifted fluorescence band (at 750 nm, extending to near&#8208;IR region) appears at the time ~ 83 ps as a result of electrochromic modulation of PCCT reaction. It occurs at substantial delay to PCCT that displayed fluorescence band at 640 nm and risetime of &lt; 200 fs. Thus, it becomes possible to visualize the manifestations of light&#8208;triggered ion translocation and of its driving force by fluorescence techniques and to separate them in time and energy domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Aromatic Cation&#8208;&#960; Driven Dimensional Polymorphism in Supramolecular Polymers for the Photocatalytic Oxidation and Separation of Aromatic/Cyclic Aliphatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise assembly of molecular building blocks is essential for designing polymorphism in supramolecular assemblies (SAs). A self&#8208;adaptive aromatic cation&#8208;&#960; binding motif has been developed to steer the self&#8208;assembly directionality of monomers to facilitate the creation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystalline supramolecular structures. These polymorphic SAs will have applications in various fields.







Abstract
The phenomenon of polymorphism is ubiquitous in nature, the controlled manipulation of which not only increases our ontological understanding of nature but also facilitates the conceptualization and realization of novel functional materials. However, achieving targeted polymorphism in supramolecular assemblies (SAs) remains a formidable challenge, largely because of the constraints inherent in controlling the specific binding motifs of noncovalent interactions. Herein, we propose self&#8208;adaptive aromatic cation&#8208;&#960; binding motifs to construct polymorphic SAs in both the solid and solution states. Using distinct discrete cation&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation and long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; binding motifs enables control of the self&#8208;assembly directionality of a C2h&#8208;symmetric bifunctional monomer, resulting in the successful formation of both two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional crystalline SAs (2D&#8208;CSA and 3D&#8208;CSA). The differences in the molecular packing of 3D&#8208;CSA compared with that of 2D&#8208;CSA significantly improve the charge separation and carrier mobility, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulfoxide (yield of 99&#8201;% vs 57&#8201;%). 2D&#8208;CSA, which has a vertical extended structure with favorable stronger interaction with toluene though face&#8208;to&#8208;face cation&#8208;&#960; interactions than methylcyclohexane, shows higher toluene/methylcyclohexane separation efficiency than 3D&#8208;CSA (96.9&#8201;% for 2D&#8208;CSA vs 56.3&#8201;% for 3D&#8208;CSA).

         <title>Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Direct Oxidation of Methane under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers a contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis technique for converting methane to formaldehyde and methanol under ambient conditions, using electrified fluorinated ethylene propylene with water. Achieving high yield of HCHO, this method significantly advances the field of catalysis by efficiently activating methane with reactive oxygen.







Abstract
The conversion of methane under ambient conditions has attracted significant attention. Although advancements have been made using active oxygen species from photo&#8208; and electro&#8208; chemical processes, challenges such as complex catalyst design, costly oxidants, and unwanted byproducts remain. This study exploits the concept of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis, initiating chemical reactions through charge exchange at a solid&#8211;liquid interface, to report a novel process for directly converting methane under ambient conditions. Utilizing the electrification of commercially available Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) with water under ultrasound, we demonstrate how this interaction promote the activation of methane and oxygen molecules. Our results show that the yield of HCHO and CH3OH can reach 467.5 and 151.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, respectively. We utilized electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to confirm the evolution of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and superoxide radicals (&#8901;OOH). Isotope mass spectrometry (MS) was employed to analyze the elemental origin of CH3OH, which can be further oxidized to HCHO. Additionally, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) simulations to assess the reaction energies of FEP with H2O, O2, and CH4 under these conditions. The implications of this methodology, with its potential applicability to a wider array of gas&#8208;phase catalytic reactions, underscore a significant advance in catalysis.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Templated Peptide Bond Formation Promotes L&#8208;Homochirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the RNA&#8208;peptide world, non&#8208;canonical nucleotides on complementary RNA strands can be used for RNA&#8208;templated peptide bond formation reactions. Both L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids can be loaded onto a donor RNA strand to give an equimolar mixture of products. The isomeric mixture of donor RNA strands can be coupled with an acceptor RNA strand to form the L,L&#8208;homochiral product in good yield and high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The world in which we live is homochiral. The ribose units that form the backbone of DNA and RNA are all D&#8208;configured and the encoded amino acids that comprise the proteins of all living species feature an all&#8208;L&#8208;configuration at the &#945;&#8208;carbon atoms. The homochirality of &#945;&#8208;amino acids is essential for folding of the peptides into well&#8208;defined and functional 3D structures and the homochirality of D&#8208;ribose is crucial for helix formation and base&#8208;pairing. The question of why nature uses only encoded L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids is not understood. Herein, we show that an RNA&#8208;peptide world, in which peptides grow on RNAs constructed from D&#8208;ribose, leads to the self&#8208;selection of homo&#8208;L&#8208;peptides, which provides a possible explanation for the homo&#8208;D&#8208;ribose and homo&#8208;L&#8208;amino acid combination seen in nature.

         <title>Charge Transfer Dynamics in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Heterostructures&#8212;Insights by Vibrational&#8208;Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intricate structures of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid heterostructures used in organic photovoltaics, DSSCs, and organic optoelectronics demand an in&#8208;depth investigation of their functional interface. This minireview offers a perspective on the application of time&#8208;resolved vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy for exploring the charge dynamics and their influence on the interfacial structure of these devices.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic heterostructures play a pivotal role in modern electronic and optoelectronic applications including photodetectors and field effect transistors, as well as in solar energy conversion such as photoelectrodes of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and in organic photovoltaics. To a large extent, performance of such devices is controlled by charge transfer dynamics at and across (inner) interfaces, e.g., between a wide band gap semiconductor and molecular sensitizers and/or catalysts. Hence, a detailed understanding of the structure&#8208;dynamics&#8208;function relationship of such functional interfaces is necessary to rationalize possible performance limitations of these materials and devices on a molecular level. Vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, as an interface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopic technique, allows to obtain chemically specific information from interfaces and combines such chemical insights with ultrafast time resolution, when integrated as a spectroscopic probe into a pump&#8208;probe scheme. Thus, this minireview discusses the advantages and potential of VSFG spectroscopy for investigating interfacial charge transfer dynamics and structural changes at inner interfaces. A critical perspective of the unique spectroscopic view of otherwise inaccessible interfaces is presented, which we hope opens new opportunities for an improved understanding of function&#8208;determining processes in complex materials, and brings together communities who are devoted to designing materials and devices with spectroscopists.
