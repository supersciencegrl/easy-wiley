      <title>Chiral CuxCoyS Nanoparticles under Magnetic Field and NIR Light to Synergistically Eliminate Senescent Cells</title>
      <dc:description>In the present study, chiral Cu  x  Co  y  S nanoparticles (NPs) were developed to selectively induce apoptosis of senescent cells using both an alternating magnetic field (AMF) and near infrared (NIR) photon illumination. The chiral effects on living cells were investigated, and  D  &#8208;Cu  x  Co  y  S NPs showed about 2.5 times higher of internalized ability than  L  &#8208;NPs. By modifying beta 2 macroglobulin (MG), senescent cells were effectively eliminated by  D  &#8208;Cu  x  Co  y  S NPs without damaging the activities of normal cells under AMF and photon illumination. Compared with the individual application of NIR illumination and AMF, their synergistic effect induced the production of caspase&#8208;3 with a much shorter treatment time and higher efficiency due to the more serious photon&#8208;induced cellular redox and mechanical damage of cellular skeleton. Moreover, the developed strategy was successfully used to remove senescent cells  in vivo  . This study developed a controllable way of regulating cell activities using chiral NPs, which will provide a valuable way for treating diseases and promoting health.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecularly tailored lithium&#8211;arene complex enables chemical prelithiation of high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion battery anodes</title>
      <dc:description>Prelithiation is of great interest to Li&#8208;ion battery manufacturers to compensate for the inevitable loss of active Li during initial cycling of a battery that would otherwise degrade its available energy density. Nevertheless, none of the current strategies are suited for mass production due to lack of control, homogeneity, safety and scalability. Solution&#8208;based chemical prelithiation using a reductive chemical promises unparalleled reaction homogeneity and simplicity. Thus far, however, the applied chemicals of inadequate reducing strength have not succeeded in doping active Li in Si&#8208;based high&#8208;capacity anodes but merely formed solid&#8211;electrolyte interphases, leading to only partial mitigation of the cycle irreversibility. Here, we show that a molecularly engineered Li&#8211;arene complex with a sufficiently low redox potential drives active Li accommodation in Si&#8208;based anodes to grant ideal Li contents in a full cell. Fine control over the prelithiation degree and spatial uniformity of active Li throughout the electrodes are achieved by managing time and temperature during immersion, promising both fidelity and low cost of the process for large&#8208;scale integration.</dc:description>

      <title>Embedding Functional Biomacromolecules within Peptides&#8208;Directed Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Nanoarchitectures Enables Activity Enhancement</title>
      <dc:description>Rationally tailoring a robust artificial coating can enhance the life&#8208;time of the fragile biomacromolecules. However, the shrouded coating also can restrain the activity of the guest because of the decreased substrate accessibility. Herein, we report a peptides&#8208;directed strategy that enables to tailor the MOFs&#8208;shrouded biohybrids into controllable nanoarchitectures in&#8208;situ. The MOFs biohybrid is feasible to be shaped from different 3D microporous architectures to 2D mesoporous layer by a peptide modulator. Based on this mild strategy, we reveal that the nanoarchitectures of MOFs coating significantly affect the biological functions of the hosted biomacromolecules, and demonstrate that the biomacromolecules entrapped within the novel 2D mesoporous spindle&#8208;shaped MOFs (2D MSMOFs) can significantly boost their bioactivity compared with that entrapped within the hitherto explored 3D microporous MOFs, attributing to the shortened diffusion path and enlarged pore channel in 2D MSMOFs that facilitates the intercommunication for biotransformation. Meanwhile, the engineered 2D MSMOFs thin layer also can provide excellent protective effect on the hosted biomacromolecules or proteins&#8208;scaffolded biominerals through structural confinement.</dc:description>

      <title>A Predictive Model Towards Site&#8208;Selective Metalations of Functionalized Heterocycles, Arenes, Olefins and Alkanes using TMPZnCl&#183;LiCl</title>
      <dc:description>The development of a predictive model towards site&#8208;selective deprotometalation reactions using TMPZnCl&#183;LiCl is reported (TMP = 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyl).

Engineered nanomaterials have been applied as mRNA nanocarriers; their functions are designed mainly as delivery vehicles, but rarely in regulation of the protein translation. Recently, progress in nanobiotechnology has shifted the design principle of mRNA nanocarriers from simple delivery tools to translation modulators. Here, we review the emerging concepts of nanomaterials regulating mRNA translation and recent progresses in mRNA delivery. Designer nanomaterials providing integrated functions for specific mRNA applications are also reviewed to provide insights for the design of next&#8208;generation nanomaterials to revolutionize mRNA technology.</dc:description>

      <title>The Six Isomers of the Cyclohexanol Dimer: A Delicate Test for Dispersion Models</title>
      <dc:description>The cyclohexanol homodimer is a delicate test model of the role of&#160;dispersion&#160;forces&#160;in intermolecular association. While phenol produces a single dimer, suppression of&#160;&#960;&#160;interactions&#160;and larger conformational flexibility&#160;in cyclohexanol results in multiple isomerism, as six competing dimers of the free molecule are observed in a supersonic jet expansion. Rotational spectroscopy reveals accurate structural data, specifically the formation of homo&#8208; and heterochiral diasteroisomers and the presence of both equatorial and axial forms in the dimers. Four dispersion&#8208;corrected density&#8208;functional molecular orbital calculations were tested against the experiment, with&#160;B3LYP&#8208;D3(BJ)&#160;offering good structural reproducibility with an&#160;Alrich&#8217;s triple&#8208;&#950;&#160;basis set. However, the prediction of the dimer energetics is largely model&#8208;dependent, offering a testbed for validation of&#160;dispersion&#8208;corrected&#160;computational models.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantum Dot&#8208;Catalyzed Photoreductive Removal of Sulfonyl&#8208;Based Protecting Groups</title>
      <dc:description>This communication describes the use of CuInS&#173;  2  /ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as photocatalysts for the reductive deprotection of aryl sulfonyl&#8208;protected phenols. For a series of aryl sulfonates with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, the rate of deprotection for the corresponding phenyl aryl sulfonates increases with decreasing electrochemical potential for the two electron transfers within the catalytic cycle. The rate of deprotection for a substrate that contains a carboxylic acid, a known QD&#8208;binding group, is accelerated by more than a factor of ten from that expected from the electrochemical potential for the transformation, a result that suggests that formation of metastable electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes provides a significant kinetic advantage. This deprotection method does not perturb the common NHBoc or toluenesulfonyl protecting groups and, as demonstrated with an estrone substrate, does not perturb proximate ketones, which are generally vulnerable to many chemical reduction methods used for this class of reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploring ovarian cancer cell resistance to rhenium anticancer complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Rhenium tricarbonyl complexes have been recently investigated as novel anticancer agents. However, little is understood about their mechanisms of action, as well as the means by which cancer cells respond to chronic exposure to these compounds. To gain a deeper mechanistic insight into these rhenium anticancer agents, we developed and characterized an ovarian cancer cell line that is resistant to a previously studied compound [Re(CO)  3  (dmphen)(ptolICN)]  +  , where dmphen = 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and  p  tolICN =  para  &#8208;tolyl isonitrile, called TRIP. This TRIP&#8208;resistant ovarian cancer cell line, A2780TR, was found to be 9 times less sensitive to TRIP compared to the wild&#8208;type A2780 ovarian cancer cell line. Furthermore, the cytotoxicities of established drugs and other rhenium anticancer agents in the TRIP&#8208;resistant cell line were determined. Notably, the drug taxol was found to exhibit a 184&#8208;fold decrease in activity in the A2780TR cell line, suggesting that mechanisms of resistance towards TRIP and this drug are similar. Accordingly, expression levels of the ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter P&#8208;glycoprotein, an efflux transporter known to detoxify taxol, were found to be elevated in the A2780TR cell line. Additionally, a gene expression analysis using the National Cancer Institute 60 cell line panel identified the  MT1E  gene to be overexpressed in cells that are less sensitive to TRIP. Because this gene encodes for metallothioneins, this result suggests that detoxification by this class of proteins is another mechanism for resistance to TRIP. The importance of this gene in the A2780TR cell line was assessed, confirming that its expression is elevated in this cell line as well. As the first study to investigate and identify the cancer cell resistance pathways in response to a rhenium complex, this report high&#8208;lights important similarities and differences in the resistance responses of ovarian cancer cells to TRIP and conventional drugs.</dc:description>

We attribute this problem to toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement is an Exact Strand Displacement (ESD), where one invader strand corresponds to one specific substrate.

      <title>Dual&#8208;Functionalized Crescent Microgels for Selectively Capturing and Killing Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>In cancer therapy, the selective targeting of cancer cells while avoiding side effects to normal cells is still full of challenges. Here, we developed dual&#8208;functionalized crescent microgels, which selectively captured and killed lung cancer cells in situ without killing other cells.

Exposing the crescent hydrogels to physiological concentrations of glucose leads to the production of a locally high concentration of H  2  O  2  inside the microgels&#8217; cavities, due to the catalytic action by GOX inside the gel matrix, which selectively killed 90% cancer cells entrapped in the microgel cavities without killing the cells outside.

      <title>Ag2Au50(PET)36 Nanocluster: Dimeric Assembly of Au25(PET)18 Enabled by Silver Atoms</title>
      <dc:description>Assembly of atomically precise metal nanoclusters is now in the research spotlight, which offers exciting opportunities to gain fundamental insights into the hierarchical assembly of nanoparticles. However, it is still extremely challenging for controllable assembly of individual nanoclusters at a molecular&#8208; or atomic&#8208;level. Herein we report the dimeric assembly of Au25(PET)18  (PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiol), where two Au25(PET)18  monomers are bridged together by two Ag atoms to form the Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer. The Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer is an exclusive mesomer, which has not been found in any other chiral metal nanoclusters belonging to the racemic category. Furthermore, the Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer is distinct from the Au25(PET)18  monomer on the optical, electronic, and catalytic properties. This study is expected to provide a feasible strategy to precisely modulate the assembly of metal nanoclusters with controllable structures and properties.</dc:description>

      <title>DNA&#8208;Edited Ligand Positioning on Red Blood Cells to Enable Optimized T Cell Activation for Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Artificial antigen presenting cells (APCs) with surface&#8208;anchored T cell activating ligands hold great potential in adoptive immunotherapy. However, it remains challenging to precisely control the ligand positioning on those platforms via conventional bioconjugation chemistry. Here, utilizing DNA&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly, we are able to precisely control both lateral and vertical distribution of T cell activation ligands on red blood cells (RBCs). It is found that the clustered lateral positioning of peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on RBCs with a short vertical distance to the cell membrane would be favorable for more effective T cell activation, likely owing to their better mimic of natural APCs. Such optimized RBC&#8208;based artificial APCs can stimulate T cell proliferation in vivo and effectively inhibit tumor growth via adoptive immunotherapy. DNA technology is thus a unique tool to precisely engineer the cell membrane interface and tune cell&#8208;cell interactions, promising for a wide range of applications including immunotherapy.</dc:description>

      <title>DNA Nanolithography Enables Highly Ordered Recognition Interface in Microfluidic Chip for Efficient Capture and Release of Circulating Tumor Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Microfluidic chip with nano&#8208;scale structures has shown great potential, but the fabrication and cost issues restrict its application. Here, we propose a conceptually new &#8220;DNA nanolithography in microfluidic chip&#8221; by using sub&#8208;10 nm three&#8208;dimensional DNA structures (TDNs) as frameworks with a pendant aptamer at the top vertex (ApTDN&#8208;Chip). The nano&#8208;scale framework ensures the aptamer with a highly ordered upright orientation, avoiding the undesired orientation or crowding effects caused by conventional microfluidic interface fabrication processes. Compared with a monovalent aptamer modified chip, the capture efficiency of ApTDN&#8208;Chip was enhanced nearly 60% due to the highly precise dimension and rigid framework of TDNs. In addition, the confined tetrahedral nanostructure scaffolds make DNase I more accessible to aptamer with up to 83% release efficiency and 91% cell viability, which is fully compatible with downstream molecular analysis. Overall, &#8220;DNA nanolithography in microfluidic chip&#8221; provides a novel perspective to engineer nano&#8208;scaffolds to achieve a more ordered nano&#8208;topography of microfluidic chip.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical&#8208;Reductant&#8208;Free Electrochemical Deuteration Reaction using Deuterium Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report a protocol for electrochemical deuteration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds under catalyst&#8208; and external&#8208;reductant&#8208;free conditions with deuteration rates as high as 99% and yields up to 91% in 2 h. The use of graphite felt for both the cathode and the anode was key to ensuring chemoselectivity and high deuterium incorporation under neutral conditions without the need for an external reductant. This protocol has a number of advantages over previously reported deuteration reactions that use stoichiometric metallic reductants. Mechanistic experiments showed that O  2  evolution at the anode not only eliminated the need for an external reductant but also regulated the pH of the reaction mixture, keeping it approximately neutral.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a protocol for electrochemical deuteration of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds under catalyst&#8208; and external&#8208;reductant&#8208;free conditions with deuteration rates as high as 99% and yields up to 91% in 2 h. The use of graphite felt for both the cathode and the anode was key to ensuring chemoselectivity and high deuterium incorporation under neutral conditions without the need for an external reductant. This protocol has a number of advantages over previously reported deuteration reactions that use stoichiometric metallic reductants. Mechanistic experiments showed that O  2  evolution at the anode not only eliminated the need for an external reductant but also regulated the pH of the reaction mixture, keeping it approximately neutral.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation from CdTe Photoanodes Annealed with CdCl2</title>
      <dc:description>CdTe absorbs sunlight up to 830 nm and has the potential to promote efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, most CdTe photoanodes and CdTe photocathodes show positive and negative photocurrent onset potentials for water oxidation and reduction, respectively, and are thus unable to drive PEC water splitting without external applied biases. In this work, we enhanced the activity of a CdTe photoanode having an internal p&#8208;n junction during PEC water oxidation by applying a CdCl  2  annealing treatment together with surface modifications. The resulting CdTe photoanode generated photocurrents of 1.8 and 5.4 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 0.6 and 1.2 V  RHE  , respectively, with a photoanodic current onset potential of 0.22 V  RHE  under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G). The CdCl  2  annealing increased the grain sizes in this material and lowered the density of grain boundaries, allowing for more efficient charge separation. Consequently, a two&#8208;electrode tandem PEC cell comprising a CdTe&#8208;based photoanode and photocathode split water without any external bias at a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 0.51% at the beginning of the reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Multistability in an Anion Radical Pimer</title>
      <dc:description>Radical pimers are the simplest and most important models for studying charge transfer processes, and they provide deep insights into &#960;&#8208;stacked organic materials. Notably, radical pimer systems with magnetic bi&#8208; or multistability may have important applications in switchable materials, thermal sensors and information storage media. However, no such systems have been reported. Here, we describe a new pimer consisting of neutral  N  &#8208;(n&#8208;propyl) benzene triimide ([BTI&#8208;3C]) and its anionic radical ([BTI&#8208;3C]  &#8208;&#8226;  ), which exhibits rare magnetic multistability. The crystalline pimer was easily synthesized by reduction of BTI&#8208;3C with cobaltocene (CoCp  2  ). The transition occurs with a 27 K&#8208;width thermal hysteresis loop in the range of 170&#8208;220 K, accompanied by a smaller 25 K&#8208;width loop at 220&#8208;242 K. The magnetic multistabilty was attributed to the slippage of the &#960;&#8208;stacked BTI backbones and the entropy&#8208;driven conformational isomerization of the side propyl chains in the crystalline state during temperature variation. Our research demonstrated an unprecedented radical pimer showing magnetic multistability. The high diversity of the substituents on BTI provides great possibilities for designing multifunctional materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Micromotors for Multiple Motile Sperm Cells Capture, Transport, and Enzymatic Release</title>
      <dc:description>An integrated system combining a magnetically&#8208;driven micromotor and a synthetized protein&#8208;based hyaluronic acid (HA) microflake is presented as a novel strategy for the in&#8208;situ selection and transport of multiple motile sperm cells (ca. 50). The proposed system appeals for targeted sperm delivery in the reproductive system to assist fertilization or to deliver drugs in scenarios where tens to hundreds of sperm are required for an effective therapy. The binding mechanism between the HA microflake and sperm rely on the interactions between HA and the corresponding sperm HA receptors, which are expressed on the sperm membrane when they are mature and with intact DNA. Once sperm are captured within the HA microflake, the assembly is trapped and transported by a magnetically&#8208;driven helical microcarrier. The trapping of the sperm&#8208;microflake occurs by a local vortex induced by the microcarrier during rotation&#8208;translation under a rotating magnetic field. After transport, the microflake is enzymatically hydrolyzed by local proteases, allowing sperm to escape and finally reach the target location. This cargo&#8208;delivery system represents a new concept to transport not only multiple motile sperm but also other actively moving biological cargoes.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An integrated system combining a magnetically&#8208;driven micromotor and a synthetized protein&#8208;based hyaluronic acid (HA) microflake is presented as a novel strategy for the in&#8208;situ selection and transport of multiple motile sperm cells (ca. 50). The proposed system appeals for targeted sperm delivery in the reproductive system to assist fertilization or to deliver drugs in scenarios where tens to hundreds of sperm are required for an effective therapy. The binding mechanism between the HA microflake and sperm rely on the interactions between HA and the corresponding sperm HA receptors, which are expressed on the sperm membrane when they are mature and with intact DNA. Once sperm are captured within the HA microflake, the assembly is trapped and transported by a magnetically&#8208;driven helical microcarrier. The trapping of the sperm&#8208;microflake occurs by a local vortex induced by the microcarrier during rotation&#8208;translation under a rotating magnetic field. After transport, the microflake is enzymatically hydrolyzed by local proteases, allowing sperm to escape and finally reach the target location. This cargo&#8208;delivery system represents a new concept to transport not only multiple motile sperm but also other actively moving biological cargoes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Selective C  sp2  &#8208;C  sp2  couplings are powerful strategies for the rapid and programmable constructions of bi&#8208; or multiaryls.

The protocol makes use of visible light activation combined with gold&#8208;catalysis, which facilitates the selective coupling of C&#8208;Ge with aryl diazonium salts. Contrary to previous light/gold catalyzed couplings of Ar&#8208;N  2  +  , which were specialized in Ar&#8208;N  2  +  scope, we present conditions to efficiently couple electron&#8208;rich, &#8208;poor, heterocyclic and sterically hindered aryl diazonium salts.

      <title>Strategies for the Syntheses of Pactamycin and Jogyamycin</title>
      <dc:description>Pactamycin and jogyamycin are aminocyclopentitol natural products, where each core carbon bears a stereodefined alcohol or amine moiety. Their structural complexity, coupled with the diversity of functional groups co&#8208;existing in a condensed space, make them fascinating synthetic targets in their own right. Pactamycin and its derivatives bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit and display activity against parasites responsible for drug&#8208;resistant malaria and African sleeping sickness; however, efforts to develop their therapeutic potential have been hampered by their cellular toxicity. Interestingly, bioengineered analogues display differences in selectivity and toxicity towards mammalian cells, spurring efforts to develop flexible strategies to thoroughly probe structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR), particularly in analogues lacking the C7 hydroxyl group of pactamycin. This review compares and contrasts approaches towards pactamycin and jogyamycin, including two successful total syntheses of the former.

      <title>Multicomponent Organic Metal Halide Hybrid with White Emissions</title>
      <dc:description>Multicomponent single crystals have received great research attention for their capability of realizing multifunctionalities in a single phase material. Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids are an emerging class of ionically bonded crystalline materials, in which organic and metal halide ions co&#8208;crystallize to form neutral species. The rich choices of organic and metal halide components make 0D organic metal halide hybrids a highly promising platform for the development of multifunctional crystalline materials, which however are very much unexplored to date. Here we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a ternary 0D organic metal halide hybrid, (HMTA)  4  PbMn  0.69  Sn  0.31  Br  8  , in which an organic cation HMTA  +  (HMTA  +  : N&#8208;benzyl hexamethylenetetramium, C  13  H  19  N  4  +  ) co&#8208;crystallizes with multiple metal halide anions, i.e. PbBr  4  2&#8208;  , MnBr  4  2&#8208;  , and SnBr  4  2&#8208;  . The wide bandgap of the organic cation and distinct optical characteristics of three metal bromide anions enable a single crystalline &#8220;host&#8208;guest&#8221; system to exhibit emissions from multiple &#8220;guest&#8221; metal halide species simultaneously. The combination of these emissions could lead to a near&#8208;perfect white emission, with Commission Internationale d&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) of (0.32, 0.33), Color Rendering Index (CRI) of 95, and photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of around 73%. Due to distinct excitations of three metal halide species, warm to cool white emissions with Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT) varying from 3237 K to 12730 K could be realized by controlling the excitation wavelength.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A linked dicarboxylate phase&#8208;transfer catalyst enables smooth asymmetric dearomative fluorination of 2&#8208;naphthols with Selectfluor under mild conditions to give the corresponding 1&#8208;fluoronaphthalenone derivatives in a highly enantioselective manner. This reaction, which is compatible with various functional groups, is the first example of catalytic asymmetric fluorination of 2&#8208;naphthols, and is expected to be useful in the synthesis of bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tunable Surface Wrinkling by a Bio&#8208;Inspired Polyamine Anion Coacervation Process that Mediates the Assembly of Polyoxometalate Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Wrinkling desired: A bio&#8208;inspired assembly method renders spontaneous surface wrinkling on microsphere structures, in which the polyamine&#8208;multivalent anion interaction, following the Hofmeister series, plays a critical role both in assembling polyoxometalate nanoclusters and tuning the surface buckling effects.







Abstract
A bio&#8208;inspired method is used to render controlled wrinkling surface patterns on supramolecular architectures assembled from polyoxometalate (POM) clusters. It involves a polyamine&#8208;multivalent anion interaction generating positively charged coacervates, which while dictating the assembly of POM into spherical structures further facilitate an interesting surface morphogenesis with wrinkling patterns. This spontaneous surface wrinkling depends on the type of multivalent anion and the pH. As the polyamine&#8208;anion interaction becomes stronger, the wrinkles turn denser with lesser depth, which eventually undergoes post&#8208;buckling to engender a complex surface pattern. Interestingly, the order of influence exerted by different anions on the morphology follows the Hofmeister series. Moreover, the mild synthesis conditions keep the functional POM units dispersed in the sphere with a structural transformability to their lacunary form.

On the surface of it: Ligand&#8208;induced surface restructuring with heteroatomic doping is used to precisely modify the surface of a prototypical [Au25(SR1)18]&#8722; cluster while maintaining its icosahedral Au13 core for the synthesis of a new bimetallic [Au19Cd3(SR2)18]&#8722; cluster.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;induced surface restructuring with heteroatomic doping is used to precisely modify the surface of a prototypical [Au25(SR1)18]&#8722; cluster (1) while maintaining its icosahedral Au13 core for the synthesis of a new bimetallic [Au19Cd3(SR2)18]&#8722; cluster (2). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that six bidentate Au2(SR1)3 motifs (L2) attached to the Au13 core of 1 were replaced by three quadridentate Au2Cd(SR2)6 motifs (L4) to create a bimetallic cluster 2. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate a stronger electronic interaction between the surface motifs (Au2Cd(SR2)6) and the Au13 core, attributed to a more compact cluster structure and a larger energy gap of 2 compared to that of 1. These factors dramatically enhance the photoluminescence quantum efficiency and lifetime of crystal of the cluster 2. This work provides a new route for the design of a wide range of bimetallic/alloy metal nanoclusters with superior optoelectronic properties and functionality.

      <title>A Photoactivated Cu&#8211;CeO2 Catalyst with Cu&#8208;[O]&#8208;Ce Active Species Designed through MOF Crystal Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoactivated catalysis of the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide was achieved by using a catalyst with specified and homogeneously dispersed active species. The catalyst was designed through MOF crystal engineering and its integration of photothermal and photoelectric mechanisms realized the full utilization of solar energy with excellent stability.







Abstract
Fully utilizing solar energy for catalysis requires the integration of conversion mechanisms and therefore delicate design of catalyst structures and active species. Herein, a MOF crystal engineering method was developed to controllably synthesize a copper&#8211;ceria catalyst with well&#8208;dispersed photoactive Cu&#8208;[O]&#8208;Ce species. Using the preferential oxidation of CO as a model reaction, the catalyst showed remarkably efficient and stable photoactivated catalysis, which found practical application in feed gas treatment for fuel cell gas supply. The coexistence of photochemistry and thermochemistry effects contributes to the high efficiency. Our results demonstrate a catalyst design approach with atomic or molecular precision and a combinatorial photoactivation strategy for solar energy conversion.

      <title>Continuous and Segmented Semiconducting Fiber&#8208;like Nanostructures with Spatially Selective Functionalization by Living Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Uniform continuous and segmented semiconducting hybrid fiber&#8208;like nanostructures of controlled length and composition consisting of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated OPV core and P2VP coronas selectively decorated with diverse functional moieties were prepared by living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Fiber&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures are important components of flexible organic electronic and optoelectronic devices. To broaden the range of potential applications, one needs to control not only the length of these nanostructures, but the introduction of diverse functionality with spatially selective control. Here we report the synthesis of a crystalline&#8208;coil block copolymer of oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (OPV5&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP44), in which the basicity and coordinating/chelating ability of the P2VP segment provide a landscape for the incorporation of a variety of functional inorganic NPs. Through a self&#8208;seeding strategy, we were able to prepare monodisperse fiber&#8208;like micelles of OPV5&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP44 with lengths ranging from 50 to 800&#8197;nm. Significantly, the exposed two ends of OPV core of these fiber&#8208;like micelles remained active toward further epitaxial deposition of OPV5&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM49 and OPV5&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP44 to generate uniform A&#8208;B&#8208;A and B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B segmented block comicelles with tunable lengths for each block. The P2VP domains in these (co&#8208;)micelles can be selectively decorated with inorganic and polymeric nanoparticles as well as metal oxide coatings, to afford hybrid fiber&#8208;like nanostructures. This work provides a versatile strategy toward the fabrication of narrow length dispersity continuous and segmented &#960;&#8208;conjugated OPV&#8208;containing fiber&#8208;like micelles with the capacity to be decorated in a spatially selective way with varying functionalities.

      <title>Phosphorus Vacancies that Boost Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Two Orders of Magnitude</title>
      <dc:description>
Phosphorus vacancies have been created and their boosting effect to alkaline electrocatalytic HER is demonstrated. The nickel phosphide with phosphorus vacancies exhibits outstanding HER activity, kinetics, and stability that even outperform the Pt/C benchmark. DFT calculations suggest the greatly improved HER activity can be ascribed to the enriched electron density of Ni and P atoms near the vacancies.







Abstract
Vacancy engineering is an effective strategy to manipulate the electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve their performance, but few reports focus on phosphorus vacancies (Pv). Herein, the creation of Pv in metal phosphides and investigation of their role in alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is presented. The Pv&#8208;modified catalyst requires a minimum onset potential of 0&#8197;mV vs. RHE, a small overpotential of 27.7&#8197;mV to achieve 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 geometric current density and a Tafel slope of 30.88&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, even outperforms the Pt/C benchmark (32.7&#8197;mV@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 30.90&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). This catalyst also displays superior stability up to 504&#8197;hours without any decay. Experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations suggest Pv can weaken the hybridization of Ni&#8197;3d and P&#8197;2p orbitals, enrich the electron density of Ni and P atoms nearby Pv, and facilitate H* desorption process, contributing to outstanding HER activity and facile kinetics.

      <title>Divergent Strain&#8208;Release Amino&#8208;Functionalization of [1.1.1]Propellane with Electrophilic Nitrogen&#8208;Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrophilic nitrogen&#8208;radicals enable efficient strain&#8208;release amino&#8208;functionalization of [1.1.1]propellane. This radical reactivity can be used for the divergent assembly of 3&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentylamines, which are powerful aniline bioisosteres.







Abstract
Herein we report the development of a photocatalytic strategy for the divergent preparation of functionalized bicyclo[1.1.1]pentylamines. This approach exploits, for the first time, the ability of nitrogen&#8208;radicals to undergo strain&#8208;release reaction with [1.1.1]propellane. This reactivity is facilitated by the electrophilic nature of these open&#8208;shell intermediates and the presence of strong polar effects in the transition&#8208;state for C&#8722;N bond formation/ring&#8208;opening. With the aid of a simple reductive quenching photoredox cycle, we have successfully harnessed this novel radical strain&#8208;release amination as part of a multicomponent cascade compatible with several external trapping agents. Overall, this radical strategy enables the rapid construction of novel amino&#8208;functionalized building blocks with potential application in medicinal chemistry programs as p&#8208;substituted aniline bioisosteres.

      <title>Activating Pronucleophiles with High pKa Values: Chiral Organo&#8208;Superbases</title>
      <dc:description>
Superbase: This Minireview focuses on chiral organo&#8208;superbases as catalysts in asymmetric reactions of pronucleophiles with high pKa values. The performance of the organo&#8208;superbases, compared to conventional tertiary amine bases, is highlighted. The advantage of these new superbases lies in the opportunity to develop more asymmetric transformations of weakly acidic pronucleophiles.







Abstract
Direct deprotonation represents an extremely simple, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economic strategy to activate pronucleophiles bearing an acidic proton. However, the difficulty often arises in activating pronucleophiles with high pKa values by using conventional chiral tertiary amines. To overcome this challenge, a handful of novel chiral Br&#248;nsted superbases, including amidines, guanidines, cyclopropenimines, and iminophosphoranes, have been discovered in recent years. This minireview focuses on the application of these organo&#8208;superbases in the catalytic asymmetric reactions of weakly acidic pronucleophiles, and highlights their comparison to the conventional tertiary amines, demonstrating the highly efficient deprotonation processes and stereoselectivity controlled conversions of the superbases. The advantage of these new superbases brings a great opportunity for developing more asymmetric transformations of weakly acidic pronucleophiles.

      <title>Coupling of Solar Energy and Thermal Energy for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Status and Prospects</title>
      <dc:description>
A bundle of energy: The coupling of solar energy and thermal energy is a promising strategy to mediate the activity and/or selectivity of CO2 reduction. The status and prospects of this topic are reviewed, with the aim of providing guidelines for the design of new catalysts.







Abstract
Enormous efforts have been devoted to the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) by utilizing various driving forces, such as heat, electricity, and radiation. However, the efficient reduction of CO2 is still challenging because of sluggish kinetics. Recent pioneering studies from several groups, including us, have demonstrated that the coupling of solar energy and thermal energy offers a novel and promising strategy to promote the activity and/or manipulate selectivity in CO2 reduction. Herein, we clarify the definition and principles of coupling solar energy and thermal energy, and comprehensively review the status and prospects of CO2 reduction by coupling solar energy and thermal energy. Catalyst design, reactor configuration, photo&#8208;mediated activity/selectivity, and mechanism studies in photo&#8208;thermo CO2 reduction will be emphasized. The aim of this Review is to promote understanding towards CO2 activation and provide guidelines for the design of new catalysts for the efficient reduction of CO2.

      <title>Difunctionalization of Alkenes Involving Metal Migration</title>
      <dc:description>
Driving force: The difunctionalization of alkenes involving metal migration provides access to a new class of products that are not readily synthesized by other methods. This Minireview summarizes recent advances in the field, with an emphasis on the driving force for metal migration.







Abstract
The direct difunctionalization of alkenes, a cheap and abundant feedstock, represents one of the most attractive strategies for increasing molecular complexity in synthetic organic chemistry. In contrast with the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes, recent advances showcase alkene 1,n&#8208;difunctionalizations (n&#8800;2) involving metal migration is an emerging and rapidly growing area of research. This promising strategy not only opens a novel avenue for future development of alkene transformations, but also significantly expands upon the bond disconnections available in modern organic synthesis. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the migratory difunctionalization of alkenes, with an emphasis on the driving force for metal migration.

      <title>Fabrication of Heterostructured Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 Nanocages with Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterostructured Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 nanocages are fabricated through a facile synthetic approach. With the advantages of the novel hollow heterostructure, the well&#8208;defined FeTi2O5&#8211;TiO2 nanocages exhibit enhanced photoelectrochemical performance compared with TiO2 nanodisks, Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles, and Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 nanoparticles.







Abstract
Photocatalysts with well&#8208;designed compositions and structures are desirable for achieving highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Heterostructured semiconductor photocatalysts with advanced hollow structures possess beneficial features for promoting the activity towards photocatalytic reactions. Here we develop a facile synthetic strategy for the fabrication of Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 nanocages (NCs) as anode materials in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cells. A hydrothermal reaction is performed to transform MIL&#8208;125(Ti) nanodisks (NDs) to Ti&#8211;Fe&#8211;O NCs, which are further converted to Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 NCs through a post annealing process. Owing to the compositional and structural advantages, the heterostructured Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 NCs show enhanced performance for PEC water oxidation compared with TiO2 NDs, Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles (NPs) and Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 NPs.

A hydrothermal reaction is performed to transform MIL&#8208;125(Ti) nanodisks (NDs) to Ti&#8211;Fe&#8211;O NCs, which are further converted to Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NCs through a post annealing process. Owing to the compositional and structural advantages, the heterostructured Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NCs show enhanced performance for PEC water oxidation compared with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NDs, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (NPs) and Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electron Transfer in the Cs&#8834;{Mn4Fe4} Cubic Switch: A Soluble Molecular Model of the MnFe Prussian&#8208;Blue Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>
Out of the blue: The Cs&#8834;{Mn4Fe4} cube, the first soluble molecular model of MnFe Prussian&#8208;blue analogues, is analyzed using X&#8208;ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, and magnetic measurements. Near room temperature, a spin&#8208;state change occurs which could be ascribed to a metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer.







Abstract
A mixed&#8208;valence {MnII3MnIIIFeII2FeIII2} cyanide&#8208;bridged molecular cube hosting a caesium cation, Cs&#8834;{Mn4Fe4}, was synthesized and structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Cyclic&#8208;voltammetry measurements show that its electronic state can be switched between five different redox states, which results in a remarkable electrochromic effect. Magnetic measurements on fresh samples point to the occurrence of a spin&#8208;state change near room temperature, which could be ascribed to a metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer converting the {FeII&#8722;CN&#8722;MnIII} pair into a {FeIII&#8722;CN&#8722;MnII} pair. This feature was only previously observed in the polymeric MnFe Prussian&#8208;blue analogues (PBAs). Moreover, this novel switchable molecule proved to be soluble and stable in organic solvents, paving the way for its integration into advanced materials.

      <title>Cove&#8208;Edged Nanographenes with Localized Double Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Cove&#8208;edged, contorted nanographenes! Large&#8208;size nanographenes with a cove&#8208;type periphery and contorted structure were synthesized. They contain localized C=C double bonds (see picture, in purple) and they have a very different electronic structure to the all&#8208;benzenoid NGs.







Abstract
The efficient synthesis and electronic properties of two large&#8208;size cove&#8208;edged nanographenes (NGs), CN1 and CN2, are presented. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals a contorted backbone for both molecules owing to the steric repulsion at the inner cove position. Noticeably, the dominant structures of these molecules contain four (for CN1) or six (for CN2) localized C=C double bonds embedded in nine (for CN1) or twelve (for CN2) aromatic sextet rings according to Clar's formula, which is supported by bond length analysis and theoretical (NICS, ACID) calculations. Furthermore, Raman spectra exhibit a band associated with the longitudinal CC stretching mode of olefinic double bonds. Owing to the existence of the additional olefinic bonds, both compounds show a small band gap (1.84&#8197;eV for CN1 and 1.37&#8197;eV for CN2). They also display moderate fluorescence quantum yield (35&#8201;% for CN1 and 50&#8201;% for CN2) owing to the contorted geometry, which can suppress aggregation in solution.

      <title>On the Binding of Congo Red to Amyloid Fibrils</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooperative labelling of amyloids: Congo red binds to amyloid fibrils with the long axis oblique to the fibril axis and the plane radial to the fibril core, following a cooperative mechanism characterized by the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex.







Abstract
Amyloids are characterized by their capacity to bind Congo red (CR), one of the most used amyloid&#8208;specific dyes. The structural features of CR binding were unknown for years, mainly because of the lack of amyloid structures solved at high resolution. In the last few years, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy enabled the determination of the structural features of amyloids, such as the HET&#8208;s prion forming domain (HET&#8208;s PFD), which also has recently been used to determine the amyloid&#8211;CR interface at atomic resolution. Herein, we combine spectroscopic data with molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and excitonic quantum/molecular mechanics calculations to examine and rationalize CR binding to amyloids. In contrast to a previous assumption on the binding mode, our results suggest that CR binding to the HET&#8208;s PFD involves a cooperative process entailing the formation of a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry. This provides a molecular basis to explain the bathochromic shift in the maximal absorbance wavelength when CR is bound to amyloids.

      <title>Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Deficient Corona[5]arenes and Their Selective Complexation with Dihydrogen Phosphate: Cooperative Effects of Anion&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Let's cooperate! Diverse electron&#8208;deficient corona[3]arene[2]tetrazines were efficiently synthesized by coupling reactions and post&#8208;macrocyclization oxidation reactions. As electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles, they serve as powerful and highly selective receptors for the hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer of dihydrogen phosphate, forming the complexes through cooperative anion&#8211;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
Reported here are the syntheses, conformational structures, electrochemical properties, and noncovalent anion binding of corona[5]arenes. A (3+2) fragment coupling reaction proceeded efficiently under mild reaction conditions to produce a number of novel heteroatom&#8208; and methylene&#8208;bridged corona[3]arene[2]tetrazine macrocycles. Selective oxidation of the sulfur atom between two phenylene rings afforded sulfoxide&#8208; and sulfone&#8208;linked corona[5]arenes in good yields. All corona[5]arenes synthesized adopted similar 1,2,4&#8208;alternate conformational structures, forming pentagonal cavities. The cavity sizes and the electronic properties such as redox potentials, were measured with CV and DPV, and were influenced by the different bridging units. As electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles, the acquired corona[3]arene[2]tetrazines served as highly selective hosts, forming complexes with the hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer of dihydrogen phosphate through cooperative anion&#8211;&#960; interactions.

      <title>Direct Access to Isotopically Labeled Aliphatic Ketones Mediated by Nickel(I) Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Squeezing in CO: NiI complexes can promote the carbonylative coupling of NiII&#8208;acyl complexes with primary and secondary iodides to provide a general method for accessing aliphatic ketones directly from carbon monoxide. The methodology is ideal for carbon isotope labeling and illustrated with examples for accessing carbon&#8197;13 and carbon&#8197;14 bioactive molecules.







Abstract
An extensive range of functionalized aliphatic ketones with good functional&#8208;group tolerance has been prepared by a NiI&#8208;promoted coupling of either primary or secondary alkyl iodides with NN2 pincer NiII&#8208;acyl complexes. The latter were easily accessed from the corresponding NiII&#8208;alkyl complexes with stoichiometric CO. This Ni&#8208;mediated carbonylative coupling is adaptable to late&#8208;stage carbon isotope labeling, as illustrated by the preparation of isotopically labelled pharmaceuticals. Preliminary investigations suggest the intermediacy of carbon&#8208;centered radicals.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Squeezing in CO&lt;/b&gt;: Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes can promote the carbonylative coupling of Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;acyl complexes with primary and secondary iodides to provide a general method for accessing aliphatic ketones directly from carbon monoxide. The methodology is ideal for carbon isotope labeling and illustrated with examples for accessing carbon&#8197;13 and carbon&#8197;14 bioactive molecules.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extensive range of functionalized aliphatic ketones with good functional&#8208;group tolerance has been prepared by a Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;promoted coupling of either primary or secondary alkyl iodides with NN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pincer Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;acyl complexes. The latter were easily accessed from the corresponding Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;alkyl complexes with stoichiometric CO. This Ni&#8208;mediated carbonylative coupling is adaptable to late&#8208;stage carbon isotope labeling, as illustrated by the preparation of isotopically labelled pharmaceuticals. Preliminary investigations suggest the intermediacy of carbon&#8208;centered radicals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Indium&#8208;Seamed Hexameric Metal&#8211;Organic Cage as an Example of a Hexameric Pyrogallol[4]arene Capsule Conjoined Exclusively by Trivalent Metal Ions</title>
      <dc:description>
Zip it up: The formation of a pyrogallol[4]arene (PgC5)&#8208;based indium&#8208;seamed hexameric capsule is presented. The reaction involves stitching of 6 PgC5 macrocycles by 24 InIII ions to form the supramolecular structure.







Abstract
A hexameric metal&#8211;organic nanocapsule is assembled from pyrogallol[4]arene units, which are stitched together with indium ions. This indium&#8208;seamed capsule is the first instance of a M24L6 type hexameric coordination cage held together exclusively by trivalent metal ions. Explicitly, unlike previously reported pyrogallol[4]arene&#8208;based metal&#8208;seamed capsules, the current In3+ seamed capsule is entirely supported by O&#8594;In coordinate bonds. This work demonstrates the important proof of concept of the ability of pyrogallol[4]arene to react with metals in higher oxidation states to assemble into atomically&#8208;precise hexameric coordination cages. As such, these results open up exciting avenues toward the assembly of previously unanticipated metal&#8211;organic capsules, for example offering inspiration for tackling metals exhibiting high valence states such as in the lanthanide and actinide series.

      <title>Redox&#8208;Triggered Chirality Switching and Guest&#8208;Capture/Release with a Pillar[6]arene&#8208;Based Molecular Universal Joint</title>
      <dc:description>
The ins and outs of it: Redox reaction of a chiral electrochemically responsive molecular universal joint leads to a self&#8208;inclusion/exclusion conformational switching. This results in an unprecedented electrochemically controlled binding and release of guest molecules.







Abstract
A chiral electrochemically responsive molecular universal joint (EMUJ) was synthesized by fusing a macrocyclic pillar[6]arene (P[6]) to a ferrocene&#8208;based side ring. A single crystal of an enantiopure EMUJ was successfully obtained, which allowed, for the first time, the definitive correlation between the absolute configuration and the circular dichroism spectrum of a P[6] derivative to be determined. The self&#8208;inclusion and self&#8208;exclusion conformational change of the EMUJ led to a chiroptical inversion of the P[6] moiety, which could be manipulated by both solvents and changes in temperature. The EMUJ also displayed a unique redox&#8208;triggered reversible in/out conformational switching, corresponding to an occupation/voidance switching of the P[6] cavity, respectively. This phenomenon is an unprecedented electrochemical manipulation of the capture and release of guest molecules by supramolecular hosts.

      <title>Emission of toxic HCN during NOx removal by ammonia SCR in the exhaust of lean&#8208;burn natural gas engines</title>
      <dc:description>Reducing greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions is one of the most stringent priorities of our society to minimize their dramatic effects on health and environment. Natural gas (NG) engines, in particular at lean conditions, emit less CO  2  in comparison to combustion engines operated with liquid fuels but NG engines still require emission control devices for NO  x  removal. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO  x  with NH  3  , we evaluated the interplay of the reducing agent NH  3  and formaldehyde, which is always present in the exhaust of NG engines. Our results show that a significant amount of highly toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is formed over typical NO  x  removal catalysts. All catalysts tested partially convert formaldehyde to HCOOH and CO. Additionally they form secondary emissions of HCN due to catalytic reactions of formaldehyde and its oxidation intermediates with NH  3  . Considering that with the present components of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system the HCN emissions are not efficiently converted to non&#8208;polluting gases, the development of more advanced catalyst formulations with improved oxidation activity is mandatory to solve this novel critical issue.</dc:description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Magic&#8208;Size Cluster Precursor Compounds into Ultrasmall CdS Quantum Dots with Enhanced Particle Yield at Low Temperatures</title>
      <dc:description>
Small&#8208;size CdS quantum dots are synthesized without the coexistence of the precursor compound and thus with enhanced particle yield. It is shown that after the formation of the precursor compound in the pre&#8208;nucleation stage, the addition of tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide facilitates the production of small&#8208;size QDs.







Abstract
Colloidal small&#8208;size CdS quantum dots (QDs) are produced usually with low particle yield, together with side products such as the particular precursor compounds (PCs) of magic&#8208;size clusters (MSC). Here, we report our synthesis of small&#8208;size CdS QDs without the coexistence of the PC and thus with enhanced particle yield. For a conventional reaction of cadmium oleate (Cd(OA)2) and sulfur (S) in 1&#8208;octadecene (ODE), we show that after the formation of the PC in the pre&#8208;nucleation stage, the addition of tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) facilitates the production of small&#8208;size QDs. We demonstrate that TOPO fragmentizes the PC that have formed, which enables the nucleation and growth of small&#8208;size QDs even at room temperature. Our findings introduce a new approach to making small&#8208;size QDs without the coexistence of the PC and with improved particle yield. Providing experimental evidence for the two&#8208;pathway model proposed for the pre&#8208;nucleation stage of colloidal binary QDs, the present study aids in the advance of non&#8208;classical nucleation theory.

      <title>Using the Secondary PH/BH Functional Groups of an Active Geminal Frustrated Lewis Pair for Carbon Monoxide Reduction and Reactions with Nitriles and Isonitriles</title>
      <dc:description>
A P/B pair: The geminal secondary phosphane/borane (PH/BH) pair reduces carbon monoxide to a formaldehyde unit at the P/B template. Formaldehyde is liberated in a subsequent reaction. The PH/BH pair also reacts with benzonitrile to give a P&#8208;benzamidine (not shown).







Abstract
Reaction of the secondary alkynyl(Mes*)PH phosphane 2 with (Fmes)BH2&#8901;SMe2 gives the geminal PH/BH frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) 3. The PH and the BH functions are jointly used in the reduction of carbon monoxide under mild reaction conditions to give the [P]&#8208;CH2&#8208;O&#8208;[B] product. A subsequent cycloaddition sequence results in the liberation of formaldehyde. The FLP 3 reacts with benzonitrile to give a P&#8208;benzamidine, and it couples two isonitriles at the FLP framework.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A P/B pair&lt;/b&gt;: The geminal secondary phosphane/borane (PH/BH) pair reduces carbon monoxide to a formaldehyde unit at the P/B template. Formaldehyde is liberated in a subsequent reaction. The PH/BH pair also reacts with benzonitrile to give a P&#8208;benzamidine (not shown).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction of the secondary alkynyl(Mes*)PH phosphane &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with (Fmes)BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;SMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives the geminal PH/BH frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. The PH and the BH functions are jointly used in the reduction of carbon monoxide under mild reaction conditions to give the [P]&#8208;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;O&#8208;[B] product. A subsequent cycloaddition sequence results in the liberation of formaldehyde. The FLP &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; reacts with benzonitrile to give a P&#8208;benzamidine, and it couples two isonitriles at the FLP framework.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
A sound approach: Photo&#8208;triggered anticancer therapeutic modalities are usually limited by their low penetrative depth. An alternative approach is sonodynamic therapy (SDT), which uses high&#8208;penetrating acoustic waves to activate sound&#8208;responsive materials. This Review gives a summary and discussion of such sonosensitizers.







Abstract
Modalities for photo&#8208;triggered anticancer therapy are usually limited by their low penetrative depth. Sonotheranostics especially sonodynamic therapy (SDT), which is different from photodynamic therapy (PDT) by the use of highly penetrating acoustic waves to activate a class of sound&#8208;responsive materials called sonosensitizers, has gained significant interest in recent years. The effect of SDT is closely related to the structural and physicochemical properties of the sonosensitizers, which has led to the development of new sound&#8208;activated materials as sonosensitizers for various biomedical applications. This Review provides a summary and discussion of the types of novel sonosensitizers developed in the last few years and outlines their specific designs and the potential challenges. The applications of sonosensitizers with various functions such as for imaging and drug delivery as well as in combination with other treatment modalities would provide new strategies for disease therapy.

Stereoselective [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of alkenylboranes and dienes was accomplished through the introduction of chiral N&#8208;protonated alkenyl oxazaborolidines as dieneophiles. The reaction gives products that can be readily derivatized to more complex structural motifs through stereospecific transformations of the C&#8722;B bond such as oxidation and homologation.

Abstract
A method for the stereoselective [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of alkenylboranes and dienes is presented. This transformation was accomplished through the introduction of a new strategy that involves the use of chiral N&#8208;protonated alkenyl oxazaborolidines as dieneophiles. The reaction leads to the formation of products that can be readily derivatized to more complex structural motifs through stereospecific transformations of the C&#8722;B bond such as oxidation and homologation. Detailed computation evaluation of the reaction has uncovered a surprising role of the counterion on stereoselectivity.

      <title>A Novel D Peptide Identified by Mirror&#8208;image Phage Display Blocks TIGIT/PVR for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>The low response rate and adaptive resistance of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 blockade demands the studies on novel therapeutic targets for cancer immunotherapy. We discovered that a novel immune checkpoint TIGIT expressed higher than PD&#8208;1 in many tumors especially anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 resistant tumors. Here, mirror&#8208;image phage display bio&#8208;panning was performed using the D&#8208;enantiomer of TIGIT synthesized by hydrazide&#8208;based native chemical ligation. D peptide  D  TBP&#8208;3 was identified, which could occupy the binding interface and effectively block the interaction of TIGIT with its ligand PVR.  D  TBP&#8208;3 showed proteolytic resistance, tumor tissue penetrating ability, and significant tumor suppressing effects in a CD8  +  T cell dependent manner. More importantly,  D  TBP&#8208;3 could inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 resistant tumor model. This is the first D peptide targeting TIGIT, which could serve as a potential candidate for cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The low response rate and adaptive resistance of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 blockade demands the studies on novel therapeutic targets for cancer immunotherapy. We discovered that a novel immune checkpoint TIGIT expressed higher than PD&#8208;1 in many tumors especially anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 resistant tumors. Here, mirror&#8208;image phage display bio&#8208;panning was performed using the D&#8208;enantiomer of TIGIT synthesized by hydrazide&#8208;based native chemical ligation. D peptide  D  TBP&#8208;3 was identified, which could occupy the binding interface and effectively block the interaction of TIGIT with its ligand PVR.  D  TBP&#8208;3 showed proteolytic resistance, tumor tissue penetrating ability, and significant tumor suppressing effects in a CD8  +  T cell dependent manner. More importantly,  D  TBP&#8208;3 could inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 resistant tumor model. This is the first D peptide targeting TIGIT, which could serve as a potential candidate for cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Designing 3D&#8208;MoS2 Sponge as Excellent Cocatalysts in Advanced Oxidation Processes for Pollutant Control</title>
      <dc:description>3D&#8208;MoS2 can adsorb organic molecules and provide multidimensional electron transport pathways, implying a signi&#64257;cant potential application for environment remediation. Here, we study the degradation of aromatic organics in AOPs by a 3D&#8208;MoS2 sponge loaded with MoS2 nanospheres and graphene oxide (GO). Exposed Mo4+ active sites on 3D&#8208;MoS2 can significantly improve the concentration and stability of Fe2+ in AOPs, and keep the Fe3+/Fe2+ in a stable dynamic cycle, thus effectively promoting the activation of H2O2/PMS. The degradation rate of organic pollutants in the 3D&#8208;MoS2 system is ~50 times higher than that in the case without cocatalyst. Even after 140 L pilot&#8208;scale experiment, it still maintains high efficiency and stable AOPs activity. After 16 days of continuous reaction, the 3D&#8208;MoS2 can achieve the degradation rate of 120 mg/L antibiotic wastewater up to 97.87%. The operating cost of treating a ton of wastewater is only 0.33 $, suggesting it has huge industrial applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Conjugated Polymer Entailing Arylazopyrazole Units in the Side Chains for Optically Tunable Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by Near Infra&#8208;red Light</title>
      <dc:description>Optically tunable field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with near infra&#8208;red (NIR) light show promising applications in various areas. Here, we incorporate arylazopyrazole groups in the side chains of a semiconducting donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymer. The  cis  &#8208;  trans  interconversion of the arylazopyrazole can be controlled by 980 nm and 808 nm NIR light irradiation, by utilising NaYF  4  :Yb,Tm upconversion nanoparticles and the photothermal effect&#160;of conjugated D&#8208;A polymers, respectively. This reversible transformation affects the interchain packing of the polymer thin film, which in turn reversibly tunes the semiconducting properties of the FETs by the successive 980 nm and 808 nm light irradiation. The resultant FETs display fast response to NIR light, good resistance to photofatigue, and stability in storage for up to 120 days. These unique features will be useful in future memory and bioelectronic wearable devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing Machinery Using Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Vehicles</title>
      <dc:description>Recent innovations in genome editing have enabled the precise manipulation of the genetic information of mammalians, and benefitted the development of next&#8208;generation gene therapy. Despite these advances, several barriers to the clinical translation of genome editing remain, including the intracellular delivery of genome editing machinery, and the risk of off&#8208;target editing effect. Here, we review the recent advance of spatiotemporal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing machinery, which is composed of programmable Cas9 nuclease and a single&#8208;guide RNA (sgRNA) using stimuli&#8208;responsive  nanoparticles. We discuss the specific chemistries that have been used for controlled Cas9/sgRNA delivery and intracellular release in the presence of endogenous or external signals. These methodologies can leverage biological signals found locally within disease cells, or exogenous signals administrated with spatiotemporal control, through which an improved genome editing could be achieved. We also discuss the future in exploiting these approaches for fundamental biomedical applications and therapeutic genome editing.</dc:description>

      <title>Triplet acceptors with D&#8208;A structure and twisted conformation for efficient organic solar cells</title>
      <dc:description>Triplet acceptors have been developed to construct high performance organic solar cells (OSCs) since the long lifetime and diffusion range of triplet excitons may dissociate into free charges instead of net recombination when the energy levels of triplet states (T  1  ) are close to those of charge transfer states (  3  CT). The current triplet acceptors were designed by introducing heavy atoms to enhance the intersystem crossing, limiting their applications. Herein, two twisted acceptors without heavy atoms, analogues of Y6, were constructed with large &#960;&#8208;conjugated core and D&#8208;A structure, proved to be triplet materials, leading to a high performance OSCs. The mechanism of triplet excitons were investigated to show that the twisted and D&#8208;A structures result in large spin orbital coupling (SOC) and small energy gap between the singlet and triplet states, and thus efficient intersystem crossing. Moreover, the energy level of T  1  is close to  3  CT, facilitating the split of triplet exciton to free charges. This contribution provided new insights in working mechanism of triplet excitons in OSCs.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Triplet acceptors have been developed to construct high performance organic solar cells (OSCs) since the long lifetime and diffusion range of triplet excitons may dissociate into free charges instead of net recombination when the energy levels of triplet states (T  1  ) are close to those of charge transfer states (  3  CT). The current triplet acceptors were designed by introducing heavy atoms to enhance the intersystem crossing, limiting their applications. Herein, two twisted acceptors without heavy atoms, analogues of Y6, were constructed with large &#960;&#8208;conjugated core and D&#8208;A structure, proved to be triplet materials, leading to a high performance OSCs. The mechanism of triplet excitons were investigated to show that the twisted and D&#8208;A structures result in large spin orbital coupling (SOC) and small energy gap between the singlet and triplet states, and thus efficient intersystem crossing. Moreover, the energy level of T  1  is close to  3  CT, facilitating the split of triplet exciton to free charges. This contribution provided new insights in working mechanism of triplet excitons in OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Huisgen&#8217;s 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions to Fulvenes via Ambimodal [6+4]/[4+2] Transition States</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  Huisgen&#8217;s 1960 announcement of the concept of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions was published the year before Alder&#8217;s study of the reaction of diazomethane and dimethylfulvene. The diazomethane reaction was studied again in 1970 by Houk et al., and shown to give a [6+4] adduct. Padwa&#8217;s nitrile ylide cycloaddition to dimethylfulvene (1978) gave [6+4] and [4+2] adducts. We have performed computational studies of these reactions with DFT and show that they involve ambimodal [6+4]/[4+2] transition states that can lead to either type of cycloadduct from one transition state. We dedicate this paper to the extraordinary life and humanity of Rolf Huisgen, and to the undying influence of his discoveries on chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Dissipative assembly of macrocycles comprising multiple transient bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Dissipative (nonequilibrium) assembly powered by chemical fuels has great potential for the creation of new adaptive chemical systems. However, while molecular assembly at equilibrium is routinely used to prepare complex architectures from polyfunctional monomers, species formed out of equilibrium have, to this point, been structurally very simple. In most examples the fuel simply effects the formation of a single short&#8208;lived covalent bond. Here, we show that chemical fuels can assemble bifunctional components into macrocycles containing multiple transient bonds. Specifically, dicarboxylic acids give aqueous dianhydride macrocycles on treatment with a carbodiimide. The macrocycles are assembled efficiently as a consequence of both fuel&#8208;dependent and &#8208;independent mechanisms: they undergo slower decomposition, building up as the fuel recycles the components, and are a favored product of the dynamic exchange of the anhydride bonds. These results create new possibilities for generating structurally sophisticated out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium species.</dc:description>

It exhibits concrete ferroelectricity including Curie temperature of 305 K and large spontaneous polarization of 3.2 &#956;C/cm  2  , triggered by dynamic ordering of organic cation and tilting motions of heterometal AgBr  6  /BiBr  6  octahedra. Besides, the alternating array of inorganic perovskite sheets and organic cations endows large mobility&#8208;lifetime product (  &#956;&#964;  = 1.0&#215;10  &#8208;3  cm  2  &#8729;V  &#8208;1  ) for detecting X&#8208;ray photons, being almost tenfold higher than that of CH  3  NH  3  PbI  3  wafers. As far as we know, this is the first study on X&#8208;ray&#8208;sensitive ferroelectric of 2D halide double perovskites.

      <title>Inverse vulcanized polymers with shape memory, enhanced mechanical properties, and vitrimer behavior</title>
      <dc:description>The invention of inverse vulcanization provides great opportunities for generating functional polymers directly from elemental sulfur, an industrial by&#8208;product. However, unsatisfactory mechanical properties have limited the scope for wider applications of these exciting materials. Here, we report an effective synthesis method that significantly improves mechanical properties of sulfur&#8208;polymers and allows control of performance. A linear pre&#8208;polymer containing hydroxyl functional group was produced, which could be stored at room temperature for long periods of time. This prepolymer was then further cross linked by difunctional isocyanate secondary crosslinker. By adjusting the molar ratio of crosslinking functional groups, the tensile strength was controlled, ranging from 0.14&#177;0.01 MPa to 20.17&#177;2.18 MPa, and strain was varied from 11.85&#177;0.88% to 51.20&#177;5.75%. Control of hardness, flexibility, solubility and function of the material were also demonstrated. We were able to produce materials with suitable combination of flexibility and strength, with excellent shape memory function. Combined with the unique dynamic property of S&#8208;S bonds, these polymer networks have an attractive, vitrimer&#8208;like ability for being reshaped and recycled, despite their crosslinked structures. This new synthesis method could open the door for wider applications of sustainable sulfur&#8208;polymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Thiophene cation intercalation improves bandedge integrity in reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites with reduced&#8208;dimensional (RD) crystal structures have attracted attention for application in photovoltaics. The insertion of large organic cations increases the crystal formation energy and regulates the growth orientation of the inorganic domains, which benefits materials and device stability. However, the power conversion performance of RD perovskite devices is curtailed by the insulating nature of the bulky cations. Here we investigate a series of RD perovskites with 2&#8208;thiophenmethylammonium (TMA) as the intercalating cation. Compared with traditional ligands, such as phenethylammonium (PEA), TMA demonstrates improved electron transfer in the inorganic framework. In addition, TMA modifies the near&#8208;bandedge integrity of the RD perovskite, improving hole transport. We achieve as a result a power conversion efficiency of 19%, the highest efficiency reported to date for TMA&#8208;based RD perovskite photovoltaics; these TMA devices provide a 12% relative increase in PCE compared to control RD perovskite devices that use PEA as the intercalating ligand, a result of the improved charge transfer from the inorganic layer to the organic ligands.</dc:description>
