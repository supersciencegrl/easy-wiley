         <title>Spin&#8208;State Manipulation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Enhanced Metal&#8208;Oxygen Covalency for Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aprotic Li&#8208;O  2  battery has attracted extensive attention in the past decade owing to the high theoretical energy density, however it is obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at cathodes and large voltage hysteresis. Herein, we regulate the spin state of partial Ni  2+  metal centers (  t  2g  6  e  g  2  ) of conductive nickel catecholate framework (Ni  II  &#8208;NCF) nanowire arrays to high&#8208;valence Ni  3+  (  t  2g  6  e  g  1  ) for Ni  III  &#8208;NCF. The spin&#8208;state modulation enables enhanced nickel&#8208;oxygen covalency in Ni  III  &#8208;NCF, which facilitates electron exchange between the Ni sites and oxygen adsorbates and accelerates the oxygen redox kinetics. The high affinity of Ni  3+  sites with the intermediate LiO  2  promotes formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li  2  O  2  in the void space among Ni  III  &#8208;NCF nanowires upon discharging. These merit the Li&#8208;O  2  battery based on Ni  III  &#8208;NCF with remarkably reduced discharge/charge voltage gaps, superior rate capability, and long cycling stability of over 200 cycles. This work highlights the domination of electron spin state on the redox kinetics and will shed insights into electronic structure regulation of electrocatalysts for Li&#8208;O  2  battery and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimized Synthesis of Solution&#8208;Processable Crystalline Poly(Triazine Imide) with Minimized Defects for OLED Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of low&#8208;energy defects, charge delocalization, and exfoliation on the optical and electronic performance of a layered, metal&#8208;free intercalation compound, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) are reported. Using an adjusted synthetic protocol, the quantum yield and the photocurrent of the semiconducting PTI could be increased. Due to the high quality of the product, structure&#8211;property relationships could be studied and PTI could be integrated in a single&#8208;layer OLED.







Abstract
Poly(triazine imide) (PTI) is a highly crystalline semiconductor, and though no techniques exist that enable synthesis of macroscopic monolayers of PTI, it is possible to study it in thin layer device applications that are compatible with its polycrystalline, nanoscale morphology. We find that the by&#8208;product of conventional PTI synthesis is a C&#8722;C carbon&#8208;rich phase that is detrimental for charge transport and photoluminescence. An optimized synthetic protocol yields a PTI material with an increased quantum yield, enabled photocurrent and electroluminescence. We report that protonation of the PTI structure happens preferentially at the pyridinic N&#8197;atoms of the triazine rings, is accompanied by exfoliation of PTI layers, and contributes to increases in quantum yield and exciton lifetimes. This study describes structure&#8211;property relationships in PTI that link the nature of defects, their formation, and how to avoid them with the optical and electronic performance of PTI. On the basis of our findings, we create an OLED prototype with PTI as the active, metal&#8208;free material.

         <title>Linear Extension of Anthracene via B&#8592;N Lewis Pair Formation: Effects on Optoelectronic Properties and Singlet O2 Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linearly B&#8592;N Lewis pair extended anthracenes are prepared by highly regioselective N&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation. Their LUMOs are higher in energy and their HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps are significantly larger compared to those of the respective laterally functionalized species. Photooxygenation studies reveal effective singlet oxygen sensitization with a largely reduced tendency for self&#8208;sensitized endoperoxide formation.







Abstract
The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) via B&#8592;N Lewis pair formation offers an opportunity to judiciously fine&#8208;tune the structural features and optoelectronic properties, to suit the demands of applications in organic electronic devices, bioimaging, and as sensitizers for singlet oxygen generation. We demonstrate that the N&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anthracene offers access to linearly extended acene derivatives Py&#8208;BR (R=Et, Ph, C6F5). In comparison to indeno&#8208;fused 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene, the formal &#8220;BN for CC&#8221; replacement in Py&#8208;BR selectively lowers the LUMO, resulting in a much reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. An even more extended conjugated system with seven six&#8208;membered rings in a row (Qu&#8208;BEt) is obtained by borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)anthracene. Fluorinated Py&#8208;BPf shows particularly advantageous properties, including relatively lower&#8208;lying HOMO and LUMO levels, strong yellow&#8208;green fluorescence, and effective singlet oxygen sensitization, while resisting self&#8208;sensitized conversion to its endoperoxide.

         <title>Trifluoroethanol as a Unique Additive for the Chemoselective Electrooxidation of Enamines to Access Unsymmetrically Substituted NH&#8208;Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective electrooxidative heterocoupling of two different enamines is reported for the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted NH&#8208;pyrroles. A &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of the additive trifluoroethanol is utilized to achieve the desired chemoselectivity by tuning the oxidation potentials and controlling the activation energy of the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
An electrochemical method for the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted NH&#8208;pyrroles is described. The synthetic strategy comprises a challenging heterocoupling between two structurally diverse enamines via sequential chemoselective oxidation, addition, and cyclization processes. A series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted enamines were effectively cross&#8208;coupled from an equimolar mixture to synthesize various unsymmetrical pyrrole derivatives up to 84&#8201;% yield. The desired cross&#8208;coupling was achieved by tuning the oxidation potential of the enamines by utilizing a &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of the additive trifluoroethanol (TFE). Additionally, extensive computational studies reveal the unique role of TFE in promoting the heterocoupling process by regulating the activation energies of the reaction steps through H&#8208;bonding and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Importantly, the developed electrochemical protocol was found to be equally efficient for the homocoupling of enamines to form symmetric pyrroles up to 92&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Modification of Multi&#8208;Component Building Blocks for Assembling Giant Chiral Lanthanide&#8211;Titanium Molecular Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Building blocks with multiple components are promising for the synthesis of complex molecular assemblies, but are rarely available. Herein, we report a modification procedure for a multicomponent building block [Ln3Ti(HSA)6(SA)4(H2O)]&#8722; ({Ln3Ti&#8208;SA}, H2SA = salicylic acid, Ln = Eu/Gd) to form new building blocks {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} (H2MSA = 5&#8208;Methoxysalicylic acid, x = 1, 2, 3) by constructing [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8208; units. The obtained {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} can further assemble into a chiral Ln22Ti14 ring with the formulae [Eu22Ti14(MSA)48(HMSA)22(CH3COO)4(H2O)10(iPrOH)] and [Gd22Ti14(MSA)46(HMSA)26(CH3COO)4(H2O)8]. Parallel experiments without Ti4+ result in linear Ln chains. Detailed analysis shows that the [Ti(MSA)4]4&#8208; unit makes the originally variable Ln chain become available building blocks and the modified [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8208; further triggers interesting chiral&#8208;sorting behavior.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Building blocks with multiple components are promising for the synthesis of complex molecular assemblies, but are rarely available. Herein, we report a modification procedure for a multicomponent building block [Ln3Ti(HSA)6(SA)4(H2O)]&#8722; ({Ln3Ti-SA}, H2SA = salicylic acid, Ln = Eu/Gd) to form new building blocks {Ln3Tix-MSA} (H2MSA = 5-Methoxysalicylic acid, x = 1, 2, 3) by constructing [Ti(MSA)3]2- units. The obtained {Ln3Tix-MSA} can further assemble into a chiral Ln22Ti14 ring with the formulae [Eu22Ti14(MSA)48(HMSA)22(CH3COO)4(H2O)10(iPrOH)] and [Gd22Ti14(MSA)46(HMSA)26(CH3COO)4(H2O)8]. Parallel experiments without Ti4+ result in linear Ln chains. Detailed analysis shows that the [Ti(MSA)4]4- unit makes the originally variable Ln chain become available building blocks and the modified [Ti(MSA)3]2- further triggers interesting chiral-sorting behavior. Finally, the electronic adsorption and magneto-optic responses of these molecular rings are investigated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lactone Backbone Density in Rigid Electron&#8208;Deficient Semiconducting Polymers Enabling High n&#8208;type Organic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers, P&#8208;0, P&#8208;50, and P&#8208;75 are developed, in which the lactone group density were maximized by increasing the benzene content from 0&#8201;% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50&#8201;% (P&#8208;50), and 75&#8201;% (P&#8208;75), to enable co&#8208;planar polymers with deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level. As a result, the polymer of P&#8208;75 exhibits a good thermoelectric performance with a maximum electrical conductivity of 12&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8208;1 and Figure of merit power factor of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8208;1&#8197;K&#8208;2.







Abstract
Three lactone&#8208;based rigid semiconducting polymers were designed to overcome major limitations in the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics, namely electrical conductivity and air stability. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrated that increasing the lactone group density by increasing the benzene content from 0&#8201;% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50&#8201;% (P&#8208;50), and 75&#8201;% (P&#8208;75) resulted in progressively larger electron affinities (up to 4.37&#8197;eV), suggesting a more favorable doping process, when employing (N&#8208;DMBI) as the dopant. Larger polaron delocalization was also evident, due to the more planarized conformation, which is proposed to lead to a lower hopping energy barrier. As a consequence, the electrical conductivity increased by three orders of magnitude, to achieve values of up to 12&#8197;S&#8201;cm and Power factors of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8722;1&#8197;K&#8722;2 were thereby enabled. These findings present new insights into material design guidelines for the future development of air stable n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.

         <title>Imparting CO2 Electroreduction Auxiliary for Integrated Morphology Tuning and Performance Boosting in a Porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of functionalizing exfoliation agent has been selected to simultaneously modify and exfoliate bulk COFs into functional nanosheets and the obtained materials can be applied in highly selective CO2 electroreduction into CH4.







Abstract
Strategies that enable simultaneous morphology&#8208;tuning and electroreduction performance boosting are much desired for the exploration of covalent organic frameworks in efficient CO2 electroreduction. Herein, a kind of functionalizing exfoliation agent has been selected to simultaneously modify and exfoliate bulk COFs into functional nanosheets and investigate their CO2 electroreduction performance. The obtained nanosheets (Cu&#8722;Tph&#8722;COF&#8722;Dct) with large&#8208;scale (&#8776;1.0&#8197;&#956;m) and ultrathin (&#8776;3.8&#8197;nm) morphology enable a superior FECH4 (&#8776;80&#8201;%) (almost doubly enhanced than bare COF) with large current&#8208;density (&#8722;220.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. The boosted performance can be ascribed to the immobilized functionalizing exfoliation agent (Dct groups) with integrated amino and triazine groups that strengthen CO2 absorption/activation, stabilize intermediates and enrich the CO concentration around the Cu active sites as revealed by DFT calculations. The point&#8208;to&#8208;point functionalization strategy for modularly assembling Dct&#8208;functionalized COF catalyst for CO2 electroreduction will open up the attractive possibility of developing COFs as efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Preparing Two&#8208;Dimensional Ordered Li0.33La0.557TiO3 Crystal in Interlayer Channel of Thin Laminar Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte towards Ultrafast Li+ Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D LLTO crystal with large&#8208;size, oriented, and crystal defect&#8208;free structure was obtained by controlling the LLTO crystal growth and arrangement in the confined space of 2D laminar channels, which achieved faster Li+ transfer than LLTO Pellet.







Abstract
Inorganic superionic conductor holds great promise for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the ionic conductivity of traditional inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) is always unsatisfactory owing to the grain boundary resistance and large thickness. Here, a 13&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;thick laminar framework with &#8776;1.3&#8197;nm interlayer channels is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling rigid, hydrophilic vermiculite (Vr) nanosheets. Then, Li0.33La0.557TiO3 (LLTO) precursors are impregnated in interlayer channels and afterwards in situ sintered to large&#8208;size, oriented, and defect&#8208;free LLTO crystal. We demonstrate that the confinement effect permits ordered arrangement of LLTO crystal along the c&#8208;axis (the fastest Li+ transfer direction), permitting the resultant 15&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;thick Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte an ionic conductivity of 8.22&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and conductance of 87.2&#8197;mS at 30&#8201;&#176;C. These values are several times&#8217; higher than that of traditional LLTO&#8208;based electrolytes. Moreover, Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte has a compressive modulus of 1.24&#8197;GPa. Excellent cycling performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery.

         <title>Oriented Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Ion Flux and Smart Gating Nanofluidic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework membranes that offer vertically aligned nanofluidic channel arrays, leading to an ultrahigh ion flux and pH&#8208;gating nanofluidic transport.







Abstract
Nanofluidic ion transport holds high promise in bio&#8208;sensing and energy conversion applications. However, smart nanofluidic devices with high ion flux and modulable ion transport capabilities remain to be realised. Herein, we demonstrate smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (2D COF) membranes with vertically aligned nanochannel arrays that achieved a 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher ion flux compared with that of conventional single&#8208;channel nanofluidic devices. The surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion conductance is dominant for electrolyte concentration up to 0.01&#8197;M. Moreover, owing to the customisable pH&#8208;responsivity of imine and phenol hydroxyl groups, the COF&#8208;DT membranes attained an actively modulable ion transport with a high pH&#8208;gating on/off ratio of &#8776;100. The customisable structure and rich chemistry of COF materials will offer a promising platform for manufacturing nanofluidic devices with modifiable ion/molecular transport features.

         <title>Zinc Containing Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites for Capture of Low Concentration Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low concentration CO2 is adsorbed in zinc containing CHA&#8208;type zeolites with a high capacity of 0.67&#8197;mmol CO2/g&#8208;zeolite. The materials exhibit higher CO2 capacity, faster kinetics, lower desorption energy than low&#8208;silica 13X zeolites. Zeolite framework and the states and locations of zinc ions play crucial roles in the adsorption performance.







Abstract
The capture of low concentration CO2 presents numerous challenges. Here, we report that zinc containing chabazite (CHA) zeolites can realize high capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, and low desorption energy when capturing ca. 400&#8197;ppm CO2. Control of the state and location of the zinc ions in the CHA cage is critical to the performance. Zn2+ loaded onto paired anionic sites in the six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) in the CHA cage are the primary sites to adsorb ca. 0.51&#8197;mmol CO2/g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=ca. 7, a 17&#8208;fold increase compared to the parent H&#8208;form. The capacity is increased further to ca. 0.67&#8197;mmol CO2/g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=ca. 2 due to more paired sites for zinc exchange. Zeolites with double six&#8208;membered rings (D6MRs) that orient 6MRs into the cages give enhanced uptakes for CO2 adsorption with zinc exchange. The results reveal that zinc exchanged CHA and several other small pore, cage containing zeolites merit further investigation for the capture of low concentration CO2.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Embedded Approach to Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Isoelectronic Structures for Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was synthesized by condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde derivative, which was readily converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacing oxonium with nitrogen atoms under the treatment of ammonia.







Abstract
Embedding heteroatoms into the main backbones of polymeric materials has become an efficient tool for tailoring their structures and improving their properties. However, owing to comparatively harsh heteroatom&#8208;doping conditions, this has rarely been explored in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein, upon aldol condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium salt with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde, a two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was achieved, which was further converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacement of oxonium ions with nitrogen atoms under ammonia treatment. The two heteroatom&#8208;embedded COFs are conceptually isoelectronic with each other, featuring similar geometric structures but different electronic structures, rendering them capable of catalyzing the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component synthesis of tri&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives with good recyclability.

         <title>Design of a Metallacycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Photosensitizer for In Vivo Image&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Inactivation of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizer (1&#8835;2) for in vivo image&#8208;guided photodynamic inactivation of bacteria. Through host&#8208;guest interaction, the assembly 1&#8835;2, with improved fluorescence signals and ROS production capabilities, is employed for in vivo fluorescence tracking as well as accurate image&#8208;guided treatment of S. aureus infection without minimal side effects.







Abstract
Bacterial infection is one of the greatest threats to public health. In vivo real&#8208;time monitoring and effective treatment of infected sites through non&#8208;invasive techniques, remain a challenge. Herein, we designed a PtII metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizer through the host&#8208;guest interaction between a pillar[5]arene&#8208;modified metallacycle and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;[4&#8208;(diphenylamino)styryl]pyridinium. Leveraging the aggregation&#8208;induced emission supramolecular photosensitizer, we improved fluorescence performance and antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation. In vivo studies revealed that it displayed precise fluorescence tracking of S. aureus&#8208;infected sites, and in situ performed image&#8208;guided efficient PDI of S. aureus without noticeable side effects. These results demonstrated that metallacycle combined with host&#8208;guest chemistry could provide a paradigm for the development of powerful photosensitizers for biomedicine.

         <title>Assembly of Hexagonal Column Interpenetrated Spheres from Plant Polyphenol/Cationic Surfactants and Their Application as Antimicrobial Molecular Banks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lasting and broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial agents with the special structure of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are constructed through non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid and quaternary ammonium surfactants. HCISs possess high substrate&#8208;adhesion on various substrates and high anti&#8208;water washing property, and can continuously provide antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, avoiding one&#8208;time burst release of antimicrobial units.







Abstract
Microbial infections have become a great threat to human health and one of the main risks arises from direct contact with the surfaces contaminated by pathogenic microbes. Herein, a kind of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are fabricated by non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid with quaternary ammonium surfactants. Different from one&#8208;time burst release of conventional antimicrobial agents, the HCIS acts like a &#8220;antimicrobial molecular bank&#8221; and releases the antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, leading to long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial performance. Taking advantage of strong hydrophobicity and adhesion, HCISs are applicable to various substrates and endowed with anti&#8208;water washing property, thus showing high in vitro antimicrobial efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) even after being used for 10 cycles. Meanwhile, HCISs exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, and have good biocompatibility with mammalian cells. Such a low&#8208;cost and portable long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent meets the growing anti&#8208;infection demand in public spaces.

         <title>Unexpectedly High Capacitance of the Metal Nanoparticle/Water Interface: Molecular&#8208;Level Insights into the Electrical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry revealed an anomalously high capacitance for Pt nanoparticles and to a lower extent for Au nanoparticles at potentials more negative than their potential of zero charge. MD calculations showed that the strong interaction of metal with water molecules leads to water chemisorption and accumulation of ions in the Helmholtz layer beyond expectation, resulting in a higher interface charge storage ability.







Abstract
The electrical double&#8208;layer plays a key role in important interfacial electrochemical processes from catalysis to energy storage and corrosion. Therefore, understanding its structure is crucial for the progress of sustainable technologies. We extract new physico&#8208;chemical information on the capacitance and structure of the electrical double&#8208;layer of platinum and gold nanoparticles at the molecular level, employing single nanoparticle electrochemistry. The charge storage ability of the solid/liquid interface is larger by one order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude than predicted by the traditional mean&#8208;field models of the double&#8208;layer such as the Gouy&#8211;Chapman&#8211;Stern model. Performing molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the possible relationship between the measured high capacitance and adsorption strength of the water adlayer formed at the metal surface. These insights may launch the active tuning of solid&#8211;solvent and solvent&#8211;solvent interactions as an innovative design strategy to transform energy technologies towards superior performance and sustainability.

These insights may launch the active tuning of solid&#8211;solvent and solvent&#8211;solvent interactions as an innovative design strategy to transform energy technologies towards superior performance and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An unambiguous structural elucidation using microcrystal electron diffraction provides insight into unique properties of a layered conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Cu3(C6O6)2. The presence of strong interlayer electronic coupling exerts a profound effect on the electrical and magnetic properties of the MOF.







Abstract
This paper describes structural elucidation of a layered conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) material Cu3(C6O6)2 by microcrystal electron diffraction with sub&#8208;angstrom precision. This insight enables the first identification of an unusual &#960;&#8208;stacking interaction in a layered MOF material characterized by an extremely short (2.73&#8197;&#197;) close packing of the ligand arising from pancake bonding and ordered water clusters within pores. Band structure analysis suggests semiconductive properties of the MOF, which are likely related to the localized nature of pancake bonds and the formation of a singlet dimer of the ligand. The spin of CuII within the Kagom&#233; arrangement dominates the paramagnetism of the MOF, leading to strong geometrical magnetic frustration.

         <title>Enhanced Reactivity of Accessible Protons in Sodalite Cages of Faujasite Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Faujasite (FAU) zeolites (with Si/Al ratio of ca. 1.7) undergo mild dealumination at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.01 to 0.6&#8197;M of NH4NO3 solutions) resulting in protons circumscribed by sodalite cages becoming accessible for reaction. The ratio of protons in sodalite cages (HSOD) to supercages (HSUP) can be manipulated by adjusting ammonium concentrations used in ion exchange.







Abstract
Faujasite (FAU) zeolites (with Si/Al ratio of ca. 1.7) undergo mild dealumination at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.01 to 0.6&#8197;M of NH4NO3 solutions) resulting in protons circumscribed by sodalite cages becoming accessible for reaction without conspicuous changes to bulk crystallinity. The ratio of protons in sodalite cages (HSOD) to supercages (HSUP) can be systematically manipulated from 0 to ca. 1 by adjusting ammonium concentrations used in ion exchange. The fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is assessed by virtue of infrared spectra for H&#8208;D exchange of deuterated propane based on the band area ratio of OD2620/OD2680 (ODSOD/ODSUP). Protons in sodalite cages (HSOD) show higher rate constants of propane dehydrogenation (kD) and cracking (kC) than protons in supercages (HSUP) plausibly due to confinement effects being more prominent in smaller voids. Rate constants of dehydrogenation and cracking including kD/kC ratios are also augmented as the fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is enhanced. These effects of accessibility and reactivity of protons in sodalite cages hitherto inconspicuous are revealed herein via methods that systematically increase accessibility of cations located in sodalite cages.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To reveal the biomedical effects and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules urgently needs hydrogen molecular imaging probes as an imperative tool, but the development of these probes is extremely challenging. In this work, a catalytic hydrogenation strategy is proposed to design and synthesize a ratiometric fluorescent probe by encapsulating Pd nanoparticles and conjugating azido&#8208;/coumarin&#8208;modified fluorophore into mesoporous silica nanoparticles, realizing in vitro and in vivo fluorescence imaging of hydrogen molecules. The developed hydrogen probe exhibits high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, enabling rapid and real&#8208;time detection of hydrogen molecules both in cells and in the body of animal and plant. By application of the developed fluorescent probe, we have directly observed superhigh transmembrane and ultrafast transport abilities of hydrogen molecules in cell, animal and plant, and discovered in vivo high diffusion of hydrogen molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis, structural analysis, optical and chiroptical properties of a novel quadruple helicene, which has two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework of 92  sp  2  carbon atoms.&#160; It was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate with the formation of eight carbon&#8211;carbon bonds on the perylene unit in a single synthetic operation. Chemical oxidation of the quadruple helicene with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate resulted in an air&#8208;stable dication, which exhibits the same helicity in its four helicene moieties as unambiguously identified by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission with absorption and emission maxima at 848 nm and 977 nm, respectively, and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible light regions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We introduce a strategy to optimize the photoswitching behavior of rhodamines for (d)STORM super&#8208;resolution microscopy. By replacing the benzene ring in the rhodamine core with a permanently charged 1,3&#8208;disubstituted imidazolium, the resultant dyes are markedly sensitized toward photoswitching, and exhibit outstanding (d)STORM performance with fast on&#8208;off switching, long&#8208;lasting blinking, and bright single&#8208;molecule emission. We thus attain excellent (d)STORM images under green excitation that are on par with the &#8220;ideal&#8221; red&#8208;excited dyes, including for difficult structures as the mammalian actin cytoskeleton, and demonstrate high&#8208;quality two&#8208;color three&#8208;dimensional (d)STORM.</dc:description>

         <title>Collateral Damage Occurs When Using Photosensitizer Probes to Detect or Modulate Nucleic Acid Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids are chemically modified to fine&#8208;tune their properties for biological function. Chemical tools for selective tagging of base modifications enables new approaches; the photosensitizers riboflavin and anthraquinone were previously proposed to oxidize N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A) or 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mdC) selectively. Herein, riboflavin, anthraquinone, or Rose Bengal were allowed to react with the canonical nucleosides dA, dC, dG, and dT, and the modified bases 5mdC, m6A, 8&#8208;oxoguanine (dOG), and 8&#8208;oxoadenine (dOA) to rank their reactivities. The nucleoside studies reveal that dOG is the most reactive and that the native nucleoside dG is higher or similar in reactivity to 5mdC or m6A; competition in both single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded DNA of dG vs. 5mdC or 6mdA for oxidant confirmed that dG is favorably oxidized. Thus, photosensitizers are promiscuous nucleic acid oxidants with poor chemoselectivity that will negatively impact attempts at targeted oxidation of modified nucleotides in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Configurationally Chiral SuFEx&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel methods to make synthetic chiral polymers are highly desirable given their potential in a rapidly increasing number of bio&#8208;inspired applications. The enantiospecific sulfur&#8208;fluorine exchange (SuFEx) reaction of chiral di&#8208;sulfonimidoyl fluorides (di&#8208;SFs) with diphenols, was used to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight chiral polymers with configurational backbone chirality. The resulting new class of polymers, polysulfonimidates, can be efficiently produced  via  this step&#8208;growth mechanism for a wide range of di&#8208;SFs and diphenols, yielding  M  n  PS  up to 283 kDa with typical dispersity  &#272;  around 1.6. The optical activity of the resulting chiral polymers is largely due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the S atoms (configurational chirality). Finally, the enantiospecificity (  ee  &gt; 98%) of the polymerization reaction was demonstrated by the degradation of a disulfide&#8208;containing polysulfonimidate. This novel route towards configurational main&#8208;chain chirality opens up new approaches towards tailor&#8208;made chiral polymers with precisely defined properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Polyoxometalate Charge Carriers via Redox&#8208;Driven Nanoconfinement in Single&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the preparation of hybrid redox materials based on polyoxomolybdates encapsulated within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Polyoxomolybdates readily oxidize SWNTs under ambient conditions in solution, and here we study their charge&#8208;transfer interactions with SWNTs to provide a detailed mechanistic insight into the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of these &#8211; and similar &#8211; nanoclusters. We are able to correlate the relative redox potentials of the encapsulated clusters with the level of SWNT oxidation in the resultant hybrid materials and use this to show that precise redox tuning is a necessary requirement for successful encapsulation. The host&#8208;guest redox materials described here exhibit exceptional electrochemical stability, retaining up to 86% of their charge capacity over 1000 oxidation/reduction cycles despite the typical lability and solution&#8208;phase electrochemical instability of the polyoxomolybdates we have explored. Our findings illustrate the broad applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation approach to the design and fabrication of tunable, highly conductive, ultra&#8208;stable nanoconfined energy materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Green carbon science is defined as &#8220;Study and optimization of the transformation of carbon containing compounds and the relevant processes involved in the entire carbon cycle from carbon resource processing, carbon energy utilization, and carbon recycling to use carbon resources efficiently and minimize the net CO2 emission.&#8221; [1] Green carbon science is related closely to carbon neutrality, and the relevant fields have developed quickly in the last decade. In this Minireview, we proposed the concept of carbon energy index, and the recent progresses in petroleum refining, production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials using coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics are highlighted in combination with green carbon science, and an outlook for these important fields is provided in the final section.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Giant Calixarene&#8208;Like Polyoxoniobate Nanocups {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128} Built From Mixed Macrocyclic Cluster Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cup&#8208;shaped molecules are of great interest due to their appealing architectures and properties. Compared with widely studied calixarenes, polyoxometalate&#8208;based cup&#8208;shaped molecules currently remain a virgin land waiting for exploration. In this work, we report the first discovery of two giant cup&#8208;shaped inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid polyoxoniobates (PONbs) of {Cu  12  Nb  120  } and {Cd  16  Nb  128  } . The former integrates three tricyclic Nb  24  clusters and a hexacyclic Nb  48  cluster into a cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a Cu  12  metallacalixarene, while the latter unifies two tricyclic Nb  24  clusters and a brand&#8208;new pentacyclic Nb  40  cluster into another cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a hybrid Cd  16  unit. With 132 and 144 metal centers, {Cu  12  Nb  120  } and {Cd  16  Nb  128  } show the largest two inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid PONb s known to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Aquimarins, Peptide Antibiotics with Amino&#8208;Modified C&#8208;Termini from a Sponge&#8208;Derived Aquimarina sp. Bacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Genome mining and bioactivity studies suggested the sponge&#8208;derived bacterium  Aquimarina  sp. Aq135 as a producer of new antibiotics. Activity&#8208;guided isolation identified antibacterial peptides, named aquimarins, featuring a new scaffold with an unusual C&#8208;terminal amino group and chlorine moieties. Responsible for the halogenation is the Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent chlorinase AqmA that halogenates up to two isoleucine residues in a carrier protein&#8208;dependent fashion. Total syntheses of two natural aquimarins and eight non&#8208;natural variants were developed. Structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies with these compounds showed that the synthetically more laborious chlorinations are not required for antibacterial activity but enhance cytotoxicity. In contrast, variants lacking the C&#8208;terminal amine were virtually inactive, suggesting diamines similar to the terminal aquimarine residue as candidate building blocks for new peptidomimetic antibiotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering Assisted Size and Structure Modulation of Gold Nanoclusters by Ionic Liquid Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface modification induced core size/structure change is a recent discovery in inorganic nanoparticles research, and has rarely been revealed at the molecular level. Here, we exemplify with atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) that proper surface modification can selectively stabilize desired Au(0) core, conducive to the formation of size/structure&#8208;controlled Au NCs. Leveraging on &#960;&#8208;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, ionic liquid (IL) cations are bonded to Au(I)&#8208;thiolate complexes. The hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophobic interactions between IL cations subsequently provide a good mechanism to prolong the size of the Au(I)&#8208;thiolate complexes, selectively producing small&#8208;sized Au NCs upon reduction. Through combined control over the structure and concentration of IL cations, pH and solvent polarity, we are able to produce atomically precise Au NCs with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry. This work also provides a facile means to integrate/synergize the materials functionalities of Au NCs and ILs, increasing their acceptance in diverse fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Natural Peptide Ligands to the Neuropeptide Y5 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complementary biochemical methods and molecular modeling reveal how NPY and its natural analogues bind to the Y5 GPCR, filling in the gap in the knowledge of the Y multiligand/multireceptor system. This provides the first base for the rational design of selective Y5R ligands with therapeutic potential.







Abstract
The binding mode of natural peptide ligands to the Y5 G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (Y5R), an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, is largely unknown. Here, we apply complementary biochemical and computational approaches, including scanning of the receptor surface with a genetically encoded crosslinker, Ala&#8208;scanning of the ligand and double&#8208;cycle mutagenesis, to map interactions in the ligand&#8208;receptor interface and build a structural model of the NPY&#8208;Y5R complex guided by the experimental data. In the model, the carboxyl (C)&#8208;terminus of bound NPY is placed close to the extracellular loop (ECL) 3, whereas the characteristic &#945;&#8208;helical segment of the ligand drapes over ECL1 and is tethered towards ECL2 by a hydrophobic cluster. We further show that the other two natural ligands of Y5R, peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) dock to the receptor in a similar pose.

         <title>Altering Chain Flexibility of Aliphatic Polyesters for Yellow&#8208;Green Clusteroluminescence in 38&#8201;% Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the novel example of linear non&#8208;conjugated polyester exhibiting yellow&#8208;green clusteroluminescence and a high quantum yield of 38&#8201;%. The formation of ester&#8208;unit cluster is responsible for the emission and is decided by balancing flexible and rigid structures of chains.







Abstract
Preparation of non&#8208;conjugated polymers with long&#8208;wavelength emission and high quantum yield (QY) is still a huge challenge. Herein, we report the first example of linear non&#8208;conjugated polyester exhibiting yellow&#8211;green clusteroluminescence (CL) and a high QY of 38&#8201;%. We discovered that the polyester P3 with balanced flexibility and rigidity showed the longest CL wavelength and highest QY. Systematically photophysical characterization unravel the key role of ester cluster in the CL and the cluster formation via the aggregate of ester units was visualized. Moreover, P3 was demonstrated to be a highly selective, quick&#8208;responsive (ca. 1.2&#8197;min) and sensitive detector (detection limit is 0.78&#8197;&#956;M) for irons owing to the fast disassociation of clusters by irons. This work not only gains further mechanistic insight into CL but also provides a new strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;wavelength CL, meanwhile, enlightens the glorious application prospect of luminescent polyester.

         <title>Diammonium Molecular Configuration&#8208;Induced Regulation of Crystal Orientation and Carrier Dynamics for Highly Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various diammonium spacer cations are used to construct 2D/3D perovskite. The mechanism of molecular configuration&#8208;induced regulation of crystal orientation and carrier dynamics is investigated. 2D/3D perovskite solar cells based on 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) achieves device efficiency of 22.68&#8201;% and excellent moisture stability, retaining 82&#8201;% of initial efficiency after aging at 50&#177;5&#8201;% relative humidity for 1560&#8197;h.







Abstract
The effects from the molecular configuration of diammonium spacer cations on 2D/3D perovskite properties are still unclear. Here, we investigated systematically the mechanism of molecular configuration&#8208;induced regulation of crystallization kinetic and carrier dynamics by employing various diammonium molecules to construct Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;type 2D/3D perovskites to further facilitating the photovoltaic performance. The minimum average Pb&#8208;I&#8208;Pb angle leads to the smallest octahedral tilting of [PbX6]4&#8722; lattice in optimal diammonium molecule&#8208;incorporated DJ&#8208;type 2D/3D perovskite, which enables suitable binding energy and hydrogen&#8208;bonding between spacer cations and inorganic [PbX6]4&#8722; cages, thus contributing to the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite film with vertical crystal orientation, mitigatory lattice distortion and efficient carrier transportation. As a consequence, a dramatically improved device efficiency of 22.68&#8201;% is achieved with excellent moisture stability.

         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered cyclobutane&#8208;based hole&#8208;transporting material synthesised using simple and green&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired protocols achieves an impressive efficiency of 21&#8201;% in perovskite solar cells and over 19&#8201;% in perovskite solar module with an active area of 30.24&#8197;cm2.







Abstract
Hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as potential competitors to silicon&#8208;based solar cells with an unprecedented increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE), nearing the breakthrough point toward commercialization. However, for hole&#8208;transporting materials, it is generally acknowledged that complex structures often create issues such as increased costs and hazardous substances in the synthetic schemes, when translated from the laboratory to manufacture on a large scale. Here, we present cyclobutane&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective materials synthesized using simple and green&#8208;chemistry inspired protocols in order to reduce costs and adverse environmental impact. A series of novel semiconductors with molecularly engineered side arms were successfully applied in perovskite solar cells. V1366&#8208;based PSCs feature impressive efficiency of 21&#8201;%, along with long&#8208;term operational stability under atmospheric environment. Most importantly, we also fabricated perovskite solar modules exhibiting a record efficiency over 19&#8201;% with an active area of 30.24&#8197;cm2.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Structured Upconversion / Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanoparticles for Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In view of their excellent luminescence properties, nanocrystalline metal halide perovskites have diverse optoelectronic applications, including those related to anticounterfeiting. However, high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting typically requires multiple encryptions relying on several optical modes to ensure information security. Herein, an efficient anticounterfeiting strategy based on dual optical encryption is realized by combining up&#8208; and downconversion luminescence in a nanocomposite with a NaYF  4  :Er  3+  ,Yb  3+  as core and a CsMnCl  3  as shell. The emission color of this nanocomposite depends on the penetration depth of incident radiation and can be changed by varying the excitation source (980 nm laser or UV light) to produce different luminescent patterns. This feature allows one to effectively improve the anticounterfeiting index and fabricate professional anticounterfeiting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Active Centers Bridged by Oxygen Vacancies of Ru Single Atoms Hybrids Supported on Molybdenum Oxide for Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH  3  ) holds significant potential compared with the Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, the reported photocatalysts suffered from low efficiency owing to localized electrons deficiency. Here, Ru&#8208;SA (single atoms)/H  x  MoO  3&#8208;y  hybrids with abundant of Mo  n+  (n &lt; 6) species neighboring oxygen vacancies (O  V  ) are synthesized  via  a H&#8208;spillover process. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that Ru&#8208;SA/H  x  MoO  3  y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH  3  from N  2  and H  2  by the synergetic effect of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mo  n+  ). That is, Ru SA boost the activation and migration of H  2  , and Mo  n+  species act as the trapping sites of localized electrons and the adsorption and dissociation sites of N  2  , finally leading to NH  3  synthesis on Mo  n+  &#8208;OH. The NH  3  generation rate is as high as 4.0 mmol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  , accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 6.0% at 650 nm. Our finding may open up a new strategy for acquiring a better NH  3  synthesis approach under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Proton Battery in Mild Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;organic proton batteries are attracting extensive attention due to their sustainability merits and excellent rate capability. Generally, strong acids (e.g. H  2  SO  4  ) have to be employed as the electrolytes to provide H  +  for all&#8208;organic proton batteries due to the high H  +  intercalation energy barrier. Until now, the design of all&#8208;organic proton batteries in mild electrolytes is still a challenge. Herein, a poly(2, 9&#8208;dihydroquinoxalino[2, 3&#8208;b]phenazine) (PO) molecule was designed and synthesized, where the adjacent C=N groups show two different chemical environment, resulting in two&#8208;step redox reactions. Moreover, the two reactions possess considerable voltage difference because of the large LUMO energy gap between PO and its reduction product. More impressively, the C=N groups endows &#960;&#8208;conjugated PO molecule with H  +  uptake/removal in ZnSO  4  electrolyte. As a result, a symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is achieved in mild electrolyte for the first time, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and also broadens the chemistry of proton&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Active Nanobots Based on Soft Nanoarchitectonics Powered by an Ultralow Fuel Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme catalysis to power micro/nanomotors has received tremendous attention because of the vast potential in applications ranging from biomedicine to environmental remediation. However, the current design is mainly based on a complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architecture, with limited accessible surface areas for the catalytic sites, and thus require a higher fuel concentration to achieve active motion. Herein we report for the first time an enzyme&#8208;powered 2D nanobot, which was designed by a facile strategy based on soft nanoarchitectonics for active motion at an ultralow fuel concentration (0.003% H  2  O  2  ). The 2D nanobot exhibited efficient positive chemotactic behavior and the ability to swim against gravity by virtue of solutal buoyancy. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the 2D nanobots showed an excellent capability for &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; removal of methylene blue (MB) dye with an efficiency of 85%.</dc:description>

         <title>PDMS with Tunable Side Group Mobility and Its Highly Permeable Membrane for Removal of Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of phenyl side groups as rigid molecular spacers into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) imparted the methyl side groups with higher mobility and additional degrees of freedom for fast transport of aromatic compounds. Combined with the engineering design of the transport highway, the membrane achieved outstanding performance for aromatic removal.







Abstract
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), as the benchmark of organophilic membrane materials, still faces challenges for removal of aromatic compounds due to the undesirable transport channels. In this work, we propose to reconstruct the PDMS conformation with tunable side group mobility by introducing phenyl as rigid molecular spacer to relieve steric hindrance of large&#8208;sized aromatic molecules; meanwhile, polymer segments are loosely stacked to provide additional degrees of freedom as increasing the permeant size. Moreover, the reconstructed PDMS is engineered into the composite membrane with prevention of condensation of aromatic compounds in the substrate pores. The resulting thin&#8208;film composite membrane achieved one order of magnitude higher flux (11.8&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) with an equivalent separation factor (12.3) compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes for aromatic removal. The permeant&#8208;customized membrane molecular and microstructure designing strategy opens a new avenue to develop membranes for specific separation targets.

         <title>Rational Design of a Two&#8208;Photon Fluorescent Probe for Human Cytochrome&#8197;P450 3A and the Visualization of Mechanism&#8208;Based Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe for CYP3A was developed using a rational design strategy that optimized the key binding domain of the fluorophore. The probe semi&#8208;quantitatively detects and images CYP3A activity in various living systems, thereby providing a high&#8208;throughput screening system facilitating the evaluation of MBI&#8208;associated hepatotoxicity by CYP3A.







Abstract
Mechanism&#8208;based inactivation (MBI) can mediate adverse reactions and hepatotoxicity from drugs, which is a result of their conversion into highly reactive metabolites catalyzed by enzymes such as cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). In the present research, we optimized the key interaction domain of the fluorophore with the target protein to develop a two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe for CYP3A that is involved in the metabolism of more than half of all clinical drugs. The developed BN&#8208;1 probe exhibited appropriate selectivity and sensitivity for the semi&#8208;quantitative detection and imaging of endogenous CYP3A activity in various living systems, thereby providing a high&#8208;throughput screening system enabling evaluation of MBI&#8208;associated hepatotoxicity by CYP3A. Using BN&#8208;1 as a fluorescent molecular tool facilitates the efficient discovery and characterization of CYP3A&#8208;induced MBI in natural systems.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Reduction&#8208;Induced Hydrogenation of a Helical Bilayer Nanographene with K and Rb Metals: Electron Multiaddition and Selective Rb+ Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented site&#8208;specific reduction&#8208;induced hydrogenation of a helical bilayer nanographene has been found using K or Rb metals. However, coordination of the metal to the central six&#8208;membered rings of the bilayer helicene in a &#951;3&#8208;mode is only observed for the Rb complex, due to its larger ionic size, thus showing the impact of the cation's size on the reaction product.







Abstract
The chemical reduction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bilayer nanographene 1 (C138H120) with K and Rb in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 affords [K+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)(THF)2][{K+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}2(THF)0.5][C138H1223&#8722;] (2) and [Rb+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)2][{Rb+(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}2(C138H1223&#8722;)] (3). Whereas K+ cations are fully solvent&#8208;separated from the trianionic core thus affording a &#8220;naked&#8221; 1.3&#8722; anion, Rb+ cations are coordinated to the negatively charged layers of 1.3&#8722;. According to DFT calculations, the localization of the first two electrons in the helicene moiety leads to an unprecedented site&#8208;specific hydrogenation process at the carbon atoms located on the edge of the helicene backbone. This uncommon reduction&#8208;induced site&#8208;specific hydrogenation provokes dramatic changes in the (electronic) structure of 1 as the helicene backbone becomes more compressed and twisted upon chemical reduction, which results in a clear slippage of the bilayers.

         <title>Modulating the Excited State Chirality of Dynamic Chemical Reactions in Chiral Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic cavity of chiral spherical micelles was used as the chiral space to encapsulate hydrophobic emitters and endow them with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in the aqueous phase. Particularly, through breaking the &#8220;C=N&#8221; bonds of Nile Red molecules, we have observed white CPL emission.







Abstract
Chirality generation and transfer is not only of critical importance in resolving the origin of biological homochirality, but also is of great significance for exploring the chirality&#8208;related functionalities in nanomaterials and supramolecular systems. Although modulating the ground state chirality in chiral nanomaterials has been widely demonstrated, it remains a big challenge to steer the excited state chirality (circularly polarized luminescence, CPL). Herein, we present a kind of chiral spherical micelles constructed by chiral cationic gemini surfactants, whose surfaces and cavities could co&#8208;assemble with hydrophilic and hydrophobic emitters concurrently. Subsequently, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic emitters could be endowed with CPL activity in the aqueous phase. Additionally, the cavities of such micelles can be regarded as the powerful chiral confined space, which could effectively modulate the excited state chirality of dynamic chemical reactions, enabling color&#8208;adjustable CPL emission.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A protocol for the modular assembly of  &#945;  &#8208;fluoroamide motif has been developed, which provides a practical method for the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse  &#945;  &#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines through a three&#8208;component fluorination&#8208;aminocarbonylation process. The key to the success of this process is taking advantage of the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF  2  Br (TMS = trimethylsilyl). The mechanism of the process involves the 1,2&#8208;fluorine and oxygen migrations of the  in&#8208;situ  formed TMS&#8208;protected  &#945;  &#8208;aminodifluoromethyl carbinol intermediates, which represents a new type of deoxyfluorination reaction.</dc:description>

Through high&#8208;efficient microfluidic assembly and microchannel reactions, ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx exhibits well&#8208;developed micro/meso&#8208;porosity, ordered ionic pathways, fast interfacial electron conduction and large&#8208;scale fabrication, significantly boosting charges dynamic transport and intercalation. The resultant ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber presents large capacitance (1700 F cm&#8208;3) and outstanding rate performance in 1M H2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;based solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitors deliver high energy density (19.0 mWh cm&#8208;3), excellent capacitance (854 F cm&#8208;3), large deformable/wearable capabilities and long&#8208;time cyclic stability (20000 cycles), which realize natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications to drive water level/earthquake alarm devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Batteries with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable energy systems cannot exist without the storage of volatile renewable electricity. Whereas electrical batteries can be used for small amounts of energy, chemical batteries are required for large amounts of energy. The hydrogenation of CO2 is one promising option for chemical batteries. The intricate material science of Cu catalysts to control the selectivity of this reaction is discussed in detail in this Review.







Abstract
Efforts to obtain raw materials from CO2 by catalytic reduction as a means of combating greenhouse gas emissions are pushing the boundaries of the chemical industry. The dimensions of modern energy regimes, on the one hand, and the necessary transport and trade of globally produced renewable energy, on the other, will require the use of chemical batteries in conjunction with the local production of renewable electricity. The synthesis of methanol is an important option for chemical batteries and will, for that reason, be described here in detail. It is also shown that the necessary, robust, and fundamental understanding of processes and the material science of catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 does not yet exist.

         <title>Tunable Amine&#8208;Reactive Electrophiles for Selective Profiling of Lysine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable and hydrolytically stable electrophiles are reported for the chemo&#8208;selective labeling of lysine with mass sensitive probes. These tunable amine&#8208;reactive electrophiles (TAREs) were used to label proteins in various subcellular compartments inside cells and for global identification of lysine in the human proteome.







Abstract
Proteome profiling by activated esters identified &gt;9000 ligandable lysines but they are limited as covalent inhibitors due to poor hydrolytic stability. Here we report our efforts to design and discover a new series of tunable amine&#8208;reactive electrophiles (TAREs) for selective and robust labeling of lysine. The major challenges in developing selective probes for lysine are the high nucleophilicity of cysteines and poor hydrolytic stability. Our work circumvents these challenges by a unique design of the TAREs that form stable adducts with lysine and on reaction with cysteine generate another reactive electrophiles for lysine. We highlight that TAREs exhibit substantially high hydrolytic stability as compared to the activated esters and are non&#8208;cytotoxic thus have the potential to act as covalent ligands. We applied these alternative TAREs for the intracellular labeling of proteins in different cell lines, and for the selective identification of lysines in the human proteome on a global scale.

         <title>Local Environment Determined Reactant Adsorption Configuration for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Acetone Hydrogenation to Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For acetone to propane electrohydrogenation, we unveiled how the local environmental pH determines the adsorption configuration of acetone, and further, the efficiency of the catalytic process. Moreover, it is showed that the reaction efficiency of the reaction can be improved by simply adjusting local pH instead of complex catalyst engineering.







Abstract
We demonstrate a widely applicable method to alter the adsorption configuration of multi&#8208;carbon containing reactants by no catalyst engineering but simply adjusting the local reaction environment of the catalyst surface. Using electrocatalytic acetone to propane hydrogenation (APH) as a model reaction and common commercial Pt/Pt&#8208;based materials as catalysts, we found local H+ concentration can significantly influence the adsorption mode of acetone reactant, for example, in vertical or flat mode, and target product selectivity. Electrocatalytic measurement combined with in situ spectroscopic characterizations reveals that the vertically adsorbed acetone is favorable for propane production while the flatly adsorbed mode suppresses the reaction. DFT calculations indicate that the H coverage on catalyst surface plays a decisive role in the adsorption configuration of acetone. The increased local acidity can facilitate the adsorption configuration of acetone from flat to vertical mode and suppress the competing hydrogen evaluation reaction, which consequently enhances the APH selectivity.

         <title>A Bivalent Activatable Fluorescent Probe for Screening and Intravital Imaging of Chemotherapy&#8208;Induced Cancer Cell Death</title>

         <dc:description>
We describe Apotracker Red as a single fluorescent activatable probe for robust quantification of cancer cell death in fluorescence&#8208;based assays and in&#8197;vivo using multiphoton intravital imaging in mouse models of breast cancer.







Abstract
The detection and quantification of apoptotic cells is a key process in cancer research, particularly during the screening of anticancer therapeutics and in mechanistic studies using preclinical models. Intravital optical imaging enables high&#8208;resolution visualisation of cellular events in live organisms; however, there are few fluorescent probes that can reliably provide functional readouts in&#8197;situ without interference from tissue autofluorescence. We report the design and optimisation of the fluorogenic probe Apotracker Red for real&#8208;time detection of cancer cell death. The strong fluorogenic behaviour, high selectivity, and excellent stability of Apotracker Red make it a reliable optical reporter for the characterisation of the effects of anticancer drugs in cells in&#8197;vitro and for direct imaging of chemotherapy&#8208;induced apoptosis in&#8197;vivo in mouse models of breast cancer.

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Assisted Single C&#8722;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones using Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single and selective C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones via visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis is achieved in the presence of HFIP solvent. Trapping of photo&#8208;catalytically generated difluoromethyl radical to acrylamide derivatives furnishes an essential class of difluoromethyl&#8208;containing oxindole scaffolds. A high level of DFT calculations strongly supports our proposed mechanistic pathway for this novel transformation.







Abstract
A visible light photoredox catalytic method for the selective cleavage of single strong C&#8722;F bond in trifluoromethyl ketones is reported. Single electron reduction of trifluoromethyl ketones generates difluoromethyl radicals which can be engaged in intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation with N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;arylmethacrylamides to furnish fluorine&#8208;containing oxindole derivatives in good yields. The reaction shows excellent chemoselectivity with good functional group tolerance under mild conditions. 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a solvent plays a critical role for the selective single C&#8722;F bond cleavage. High&#8208;level DFT calculations are depicted to shed light on the mechanism.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Itaconation of Complex Peptides by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful approach for site&#8208;selective peptide functionalization. Herein, we report a highly N&#8208;termini&#8208;specific method to rapidly access itaconated peptide derivatives under mild photoredox conditions. Distinct from conventional methods that rely on residue nucleophilicity, this method proceeds through a highly reactive carbamoyl radical intermediate to achieve excellent selectivity. Itaconated peptides can be further functionalized to access peptide&#8208;protein conjugates.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective peptide functionalization provides a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective access to diversify peptides for biological studies. Among many existing non&#8208;invasive peptide conjugations methodologies, photoredox catalysis has emerged as one of the powerful approaches for site&#8208;specific manipulation on native peptides. Herein, we report a highly N&#8208;termini&#8208;specific method to rapidly access itaconated peptides and their derivatives through a combination of transamination and photoredox conditions. This strategy exploits the facile reactivity of peptidyl&#8208;dihydropyridine in the complex peptide settings, complementing existing approaches for bioconjugations with excellent selectivity under mild conditions. Distinct from conventional methods, this method utilizes the highly reactive carbamoyl radical derived from a peptidyl&#8208;dihydropyridine. In addition, this itaconated peptide can be further functionalized as a Michael acceptor to access the corresponding peptide&#8208;protein conjugate.

         <title>Controlling Oxidative Addition and Reductive Elimination at Tin(I) via Hemi&#8208;Lability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distannyne supported by a pincer ligand featuring pendant CH2NiPr2 arms is capable of reversibly activating E&#8722;H bonds at one or both of the tin centres through dissociation of the hemi&#8208;labile N&#8211;Sn donor/acceptor interactions. This chemistry can be exploited to sequentially (and reversibly) assemble mixed&#8208;valence chains of tin atoms of the type ArSn{Sn(Ar)H}nSnAr (n=1,2).







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of a distannyne supported by a pincer ligand bearing pendant amine donors that is capable of reversibly activating E&#8208;H bonds at one or both of the tin centres through dissociation of the hemi&#8208;labile N&#8208;Sn donor/acceptor interactions. This chemistry can be exploited to sequentially (and reversibly) assemble mixed&#8208;valence chains of tin atoms of the type ArSn{Sn(Ar)H}nSnAr (n=1, 2). The experimentally observed (decreasing) propensity towards chain growth with increasing chain length can be rationalized both thermodynamically and kinetically by the electron&#8208; withdrawing properties of the &#8208;Sn(Ar)H&#8208; backbone units generated via oxidative addition.

         <title>19F NMR Allows the Investigation of the Fate of Platinum(IV) Prodrugs in Physiological Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By 19F&#8208;labeling of a PtIV prodrug (Pt&#8208;FBA, FBA=p&#8208;fluorobenzoate), the activation in vitro, in living cells and in mice could be investigated by NMR spectroscopy while avoiding the interference of all background signals and allowing the simultaneous detection of pre&#8208; and post&#8208;activation species.







Abstract
PtIV prodrugs can overcome resistance and side effects of conventional PtII anticancer therapies. By 19F&#8208;labeling of a PtIV prodrug (Pt&#8208;FBA, FBA=p&#8208;fluorobenzoate), the activation under physiological conditions could be investigated. Unlike single&#8208;electron reductants, multi&#8208;electron agents can efficiently promote the two electrons reduction of PtIV to PtII. The activation of Pt&#8208;FBA in cell lysate is highly dependent upon the type of cancer cells. When administered to E. coli, Pt&#8208;FBA is reduced intracellularly and free FBA can shuttle out of the cell. The reduction rate greatly increases by inducing metallothionein overexpression and is lowered by addition of ZnII ions. When injected into mice, Pt&#8208;FBA undergoes fast reduction in the bloodstream accompanied by metabolic degradation of FBA; nevertheless, unreduced Pt&#8208;FBA can accumulate to detectable levels in liver and kidneys. The 19F&#8197;NMR approach has the advantage of avoiding the interference of all background signals.

         <title>Efficient Polyester Hydrogenolytic Deconstruction via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commodity polyester plastics such as PET, PBT, and PEN are hydrogenolytically deconstructed to their starting monomeric carboxylic acids and light alkanes using a solventless tandem catalytic approach. These selective reactions operate near the polymer melting temperature under 1&#8197;atm H2 and are compatible with mixed plastics.







Abstract
Using a mechanism&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free tandem catalytic approach, commodity polyester plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are rapidly and selectively deconstructed by combining the two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C, under 1&#8197;atm H2, affording terephthalic acid (or naphthalene dicarboxylic acid for PEN) and ethane (or butane for PBT) in essentially quantitative yield. This process is effective for both laboratory grade and waste plastics, and comingled polypropylene remains unchanged. Combined experimental and DFT mechanistic analyses indicate that Hf(OTf)4 catalyzes a mildly exergonic retro&#8208;hydroalkoxylation reaction in which an alkoxy C&#8722;O bond is first cleaved, yielding a carboxylic acid and alkene, and this process is closely coupled to an exergonic olefin hydrogenation step, driving the overall reaction forward.

         <title>Potent and Selective RIPK1 Inhibitors Targeting Dual&#8208;Pockets for the Treatment of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome and Sepsis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly potent dual&#8208;mode RIPK1 inhibitors occupying both the allosteric and the ATP binding pockets were developed, exemplified by compound 21 (ZB&#8208;R&#8208;55), which is about 10&#8208;fold more potent than GSK2982772, and exhibits excellent kinase selectivity, good oral pharmacokinetics and good therapeutic effects in the LPS&#8208;induced sepsis model.







Abstract
Sepsis, characterized with high risk of life&#8208;threatening organ dysfunction, represents a major cause of health loss and the World Health Organization (WHO) labelled sepsis as the most urgent unmet medical need in 2017. The emerging biological understanding of the role of RIPK1 in sepsis has opened up an exciting opportunity to explore potent and selective RIPK1 inhibitors as an effective therapeutic strategy for SIRS and sepsis therapy. Herein, we have synthesized a class of highly potent dual&#8208;mode RIPK1 inhibitors occupying both the allosteric and the ATP binding pockets, exemplified by compound 21 (ZB&#8208;R&#8208;55) which is about 10&#8208;fold more potent than GSK2982772, and exhibits excellent kinase selectivity, good oral pharmacokinetics and good therapeutic effects in the LPS&#8208;induced sepsis model, suggesting that compound ZB&#8208;R&#8208;55 is a highly promising preclinical candidate.

         <title>Cathespin&#8197;B&#8208;Initiated Cypate Nanoparticle Formation for Tumor Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic (PA) probe Cypate&#8208;CBT was designed for specific imaging and real&#8208;time tracking of cathespin&#8197;B (CTSB) activity in CTSB&#8208;overexpressing cells and tumors. After Cypate&#8208;CBT entered into CTSB&#8208;overexpressing cells, it underwent glutathione reduction and CTSB cleavage to generate cypate nanoparticles Cypate&#8208;CBT&#8208;NPs, which enhanced both the intensity and retention time of the PA signal in tumor sites.







Abstract
Cathepsin&#8197;B (CTSB) is a lysosomal protease that is overexpressed in the early stage of many cancer types. Precise evaluation of CTSB expression in vivo may provide a promising method for the early diagnosis of cancers. By virtue of the high&#8208;resolution PA imaging modality, a &#8220;smart&#8221; photoacoustic (PA) probe Cypate&#8208;CBT, which can self&#8208;assemble to cypate&#8208;containing nanoparticles in response to abundant GSH and CTSB inside tumor cells, was developed for the sensitive and specific detection of CTSB activity. Compared with unmodified Cypate, our probe Cypate&#8208;CBT exhibited a 4.9&#8208;fold or 4.7&#8208;fold PA signal enhancement in CTSB&#8208;overexpressing MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells or tumors, respectively, revealing intracellular accumulation of the probe after CTSB&#8208;initiated self&#8208;assembly. We expect Cypate&#8208;CBT to be employed as an effective PA imaging agent for clinical diagnosis of cancer at early stages.

Nanographene&#8208;based vinylene&#8208;linked framework. Dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks form 2D ABC stacking sp2 carbon lattices with robust olefin linkage. The resulting 2D unique structure exhibits high photoconductivity, charge&#8208;carrier mobility and photocatalytic activity in hydroxylation attributed to the narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap nanographene cores as active sites.







Abstract
Synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with desirable organic units furnishes advanced materials with unique functionalities. As an emerging class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs, sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs provide a facile platform to build highly stable and crystalline porous polymers. Herein, a 2D olefin&#8208;linked COF was prepared by employing nanographene, namely, dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene (DBOV), as a building block. The DBOV&#8208;COF exhibits unique ABC&#8208;stacked lattices, enhanced stability, and charge&#8208;carrier mobility of &#8776;0.6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 inferred from ultrafast terahertz photoconductivity measurements. The ABC&#8208;stacking structure was revealed by the high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. DBOV&#8208;COF demonstrated remarkable photocatalytic activity in hydroxylation, which was attributed to the exposure of narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap DBOV cores in the COF pores, in conjunction with efficient charge transport following light absorption.

         <title>Three&#8208;in&#8208;One C2H2&#8208;Selectivity&#8208;Guided Adsorptive Separation across an Isoreticular Family of Cationic Square&#8208;Lattice MOFs</title>

         <dc:description>
The first example of light hydrocarbon separation in a cationic MOF is demonstrated across a previously unreported pre&#8208;functionalized platform of isoreticular cationic metal&#8208;organic frameworks.







Abstract
Energy&#8208;efficient selective physisorption driven C2H2 separation from industrial C2&#8208;C1 impurities such as C2H4, CO2 and CH4 is of great importance in the purification of downstream commodity chemicals. We address this challenge employing a series of isoreticular cationic metal&#8208;organic frameworks, namely iMOF&#8208;nC (n=5, 6, 7). All three square lattice topology MOFs registered higher C2H2 uptakes versus the competing C2&#8208;C1 gases (C2H4, CO2 and CH4). Dynamic column breakthrough experiments on the best&#8208;performing iMOF&#8208;6C revealed the first three&#8208;in&#8208;one C2H2 adsorption selectivity guided separation of C2H2 from 1:1 C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CH4 mixtures. Density functional theory calculations critically examined the C2H2 selective interactions in iMOF&#8208;6C. Thanks to the abundance of square lattice topology MOFs, this study introduces a crystal engineering blueprint for designing C2H2&#8208;selective layered metal&#8208;organic physisorbents, previously unreported in cationic frameworks.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported mesoporosity engineering as a general strategy to promote semihydrogenation selectivity of palladium (Pd)&#8208;based nanobundles catalysts. The best mesoporous PdP displayed full conversion, remarkable activity, excellent selectivity, and high stability in semihydrogenation of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyne, all of which are remarkably better than commercial Lindlar catalysts. Mechanistic investigations ascribed high semihydrogenation selectivity to continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of catalysts that weakened the adsorption and interaction capacity of alkenes and thus inhibited over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to industrially unfavorable alkanes. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that convex crystalline mesoporosity of nanobundles catalysts electronically optimized the coordination environment of Pd active sites and energetically changed hydrogenation trends, resulting in a superior semihydrogenation selectivity to targeted alkenes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we devise and execute a new synthesis of a pristine boron&#8208;doped nanographene. Our target boron&#8208;doped nanographene was designed based on DFT calculations to possess a low LUMO energy level and deep red visible range absorption derived from its precise geometry and B&#8208;doping arrangement. Our synthesis of this target, a doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene (    B  2  &#8208;HBP    ), employs six net C&#8722;H borylations of an alkene, comprising consecutive hydroboration/electrophilic borylation/dehydrogenation and BBr  3  /AlCl  3  /2,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H borylation steps. As predicted by our calculations,    B  2  &#8208;HBP    absorbs strongly in the visible region and emits in the NIR up to 1150 nm in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene solutions. Furthermore,    B  2  &#8208;HBP    possess a very low LUMO level, showing two reversible reductions at &#8722;1.00 V and &#8722;1.17 V vs Fc  +  /Fc. Our methodology is surprisingly selective despite its implementation of unfunctionalized precursors and offers a new approach to the synthesis of pristine B&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Water&#8208;Network&#8208;Assisted Proton Transfer for Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Cobalt Corrole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton transfer is vital for many biological and chemical reactions. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded water&#8208;containing networks are often found in enzymes to assist proton transfer, but similar strategy has been rarely presented by synthetic catalysts. We herein report the Co corrole 1 with an appended crown ether unit and its boosted activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Crystallographic and 1H NMR studies proved that the crown ether of 1 can grab water via hydrogen bonds. By using protic acids as proton sources, the HER activity of 1 was largely boosted with added water, while the activity of crown&#8208;ether&#8208;free analogues showed very small enhancement. Inhibition studies by adding (1) external 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether to extract water molecules and (2) potassium ion or N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;n&#8208;butylamine to block the crown ether of 1 further confirmed its critical role in assisting proton transfer via grabbed water molecules. This work presents a synthetic example to boost HER through water&#8208;containing networks.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Oxazaborolidines by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;H/B&#8208;H Double Activation of 1,2&#8208;Azaborines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8211;H/B&#8211;H double activation of 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines proceeded via cycloaddition with vinyl ethylene carbonate to produce polycyclic oxazaborolidines in 31&#8722;96% yield. The key step in this process is the release of molecular hydrogen from a borate intermediate. Using a SPINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidite as a chiral ligand, chiral oxazaborolidines were synthesized in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 95% ee). The vinyl group of the resulting oxazaborolidine underwent metathesis, Heck reaction, and Wacker oxidation without affecting the oxazaborolidine framework.</dc:description>

         <title>A Heme&#8208;Acquisition Protein Reconstructed with a Cobalt 5&#8208;Oxaporphyrinium Cation and Its Growth&#8208;Inhibition Activity Toward Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using artificial hemes for the reconstruction of natural heme proteins represents a fascinating approach to enhance the bioactivity of the latter. Here, we report the synthesis of various metal 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cations as cofactors, and a cobalt 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation was successfully incorporated into the heme&#8208;acquisition protein (HasA) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We hypothesize that the oxaporphyrinium cation strongly bound to the HasA&#8208;specific outer membrane receptor (HasR) due to its cationic charge, which prevents the subsequent acquisition of heme. In fact, the reconstructed HasA inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and even of multidrug&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa.</dc:description>

         <title>K&#8208;Chabazite Zeolite Nanocrystal Aggregates for Highly Efficient Methane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane (CH  4  ) enrichment and purification is of great significance for increasing the heating value of unconventional natural gas sources and curtailing its effect on global warming. For a long time, commercial adsorbents for CH  4  separation have been hampered by low adsorption capacities, sub&#8208;optimal adsorption selectivities, or slow diffusion rates, which have significantly restricted separation productivity. Herein, we report a facile and green seed passaging method to fabricate donut&#8208;like macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micro hierarchical zeolite K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal aggregates. This consecutive seed&#8208;inducing method requires no organic template. By utilizing this unique nanocrystallization technique, the CH  4  adsorption capacity, gas diffusion rate, and separation productivity of the resultant material are dramatically increased compared with those of commercially available adsorbents, thus setting a new benchmark in CH  4  /N  2  separation. More importantly, production of this adsorbent can be easily scaled&#8208;up to the order of 100 kg using readily available raw materials in this environmentally friendly synthetic route, enabling potential industrial implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Implementation of Quantum Level Addressability and Geometric Phase Manipulation in Aligned Endohedral Fullerene Qudits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endohedral nitrogen fullerenes have been proposed as building blocks for quantum information processing due to their long spin coherence time. However, addressability of the individual electron spin levels in such a multiplet system of 4S3/2 has never been achieved because of the molecular isotropy and transition degeneracy among the Zeeman levels. Herein, by molecular engineering, we lifted the degeneracy by zero&#8208;field splitting effects and made the multiple transitions addressable by a liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;assisted method. The endohedral nitrogen fullerene derivatives with rigid addends of spiro structure and large aspect ratios of regioselective bis&#8208;addition improve the ordering of the spin ensemble. These samples empower endohedral&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based qudits, in which the transitions between the 4 electron spin levels were respectively addressed and coherently manipulated. The quantum geometric phase manipulation, which has long been proposed for the advantages in error tolerance and gating speed, was implemented in a pure electron spin system using molecules for the first time.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the preparation of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from widely&#8208;available carboxylic acids. Mixed anhydrides of carboxylic acids were prepared using isobutyl chloroformate and transformed to the corresponding KATs using a commercial copper catalyst, B  2  (pin)  2  and aqueous KHF  2  . This method allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic, aromatic, and amino acid&#8208;derived KATs and is compatible with a variety of functional groups including alkenes, esters, halides, nitriles, and protected amines.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Multifunctional Carbon&#8208;Based Nanoparticle&#8208;Supported Dispersed Cu2+ Disrupts Redox Homeostasis to Enhance CDT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized multifunctional carbon&#8208;based nanoparticle&#8208;supported dispersed Cu2+ (Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs) using one&#8208;pot strategy, which significantly improves the efficacy of CDT. In vivo experiments revealed that Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs effectively inhibit tumor growth without side effects on the normal organs. Two&#8208;photon imaging in mice showed that Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), promising for brain tumor treatment.







Abstract
In chemodynamic therapy (CDT), the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production plays an important role for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy. However, the high levels of glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells consume the ROS, directly reducing the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, we synthesized carbon&#8208;based nanoparticle (Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs) using one&#8208;pot strategy, which consume GSH via redox reactions to produce Cu+ that catalyze H2O2 to produce .OH, thus the ROS level was observably increased through this synergistic effect. In vivo experiments further revealed that Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs could effectively inhibit tumor growth. Additionally, Cu&#8208;cys CBNPs can affect the activity of some protein sulfhydryl groups in cells, which was assessed by rdTOP&#8208;ABPP assay. In general, this study not only provides a potential CDT drug, but also provides a strategy for one&#8208;pot synthesis of multifunctional nanomaterials.

         <title>Crossed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Iron&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cycloadditions of Unactivated Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of unactivated branched and linear dienes is described. The illustrated process provides a very efficient and atom&#8208;economic access to chiral 1,3&#8208;substituted vinyl&#8208;cyclohexenes under very mild reaction conditions. The development of a chiral bis&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline ligand class was essential to obtain excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The cyclohexene motif is ubiquitous in nature and specialty chemicals. A straightforward selective access to chiral cyclohexenes from unactivated dienes and dienophiles is not feasible by classical Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and constitutes an unsolved synthetic challenge. We report a mild and enantioselective iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of unactivated dienes providing access to chiral 1,3&#8208;substituted vinyl&#8208;cyclohexenes. The development of bis&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline ligands was vital to obtain iron complexes that display high reactivities and excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities towards the targeted cyclohexenes. A range of diene substrates is well accommodated including feedstocks like butadiene, isoprene and myrcene. The structures of different iron complexes are mapped by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and linked to their performance.

         <title>In Situ Raman Probing of Hot&#8208;Electron Transfer at Gold&#8211;Graphene Interfaces with Atomic Layer Accuracy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot&#8208;electron transfer at Au&#8211;graphene interfaces has been investigated in&#8197;situ with atomic layer accuracy, and it is shown that hot electrons can be injected from plasmonic Au nanoparticles to graphene and penetrate up to four layers of graphene.







Abstract
Plasmonic metals under photoexcitation can generate energetic hot electrons to directly induce chemical reactions. However, the capability and fundamental insights of the transportation of these hot electrons at plasmonic metal&#8208;2D material interfaces remain unclear. Herein, hot&#8208;electron transfer at Au&#8208;graphene interfaces has been in situ studied using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with atomic layer accuracy. Combining in situ SERS studies with density functional theory calculations, it is proved that hot electrons can be injected from plasmonic Au nanoparticles to graphene and directly penetrate graphene to trigger photocatalytic reactions. With increasing graphene layers, the transportation of hot electrons decays rapidly and would be completely blocked after five layers of graphene. Moreover, the transfer of hot electrons can be modulated by applying an external electric field, and the hot&#8208;electron transfer efficiency under electrochemical conditions is improved by over three times in the presence of a monolayer of graphene.

         <title>Biasing the Hierarchy Motifs of Nanotoroids: from 1D Nanotubes to 2D Porous Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steric demand exerted by the peripheral side chains of the reported azobenzene dyads impedes their hierarchical self&#8208;assembly from nanotoroids into nanotubes. In contrast, they organize into 2D porous networks on substrate upon solution processing. Photoisomerization of azobenzene moieties allows efficient dissociation/reorganization of nanotoroids in solution, demonstrating their potential as photoresponsive 2D porous nanosheets.







Abstract
Hierarchical organization of self&#8208;assembled structures into superstructures is omnipresent in Nature but has been rarely achieved in synthetic molecular assembly due to the absence of clear structural rules. We herein report on the self&#8208;assembly of scissor&#8208;shaped azobenzene dyads which form discrete nanotoroids that further organize into 2D porous networks. The steric demand of the peripheral aliphatic units diminishes the trend of the azobenzene dyad to constitute stackable nanotoroids in solution, thus affording isolated (unstackable) nanotoroids upon cooling. Upon drying, these nanotoroids organize at graphite surface to form well&#8208;defined 2D porous networks. The photoirradiation with UV and visible light enabled reversible dissociation and reconstruction of nanotoroids through the efficient trans&#8596;cis isomerization of azobenzene moieties in solution.

         <title>Bimetallic Copper/Ruthenium/Osmium Complexes: Observation of Conformational Differences Between the Solution Phase and Solid State by Atomic Pair Distribution Function Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solution phase structure of five bimetallic CuI/RuII/OsII complexes was revealed by high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray scattering and pair distribution function analysis (HEXS/PDF). Assisted by computational simulation, conformational differences of the complexes in the solution and solid states were identified with sub&#8208;&#197;ngstr&#246;m resolution.







Abstract
High&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray scattering and pair distribution function analysis (HEXS/PDF) is a powerful method to reveal the structure of materials lacking long&#8208;range order, but is underutilized for molecular complexes in solution. We demonstrate the application of HEXS/PDF with 0.26&#8197;&#197; resolution to uncover the solution structure of five bimetallic CuI/RuII/OsII complexes. HEXS/PDF of each complex in acetonitrile solution confirms the pairwise distances in the local coordination sphere of each metal center as well as the metal&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal distances separated by over 12&#8197;&#197;. The metal&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal distance detected in solution is compared with that from the crystal structure and molecular models to confirm that distortions to the metal bridging ligand are unique to the solid state. This work presents the first example of observing sub&#8208;&#197;ngstr&#246;m conformational differences by direct comparison of solution phase and solid&#8208;state structures and shows the potential for HEXS/PDF in the determination of solution structure of single molecules.

         <title>Enantioselective Allenation of Terminal Alkynes Catalyzed by Copper Halides of Mixed Oxidation States and Its Application to the Total Synthesis of Scorodonin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient CuCl/CuBr2 co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective allenation of 2&#8208;alkynals involving the highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective 1,5&#8208;H transfer of 1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amine intermediates has been developed. Various allenynes were obtained with excellent enantioselectivities. This reaction was applied to the first highly enantioselective total synthesis of natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;scorodonin and its enantiomer.







Abstract
Naturally occurring conjugated allenynes are of general interest owing to their potent and various biological activities. The 1,5&#8208;H transfer of alka&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amines would be one of the most straightforward yet challenging approaches to such compounds since, in principle, two regioisomers may be formed involving two C&#8722;C triple bonds. Herein, a catalytic recipe of copper halides with mixed oxidation states, i.e., CuCl/CuBr2, has been identified to address the issues of the side reaction of conjugate addition and the selectivity of 1,5&#8208;H transfer of alka&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyn&#8208;3&#8208;yl amines in EATA (enantioselective allenation of terminal alkynes) reaction involving 2&#8208;alkynals. This method provided various allenynes with excellent enantioselectivities, and was also applied to the first highly enantioselective total synthesis of natural product scorodonin. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations elucidated the regioselectivity for the observed 1,5&#8208;H transfer.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Polyacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active functionalized polyacetylenes bearing a wide range of electronically distinct heteroatom&#8208;based groups have been prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROMP). Hallmarks of this work include enhanced polyacetylene solubility, air stability, and electrochromic switching in the near IR spectral window.







Abstract
The discovery of metallic conductivity in polyacetylene [&#8208;HC=CH&#8208;]n upon doping represents a landmark achievement. However, the insolubility of polyacetylene and a dearth of methods for its chemical modification have limited its widespread use. Here, we employ a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) protocol to prepare functionalized polyacetylenes (fPAs) bearing: (1)&#8197;electron&#8208;deficient boryl (&#8208;BR2) and phosphoryl (&#8208;P(O)R2) side chains; (2)&#8197;electron&#8208;donating amino (&#8208;NR2) groups, and (3)&#8197;ring&#8208;fused 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium units via strain&#8208;promoted Click chemistry. These functional groups render most of the fPAs soluble and can lead to intense light absorption across the visible to near&#8208;IR region. Also, the presence of redox&#8208;active boryl and amino groups leads to opposing near&#8208;IR optical responses upon (electro)chemical reduction or oxidation. Some of the resulting fPAs show greatly enhanced air stability when compared to known polyacetylenes. Lastly, these fPAs can be cross&#8208;linked to yield network materials with the full retention of optical properties.

         <title>Abiotic Formation of an Amide Bond via Surface&#8208;Supported Direct Carboxyl&#8211;Amine Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined scanning tunneling microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies provide evidence for thermally activated abiotic formation of amide bonds between adsorbed precursors through direct carboxyl&#8211;amine coupling under ultrahigh&#8208;vacuum conditions by means of on&#8208;surface synthesis.







Abstract
Amide bond formation is one of the most important reactions in biochemistry, notably being of crucial importance for the origin of life. Herein, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies to provide evidence for thermally activated abiotic formation of amide bonds between adsorbed precursors through direct carboxyl&#8211;amine coupling under ultrahigh&#8208;vacuum conditions by means of on&#8208;surface synthesis. Complementary insights from temperature&#8208;programmed desorption measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal the competition between cross&#8208;coupling amide formation and decarboxylation reactions on the Au(111) surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate the critical influence of the employed metal support: whereas on Au(111) the coupling readily occurs, different reaction scenarios prevail on Ag(111) and Cu(111). The systematic experiments signal that archetypical bio&#8208;related molecules can be abiotically synthesized in clean environments without water or oxygen.

         <dc:description>This communication reports a family of single ion&#8208;lithium conducting polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups. The effect of the nature of the substituents onto boron atom into the ionic conductivity of the resultant methacrylic polymers was analyzed. To the best of our knowledge the lithium borate polymers endowed with flexible and electrowithdrawing substituents presents the highest ionic conductivity reported for a lithium single&#8208;ion conducting homopolymer (1.65 &#215;10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  at 60 &#176;C). This together with its high lithium transference number [[EQUATION]] = 0.93 and electrochemical stability window of 4.2 V vs Li  0  /Li  +  show promises for application in lithium batteries. To show this, a lithium borate monomer was integrated into single&#8208;ion gel polymer electrolyte which showed good performance on lithium symmetrical cells (&lt;0.85 V at &#177;0.2 mA/cm  &#8208;2  for 175 h).</dc:description>

         <title>Relating Conformational Equilibria to Conformer&#8208;Specific Lipophilicities: New Opportunities in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient drug discovery is based on a concerted effort in optimizing bioactivity and compound properties such as lipophilicity, and is guided by efficiency metrics that reflect both aspects. While conformation&#8208;activity relationships and ligand conformational control are known strategies to improve bioactivity, the use of conformer&#8208;specific lipophilicities (log  p  ) is much less explored. Here we show how conformer&#8208;specific log  p  values can be obtained from knowledge of the macroscopic log  P  value, and of the equilibrium constants between the individual species in water and in octanol. This is illustrated with fluorinated amide rotamers, with integration of rotamer  19  F NMR signals as a facile, direct method to obtain log  p  values. The difference between log  p  and log  P  optimization is highlighted, giving rise to a novel avenue for lipophilicity control in drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here we report for the first time  the  regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3 + 2] annulation of a wide range of aliphatic aldimines with alkenes via the activation of an unactivated &#946;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8722;H bond by half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts.  This protocol offers a straightforward and atom&#8208;e&#64259;cient route for the synthesis of a new family of multi&#8208;substituted aminocyclopentane derivatives from easily accessible aliphatic aldimines and alkenes. The annulation of aldimines with styrenes exclusively afforded the 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;  trans  &#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminocyclopentane derivatives with excellent diastereoselectivity through the 2,1&#8208;insertion of a styrene unit.

A catalytic amount of an appropriate amine such as adamantylamine (AdH  2  ) or dibenzylamine (Bn  2  NH) showed significant effects on the catalyst activity and stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Bridging Structure of Nickel&#8211;Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To meet the strategic applications, electrochemical reduction of CO2  into value&#8208;added chemical molecules would be promoted by the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed active sites. Herein an electrospun&#8208;pyrolysis cooperative strategy is presented to not only modulate the porous structure of carbon support for favorable charge and mass transfer, but also adjust the bridging structure of atomically dispersed metal species. Typically, the experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the unique chemical structure of binuclear nickel bridging with nitrogen and carbon atoms (namely Ni2&#8208;N4&#8208;C2  ) tunes the electronic nature of d&#8208;states for the optimal adsorption of carbon dioxide and intermediates, thus inducing the substantially enhancement of CO2  reduction via the thermodynamically more favorable pathway. The identification of such structure demonstrates the large space to modulate the atomic bridging status for optimizing electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Neutral Homocyclic Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neutral homocyclic silylene 2 was obtained from a bicyclic silicon(I) amide J. This reaction proceeds via the anionic homoaromatic ring compound 1. The two&#8208;coordinate Si&#8208;atom in 1 is stabilized via a 3&#8208;center 2&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;bond and that in 2 via an allyl&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. Compound 2 undergoes cycloadditions with alkenes and alkynes and oxidative addition with methanol. The reaction with ethylene yields a tricyclic ring species.







Abstract
Isolation of the neutral homocyclic silylene 2 is possible via amine ligand abstraction with potassium graphite (KC8) and subsequent reaction with SiMe3Cl from a bicyclic silicon(I) amide J. This reaction proceeds via an anionic homoaromatic silicon ring compound 1 as an intermediate. The twofold&#8208;coordinated silicon atom in the homocyclic silylene 2 is stabilized by an allyl&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. 2 reacts in an oxidative addition with two equivalents of MeOH and in cycloadditions with ethene, phenylacetylene, diphenylacetylene and with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene to afford novel functionalized ring compounds.

         <title>A Photoinduced Dual&#8208;Wavelength Approach for 3D Printing and Self&#8208;Healing of Thermosetting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RAFT polymerization was successfully applied to visible light&#8208;induced (405&#8197;nm) 3D printing to produce high&#8208;resolution objects with self&#8208;healing capabilities. The self&#8208;healing process is based on the reactivation of RAFT agent embedded in the 3D printed thermosets under UV light (365&#8197;nm) and can be performed at room temperature without prior deoxygenation. The fractured materials can fully recover their initial tensile strength within 30&#8197;min.







Abstract
Vat photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing techniques have been widely used to produce high&#8208;resolution 3D thermosetting materials. However, the lack of repairability of these thermosets leads to the production of waste. In this study, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents are incorporated into resin formulations to allow visible light (405&#8197;nm) mediated 3D printing of materials with self&#8208;healing capabilities. The self&#8208;healing process is based on the reactivation of RAFT agent embedded in the thermosets under UV light (365&#8197;nm), which enables reformation of the polymeric network. The self&#8208;healing process can be performed at room temperature without prior deoxygenation. The impact of the type and concentration of RAFT agents in the polymer network on the healing efficiency is explored. Resins containing RAFT agents enable 3D printing of thermosets with self&#8208;healing properties, broadening the scope of future applications for polymeric thermosets in various fields.

         <title>Janus Photonic Microspheres with Bridged Lamellar Structures via Droplet&#8208;Confined Block Copolymer Co&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new complex photonic structure, bridged lamellae, with intriguing color reflections is successfully fabricated through well&#8208;controlled co&#8208;assembly of lipophilic and amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers within shrinking droplets. Self&#8208;assembled Janus microspheres with precisely tunable dual light reflections are facilely obtained through the manipulation of the co&#8208;assembly at a molecular level.







Abstract
Artificial self&#8208;assembly systems typically exhibit limited capability in creating nature&#8208;inspired complex materials with advanced functionalities. Here, an effective co&#8208;assembly strategy is demonstrated for the facile creation of complex photonic structures with intriguing light reflections. Two different lipophilic and amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BCPs) are placed within shrinking droplets to enable a cooperative working mechanism of microphase segregation and organized spontaneous emulsification, respectively. Layer assemblies of the lipophilic BCP and uniform water nanodroplets stabilized by the bottlebrush surfactant are both generated, and co&#8208;assembled into a bridged lamellar structure with the alternating arrangement of layers and closely packed nanodroplet arrays. Janus microspheres with diverse dual optical characteristics are successfully fabricated, and reflected wavelengths of light are highly tunable simply by changing the formulation or molecular weight of BCP.

         <title>Catalysis&#8208;Enabled Concise and Stereoselective Total Synthesis of the Tricyclic Prostaglandin D2 Metabolite Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinically important tricyclic prostaglandin D2 metabolite (PGDM) methyl ester was synthesized in eight steps from a readily available known compound. The synthesis features Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis to form the challenging Z &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ester, palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative spirolactonization to build the oxaspirolactone moiety, and nickel&#8208;catalyzed Ueno&#8211;Stork&#8208;type dicarbofunctionalization to form two key C&#8722;C bonds and stereocenters.







Abstract
A concise and stereoselective total synthesis of the clinically relevant tricyclic prostaglandin D2 metabolite (tricyclic&#8208;PGDM) methyl ester in racemic form was accomplished in eight steps from a readily available known cyclopentene&#8208;diol derivative. The synthesis features a nickel&#8208;catalyzed Ueno&#8211;Stork&#8208;type dicarbofunctionalization to generate two consecutive stereocenters, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative spirolactonization to build the core oxaspirolactone, and a Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis to introduce the (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;butenoate side chain, a group challenging to introduce through traditional Wittig protocols and troublesome for the two previous total syntheses. A general Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis protocol to construct (Z)&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters was also developed that has broad functional group tolerance and high stereoselectivity. Additionally, our synthesis already accumulated 75&#8197;mg of valuable material for an 18O&#8208;tricyclic&#8208;PGDM&#8208;based assay used in clinical settings for inflammation.

         <title>Orienting an Organic Semiconductor into DNA 3D Arrays by Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orienting of an organic semiconductor, a heptamer of poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (HPV), into DNA 3D arrays by rational design. Addressed with covalent bonds in a DNA tensegrity triangle motif, the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional molecules were well&#8208;aligned inside the crystalline lattices, as indicated by polarized fluorescent emission. This experiment demonstrated a simple approach to constructing photonic crystals with DNA&#8208;templated band&#8208;gap materials.







Abstract
A quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductor, hepta(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (HPV), was incorporated into a DNA tensegrity triangle motif using a covalent strategy. 3D arrays were self&#8208;assembled from an HPV&#8208;DNA pseudo&#8208;rhombohedron edge by rational design and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Templated by the DNA motif, HPV molecules exist as single&#8208;molecule fluorescence emitters at the concentration of 8&#8197;mM within the crystal lattice. The anisotropic fluorescence emission from HPV&#8208;DNA crystals indicates HPV molecules are well aligned in the macroscopic 3D DNA lattices. Sophisticated nanodevices and functional materials constructed from DNA can be developed from this strategy by addressing functional components with molecular accuracy.

         <title>Proton/Electron Donors Enhancing Electrocatalytic Activity of Supported Conjugated Microporous Polymers for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phthalocyanines are polymerized via a solid ionothermal Scholl reaction in the presence of carbon nanotubes, resulting in an ultrathin conjugated microporous polymer sheath containing single&#8208;atom CoN4 as catalytic sites and H2Pc units as proton/electron donors, both of which interplay to enhance the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Metal phthalocyanines (MePc) hold great promise in electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, whereas the catalytic activity of MePc&#8208;containing polymers often suffers from a limited molecular modulation strategy. Herein, we synthesize an ultrathin conjugated microporous polymer sheath around carbon nanotubes by an ionothermal copolymerization of CoPc and H2Pc via the Scholl reaction. Given the H2Pc&#8208;mediated regulation in the synthesis, CoII metal is well preserved in the form of single atoms on the polymer sheath of the carbon nanotubes. With the synergistic effect of H2Pc moieties as proton/electron donors, the composites can selectively reduce CO2 to CO with a high Faradaic efficiency (max. 97&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V) in broad potential windows, exceptional turnover frequency (97&#8201;592&#8197;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.65&#8197;V) and large current density (&gt;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). It is thus desirable to develop a family of heterogeneous polymerized MePc with molecularly regulating electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Exploiting Cooperative Catalysis for the On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Linear Heteroaromatic Polymers via Selective C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative catalytic role of sodium and silver adatoms in steering the on&#8208;surface polymerization of hexaazatriphenylene molecules on Ag(111) is demonstrated. By combining high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy with density functional calculations, we elucidate how complex surface processes can be enabled by addition of atomic species designed for catalyzing specific reactions steps.







Abstract
Regiospecific C&#8722;H activation is a promising approach to achieve extended polymers with tailored structures. While a recent on&#8208;surface synthetic approach has enabled regioselective homocoupling of heteroaromatic molecules, only small oligomers have been achieved. Herein, selective C&#8722;H activation for dehydrogenative C&#8722;C couplings of hexaazatriphenylene by Scholl reaction is reported for the first time. By combining low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we revealed the formation of one&#8208;dimensional polymers with a double&#8208;chain structure. The details of the growth process are rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, pointing out a cooperative catalytic action of Na and Ag adatoms in steering the C&#8722;H selectivity for the polymerization.

         <title>From Impossible to Possible: Atom&#8208;Economic Polymerization of Low Strain Five&#8208;Membered Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economic polymerization of five&#8208;membered propylene carbonate (PC) for preparation of polyester and polycarbonate simultaneously is reported. The key premise of our strategy is the careful elaboration of the mechanism of direct ring&#8208;opening polymerization of PC, which emphasizes the importance of the in situ released propylene oxide.







Abstract
The direct ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of propylene carbonate (PC) only affords oligomers with substantial unidentified by&#8208;products, which hinders the efficient utilization of PC. Through detailed studies, for the first time, a careful mechanism involving the in situ release of propylene oxide (PO) from PC decarboxylation is proposed. Further, we report a novel strategy of copolymerization of PC/cyclic anhydrides via in situ capture of the formed intermediates. Results show that PC is successfully transformed into polyesters. Especially for the ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of PC/phthalic anhydride (PA), a variety of advantages are manifold: i) slow&#8208;release of PO ensuring a perfectly alternating structure; ii) quantitative and fast transformation of PC; iii) visualization of polymerization process by a CO2 pressure gauge. Of importance, through tandem polymerizations, PC is fully transformed into polyesters and polycarbonates concurrently, thus achieving PC utilization with a high atom&#8208;economy.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Independent Molecular Weight Determination of Polymers Based on a Truly Universal Calibration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal calibration curve for molecular weight determination is presented. Diffusion coefficients of poly(styrene) and poly(ethylene glycol) standards are measured via diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy. These diffusion/molecular weight relationships are calibrated to be solvent&#8208;independent. This universal calibration creates a novel platform wherein molecular weights of unknown polymers can be found using the universal calibration curve independent of what solvent is used.







Abstract
Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) allows for accurate molecular weight calibration and determination that can be corrected for solvent influences. Polystyrene and poly(ethylene glycol) standards have been used to calibrate DOSY diffusion data for a variety of solvents, showing a high correlation of data when the bulk viscosity of the solvent is accounted for following the Stokes&#8211;Einstein equation. In this way, a type of universal calibration is introduced that allows for determinations of average molecular weight that are at least as accurate as those of traditional size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC), if not better. Further, we demonstrate that DOSY calibrations can be used between laboratories, hence removing the need for individual calibration of setups as currently done.

         <title>Controlling Chemoselectivity of Catalytic Hydroboration with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to selectively react one functional group in the presence of another underpins efficient reaction sequences. Despite many designer catalytic systems being reported for hydroboration reactions, which allow introduction of a functional handle for cross&#8208;coupling or act as mild method for reducing polar functionality, these platforms rarely deal with more complex systems where multiple potentially reactive sites exist. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to use light to distinguish between ketones and carboxylic acids in more complex molecules. By taking advantage of different activation modes, a single catalytic system can be used for hydroboration, with the chemoselectivity dictated only by the presence or absence of visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Branched Poly(aryl piperidinium) Membranes for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a promising, next&#8208;generation fuel cell technology. AEMFCs require highly conductive and robust anion exchange membranes (AEMs), which are challenging to develop due to the tradeoff between conductivity and water uptake. Here we report a method to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched poly(aryl piperidinium) AEMs. We show that branching reduces water uptake, leading to improved dimensional stability. The optimized membrane, b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5, exhibits simultaneously high OH  &#8208;  conductivity (&gt;145 mS cm  &#8208;1  at 80  o  C), high mechanical strength and dimensional stability, good processability, and excellent alkaline stability (&gt; 1500 h) in 1 M KOH at 80  o  C. AEMFCs based on b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5 reached peak power densities of 2.3 W cm  &#8208;2  in H  2  &#8208;O  2  and 1.3 W cm  &#8208;2  in H  2  &#8208;air at 80  o  C. The AEMFCs can run stably under a constant current of 0.2 A cm  &#8208;2  over 500 h, during which the b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5 membrane remains stable.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of potassium metal with sulfurtriimide S(N  t  Bu)  3  (  II  ) gives the long elusive dark blue cage radical [K  3  {(N  t  Bu)  3  S}  2  ]  &#183;  (  1_K  ) that crystallizes at &#8208;35&#176;C from toluene solution.

         <title>Nitrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis by Metallonitrene C&#8211;H Insertion: Photocatalytic Amidation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H amination and amidation by catalytic nitrene transfer are well&#8208;established and typically proceed via electrophilic attack of nitrenoid intermediates. In contrast, the insertion of (formal) terminal nitride ligands into C&#8211;H bonds is much less developed and catalytic nitrogen atom transfer remains unknown. We here report the synthesis of a formal terminal nitride complex of palladium. Photocrystallographic, magnetic, and computational characterization support the assignment as authentic metallonitrene (Pd&#8211;N) with a diradical nitrogen ligand that is singly&#8208;bonded to PdII. Despite the subvalent nitrene character, selective C&#8211;H insertion with aldehydes follows nucleophilic selectivity. Transamidation of the benzamide product is enabled by reaction with N3SiMe3. Based on these results, a photocatalytic protocol for aldehyde C&#8211;H trimethylsilylamidation was developed that exhibits inverted, nucleophilic selectivity as compared to typical nitrene transfer catalysis. This first example of catalytic C&#8211;H nitrogen atom transfer offers facile access to primary amides after deprotection.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Covalent Headpiece Enables Interconversion between Double&#8208; and Single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of a proper encoding methodology is one of the most important aspects when practicing DEL technology. A &#8220;headpiece&#8221;&#8208;based double&#8208;stranded DEL encoding method is currently the most widely used for productive DEL. However, the robustness of double&#8208;stranded DEL construction conflicts with the versatility presented by single&#8208;stranded DEL applications. We here report a novel encoding method, which is based on a &#8220;reversible covalent headpiece (RCHP)&#8221;. The RCHP allows reversible interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DNA formats, providing an avenue to robust synthesis and allowing for the applications in distinct setups. We have validated the versatility of this encoding method with encoded self&#8208;assembled chemical library and DNA&#8208;encoded dynamic library technology. Notably, based on the RCHP&#8208;settled library construction, a unique &#8220;ternary covalent complex&#8221; mediating ligand isolation methodologies against non&#8208;immobilized targets was developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Expeditious and Efficient ortho&#8208;Selective Trifluoromethanesulfonylation of Arylhydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal and oxidant&#8208;free, practical and efficient method for the synthesis of highly versatile and synthetically useful  ortho  &#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonylated anilines from arylhydroxylamines and trifluoromethanesulfinic chloride was developed. This rapid transformation proceeded smoothly with good yields and excellent  ortho  &#8208;selectivity in the absence of any metals or ligands. Mechanistically, the reaction comprised a noncanonical  O  &#8208;trifluoro&#8208;methanesulfinylation of the arylhydroxylamine, and the subsequent [2, 3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to afford  ortho  &#8208;trifluoromethane&#8208;sulfonylated aniline derivatives. The practical application of this reaction was demonstrated by further conversion into a series of functional molecules under different reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208; and Mechanochromic Camouflage and Self&#8208;Healing in Biomimetic Soft Actuators Based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature,    many mysterious creatures capable of deformation camouflage, color camouflage, and self&#8208;healing have inspired scientists to develop various biomimetic soft robots. However, the systematic integration of all the above functionalities into a single soft actuator system still remains a challenge. Here we chemically introduce a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape morphing and reversible color changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also show excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics. We hope that such a TASN&#8208;LCE actuator system endowed with   dynamic distortion, thermo&#8208; and mechanochromic camouflage, and self&#8208;healing functionalities would pave the way for further development of multifunctional biomimetic soft robotic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Cyclopropane Formation in the Biosyntheses of Hormaomycins and Belactosins: Sequential Nitration and Cyclopropanation by Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hormaomycins and belactosins are peptide natural products that contain unusual cyclopropane moieties. Bioinformatics analysis of the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters showed that two conserved genes,  hrmI  /  belK  and  hrmJ  /  belL  , were potential candidates for catalyzing cyclopropanation. Using  in vivo  and  in vitro  assays, the functions of HrmI/BelK and HrmJ/BelL were established. HrmI and BelK, which are heme oxygenase&#8208;like dinuclear iron enzymes, catalyze oxidation of the &#949;&#8208;amino group of L&#8208;lysine to afford L&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine. Subsequently, HrmJ and BelL, which are iron&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases, effectively convert L&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine to 3&#8208;(  trans  &#8208;2&#8208;nitrocyclopropyl)alanine through C4&#8211;C6 bond installation. These observations disclose a novel pathway of cyclopropane ring construction and exemplify the new chemistry involving metalloenzymes in natural product biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lignin&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers as High&#8208;Temperature and UV&#8208;Blocking Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work utilizes frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of tethered bis&#8208;organophosphorus superbases and a bulky organoaluminum to furnish the highly efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers via one&#8208;step block copolymerization of lignin&#8208;based syringyl methacrylate and  n  &#8208;butyl acrylate, through di&#8208;initiation and compounded sequence control. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit microphase separation and much superior mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 2091%, tensile strength up to 11.5 MPa, and elastic recovery up to 95% after 10 cycles) to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs. More impressively, lignin&#8208;based tri&#8208;BCPs can maintain TPEs properties up to 180 &#176;C, exhibit high transparency and nearly 100% UV shield, suggesting potential applications in temperature&#8208;resistant and optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Hindered Tetraphenylethylene Helicates: Chiral Fluorophores with Deep&#8208;Blue Emission, Multiple&#8208;Color CPL, and Chiral Recognition Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates with substitution at 2,6&#8208;position of phenyl rings were designed and synthesized. Due to hindrance, the TPE helicates could emit strong deep&#8208;blue to violet fluorescence both in solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that could emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) light, exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives in CPL spectra, enable CPL further enhancement. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possessed amino groups with a planar structure and sp  2  &#8208;hybridized nitrogen that are never reported, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and highly chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.</dc:description>

Due to hindrance, the TPE helicates could emit strong deep-blue to violet fluorescence both in solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that could emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) light, exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives in CPL spectra, enable CPL further enhancement. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possessed amino groups with a planar structure and sp  2  -hybridized nitrogen that are never reported, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep-blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and highly chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Introduction of trifluoromethyl group (CF  3  ) into organic molecules in enantioselective manner has attracted significant attentions, but still remains a challenging problem. We herein report a catalytic asymmetric trifluoromethylation of cyclic ketones via Sc(III)/chiral bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed homologation reaction by employing 2,2,2&#8208;trifluorodiazoethane (CF  3  CHN  2  ) as the CF  3  source. This desymmetrization process is highly efficient and generates two chiral centers with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, affording chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl cyclic ketones in a straightforward manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Synthesis of Poly(silylether)s: Access to Degradable Polymers from Renewable Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of new materials with tunable properties and intrinsic recyclability, derived from biomass under mild conditions, stands as a gold standard in polymer chemistry. Reported herein are platinum complexes which catalyze the formation of poly(silylether)s (PSEs) at low catalyst loadings. These polymers are directly obtained from dual&#8208;functional biobased building blocks such as 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) or vanillin, coupled with various dihydrosilanes. Access to different types of copolymer architectures (statistical or alternating) is highlighted by several synthetic strategies. The materials obtained were then characterized as low  T  g  materials (ranging from &#8208;60 to 29&#176;C), stable upon heating (  T  &#8208;5%  up to 301&#176;C) and resistant towards uncatalyzed methanolysis. Additionally, quantitative chemical recycling of several PSEs could be triggered by acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis or methanolysis. These results emphasize the interest of biobased poly(silylether)s as sustainable materials with high recycling potential.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Tunable Persistent Luminescent Materials via Radiative Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a universal strategy for solid, solution, or gel state organic persistent luminescent materials via radiative energy transfer is proposed. The persistent luminescence (&#964; &gt; 0.7 s) could be remotely regulated between different colors by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor. The function is relying on the simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism, rather than the complicated communication between the excited state of the molecules such as F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter energy transfer. And the &#8220;apparent lifetime&#8221; for the energy acceptor is the same as the lifetime of the energy donor, which was different with traditional radiative energy transfer process. The simple working principle endows this strategy with huge universality, flexibility, and operability. This work offers a simple, feasible, and universal way to construct various persistent luminescent materials in solid, solution, and gel states.In this work, a universal strategy for solid, solution, or gel state organic persistent luminescent materials via radiative energy transfer is proposed.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles with Enhanced Interband Transitions for Efficient Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27113-27118, December 20, 2021. </description>

A strategy toward the optimization of photothermal conversion materials with broad optical absorption and high conversion efficiency via the d&#8208;d interband transitions is demonstrated. The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticles could realize an excellent solar harvesting performance especially compositing with up to seven 3d elements in a single phase, ascribing to the fully filled energy regions below and above the Fermi level.







Abstract
Photothermal materials with broadband optical absorption and high conversion efficiency are intensively pursued to date. Here, proposing by the d&#8208;d interband transitions, we report an unprecedented high&#8208;entropy alloy FeCoNiTiVCrCu nanoparticles that the energy regions below and above the Fermi level (&#177;4&#8197;eV) have been fully filled by the 3d transition metals, which realizes an average absorbance greater than 96&#8201;% in the entire solar spectrum (wavelength of 250 to 2500&#8197;nm). Furthermore, we also calculated the photothermal conversion efficiency and the evaporation rate towards the steam generation. Due to its pronounced full light capture and ultrafast local heating, our high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticle&#8208;based solar steam generator has over 98&#8201;% efficiency under one sun irradiation, meanwhile enabling a high evaporation rate of 2.26&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.

A strategy that narrows the interlayer distance of cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) is reported, which enables strong coupling between CoSe2 monolayers. The strongly coupled CoSe2 can catalyze electrosynthesis of H2O2 in acidic media efficiently, which yields Faradaic efficiency of 96.7&#8201;%, current density of 50.04&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and product rate of 30.60&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, outperforming all catalysts reported previously in acidic environments.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the acidic environment could largely prevent its decomposition to water, but efficient catalysts that constitute entirely earth&#8208;abundant elements are lacking. Here we report the experimental demonstration of narrowing the interlayer gap of metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2), which creates high&#8208;performance catalyst to selectively drive two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction toward H2O2 in an acidic electrolyte. The enhancement of the interlayer coupling between CoSe2 atomic layers offers a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the critical *OOH adsorption, promoting the energetics for H2O2 production. Consequently, on the strongly coupled CoSe2 catalyst, we achieved Faradaic efficiency of 96.7&#8201;%, current density of 50.04&#8197;milliamperes per square centimeter, and product rate of 30.60&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Moreover, this catalyst shows no sign of degradation when operating at &#8722;63 milliamperes per square centimeter over 100&#8197;hours.

Guest&#8208;driven light&#8208;induced spin change (GD&#8208;LISC) was firstly realized in a Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework with photochromic azobenzene guests.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that can be reversibly switched by light are of immense interest. Among them, photo&#8208;responsive spin crossover (SCO) complexes have great promises to combine the photoactive inputs with multifaceted outputs into switchable materials and devices. However, the reversible control the spin&#8208;state change by photochromic guests is still challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented guest&#8208;driven light&#8208;induced spin change (GD&#8208;LISC) in a Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), [Fe(bpn){Ag(CN)2}2]&#8901;azobenzene. (1, bpn=1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)naphthalene). The reversible trans&#8211;cis photoisomerization of azobenzene guest upon UV/Vis irradiation in the solid&#8208;state results in the remarkable magnetic changes in a wide temperature range of 10&#8211;180&#8197;K. This finding not only establishes a new switching mechanism for SCO complexes, but also paves the way toward the development of new generation of photo&#8208;responsive magnetic materials.

Two D&#8208;A&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks have been designed and prepared following a novel strategy for the construction of endurable and reliable memory devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memristor&#8208;based COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT thin film showed typical rewritable resistive switching behavior, a high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105), good endurance of 319 cycles, and a long retention time of 3.3&#215;104&#8197;s.







Abstract
Developing new materials for the fabrication of resistive random&#8208;access memory is of great significance in this period of big data. Herein, we present a novel design strategy of embedding donor (D) and acceptor (A) fragments into imine&#8208;linked frameworks to construct resistive switching covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for high&#8208;performance memristors. Two D&#8208;A&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional COFs, COF&#8208;BT&#8208;TT and COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT, were designed and synthesized using a conventional solvothermal approach, and high&#8208;quality thin films of these materials deposited on ITO substrate exhibited great potential as an active layer for memristors. Rewritable memristors based on 100&#8197;nm thick COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT and COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT films showed a high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105 and 104) and low driving voltage (1.30 and 1.60&#8197;V). The cycle period and retention time for COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT&#8208;based rewritable devices were as high as 319 cycles and 3.3&#215;104&#8197;s at a constant voltage of 0.1&#8197;V (160 cycles and 1.2&#215;104&#8197;s for the COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT memristor).

A divergent synthesis of skeletally distinct arboridinine (1) and arborisidine (2) was achieved. The central divergent strategy was inspired by the divergent biosynthetic cyclization mode of arboridinine (1) and arborisidine (2) and their hidden topological connection.







Abstract
A divergent synthesis of skeletally distinct arboridinine and arborisidine was achieved. The central divergent strategy was inspired by the divergent biosynthetic cyclization mode of arboridinine and arborisidine and their hidden topological connection. The branch point was reached through a Michael and Mannich cascade process. A site&#8208;selective intramolecular Mannich reaction was developed to construct the tetracyclic core of arboridinine, while a site&#8208;selective intramolecular &#945;&#8208;amination of ketone was used to access the tetracyclic core of arborisidine. A strategic Peterson olefination through intramolecular nucleophile delivery was able to set up the exocyclic olefin of arboridinine.

         <title>Parahydrogen Hyperpolarization Allows Direct NMR Detection of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids in Complex (Bio)mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 26954-26959, December 20, 2021. </description>

Non&#8208;hydrogenative parahydrogen hyperpolarization allows the detection and quantification of &#945;&#8208;amino acids down to sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. This method can also be applied to aqueous mixtures after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment. This direct approach was tested on human urine, allowing a well&#8208;resolved detection of amino acids despite the complexity of the mixture.







Abstract
The scope of non&#8208;hydrogenative parahydrogen hyperpolarization (nhPHIP) techniques has been expanding over the last years, with the continuous addition of important classes of substrates. For example, pyruvate can now be hyperpolarized using the Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) technique, offering a fast, efficient and low&#8208;cost PHIP alternative to Dynamic Nuclear Polarization for metabolic imaging studies. Still, important biomolecules such as amino acids have so far resisted PHIP, unless properly functionalized. Here, we report on an approach to nhPHIP for unmodified &#945;&#8208;amino acids that allows their detection and quantification in complex mixtures at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations.

     alt="Parahydrogen Hyperpolarization Allows Direct NMR Detection of &#945;-Amino Acids in Complex (Bio)mixtures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-hydrogenative parahydrogen hyperpolarization allows the detection and quantification of &#945;-amino acids down to sub-micromolar concentrations. This method can also be applied to aqueous mixtures after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment. This direct approach was tested on human urine, allowing a well-resolved detection of amino acids despite the complexity of the mixture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of non-hydrogenative parahydrogen hyperpolarization (nhPHIP) techniques has been expanding over the last years, with the continuous addition of important classes of substrates. For example, pyruvate can now be hyperpolarized using the Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) technique, offering a fast, efficient and low-cost PHIP alternative to Dynamic Nuclear Polarization for metabolic imaging studies. Still, important biomolecules such as amino acids have so far resisted PHIP, unless properly functionalized. Here, we report on an approach to nhPHIP for unmodified &#945;-amino acids that allows their detection and quantification in complex mixtures at sub-micromolar concentrations. This method was tested on human urine, in which natural &#945;-amino acids could be measured after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylation of Alkyl Iodides Enabled by Aryl Radical Activation of Carbon&#8211;Iodine Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27070-27077, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aryl radical activation strategy has been developed that can engage unactivated alkyl iodides in copper&#8208;catalyzed Negishi&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The strategy is based on the largely overlooked yet highly efficient reactivity of aryl radicals to abstract iodine atoms from alkyl iodides.







Abstract
The engagement of unactivated alkyl halides in copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions has been historically challenging, due to their low reduction potential and the slow oxidative addition of copper(I) catalysts. In this work, we report a novel strategy that leverages the halogen abstraction ability of aryl radicals, thereby engaging a diverse range of alkyl iodides in copper&#8208;catalyzed Negishi&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions at room temperature. Specifically, aryl radicals generated via copper catalysis efficiently initiate the cleavage of the carbon&#8211;iodide bonds of alkyl iodides. The alkyl radicals thus generated enter the copper catalytic cycles to couple with a difluoromethyl zinc reagent, thus furnishing the alkyl difluoromethane products. This unprecedented Negishi&#8208;type difluoromethylation approach has been applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of densely functionalized pharmaceutical agents and natural products.

Helically folded supramolecular polymers with a high internal rigidity undergo non&#8208;uniform unfolding upon UV&#8208;irradiation, affording topological block nanofibers consisting of two distinct domains with helically folded and unfolded structures.







Abstract
Synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional nanofibers with distinct topological (higher&#8208;order structural) domains in the same main chain is one of the challenging topics in modern supramolecular polymer chemistry. Non&#8208;uniform structural transformation of supramolecular polymer chains by external stimuli may enable preparation of such nanofibers. To demonstrate feasibility of this post&#8208;polymerization strategy, we prepared a photoresponsive helically folded supramolecular polymers from a barbiturate monomer containing an azobenzene&#8208;embedded rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold. In contrast to previous helically folded supramolecular polymers composed of a more flexible azobenzene monomer, UV&#8208;light induced unfolding of the newly prepared helically folded supramolecular polymers occurred nonuniformly, affording topological block copolymers consisting of folded and unfolded domains. The formation of such blocky copolymers indicates that the photoinduced unfolding of the helically folded structures initiates from relatively flexible parts such as termini or defects. Spontaneous refolding of the unfolded domains was observed after visible&#8208;light irradiation followed by aging to restore fully folded structures.

An ultrahigh supramolecular cascaded RTP&#8208;capturing system was constructed based on a multivalent supramolecular aggregate using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD) in aqueous medium. Energy transfer from G&#8834;CB[7]@SC4AD to primary (RhB or DBT) and then to secondary energy acceptors (Cy5 or NiB) gives rise to long&#8208;range and long&#8208;lived photoluminescence, especially NIR delayed emission (675&#8197;nm).







Abstract
An ultrahigh supramolecular cascaded phosphorescence&#8208;capturing aggregate was constructed by multivalent co&#8208;assembly of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and amphipathic sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD). The initial dibromophthalimide derivative (G) generated a weak phosphorescent emission at 505&#8197;nm by host&#8211;guest interaction with CB[7], which further assembled with SC4AD to form homogeneously spherical nanoparticles with a dramatic enhancement of both phosphorescence lifetime to 1.13&#8197;ms and emission intensity by 40&#8208;fold. Notably, this G&#8834;CB[7]@SC4AD aggregate exhibited efficient phosphorescence energy transfer to Rhodamine B (RhB) and benzothiadiazole (DBT) with high efficiency (&#981;ET) of 84.4&#8201;% and 76.3&#8201;% and an antenna effect (AE) of 289.4 and 119.5, respectively, and then each of these can function as a bridge to further transfer their energy to second near&#8208;IR acceptors Cy5 or Nile blue (NiB) to achieve cascaded phosphorescence energy transfer. The final aggregate with long&#8208;range effect from 425&#8197;nm to 800&#8197;nm and long&#8208;lived photoluminescence was further employed as an imaging agent for multicolour cell labeling.

Structural snapshots and mechanistic investigation of a key spiroketal synthase provide insights into extensive oxidative backbone rearrangements and spiroketal pharmacophore assembly in rubromycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The medically important bacterial aromatic polyketide natural products typically feature a planar, polycyclic core structure. An exception is found for the rubromycins, whose backbones are disrupted by a bisbenzannulated [5,6]&#8208;spiroketal pharmacophore that was recently shown to be assembled by flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes. In particular, a flavoprotein monooxygenase proved critical for the drastic oxidative rearrangement of a pentangular precursor and the installment of an intermediate [6,6]&#8208;spiroketal moiety. Here we provide structural and mechanistic insights into the control of catalysis by this spiroketal synthase, which fulfills several important functions as reductase, monooxygenase, and presumably oxidase. The enzyme hereby tightly controls the redox state of the substrate to counteract shunt product formation, while also steering the cleavage of three carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Our work illustrates an exceptional strategy for the biosynthesis of stable chroman spiroketals.

A Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement is disclosed that involves an unexpected dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and heteroaromatic compounds and allows the practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of various valuable spirolactams. Moreover, the asymmetric version of this tandem cyclization is also achieved via kinetic resolution by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis.







Abstract
Described herein is a novel Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement, allowing the practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a range of valuable spirolactams from readily available ynamides in generally good to excellent yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and broad substrate scope.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Described herein is a novel Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement, allowing the practical and atom-economic synthesis of a range of valuable spirolactams from readily available ynamides in generally good to excellent yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and broad substrate scope. Importantly, an unexpected dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and heteroaromatic compounds is involved in this tandem sequence. Moreover, an asymmetric version of this tandem cyclization was also achieved by efficient kinetic resolution by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. In addition, the [3,3]-rearrangement is shown to be kinetically preferred over the related [1,3]-rearrangement by theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;responsive lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) inducer, which can specifically accumulate in cancer cell lysosomes for evoking immunogenic cell death (ICD) and converting immunologically cold tumors into hot tumors.







Abstract
Lysosome&#8208;relevant cell death induced by lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) has recently attracted increasing attention. However, nearly no studies show that currently available LMP inducers can evoke immunogenic cell death (ICD) or convert immunologically cold tumors to hot. Herein, we report a LMP inducer named TPE&#8208;Py&#8208;pYK(TPP)pY, which can respond to alkaline phosphatase (ALP), leading to formation of nanoassembies along with fluorescence and singlet oxygen turn&#8208;on. TPE&#8208;Py&#8208;pYK(TPP)pY tends to accumulate in ALP&#8208;overexpressed cancer cell lysosomes as well as induce LMP and rupture of lysosomal membranes to massively evoke ICD. Such LMP&#8208;induced ICD effectively converts immunologically cold tumors to hot as evidenced by abundant CD8+ and CD4+ T cells infiltration into the cold tumors. Exposure of ALP&#8208;catalyzed nanoassemblies in cancer cell lysosomes to light further intensifies the processes of LMP, ICD and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor conversion. This work thus builds a new bridge between lysosome&#8208;relevant cell death and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Ion Intercalation and High Volumetric Capacitance in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Non&#8208;Porous Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27119-27125, December 20, 2021. </description>

A two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer (Ni3BHT) demonstrates rapid and reversible intercalation of both cations and anions in an electrochemical capacitor (EC). This first observation of dual&#8208;ion intercalation in ECs presents a unique scenario, wherein cation intercalation in Ni3BHT is pseudocapacitive but anion intercalation is capacitive in nature.







Abstract
Intercalation is a promising ion&#8208;sorption mechanism for enhancing the energy density of electrochemical capacitors (ECs) because it offers enhanced access to the electrochemical surface area. It requires a rapid transport of ions in and out of a host material, and it must occur without phase transformations. Materials that fulfil these requirements are rare; those that do intercalate almost exclusively cations. Herein, we show that Ni3(benzenehexathiol) (Ni3BHT), a non&#8208;porous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered coordination polymer (CP), intercalates both cations and anions with a variety of charges. Whereas cation intercalation is pseudocapacitive, anions intercalate in a purely capacitive fashion. The excellent EC performance of Ni3BHT provides a general basis for investigating similar dual&#8208;ion intercalation mechanisms in the large family of non&#8208;porous 2D CPs.

         <title>Flower&#8208;Like Colloidal Particles through Precipitation Polymerization of Redox&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystals</title>

Flower&#8208;like particles of a redox&#8208;responsive liquid crystalline mixture prepared by precipitation polymerization are reported. The influences of monomer composition, polymerization temperature, and solvent on the particle shape are investigated. The shapes formed in the early stage of polymerization remain unchanged. Under reducing conditions, the flower&#8208;like particles are degraded much more rapidly than the spherical particles due to their higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of monodisperse, flower&#8208;like, liquid crystalline (LC) polymer particles by precipitation polymerization of a LC mixture consisting of benzoic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylates and disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates. Introduction of a minor amount of redox&#8208;responsive disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates (&#8804;10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) induced the formation of flower&#8208;like shapes. The shape of the particles can be tuned from flower&#8208; to disk&#8208;like to spherical by elevating the polymerization temperature. The solvent environment also has a pronounced effect on the particle size. Time&#8208;resolved TEM reveals that the final particle morphology was formed in the early stages of the polymerization and that subsequent polymerization resulted in continued particle growth without affecting the morphology. Finally, the degradation of the particles under reducing conditions was much faster for flower&#8208;like particles than for spherical particles, likely a result of their higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.

         <title>Strong SHG Responses in a Beryllium&#8208;Free Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Hydroxyborate via Covalent Bond Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27151-27157, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical hydroxyborate, NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), was constructed by a covalent bond modification strategy via a facile hydrothermal reaction. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH is SHG&#8208;active at both 1064&#8197;nm and 532&#8197;nm, with deep&#8208;UV transparency to wavelengths below 190&#8197;nm, and good phase&#8208;matchability in the near deep&#8208;UV region, a rare combination for NLO hydroxyborates.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are key materials in creating tunable deep&#8208;UV lasers for frequency conversion technology. However, practical application of the sole usable crystal, KBe2BO3F2, has been hindered by the high toxicity of beryllium and its layering tendency in crystal growth. Herein, we report a beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;UV NLO material NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), synthesized by a covalent bond modification strategy under hydrothermal conditions. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH exhibits strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at 1064&#8197;nm (3.3 &#215; KH2PO4) and 532&#8197;nm (0.55 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4), both amongst the largest powder SHG responses for a deep&#8208;UV borate, with good phase&#8208;matchability and a short wavelength cutoff edge (below 190&#8197;nm). NSBOH possesses a 3D covalent anionic [B9O19]&#8734; honeycomb&#8208;like framework with no layering. The Sr2+ and Na+ ions, residing in the cavities of the anionic framework, act as templates for the assembly and favorable alignment of NLO&#8208;active groups, resulting in an optimal balance between strong SHG activities and wide UV transparency. These merits indicate NSBOH is a very attractive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO applications.

         <title>Rotation in an Enantiospecific Self&#8208;Assembled Array of Molecular Raffle Wheels</title>

A kagome network on the Ag(111) surface hosts guest molecules with enantiomeric selectivity. Each larger pore confines a single guest molecule. The punctuated pirouette of the guest molecule in this confined space is unravelled by a combination of density functional theory and variable temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy in real time at the single molecule level.







Abstract
Tailored nano&#8208;spaces can control enantioselective adsorption and molecular motion. We report on the spontaneous assembly of a dynamic system&#8212;a rigid kagome network with each pore occupied by a guest molecule&#8212;employing solely 2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid on Ag(111). The network cavity snugly hosts the chemically modified guest, bestows enantiomorphic adsorption and allows selective rotational motions. Temperature&#8208;dependent scanning tunnelling microscopy studies revealed distinct anchoring orientations of the guest unit switching with a 0.95&#8197;eV thermal barrier. H&#8208;bonding between the guest and the host transiently stabilises the rotating guest, as the flapper on a raffle wheel. Density functional theory investigations unravel the detailed molecular pirouette of the guest and how the energy landscape is determined by H&#8208;bond formation and breakage. The origin of the guest's enantiodirected, dynamic anchoring lies in the specific interplay of the kagome network and the silver surface.

The network cavity snugly hosts the chemically modified guest, bestows enantiomorphic adsorption and allows selective rotational motions. Temperature-dependent scanning tunnelling microscopy studies revealed distinct anchoring orientations of the guest unit switching with a 0.95&#8197;eV thermal barrier.

         <title>Fire&#8208;Retardant, Stable&#8208;Cycling and High&#8208;Safety Sodium Ion Battery</title>

Safety is always a topic of concern after reports of devices catching fire due to battery failure. Using non&#8208;flammable electrolyte as an ultimate solution is difficult to be applied to commercial batteries because of various problems such as poor compatibility, high viscosity and so on. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte with excellent comprehensive performance, and applied it to sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells with different promising materials.







Abstract
The safety of energy storage equipment has always been a stumbling block to the development of battery, and sodium ion battery is no exception. However, as an ultimate solution, the use of non&#8208;flammable electrolyte is susceptible to the side effects, and its poor compatibility with electrode, causing failure of batteries. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design to achieve high&#8208;performance sodium ion battery, which resolves the dilemma via regulating the solvation structure of electrolyte by hydrogen bonds and optimizing the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase. The reported non&#8208;flammable electrolyte allows stable charge&#8208;discharge cycling of both sodium vanadium phosphate@hard carbon and Prussian blue@hard carbon full pouch cell for more than 120 cycles with a capacity retention of &gt;85&#8201;% and high cycling Coulombic efficiency (99.7&#8201;%).

         <title>Hyperbranched Microwire Networks of Organic Cocrystals with Optical Waveguiding and Light&#8208;Harvesting Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27046-27052, December 20, 2021. </description>

Hierarchical micro&#8208; and nanostructures made of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are not yet reported due to the weak control over intermolecular interactions and little&#8208;known complex assembly behavior of organic species. Hyperbranched microwire networks comprising binary organic arene&#8208;perfluoroarene cocrystals were created, which show optical waveguiding and light&#8208;harvesting abilities.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of hyperbranched organic microwire (MW) networks comprising 1,4&#8208;bis(pentafluorostyryl)benzene (10Ft) and 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BA) using a simple solution co&#8208;assembly route. Pure 10Ft or BA assemblies cannot produce such complex MW networks; in contrast with a binary cocrystal of 10Ft and BA with a 2:1 molar ratio ((2:1)10Ft:BA), which is formed via intermolecular arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interactions. A new generation of multiple MWs grow epitaxially on the previous generation of MWs to form MW arrays in which BA may also act as an intermediate product to facilitate the regeneration of (2:1)10Ft:BA. Highly aligned and well&#8208;connected MW networks enable superior optical waveguiding ability. Moreover, a red&#8208;emitting dopant, 5,12&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)naphthacene (BN) was incorporated into (2:1)10Ft:BA host MWs, giving light&#8208;harvesting hierarchical MW networks via an energy&#8208;transfer (ET) process. The realization of the hyperbranched MWs provides us with deep insight into the rational creation of complex branched arrays from functional organic cocrystals.

         <title>Sink/Float Magnetic Immunoassays for In&#8208;Field Bioassays</title>

Sink/float magnetic immunoassays detect proteins, antibodies, and bacteria in samples using a simple mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe protocol that uses a biofunctionalized small sphere, some liquid reagents and a small permanent magnet. A simple sink/float test of the sphere identifies if the analyte is above or below a predetermined level; the sphere sinks only if the analyte is above the concentration level.







Abstract
Analytical tests/devices that are used outside laboratory settings are required to have a very simple analytical protocol to get clearance by regulatory authorities. This study describes sink/float magnetic immunoassays, a new type of rapid, mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe, instrument&#8208;free tests for the detection of biomarkers in untreated biological samples that are very simple and might meet the simple&#8208;to&#8208;use criterion of authorities to be used in the field. These tests can tell whether an analyte is above or below a predetermined level within 25&#8211;45&#8197;minutes based on the sinking or floating of a mm&#8208;sized sphere on the surface of which an immunoassay that uses reporter antibodies conjugated to superparamagnetic nanoparticles is performed. This manuscript describes the theory and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications of sink/float magnetic immunoassays for the detection of C&#8208;Reactive Protein, anti&#8208;Treponema pallidum antibodies and E.&#8197;coli bacteria.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Green Process to Synthesize MXene with Controllable Surface Terminations using Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27013-27018, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is the first study to use a molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching (MS&#8208;E&#8208;etching) method to synthesize Ti3C2Cl2 without metallic impurities. The Tx surface terminations could be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S in this one&#8208;pot process. The obtained &#8722;O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx electrode exhibited a significant increase in capacity.







Abstract
Surface terminations of two&#8208;dimensional MXene (Ti3C2Tx) considerably impact its physicochemical properties. Commonly used etching methods usually introduce &#8208;F surface terminations or metallic impurities in MXene. We present a new molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching method to synthesize fluorine&#8208;free Ti3C2Cl2. Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus, no metallics are present in the Ti3C2Cl2 product. The surface terminations can be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the variety of surface terminations.

&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to use a molten-salt-assisted electrochemical etching (MS-E-etching) method to synthesize Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without metallic impurities. The T&lt;sub&gt;

We present a new molten-salt-assisted electrochemical etching method to synthesize fluorine-free Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus, no metallics are present in the Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; product. The surface terminations can be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the variety of surface terminations. The obtained &#8722;O-terminated Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Discovery of a Rhombohedral Twelve&#8208;Connected Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Ordered Terephthalate and Fumarate Linkers</title>

The ordered arrangement of terephthalate and fumarate linkers over the fcu net produces a zirconium&#8208;based MOF Zr6(BDC)3(Fum)3 with two distinct windows and multiple guest diffusion pathways. This phase is formed by single&#8208;step synthesis in a narrow region of the available chemical space, and its identification required a large set of synthetic experiments that were facilitated by automated high&#8208;throughput methods.







Abstract
We report a metal&#8208;organic framework where an ordered array of two linkers with differing length and geometry connect [Zr6(OH)4O4]12+ clusters into a twelve&#8208;connected fcu net that is rhombohedrally distorted from cubic symmetry. The ordered binding of equal numbers of terephthalate and fumarate ditopic carboxylate linkers at the trigonal antiprismatic Zr6 core creates close&#8208;packed layers of fumarate&#8208;connected clusters that are connected along the single remaining threefold axis by terephthalates. This well&#8208;defined linker arrangement retains the three&#8208;dimensional porosity of the Zr cluster&#8208;based UiO family while creating two distinct windows within the channels that define two distinct guest diffusion paths. The ordered material is accessed by a restricted combination of composition and process parameters that were identified by high&#8208;throughput synthesis.

Through rational molecular design, simple chemical synthesis, and structure&#8211;property computation analysis, a new catholyte with high potential, two&#8208;electron transfer, and high solubility is developed for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries.







Abstract
This report describes the design of diaminocyclopropenium&#8208;phenothiazine hybrid catholytes for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries. The molecules are synthesized in a rapid and modular fashion by appending a diaminocyclopropenium (DAC) substituent to the nitrogen of the phenothiazine. Combining a versatile C&#8208;N coupling protocol (which provides access to diverse derivatives) with computation and structure&#8208;property analysis enabled the identification of a catholyte that displays stable two&#8208;electron cycling at potentials of 0.64 and 1.00&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ as well as high solubility in all oxidation states (&#8805;0.45&#8197;M in TBAPF6/MeCN). This catholyte was deployed in a high energy density two&#8208;electron RFB, exhibiting &gt;90&#8201;% capacity retention over 266&#8197;hours of flow cell cycling at &gt;0.5&#8197;M electron concentration.

         <title>Tailoring Co3d and O2p Band Centers to Inhibit Oxygen Escape for Stable 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 Cathodes</title>

         <dc:description>
The escape of surface oxygen and Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 formation are the main causes for the capacity fading of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 cathode. The oxygen escape is significantly inhibited by tailoring the Co3d and O2p band centers and enlarging their band gap with MgF2 doping, which enables a stable cycling of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 cathode.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 delivers a high capacity but sharp fading is a critical issue, and the capacity decay mechanism is also poorly understood. Herein, we clarify that the escape of surface oxygen and Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 formation are the main causes for the capacity fading of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2. We propose the inhibition of the oxygen escape for achieving stable 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 by tailoring the Co3d and O2p band center and enlarging their band gap with MgF2 doping. This enhances the ionicity of the Co&#8722;O bond and the redox activity of Co and improves cation migration reversibility. The inhibition of oxygen escape suppresses the formation of Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 and maintains the surface structure integrity. Mg acts as a pillar, providing a stable and enlarged channel for fast Li+ intercalation/extraction. The modulated LiCoO2 shows almost zero strain and achieves a record capacity retention at 4.6&#8197;V: 92&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 1C and 86.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5C.

         <title>Water Splitting by C60&#8208;Supported Vanadium Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27095-27101, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Splitting of water by a single vanadium is greatly facilitated by a C60 support, which can be regarded as a small piece of porous carbon nanomaterials, especially those with intrinsic pentagonal defects and curvatures. The compelling experimental and theoretical evidence demonstrates the important role of support in single vanadium atom catalysis.







Abstract
Water splitting is an important source of hydrogen, a promising future carrier for clean and renewable energy. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of water splitting, catalyzed by supported metal atoms or nanoparticles, is essential to improve the design of efficient catalysts. Here, we report an infrared spectroscopic study of such a water splitting process, assisted by a C60 supported vanadium atom, C60V++H2O&#8594;C60VO++H2. We probe both the entrance channel complex C60V+(H2O) and the end product C60VO+, and observe the formation of H2 as a result from resonant infrared absorption. Density functional theory calculations exploring the detailed reaction pathway reveal that a quintet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet spin crossing facilitates the water splitting reaction by C60&#8208;supported V+, whereas this reaction is kinetically hindered on the isolated V+ ion by a high energy barrier. The C60 support has an important role in lowering the reaction barrier with more than 70&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 due to a large orbital overlap of one water hydrogen atom with one carbon atom of the C60 support. This fundamental insight in the water splitting reaction by a C60&#8208;supported single vanadium atom showcases the importance of supports in single atom catalysts by modifying the reaction potential energy surface.

The compelling experimental and theoretical evidence demonstrates the important role of support in single vanadium atom catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water splitting is an important source of hydrogen, a promising future carrier for clean and renewable energy. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of water splitting, catalyzed by supported metal atoms or nanoparticles, is essential to improve the design of efficient catalysts. Here, we report an infrared spectroscopic study of such a water splitting process, assisted by a C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; supported vanadium atom, C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;+H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8594;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;+H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We probe both the entrance channel complex C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and the end product C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and observe the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a result from resonant infrared absorption. Density functional theory calculations exploring the detailed reaction pathway reveal that a quintet-to-triplet spin crossing facilitates the water splitting reaction by C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-supported V&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas this reaction is kinetically hindered on the isolated V&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion by a high energy barrier. The C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; support has an important role in lowering the reaction barrier with more than 70&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; due to a large orbital overlap of one water hydrogen atom with one carbon atom of the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; support. This fundamental insight in the water splitting reaction by a C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-supported single vanadium atom showcases the importance of supports in single atom catalysts by modifying the reaction potential energy surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatial Structure Regulation: A Rod&#8208;Shaped Viologen Enables Long Lifetime in Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a rod&#8208;like sulfonated viologen (R&#8208;Vi) anolyte for aqueous redox flow batteries (AORFBs). R&#8208;Vi possesses a low membrane&#8208;penetration rate of &#8776;10&#8722;10&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 and the lowest redox potential of &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. SHE among one&#8208;electron&#8208;storage viologens in AORFBs simultaneously. The R&#8208;Vi&#8208;based AORFB exhibits an extremely low capacity&#8208;fade rate of 0.007&#8201;% per cycle in 3200 continuous charging&#8211;discharging processes.







Abstract
A stable rod&#8208;like sulfonated viologen (R&#8208;Vi) derivative is developed through a spatial&#8208;structure&#8208;adjustment strategy for neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). The obtained R&#8208;Vi features four individual methyl groups on the 2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions of the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine core ring. The tethered methyls confine the movement of the alkyl chain as well as the sulfonic anion, thus driving the spatial structure from sigmoid to rod shape. The R&#8208;Vi with weak charge attraction and large molecular dimension displays an ultralow membrane permeability that is only 14.7&#8201;% of that of typical sigmoid viologen. Moreover, the electron&#8208;donating effect of methyls endows R&#8208;Vi with the lowest redox potential of &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. SHE among one&#8208;electron&#8208;storage viologen&#8208;based AORFBs. The AORFB with the R&#8208;Vi anolyte and a K4Fe(CN)6 catholyte exhibits an energy efficiency up to 87&#8201;% and extremely low capacity&#8208;fade rate of 0.007&#8201;% per cycle in 3200 continuous cycles.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Oxygen Activation of Iridium Clusters Stabilized on Amorphous Bimetal Borides Array for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

Iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on an amorphous metal boride array are reported, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induces the formation of high&#8208;valence cobalt species and Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Co bridges between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth understanding for water electrolysis. Herein, we report iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on amorphous metal borides array, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induced the formation of high valence cobalt species and Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Co bridge between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale, engineering lattice oxygen activation and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer to trigger multiple active sites for intrinsic pH&#8208;dependent OER activity. The lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) was confirmed by in situ 18O isotope labeling mass spectrometry and chemical recognition of negative peroxo&#8208;like species. Theoretical simulations reveal that the OER performance on this catalyst is intrinsically dominated by LOM pathway, facilitating the reaction kinetics. This work not only paves an avenue for the rational design of electrocatalysts, but also serves the fundamental insights into the lattice oxygen participation for promising OER application.

         <title>Oil&#8211;Water&#8211;Oil Triphase Synthesis of Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27078-27085, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oil&#8211;water&#8211;oil triphase method based on a phase engineering strategy is developed for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets (iCOFNs). A favourable reaction region with moderate monomer concentration is achieved in the middle water phase. The resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs show potential for ultrathin biogas separation membranes.







Abstract
Ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets (iCOFNs) with long&#8208;range ordered and mono&#8208;dispersed ionic groups hold great potential in many advanced applications. Considering the inherent drawbacks of oil&#8211;water biphase method, herein, we explore an oil&#8211;water&#8211;oil triphase method based on phase engineering strategy for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of iCOFNs. The middle water phase serves as a confined reaction region, and the two oil phases are reservoirs for storing and supplying monomers to the water phase. A large aqueous space and low monomer concentration lead to the anisotropic gradual growth of iCOFNs into few&#8208;layer thickness, large lateral size, and high crystallinity. Notably, the resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs exhibit ultra&#8208;high aspect ratios of up to 20,000. We further demonstrate their application potential by processing into ultrathin defect&#8208;free COF membranes for efficient biogas separation. Our triphase method may offer an alternative platform technology for the synthesis and innovative applications of iCOFNs.

         <title>Chiroptical Switching and Quantitative Chirality Sensing with (Pseudo)halogenated Quinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27031-27038, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinones are used for quantitative UV/CD sensing of the concentration and enantiomeric excess of more than thirty aliphatic and aromatic chiral amines, amino alcohols and amino acids. The integration of redox switching into the sensing protocol allows spectral deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra that are obtained with challenging compound mixtures.







Abstract
(Pseudo)halogenated quinones react smoothly with chiral amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids toward push&#8211;pull conjugates with optical sensing and switching applications. The chiroptically active conjugates serve as redox switches between two reversibly interconverting states with remarkably different UV and CD signatures. Addition of sodium borohydride generates a hydroquinone derivative that is quantitatively re&#8208;oxidized to the original quinone upon exposure to air. This chiroptical quinone/hydroquinone redox switch system combines several attractive features such as simple set&#8208;up, use of inexpensive chemicals, short response time, and thermal and photochemical stability. A conceptually new sensing approach that is based on integrated chiroptical amplification and redox switching enables on&#8208;the&#8208;fly deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra and is used for quantitative er analysis of challenging samples containing constitutional isomers in varying enantiomeric compositions.

         <title>Construction of Tricyclic Nitrogen Heterocycles by a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Allenynes and Application to Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems</title>

The gold&#8208;catalyzed biscyclization of hydroxyisobutyryl (Hib)&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was promoted by BrettPhosAuNTf2 in the presence of iPrOH to give 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indole derivatives, some of which were converted into nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. A hexacyclic indolium salt (see structure) showed concentration&#8208;dependent photophysical properties attributable to aggregate formation.







Abstract
A novel approach to the direct construction of tricyclic nitrogen heterocycles based on gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of aminoallenynes is described. The expected biscyclization reaction of hydroxyisobutyryl&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was efficiently promoted by a catalytic amount of BrettPhosAuNTf2 in the presence of iPrOH to produce 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indole derivatives in good yields. When the reaction was combined with Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation or palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation, the resulting tricyclic products were efficiently converted into nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N&#8208;PACs) with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. A newly obtained hexacyclic indolium salt showed characteristic concentration&#8208;dependent absorption and emission properties.

         <title>Irradiation&#8208;Wavelength Directing Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Chiral Fluorescent Molecular Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27158-27163, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phototuning the turning&#8208;off and the polarization inversion of circularly polarized luminescence signals is obtained in the corresponding photostationary state of the same helical cholesteric superstructure constructed from the light&#8208;driven hydrogen bonded chiral fluorescent molecular switch, which derives from the different conversion ratio of Z/E photoisomerization of the switch upon different light irradiations.







Abstract
Two light&#8208;driven chiral fluorescent molecular switches, (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 1 and (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 2, are prepared by means of hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) assembly of a photoresponsive (S) chiral fluorescent molecule, respectively with a cyano substitution at different positions as an H&#8208;bond acceptor and an opposite (R) chiral molecule as an H&#8208;bond donor. The resulting two switches exhibit tunable and reversible Z/E photoisomerization irradiated with 450&#8197;nm blue and 365&#8197;nm UV light. When doped into an achiral liquid crystal, both switches are found to be able to form a CPL tunable luminescent helical superstructure. In contrast to the tunable CPL characteristics of the system incorporating switch 2, exposure of the system incorporating switch 1 to 365&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm radiation can lead to controllable different photostationary CPL behavior, including switching&#8208;off and polarization inversion. In addition, optical information coding is demonstrated using the system containing switch 1.

The first osmium&#8208;catalyzed electrooxidative C&#8722;H annulation is disclosed. While improved selectivities are possible, unprecedented osmium intermediates are presented along with detailed kinetic studies, which revealed the working mode of osmaelectrocatalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose osmaelectrocatalyzed C&#8722;H activations that set the stage for electrooxidative alkyne annulations by benzoic acids. The osmium electrocatalysis enables site&#8208; and chemoselective electrooxidative C&#8722;H activations with unique levels of selectivity. The isolation of unprecedented osmium(0) and osmium(II) intermediates, along with crystallographic characterization and analyses by spectrometric and spectroscopic in&#8197;operando techniques delineate a synergistic osmium redox catalyst regime. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed a facile C&#8722;H cleavage, which allows for an ample substrate scope, providing provide robust and user&#8208;friendly access to annulated heterocycles.

The reaction product between the bulky FmesBH2 borane and an isonitrile serves as a B/N frustrated Lewis pair that adds nitriles to form the dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole heteroarene derivatives. One example of this class of compounds was shown to undergo a cycloaddition reaction with N&#8208;phenylmaleimide.







Abstract
The borane FmesBH2 reacts in a three&#8208;component reaction with an isonitrile and a small series of organonitriles to give rare examples of the class of dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivatives. In a related way, annulated BN&#8208;indolizine derivatives became conveniently available, as were dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;oxaza&#8208; or thiazaborole derivatives. The nucleophilic framework of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole example allowed for an uncatalyzed acylation reaction. It also served as a 1,3&#8208;dipolar reagent and underwent a [3+2] cycloaddition/[4+2] cycloreversion sequence when treated with methyl propiolate to give the respective pyrrole product. The [3+2] cycloaddition product of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivative with N&#8208;phenylmaleimide was isolated and its heterobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derived structure characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>A Free Aluminylene with Diverse &#963;&#8208;Donating and Doubly &#963;/&#960;&#8208;Accepting Ligand Features for Transition Metals**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27062-27069, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline carbazolylaluminylene with a monocoordinated aluminium atom featuring a lone pair of electrons and two vacant orbitals has been isolated at room temperature. The coordination behavior of this aluminylene towards transition metal centers is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene and alumanyl complexes with diverse coordination modes in a one&#8208;step process.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis, characterization, and coordination chemistry of a free N&#8208;aluminylene, namely a carbazolylaluminylene 2&#8201;b. This species is prepared via a reduction reaction of the corresponding carbazolyl aluminium diiodide. The coordination behavior of 2&#8201;b towards transition metal centers (W, Cr) is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene complexes 3&#8211;6 with diverse coordination modes. We demonstrate that the tri&#8208;active ambiphilic Al center in 2&#8201;b can behave as: 1.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; 2.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating, &#963;&#8208;accepting and &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; and 3.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#963;&#8208;accepting ligand. Additionally, we show ligand exchange at the aluminylene center providing access to the modulation of electronic properties of transition metals without changing the coordinated atoms. Investigations of 2&#8201;b with IDippCuCl (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) show an unprecedented aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation leading to a rare terminal Cu&#8208;alumanyl complex 8. The electronic structures of such complexes and the mechanism of the aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation are investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

     alt="A Free Aluminylene with Diverse &#963;-Donating and Doubly &#963;/&#960;-Accepting Ligand Features for Transition Metals**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crystalline carbazolylaluminylene with a monocoordinated aluminium atom featuring a lone pair of electrons and two vacant orbitals has been isolated at room temperature. The coordination behavior of this aluminylene towards transition metal centers is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene and alumanyl complexes with diverse coordination modes in a one-step process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein the synthesis, characterization, and coordination chemistry of a free N-aluminylene, namely a carbazolylaluminylene &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;. This species is prepared via a reduction reaction of the corresponding carbazolyl aluminium diiodide. The coordination behavior of &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; towards transition metal centers (W, Cr) is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene complexes &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; with diverse coordination modes. We demonstrate that the tri-active ambiphilic Al center in &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; can behave as: 1.&#8197;a &#963;-donating and doubly &#960;-accepting ligand; 2.&#8197;a &#963;-donating, &#963;-accepting and &#960;-accepting ligand; and 3.&#8197;a &#963;-donating and doubly &#963;-accepting ligand. Additionally, we show ligand exchange at the aluminylene center providing access to the modulation of electronic properties of transition metals without changing the coordinated atoms. Investigations of &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; with IDippCuCl (IDipp=1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) show an unprecedented aluminylene-alumanyl transformation leading to a rare terminal Cu-alumanyl complex &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;. The electronic structures of such complexes and the mechanism of the aluminylene-alumanyl transformation are investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Nuclear&#8208;spin driven relaxation collaborating with the ligands in lanthanide single molecule magnets (SMMs) remains ambiguous. In their Communication on page&#8197;27282, Liviu Ungur, Jun&#8208;Liang Liu, and co&#8208;workers report two HoIII isotopic&#8208;isomorphic SMMs, whose magnetization dynamics reveals a switch in the relative relaxation rates at low/high temperatures. A theoretical analysis suggests that the noticeable isotope effect arises from the tunnel splitting and the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the distinct nuclear spin numbers of 1H and 2H.

This Review describes recent advances in the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven preparation of nanometric molecular films of various molecules on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena. We hope to encourage the design of a facile and efficient route for molecular optoelectronic and flexible electronic applications.







Abstract
Molecules are fascinating candidates for constructing tunable and electrically conducting devices by the assembly of either a single molecule or an ensemble of molecules between two electrical contacts followed by current&#8208;voltage (I&#8208;V) analysis, which is often termed &#8220;molecular electronics&#8221;. Recently, there has been also an upsurge of interest in spin&#8208;based electronics or spintronics across the molecules, which offer additional scope to create ultrafast responsive devices with less power consumption and lower heat generation using the intrinsic spin property rather than electronic charge. Researchers have been exploring this idea of utilizing organic molecules, organometallics, coordination complexes, polymers, and biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, oligopeptides, DNA) in integrating molecular electronics and spintronics devices. Although several methods exist to prepare molecular thin&#8208;films on suitable electrodes, the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven technique has emerged as highly efficient. In this Review we describe recent advances in the electrochemical potential driven growth of nanometric various molecular films on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena.

High&#8208;entropy alloys offer a huge variety of multielement active sites on a single catalytic surface. This special polyelemental arrangement implies several different fundamental concepts in structure&#8211;activity correlations compared to traditional electrocatalysts, which are summarised and their implications for the possibility to adjust the catalytic properties with different limitations are discussed in detail.







Abstract
The formation of a vast number of different multielement active sites in compositionally complex solid solution materials, often more generally termed high&#8208;entropy alloys, offers new and unique concepts in catalyst design, which mitigate existing limitations and change the view on structure&#8211;activity relations. We discuss these concepts by summarising the currently existing fundamental knowledge and critically assess the chances and limitations of this material class, also highlighting design strategies. A roadmap is proposed, illustrating which of the characteristic concepts could be exploited using which strategy, and which breakthroughs might be possible to guide future research in this highly promising material class for (electro)catalysis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Triazolate&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived FeN4Cl1 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Hierarchical Porosity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27324-27329, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn/Fe&#8208;bimetallic metal&#8208;triazolate framework (MET) modified with 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole (dcIm) was used to prepare the Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst FeN4Cl1/NC. In the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the catalyst offers fast mass transfer and high catalytic activity because of abundant mesopores (pore:volume ratio 0.92), a high Fe loading (2.78&#8197;wt&#8201;%), and defined FeN4Cl1 sites with a distinct electronic structure.







Abstract
The construction of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high single atom densities, favorable electronic structures and fast mass transfer is highly desired. We have utilized metal&#8208;triazolate (MET) frameworks, a subclass of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high N content, as precursors since they can enhance the density and regulate the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom sites, as well as generate abundant mesopores simultaneously. Fe single atoms dispersed in a hierarchically porous N&#8208;doped carbon matrix with high metal content (2.78&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and a FeN4Cl1 configuration (FeN4Cl1/NC), as well as mesopores with a pore:volume ratio of 0.92, were obtained via the pyrolysis of a Zn/Fe&#8208;bimetallic MET modified with 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole. FeN4Cl1/NC exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations confirm that Cl can optimize the adsorption free energy of Fe sites to *OH, thereby promoting the ORR process. The catalyst demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8208;air batteries. This strategy selects, designs, and adjusts MOFs as precursors for high&#8208;performance SACs.

         <title>Structural Basis for Inhibition of ROS&#8208;Producing Respiratory Complex I by NADH&#8208;OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27277-27281, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel inhibitor NADH&#8208;OH binds with high affinity to respiratory complex I, thereby blocking NADH oxidation and the production of reactive oxygen species. The tight interaction is mediated by residues conserved in complex I but lacking in other enzymes containing a Rossmann&#8208;fold. Accordingly, it is a lead structure for the development of new drugs for fighting oxygen stress.







Abstract
NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, respiratory complex I, plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism. As a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) it affects ageing and mitochondrial dysfunction. The novel inhibitor NADH&#8208;OH specifically blocks NADH oxidation and ROS production by complex I in nanomolar concentrations. Attempts to elucidate its structure by NMR spectroscopy have failed. Here, by using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, we report the structure of NADH&#8208;OH bound in the active site of a soluble fragment of complex I at 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution. We have identified key amino acid residues that are specific and essential for binding NADH&#8208;OH. Furthermore, the structure sheds light on the specificity of NADH&#8208;OH towards the unique Rossmann&#8208;fold of complex I and indicates a regulatory role in mitochondrial ROS generation. In addition, NADH&#8208;OH acts as a lead&#8208;structure for the synthesis of a novel class of ROS suppressors.

Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), especially MOF nanosheets (NS), are very good candidates for photocatalysis. In this work, two types of donor&#8211;acceptor MOF NSs were prepared, including an acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS and a donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor NS. It was found that the acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS type has very good performance even with fewer catalytic centres. This may help future research to design photocatalysts.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency photocatalysis in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) and MOF nanosheets (NSs) are often limited by their short&#8208;lived charge separation as well as self&#8208;quenching. Here, we propose to use the energy&#8208;transfer process (EnT) to increase charge separation, thus enhancing the catalytic performance of a series of MOF NSs. With the use of NS, the photocatalyst can also be well isolated to reduce self&#8208;quenching. Tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (H4TCPP) and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8208;benzoic acid)pyrene (H4TBAPy) linkers were chosen as the acceptor and donor moieties, respectively. Accounting for the precise spatial design afforded by the MOF NSs, the donor and acceptor moieties could be closely positioned on the NSs, allowing for an efficient EnT process as well as a high degree of site isolation. Two templates, donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor NS and acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS catalysts, were successfully synthesized, and the results show that the second one has much enhanced catalytic performances over the first one due to site&#8208;isolated active photocatalysts.

         <title>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Hybrid Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanosheets of Phase Pure n=2: Stabilized Colloids Stored in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27312-27317, December 20, 2021. </description>

Quantum confined nanosheets (NSs) of 3D perovskites with a thickness of two lead halide layers can be prepared by using the dodecylammonium/tosylate ligand pair. The addition of Eu&#8208;nanodots to the colloid prevented the NSs from a structural rearrangement and/or coalescence. Deep blue&#8208;emissive colloids were recovered by simply dispersing it in toluene.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper lead halide perovskite (RP&#8208;LHP) nano&#8208;nanostructures can be regarded as self&#8208;assembled quantum wells or superlattices of 3D perovskites with an intrinsic quantum well thickness of a single or a few (n=2&#8208;4) lead halide layers; the quantum wells are separated by organic layers. They can be scaled down to a single quantum well dimension. Here, the preparation of highly (photo)chemical and colloidal stable hybrid LHP nanosheets (NSs) of ca. 7.4&#8197;&#956;m lateral size and 2.5&#8197;nm quantum well height (thereby presenting a deep blue emission at ca. 440&#8197;nm), is reported for the first time. The NSs are close&#8208;lying and they even interconnect when deposited on a substrate. Their synthesis is based on the use of the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid/dodecylamine (pTS/DDA) ligand pair and their (photo)chemical stability and photoluminescence is enhanced by adding EuBr2 nanodots (EuNDs). Strikingly, they can be preserved as a solid and stored for at least one year. The blue emissive colloid can be recovered from the solid as needed by simply dispersing the powder in toluene and then using it to prepare solid films, making them very promising candidates for manufacturing devices.

A highly efficient, versatile and atom&#8208;economic protocol to chiral allylic phosphine oxides is demonstrated via palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of allenes with phosphine oxides. A family of chiral allylic phosphine oxides with a diverse range of functional groups were obtained in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrophosphinylation of alkyl and aryl&#8208;oxyallenes with phosphine oxides has been developed for the efficient and rapid construction of a family of chiral allylic phosphine oxides with a diverse range of functional groups. This methodology was further applied in the facile construction of chiral 2H&#8208;chromene and later stage functionalization of cholesterol.

         <title>Magnetization Dynamics on Isotope&#8208;Isomorphic Holmium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27282-27287, December 20, 2021. </description>

We reported the nuclear&#8208;spin driven magnetization dynamics involving both metal ion and the ligand, for first time, in two HoIII isomorphic single&#8208;molecule magnets, where the behavior is originated from the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in nuclear spin number of protium (I=1/2) and deuterium (I=1).







Abstract
Here we reported the deuteration of the metal&#8208;binding equatorial water molecules in a reported HoIII single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) with pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal geometry, from [Ho(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5]3+ to [Ho(CyPh2PO)2(D2O)5]3+. The hyperfine structures originating from the nuclear spin of 165HoIII can be clearly observed. Moreover, the resulting magnetization dynamics revealed the switch of the relative relaxation rates for the two isotope&#8208;isomorphic complexes&#8212;respectively faster/slower at low/high temperature. The noticeable isotope effect arises from not only the paramagnetic metal center but also the diamagnetic ligands, which can be explained by the ab initio calculated tunnel splitting and the involvement of the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in the nuclear spin number of protium (1H, I=1/2) and deuterium (2H, I=1).

         <title>Probing Redox Non&#8208;Innocence in Iron&#8211;Carbene Complexes {Fe=C(H)Ar}10&#8211;11 by 1,2H and 13C Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27220-27224, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented herein are detailed 1/2H and 13C pulse EPR and DFT investigations of an S=1/2 terminal iron&#8211;carbene species. These studies reveal substantial spin density localized at the carbene&#8208;bound Fe center, in contrast with what has been reported to date for radical metal&#8211;carbenoid species. The {Fe=C(H)Ar}11 complex serves as a well&#8208;defined reference compound for comparison to data reported for in situ trapped intermediates.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a series of iron&#8208;carbene complexes in redox states {Fe=C(H)Ar}10&#8211;11. Pulse EPR studies of the 1,2H and 13C isotopologues of {Fe=C(H)Ar}11 reveal the high covalency of the Fe&#8211;carbene bonding, leading to a more even spin distribution than commonly observed for reduced Fischer carbenes.

Pulse EPR studies of the &lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotopologues of {Fe=C(H)Ar}&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; reveal the high covalency of the Fe&#8211;carbene bonding, leading to a more even spin distribution than commonly observed for reduced Fischer carbenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3,4,5&#8208;Trimethoxy Substitution on an N&#8208;DMBI Dopant with New N&#8208;Type Polymers: Polymer&#8208;Dopant Matching for Improved Conductivity&#8208;Seebeck Coefficient Relationship</title>

Two n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with different backbones and a n&#8208;type dopant 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (TP&#8208;DMBI) are synthesized, and electron mobility of 0.53&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics are achieved by TP&#8208;DMBI doped films, which out&#8208;perform N&#8208;DMBI doped films.







Abstract
Achieving high electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor simultaneously for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics is still challenging. By constructing two new acceptor&#8208;acceptor n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with different backbones and introducing the 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl group to form the new n&#8208;type dopant 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (TP&#8208;DMBI), high electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 are achieved. Calculations using Density Functional Theory show that TP&#8208;DMBI presents a higher singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) energy level of &#8722;1.94&#8197;eV than that of the common dopant 4&#8208;(1, 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2, 3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) phenyl) dimethylamine (N&#8208;DMBI) (&#8722;2.36&#8197;eV), which can result in a larger offset between the SOMO of dopant and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of n&#8208;type polymers, though that effect may not be dominant in the present work. The doped polymer films exhibit higher Seebeck coefficient and power factor than films using N&#8208;DMBI at the same doping levels or similar electrical conductivity levels. Moreover, TP&#8208;DMBI doped polymer films offer much higher electron mobility of up to 0.53&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 than films with N&#8208;DMBI doping, demonstrating the potential of TP&#8208;DMBI, and 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxy DMBIs more broadly, for high performance n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.

         <title>Palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of sec&#8208;Phosphine Oxides by P&#8208;Benzylation</title>

         <dc:description>
A kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides via the enantioselective P&#8208;benzylation process catalyzed by the palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos was designed. Both, tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphine oxides were delivered in good yield and excellent enantiopurity (selectivity factor up to 226.1). The synthetic utilities are further demonstrated by the facile preparation of several P&#8208;chiral compounds, precursors of bidentate ligands, and transition metal complexes.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphines have wide applications in asymmetric catalysis, materials, and pharmaceutical chemistry, however, their practical synthesis still constitutes a significant challenge. Herein, a successful kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides via the enantioselective P&#8208;benzylation process catalyzed by the palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos was designed. Both tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphine oxides were delivered in good yield and excellent enantiopurity (selectivity factor up to 226.1). The appealing synthetic utilities are further demonstrated by the facile preparation of several valuable P&#8208;chiral compounds, precursors of bidentate ligands, as well as transition metal complexes.

         <title>The Formal Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amines and Carboxylic Acids to Form sp3&#8211;sp3 Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bonds</title>

An amine&#8211;carboxylic acid C&#8722;C coupling would be a valuable addition to the synthetic toolbox of carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions. Using miniaturized high&#8208;throughput experimentation, we have developed the first amine&#8211;acid cross&#8208;coupling to form C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds based on preactivation of the building blocks and nickel catalysis.







Abstract
We have developed a deaminative&#8211;decarboxylative protocol to form new carbon(sp3)&#8211;carbon(sp3) bonds from activated amines and carboxylic acids. Amines and carboxylic acids are ubiquitous building blocks, available in broad chemical diversity and at lower cost than typical C&#8722;C coupling partners. To leverage amines and acids for C&#8722;C coupling, we developed a reductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling utilizing building block activation as pyridinium salts and redox&#8208;active esters, respectively. Miniaturized high&#8208;throughput experimentation studies were critical to our reaction optimization, with subtle experimental changes such as order of reagent addition, composition of a binary solvent system, and ligand identity having a significant impact on reaction performance. The developed protocol is used in the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceuticals while more than one thousand systematically captured and machine&#8208;readable reaction datapoints are reposited.

         <title>Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I: Biosynthetic Origins of the Elusive Racemic Papaveraceae Isoxazolidine Alkaloids**

The first synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I, an isoxazolidine Papaveraceae alkaloid, is realized through a biomimetic strategy. The synthesis sheds light to the possible biosynthetic origins of these elusive natural product family members.







Abstract
The biosynthetic origins of the structurally related racemic isoxazolidine Papaveraceae alkaloids Setigerumine&#8197;I, Dactylicapnosinine and Dactylicapnosine have remained elusive since their original isolation over two decades ago. Herein we report the first biosynthetic hypothesis for their formation and, inspired by it, the first synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I with accompanying computational rationale. Based on the results, these isoxazolidine alkaloids arise from racemizing oxidative rearrangements of prominent isoquinoline alkaloids Noscapine and Hydrastine. The key steps featured in this synthesis are a room temperature Cope elimination and a domino oxidation/inverse&#8208;electron demand 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of an axially chiral, yet configurationally unstable, intermediate. The work opens this previously inaccessible family of natural products for biological studies.

         <title>A Molecular Compound for Highly Selective Purification of Ethylene</title>

Structurally flexible, copper scorpionate binds ethylene extremely selectively from an ethylene&#8211;ethane mixture and displays excellent performance as a reusable material for the important and challenging C2H4/C4H6 separation.







Abstract
Purification of C2H4 from an C2H4 /C2H6 mixture is one of the most challenging separation processes, which is achieved mainly through energy&#8208;intensive, cryogenic distillation in industry. Sustainable, non&#8208;distillation methods are highly desired as alternatives. We discovered that the fluorinated bis(pyrazolyl)borate ligand supported copper(I) complex {[(CF3)2Bp]Cu}3 has features very desirable in an olefin&#8211;paraffin separation material. It binds ethylene exclusively over ethane generating [(CF3)2Bp]Cu(C2H4). This molecular compound exhibits extremely high and record ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) C2H4 /C2H6 gas separation selectivity, affording high purity (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) ethylene that can be readily desorbed from separation columns. In&#8208;situ PXRD provides a &#8220;live&#8221; picture of the reversible conversion between [(CF3)2Bp]Cu(C2H4) and the ethylene&#8208;free sorbent in the solid&#8208;state, driven by the presence or removal of C2H4. Molecular structures of trinuclear {[(CF3)2Bp]Cu}3 and mononuclear [(CF3)2Bp]Cu(C2H4) are also presented.

         <title>Direct, Site&#8208;Selective and Redox&#8208;Neutral &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of Tetrahydrofurans via Quantum Dots Photocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, THF is activated by visible light irradiation of quantum dots in a direct, site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The resultant &#945;&#8208;oxyalkyl radicals, generated from &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H of THF on the surface of QD, enable either coupling with the &#945;&#8208;amino radical of amines, or addition to chromones and terminal alkynes.







Abstract
As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, the intrinsic chemical inertness of tetrahydrofuran (THF) makes direct and site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation difficult, especially under redox neutral condition. Here, we demonstrate that semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of THF via forming QDs/THF conjugates. Under visible light irradiation, the resultant alkoxyalkyl radical directly engages in radical cross&#8208;coupling with &#945;&#8208;amino radical from amino C&#8722;H bonds or radical addition with alkene or phenylacetylene, respectively. In contrast to stoichiometric oxidant or hydrogen atom transfer reagents required in previous studies, the scalable benchtop approach can execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation of THF only by a QD photocatalyst under redox&#8208;neutral condition, thus providing a broad of value added chemicals starting from bulk THFs reagent.

         <title>Influence of Isomerism on Radioluminescence of Purely Organic Phosphorescence Scintillators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27195-27200, December 20, 2021. </description>

We present an isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. Under UV&#8208;light excitation, all isomers showed bright phosphorescence with an efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;%. Unexpectedly, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA scintillators showed bright luminescence under X&#8208;ray irradiation, which was ascribed to both excellent electrical conductivity and efficient suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay.







Abstract
There are few reports about purely organic phosphorescence scintillators, and the relationship between molecular structures and radioluminescence in organic scintillators is still unclear. Here, we presented isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. The isomers can achieve phosphorescence efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;% by ultraviolet irradiation. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA show excellent radioluminescence, while o&#8208;BA has almost no radioluminescence. Through experimental and theoretical investigation, we found that radioluminescence was not only affected by non&#8208;radiation in emissive process, but also highly depended on the material conductivity caused by the different molecular packing. This study not only allows us to clearly understand the relationship between the molecular structures and radioluminescence, but also provides a guidance to rationally design new organic scintillators.

The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds is an important way to construct P&#8208;chiral ligands. Herein, we report a new strategy that adopts the pyridinyl moiety as the coordinating group in the cobalt&#8208;catalysed asymmetric nucleophilic addition/alkylation of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs). A series of tertiary phosphine oxides (TPOs) were generated with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99.5&#8201;% ee, and with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance.

Radical&#8211;radical chain reactions may contribute to rapid growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in combustion and astrochemical environments. Phenyl and benzyl radicals were experimentally observed to complete this chain reaction, producing diphenylmethyl and triphenylmethyl radicals by prompt H&#8208;atom loss (see scheme). This observation confirms the plausibility of such chain reactions at high temperature and low pressure.







Abstract
Rapid molecular&#8208;weight growth of hydrocarbons occurs in flames, in industrial synthesis, and potentially in cold astrochemical environments. A variety of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature chemical mechanisms have been proposed and confirmed, but more facile pathways may be needed to explain observations. We provide laboratory confirmation in a controlled pyrolysis environment of a recently proposed mechanism, radical&#8211;radical chain reactions of resonance&#8208;stabilized species. The recombination reaction of phenyl (c&#8208;C6H5) and benzyl (c&#8208;C6H5CH2) radicals produces both diphenylmethane and diphenylmethyl radicals, the concentration of the latter increasing with rising temperature. A second phenyl addition to the product radical forms both triphenylmethane and triphenylmethyl radicals, confirming the propagation of radical&#8211;radical chain reactions under the experimental conditions of high temperature (1100&#8211;1600&#8197;K) and low pressure (ca. 3&#8197;kPa). Similar chain reactions may contribute to particle growth in flames, the interstellar medium, and industrial reactors.

         <title>An Iridium Catalytic System Compatible with Inorganic and Organic Nitrogen Sources for Dual Asymmetric Reductive Amination Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27307-27311, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two successive asymmetric reductive aminations (ARAs) have been merged into one reaction system to generate enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric secondary amines. The iridium&#8208;phosphoramidite complex successfully manages the dual ARAs by using two distinctly different types of amine sources: an inorganic ammonium salt and an organic primary amine.







Abstract
Asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) is one of the most promising methods for the synthesis of chiral amines. Herein we report our efforts on merging two ARA reactions into a single&#8208;step transformation. Catalyzed by a complex formed from iridium and a steric hindered phosphoramidite, readily available and inexpensive aromatic ketones initially undergo the first ARA with ammonium acetate to afford primary amines, which serve as the amine sources for the second ARA, and finally provide the enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric secondary amine products. The developed process competently enables the successive coupling of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources with ketones in the same reaction system. The Br&#248;nsted acid additive plays multiple roles in this procedure: it accelerates the formation of imine intermediates, minimizes the inhibitory effect of N&#8208;containing species on the iridium catalyst, and reduces the primary amine side products.

A new perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation protocol debuts: Consecutive triple fluorinations of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) generate (CF3)3C&#8722; species, which enables efficient nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation of various electrophiles. The C(CF3)3&#8208;containing products can be successfully applied in 19F&#8208;magnetic resonance imaging.







Abstract
Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation reaction has long remained a challenging task. We now report the use of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) as a practical reagent for perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation reactions for the first time. Through a consecutive triple&#8208;fluorination process with DBBF and CsF, the (CF3)3C&#8722; species can be liberated and observed, which is able to serve as a robust nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylating agent for various electrophiles. The power of this synthetic protocol is evidenced by the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated molecules. Multiple applications demonstrate the practicability of this method, as well as the superiority of perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated compounds as sensitive probes. The perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated product was successfully applied in 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment with an ultra&#8208;low field (ULF) MRI system.

The generation of FSO2 radicals under electrochemical conditions is reported. Various sulfonyl fluorides and heterocycles, including a novel oxathiazole dioxide heterocycle, can be obtained in good to excellent yields. Some &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives showed potent activities against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.







Abstract
Radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which have widespread applications in many fields, in particular in the context of chemical biology and drug development. Here, we report the first investigation of FSO2 radical generation under electrochemical conditions, and the establishment of a new and facile approach for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides via oxo&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes with sulfuryl chlorofluoride as the radical precursor and air as the oxidant. This electrochemical protocol is amenable to access two different products (&#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides or &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides) with the same reactants. The &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluoride products can be utilized as useful building blocks in the synthesis of various derivatives and heterocycles, including the first synthesis of an oxathiazole dioxide compound. Furthermore, some &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives exhibited notably potent activities against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.

         <title>Enzyme Catalysis in Non&#8208;Native Environment with Unnatural Selectivity Using Polymeric Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27189-27194, December 20, 2021. </description>

Amphiphilic random copolymers were employed to construct enzyme nanoreactors for catalysis in an organic solvent. Unnatural selectivity over a range of substrates was introduced by tuning the cross&#8208;linking density.







Abstract
The utilization of enzymes for catalysis in organic solvents, while exhibiting selectivity to different substrates, is a big challenge. We report an amphiphilic random copolymer system that self&#8208;assembles with enzymes in an organic solvent to form nanoreactors. These encapsulated enzymes are not denatured and they do preserve the catalytic activity. The cross&#8208;linkable functional groups in the hydrophobic compartments of the polymers offer to control accessibility to the enzyme. This varied accessibility due to the polymer host, rather than the enzyme itself, endows the nanoreactor with an unnatural selectivity. The findings here highlight the significant potential of simple polymer&#8208;based enzyme nanoreactors to execute selective organic reactions under non&#8208;native conditions.

         <title>Stable Singlet Carbenes as Organic Superbases</title>

Pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes, a type of mesoionic carbenes, also named cyclic&#8208;bentallenes (CBA), can be more basic than Verkade proazaphosphatrane and even Schwesinger phosphazene P4(tBu). With these results it is demonstrated that carbenes should not be overlooked as neutral purely organic superbases.







Abstract
A simple experimental procedure for scaling carbene Br&#248;nsted basicity is described. The results highlight the strong basicity of pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes, a type of mesoionic carbene, also named cyclic&#8208;bentallenes (CBA). They are more basic (pKaH &gt;42.7 in acetonitrile) than the popular proazaphosphatrane Verkade bases, and even the Schwesinger phosphazene superbase P4(tBu). The basicity of these compounds can readily be tuned, and they are accessible in multigram quantities. These results open new avenues for carbon centered superbases.

         <title>Stabilization of Reactive Nitrene by Silylenes without Using a Reducing Metal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27206-27211, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uncharged univalent and reactive nitrene is captured and stabilized by silylenes. Two nitrene compounds are synthesized and fully characterized. The nitrene character was established by X&#8208;ray analysis, first&#8208;principles electronic structure studies using density functional theory, and natural bond orbital&#8208;based bonding analysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report the stabilization of nitrene reagents as the source of a nitrogen atom to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;incorporated R1LSi&#8208;N&#8592;SiLR2 (1) [L=PhC(NtBu)2; R1=NTMS2, R2=NTMS]. Compound 1 is synthesized by reacting LSi(I)&#8208;SiIL with 3.1&#8197;equivalents of Me3SiN3 at low temperature to afford a triene&#8208;like structural framework. Whereas the reaction of the LSi(I)&#8208;SiIL with 2.1&#8197;equivalents of Me3SiN3 at room temperature produced silaimine 2 with a central four&#8208;membered Si2N2 ring which is accompanied by a silylene LSi and a cleaved silylene fragment. 1 further reacts with AgOTf at room temperature to yield compound 3 which shows coordination of nitrene to silver with the triflate salt. The compounds 1 and 2 were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The quantum mechanical calculations reveal that compounds 1 and 2 have dicoordinated monovalent N atoms having two active lone pairs of electrons. These lone pairs are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions.

         <title>Combined Precursor Engineering and Grain Anchoring Leading to MA&#8208;Free, Phase&#8208;Pure, and Stable &#945;&#8208;Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites for Efficient Solar Cells</title>

Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based additives in precursor solutions suppressed the formation of the undesired &#948; phase during the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskites, and heat&#8208;induced permeation of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium iodide (tBBAI) into inner perovskite grains stabilized the &#945; structure. Solar cells assembled from this material exhibited improved power conversion efficiency and stability.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Formamidinium lead iodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is one of the most promising candidate materials for high&#8208;efficiency and thermally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to its outstanding optoelectrical properties and high thermal stability. However, achieving a stable form of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 where both the composition and the phase are pure is very challenging. Herein, we report on a combined strategy of precursor engineering and grain anchoring to successfully prepare methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free and phase&#8208;pure stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. The incorporation of volatile FA&#8208;based additives in the precursor solutions completely suppresses the formation of non&#8208;perovskite &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 during film crystallization. Grains of the desired &#945;&#8208;phase are anchored together and stabilized when 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium iodide is permeated into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film interior via grain boundaries. This cooperative scheme leads to a significantly increased efficiency close to 21&#8201;% for FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. Moreover, the stabilized PSCs exhibit improved thermal stability and maintained &#8776;90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after storage at 50&#8201;&#176;C for over 1600&#8197;hours.

An unprecedented NiH&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and anti&#8208;selective intramolecular coupling of alkynones to construct O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;containing endocyclic allylic alcohols was developed. The choice of metal precursors plays a key role in tuning the regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity. This study offers a new anti&#8208;hydrocyclization mode for enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyclization of alkynones with unparalleled anti&#8208; and endocyclic selectivities is described. The choice of the precatalysts has significant influence in tuning the regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Using Ni(OTs)2/Phox as a precatalyst and (EtO)2MeSiH as a hydride source, an array of enantioenriched O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;containing heterocyclic tertiary allylic alcohols are obtained in 24&#8211;81&#8201;% yields with 80:20&#8211;99:1 er. Mechanistic investigations and synthetic application are also carried out. This study represents an efficient access to a set of allylic alcohols that are unable to access by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coupling reactions.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanopatterns of Molecular Spoked Wheels with Orthogonal Pillars: The Observation of a Fullerene Haze</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27264-27270, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthetic approach paves the way to nanoscale platform molecules for supramolecular graphite surface patterns at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. While a perylene dye bound at the end of the pillar remains fixed above the molecule center and points into solution, a fullerene ester bound at the same position performs a tumbling motion that translates as a &#8220;haze&#8221; in the otherwise submolecularly resolved images.







Abstract
Molecular spoked wheels with intraannular functionalizable pillars are synthesized in a modular approach. The functionalities at their ends are variable, and a propargyl alcohol, a [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyrate, and a perylene monoimide are investigated. All compounds form two&#8208;dimensional crystals on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. As determined by submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, the pillars adopt equilibrium distances of 6.0&#8197;nm. The fullerene has a residual mobility, limited by the length of the flexible connector unit. The experimental results are supported and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These also show that, in contrast, the more rigidly attached perylene monoimide units remain oriented along the surface normal and maintain a smallest distance of 2&#8197;nm above the graphite substrate. The robust packing concept also holds for cocrystals with molecular hexagons that expand the pillar&#8211;pillar distances by 15&#8201;% and block unspecific intercalation.

         <title>Fluorinated S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine as a Reagent for Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27178-27183, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a biocatalytic approach to the production of fluorinated compounds, halide methyltransferases (HMTs) were found to form fluorinated S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Although too unstable for isolation, fluorinated SAM was accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) to enable the fluoromethylation of small molecules (see scheme).







Abstract
Strategic replacement of protons with fluorine atoms or functional groups with fluorine&#8208;containing fragments has proven a powerful strategy to optimize the activity of therapeutic compounds. For this reason, the synthetic chemistry of organofluorides has been the subject of intense development and innovation for many years. By comparison, the literature on fluorine biocatalysis still makes for a slim chapter. Herein we introduce S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases as a new tool for the production of fluorinated compounds. We demonstrate the ability of halide methyltransferases to form fluorinated SAM (S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;S&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine) from S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) is too unstable for isolation, but is accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific methyltransferases for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation of small molecules.

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids in Nuclear Medicine Imaging: Shedding Light on Nano&#8211;Bio Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) has been advancing in biomedicine over the past decade. Its recent integration with nuclear medicine imaging has broadened our understanding of the bio&#8208;interfacing of FNAs. In this Minireview, we survey and discuss nuclear imaging of FNAs in&#8197;vivo with the aim of highlighting outstanding questions on nano&#8211;bio interactions and potential directions for translation.







Abstract
Framework nucleic acids (FNAs) represent nanoscale oligonucleotide assemblies with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties that are different from their building blocks. Following simple Watson&#8211;Crick base&#8208;pairing rules, arbitrary DNA frameworks with diverse shapes, sizes, and dimensions can be prepared with high reproducibility and stability. The programmable assembly of nucleic acids into FNAs presents a highly controllable model for studies on nano&#8211;bio interactions and allows scrutiny of &#8220;nanostructure&#8208;activity relationships.&#8221; Herein, we present an overview of recent progress with FNAs in the hope of deepening our understanding of nano&#8211;bio interfacing. We summarize the biological profiles and immune responses of various FNAs as functions of their shape, sizes, and surface charges. We then highlight recent efforts to apply FNAs for biomedical applications and discuss the challenges of FNAs for potential clinical translation. We believe that this Minireview can bring up&#8208;to&#8208;date information on FNAs and shed light on how their design may be harnessed for selective biomedical applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient Biobased Synthesis of Acrylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient strategy was developed for the environmentally benign conversion of furfural into polymer building blocks, maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, using photooxygenation, aerobic oxidation, hydrolysis and metathesis. The method offers high yielding steps with excellent selectivity while integrating multiple principles of green chemistry.







Abstract
Petrochemical based polymers, paints and coatings are cornerstones of modern industry but our future sustainable society demands greener processes and renewable feedstock materials. A challenge is to access platform monomers from biomass resources while integrating the principles of green chemistry in their chemical synthesis. We present a synthesis route starting from biomass&#8208;derived furfural towards the commonly used monomers maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, implementing environmentally benign photooxygenation, aerobic oxidation and ethenolysis reactions. Maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, transformed into sodium acrylate, were isolated in yields of 85&#8201;% (2 steps) and 81&#8201;% (4 steps), respectively. With minimal waste and high atom efficiency, this biobased route provides a viable alternative to access key monomers.

Maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, transformed into sodium acrylate, were isolated in yields of 85&#8201;% (2 steps) and 81&#8201;% (4 steps), respectively. With minimal waste and high atom efficiency, this biobased route provides a viable alternative to access key monomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

With N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;ligated Cu SAS as the active site, accompanied by many micro&#8208;nano reactors, synergistically promotes the electrochemical synthesis of methane.







Abstract
The exploitation of highly efficient carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) electrocatalyst for methane (CH4) electrosynthesis has attracted great attention for the intermittent renewable electricity storage but remains challenging. Here, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;ligated copper single atom site (Cu SAS) embedded in metal&#8211;organic framework is reported (2Bn&#8208;Cu@UiO&#8208;67), which can achieve an outstanding Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81&#8201;% for the CO2 reduction to CH4 at &#8722;1.5&#8197;V vs. RHE with a current density of 420&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The CH4 FE of our catalyst remains above 70&#8201;% within a wide potential range and achieves an unprecedented turnover frequency (TOF) of 16.3&#8197;s&#8722;1. The &#963; donation of NHC enriches the surface electron density of Cu SAS and promotes the preferential adsorption of CHO* intermediates. The porosity of the catalyst facilitates the diffusion of CO2 to 2Bn&#8208;Cu, significantly increasing the availability of each catalytic center.

         <title>Designer Outer Membrane Protein Facilitates Uptake of Decoy Molecules into a Cytochrome P450BM3&#8208;Based Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered variant of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) that facilitates the cellular uptake of amino acid derivatives as decoy molecules has been developed. Co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type P450BM3 enabled the Escherichia coli&#8208;based whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst to efficiently oxidise benzene with the assistance of decoy molecules. Moreover, whole&#8208;cell&#8208;catalysed stereoselective hydroxylation was achieved by changing the decoy molecule.







Abstract
We report an OmpF loop deletion mutant, which improves the cellular uptake of external additives into an Escherichia coli whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst. Through co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type P450BM3 in the presence of decoy molecules, the yield of the whole&#8208;cell biotransformation of benzene could be considerably improved. Notably, with the decoy molecule C7AM&#8208;Pip&#8208;Phe the yield duodecupled from 5.7&#8201;% to 70&#8201;%, with 80&#8201;% phenol selectivity. The benzylic hydroxylation of alkyl&#8208; and cycloalkylbenzenes was also examined, and with the aid of decoy molecules, propylbenzene and tetralin were converted to 1&#8208;hydroxylated products with 78&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% (R) ee for propylbenzene and 92&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% (S) ee for tetralin. Our results suggest that both the decoy molecule and substrate traverse the artificial OmpF channel, synergistically boosting whole&#8208;cell bioconversions.

         <title>Entropy Versus Enthalpy Controlled Temperature/Redox Dual&#8208;Triggered Cages for Selective Anion Encapsulation and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cage 1P, which selectively encapsulates BPh4&#8722; over a wide range of temperatures, can be quantitatively oxidized to cage 1PO with more negative enthalpy (&#916;H&#176;) and entropy (&#916;S&#176;) that releases the captured BPh4&#8722; anions at high temperature but strongly encapsulates BPh4&#8722; at low temperature.







Abstract
New C3&#8208;symmetric imidazole ligands were designed with phosphine and phosphine oxide linkers (LP and LPO, respectively) to demonstrate a dual&#8208;triggered dynamic closed coordination cage. Both LP and LPO form discrete Zn4L4&#8208;closed cages (1P and 1PO, respectively) with excellent selectively for BPh4&#8722;, whereas 1P and 1PO encapsulate neither a slightly larger size anion [B(C6H4CH3)4&#8722;] nor smaller size anions (BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, SbF6&#8722;, and OSO2CF3&#8722;). 1PO exhibits more negative enthalpy and entropy changes upon anion encapsulation, thus releasing almost all of the encapsulated anions at high temperature (343&#8197;K) (trigger 1: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1PO
1PO+BPh4&#8722;). In contrast 1P has less negative enthalpy and entropy changes, thus preserving the captured anion over a wide range of temperatures (298&#8197;K to 343&#8197;K). The 1P cage can be quantitatively oxidized to the 1PO cage by a mild oxidant (Ox.=H2O2), and therefore the captured anion can be released by a redox triggering event (trigger 2: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1P+Ox.&#8594;1PO+BPh4&#8722;).

         <title>Reactivities of Interstitial Hydrides in a Cu11 Template: En Route to Bimetallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the nature of M+, the hydrides of the H2Cu11 reactant behave differently. In the cases of M=Cu or Ag, they act as regular 2&#8208;electron ligands yielding [CuH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3]+ (Cu12H2), [AgH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6((C&#8801;CPh)6]+ (AgH2Cu14); in the case of M=Au, they behave as electron donors to form [AuCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(C&#8801;CPh)3Cl] (AuCu11). Details of the study are presented by Jean&#8208;Yves Saillard, Chen&#8208;Wei Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202113266).

         <title>Controlling the Complexity and Interconversion Mechanisms in Self&#8208;assembled [Fe2L3]4+ Helicates and [Fe4L6]8+ Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled coordination cages and metal&#8208;organic frameworks have relied extensively on symmetric ligands in their formation. Here we have prepared a relatively simple system employing an unsymmetric ligand that results in two distinct self&#8208;assembled structures, a [Fe  2  L  3  ]  4+  helicate and a [Fe  4  L  6  ]  8+  cage composed of 10 interconverting diastereomers and their enantiomers. We show that the steric profile of the ligand controls the complexity, thermodynamics and kinetics of interconversion of the system.</dc:description>

         <title>Indomethacin Polymorph &#948; Revealed to be Two Plastically Bendable Crystal Forms by 3D Electron Diffraction: Correcting a 47&#8208;Year&#8208;Old Misunderstanding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indomethacin is a clinically classical non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug that has been marketed since 1965. The third polymorph, Form &#948;, was discovered by both melt and solution crystallization in 1974. &#948;&#8208;indomethacin cannot be cultivated as a large single crystal suitable for X&#8208;ray crystallography and, therefore, its crystal structure has not yet been determined. Here, we report the structure elucidation of &#948;&#8208;indomethacin by 3D electron diffraction and reveal the truth that melt&#8208;crystallized and solution&#8208;crystallized &#948;&#8208;indomethacin are in fact two polymorphs with different crystal structures. We propose to keep the solution&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#948; and name the melt&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#952;. Intriguingly, both structures display plastic flexibility based on a slippage mechanism, making indomethacin the first drug to have two plastic polymorphs. This discovery and correction of a 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding signify that 3D electron diffraction has become a powerful tool for polymorphic structural studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable epothilone&#8208;based microtubule stabilisers allow GFP&#8208;imaging&#8208;compatible, optical control over the microtubule cytoskeleton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical methods to modulate microtubule dynamics have promise for reaching the micron&#8208; and millisecond&#8208;scale resolution needed to decrypt the roles of the cytoskeleton in biology. However, optical microtubule stabilisers are under&#8208;developed. We introduce "STEpos" as GFP&#8208;orthogonal, light&#8208;responsive epothilone&#8208;based microtubule stabilisers. They use a novel styrylthiazole photoswitch in a design to modulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding and steric effects that control epothilone potency. STEpos photocontrol microtubule dynamics and cell division with micron&#8208; and second&#8208;scale spatiotemporal precision. They substantially improve potency, solubility, and ease&#8208;of&#8208;use compared to previous optical microtubule stabilisers, and the structure&#8208;photoswitching&#8208;activity relationship insights in this work will guide future optimisations. The STEpo reagents can contribute greatly to high&#8208;precision research in cytoskeleton biophysics, cargo transport, cell motility, cell division, development, and neuroscience.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;specific Conjugation of a Selenopolypeptide to Alpha&#8208;1&#8208;antitrypsin Enhances Oxidation Resistance and Pharmacological Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human alpha&#8208;1&#8208;antitrypsin (A1AT), a native serine&#8208;protease inhibitor which protects tissue damages from excessive protease activities, is&#160;used as an augmentation therapy to treat A1AT&#8208;deficienct patients. However, A1AT is sensitive to oxidation&#8208;mediated deactivation and has a short circulating half&#8208;life. Currently, there is no method that can effectively protect therapeutic proteins from oxidative damage  in vivo  . Here we developed a novel biocompatible selenopolypeptide and site&#8208;specifically conjugated it with A1AT. The conjugated A1AT fully retained its inhibitory activity on neutrophil elastase, enhanced oxidation resistance, extended the serum half&#8208;life, and afforded long&#8208;lasting protective efficacy in a mouse model of acute lung injury. These results demonstrated that conjugating A1AT with the designed selenopolymer is a viable strategy to improve its pharmacological properties, which could potentially further be applied to a variety of oxidation sensitive biotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lanthanum Ammonium Sulfate Double Salt with a Strong SHG Response and Wide Deep&#8208;UV Transparency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The targeted synthesis of deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, especially those with non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated sulfates, has experienced considerable difficulties due to the need to reconcile the oft&#8208;competing requirements for deep&#8208;UV transparency and strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). We report herein the designed synthesis of the first rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV sulfate La(NH4)(SO4)2 by a double&#8208;salt strategy involving introduction of complementary cations, together with optical studies that reveal a short&#8208;wavelength deep&#8208;UV absorption edge (below 190 nm) and the strongest SHG response among deep&#8208;UV NLO sulfates (2.4 &#215; KDP). Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis suggest that the excellent balance between SHG response and deep&#8208;UV transparency can be attributed to a synergistic interaction of the hetero&#8208;cations La3+ and [NH4]+, which optimize alignment of the [SO4] tetrahedra and highly polarizable [LaO8] polyhedra.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Characterization and Protein Engineering of a Triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Glycosyltransferase Reveal a Conserved Residue Critical for the Regiospecificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering the function of triterpene glucosyltransferases (GTs) is challenging due to the large size of the sugar acceptors. In this work, we identified a multifunctional glycosyltransferase AmGT8 catalyzing triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#180;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation from the medicinal plant&#160;Astragalus membranaceus. To engineer its regiospecificity, a small mutant library was built based on semi&#8208;rational design. Variants A394F, A394D, and T131V were found to catalyze specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O,&#160;and 2&#180;&#8208;O&#160;glycosylation, respectively. The origin of regioselectivity of AmGT8 and its A394F variant was studied by molecular dynamics and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Residue 394 is highly conserved as A/G and is critical for the regiospecificity of the&#160;C&#8208; and&#160;O&#8208;GTs TcCGT1 and GuGT10/14. Finally, astragalosides III and IV were synthesized by mutants A394F, T131V and P192E. This work reports biocatalysts for saponin synthesis and gives new insights into protein engineering of regioselectivity in plant GTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Molten Salt Synthesis of Platinum Alloys Planted in Metal&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Graphene for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fuel cells are considered as a promising alternative to the existing traditional energy systems towards sustainable future. Nevertheless, the synthesis of efficient and robust Pt&#8208;based catalysts remains a challenge for practical applications. In this work, we present a simple and scalable molten&#8208;salt synthesis method for producing a low&#8208;platinum (Pt) nanoalloy implanted in metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;graphene. The as&#8208;prepared low&#8208;Pt alloyed graphene exhibits a high oxygen reduction activity of 1.29 A mgPt&#8208;1 and excellent durability over 30,000 potential cycles. The catalyst nanoarchitecture of graphene encased Pt nanoalloy provides a robust capability against nanoparticle migration and corrosion due to strong metal&#8208;support interaction. Similarly, advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations show that the multiple active sites in platinum alloyed graphene synergistically account for improved oxygen reduction. This work not only provides an efficient and robust low&#8208;Pt catalyst but also a facile design idea and scalable preparation technique for integrated catalysts to achieve more profound applications in fuel cells and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Degradable Vinyl Random Copolymers via Photocontrolled Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Degradable vinyl polymers by radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization are promising solutions to the challenges caused by non&#8208;degradable vinyl plastics. However, achieving even distributions of labile functional groups in the backbone of degradable vinyl polymers remains challenging. Herein, we report a photocatalytic approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP). The rROCCP of macrocyclic allylic sulfones and acrylates or acrylamides mediated by visible light at ambient temperature achieved near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios over the entire range of the feed compositions. Experimental and computational evidence revealed an unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by&#160;in situ generated sulfur dioxide (SO2), which was successfully overcome by reducing the solubility of SO2. This study provides a powerful approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers with comparable material properties to non&#8208;degradable vinyl polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Reliant Dynamic Properties and Elasto&#8208;Plastic to Plastic Crystal (Rotator) Phase Transition in a Metal Oxyacid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although, dynamic crystals are attractive for use in many technologies, molecular level mechanisms of various solid&#8208;state dynamic processes and their interdependence, remain poorly understood. Here, we report a rare example of dynamic crystal (  1  ), involving a heavy transition metal, rhenium, with an initial two face elasticity (within ~ 1 % strain), followed by elasto&#8208;plastic deformation, at r.t. Further, these crystals transform to a rotator (plastic) crystal phase at ~ 105 &#176;C, displaying exceptional malleability. Qualitative and quantitative mechanical tests, X&#8208;ray diffraction,  &#181;  &#8208;Raman and polarized light microscopy experiments reveal that the elasto&#8208;plastic deformation involves both partial molecular rotations and slip, while malleability in rotator phase is facilitated by reorientational motions and increased symmetry (slip planes). Our work, connecting the plastically bendable (1D or 2D) crystals with the rotator phases (3D), is important for designing multi&#8208;functional dynamic crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemistry of Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure&#8208;function relationship of plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) is of great importance for the design of efficient PEEC catalyst, but is rarely investigated at single nanoparticle level for the lack of efficient nanoscale methodology. Herein, we report the utilization of nanoparticle impact electrochemistry to allow single nanoparticle PEEC, where the effect of incident light on the plasmonic Ag/Au nanoparticles for accelerating Co&#8208;MOFNs catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is systematically explored. It is found that the plasmon excited hot carrier injection can lower the reaction activation energy, resulting in a much promoted reaction probability and the integral charge generated from individual collisions. Besides, a plasmonic nanoparticle filtering method is established to effectively distinguish different plasmonic nanoparticles. This work provides a unique view in understanding the intrinsic physicochemical properties for PEEC at the nano&#8208;confined domains.</dc:description>
