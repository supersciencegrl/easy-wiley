         <title>Dual Enzyme&#8208;Responsive Polymer&#8208;Drug Conjugates Induce&#160;Diverse Cells Mutual Transcytosis to Achieve Deep Pancreatic Tumor Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;responsive active transporting nanomedicines have shown promise in overcoming the tumor&#8208;dense extracellular matrix barrier by inducing cancer cells&#8217; intercellular transcytosis to deliver drugs deep into solid tumors. However, nanomedicine only responsive to the cancer cell&#8208;related enzyme is not very effective in pancreatic tumors because successive transcytosis cannot be established among the cancer cells, which are scattered in a large number of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Here are reported dual&#8208;enzyme responsive 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (SN38)&#8208;polymer conjugates capable of inducing transcytosis among cancer cells and CAFs to infiltrate pancreatic tumors efficiently. The conjugates are zwitterionic for long blood circulation. Once in the tumor, the &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) overexpressed on the tumor endothelial and cancer cells, or the fibroblast&#8208;activated protease (FAP) on CAFs, can cleave the &#947;&#8208;glutamylamide or the prolylglycine dipeptide amides, producing primary amines. The cationized conjugate then induces transcytosis among cancer cells and CAFs, establishing successive intercellular transport to infiltrate the tumor. The conjugates' enzyme reactivity and overall hydrophobicity determine their cationization and transcytosis behaviors. The conjugates with high hydrophobicity and fast cationization show potent antitumor activity in pancreatic cancer patient&#8208;derived xenograft and orthotopic tumor models. This study provides an active transportation strategy to overcome the delivery barrier of tumors with rich stroma cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Large N&#8208;Doped Zigzag Hydrocarbon Belts from Calixarenes: Synthesis, Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zigzag hydrocarbon belts and heteroatom&#8208;doped analogs have captivated chemists because of their unique structures, tantalizing properties and potential applications. Despite synthetic breakthroughs, the diversity, especially, the size of belts synthesized by fjord&#8208;stitching approach is limited by resorcin[n]arenes (n = 4, 6). We report herein the synthesis, structure and properties of large belts starting from conventional calix[8]arenes. The synthesis features multiple C&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions of per&#8208;brominated calix[8]arenes with anilines and ammonia, and selective transformation of 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline into quinolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;one segments. The molecules in question adopt a unique zigzag belt structure with nitrogen atoms and functional groups located around both portals, yielding a large octagonal prism cavity. They are able to accommodate fullerene C60 or C70 with high affinity driven by lone&#8208;pair electron/&#960; interactions and steric complementarity between host and guest.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Room Temperature Methanol Synthesis over hcp&#8208;PdMo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has garnered significant interest with respect to the reduction of carbon emissions; however, the high temperatures and pressures typically required diminish the benefits of this approach. In this study, we report a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;PdMo catalyst that exhibits the highest room temperature catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol among reported catalysts, with 100% methanol selectivity and without any signs of deactivation. Structural analyses, which included various in situ and ex situ X&#8208;ray techniques and infrared spectroscopy, have revealed that Mo and Pd serve as the active sites for CO2 adsorption and H2 dissociation, respectively. The CO2 hydrogenation reaction is facilitated at room temperature on the surface of the hcp&#8208;PdMo intermetallic catalyst, where the adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites play important roles in methanol synthesis. Mechanistic studies, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have demonstrated that the reaction proceeds via a reverse water&#8208;gas shift and subsequent CO hydrogenation (R&amp;C) pathway though a Pd&#8208;assisted Mo redox mechanism at room temperature. These findings not only reveal the origin of the reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis, but also open a new direction for the design of highly efficient catalysts that function under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Branching&#8208;Induced Intermolecular Repulsion Effects Drive Stable and Sustainable Flow Batteries on Condensed Nitroxyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) play a critical role in scalable energy storage applications where safety, cost, and lifetime matter most. However, harnessing the organics with redox chemistry is plagued by major molecular engineering principles in reversible processes and transformations. Herein, break from the conventional linear substituent structures, we report a chain&#8208;branched dual&#8208;ammonium nitroxyl radicals derivative as a stable and flowable catholyte for AORFBs. Paired with a viologen anolyte, the AORFBs with condensed electrolytes deliver a high capacity retention rate of 99.992%/cycle (99.85%/day) and a peak power density of 140.3 mW cm&#8208;2. In&#8208;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible characterization and theoretical simulation elucidate that the branched dual&#8208;ammonium structure accelerates ~40% of the binding energy barrier, thereby enhancing intermolecular electrostatic repulsion. This effect effectively inhibits side reactions triggered by nucleophilic attacks, particularly in condensed nitroxyl radicals, maintaining the structural stability of both radical and oxoammonium states as well as their reversible transformations. Our redox organic formulation offers a direction towards stable and high&#8208;energy density AORFBs that seamlessly integrate eco&#8208;friendliness, durability, and sustainability.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered&#8208;Spinel Heterogeneous Structure and Oxygen Vacancies Enable Superior Electrochemical Performance for Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMOs) materials are considered to be the next&#8208;generation cathode for high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion/metal batteries owing to their superior specific capacity, high operation voltage and low cost. However, the commercial application of LRMOs is constrained by the surface structure degradation and lattice oxygen release, resulting in low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and rapid voltage and capacity decay. Herein, we propose a facile sorbic acid&#8208;assisted surface treatment strategy to construct homogeneous multifunctional interface layers composed of layered&#8208;spinel heterogeneous structure and oxygen vacancies on the surface of LRMOs, which enhance the structure stability and improve the activity and reversibility of the anionic oxygen redox reactions. The multifunctional interfacial layers effectively suppress irreversible oxygen release and alleviate unfavorable layered&#8208;spinel phase transformation. As a consequence, the treated LRMOs cathode displays improved ICE of 88.3%, high capacity retention rate (87.9% at 1 C after 150 cycles) and low voltage decay ratio (1.26 mV per cycle). These findings provide a valuable new idea to improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance of LRMOs through multi&#8208;strategy synergistic interface engineering techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Au6Cu2 Clusters with High Electron Affinity and Oxygen&#8208;Mimetic Properties for Hypoxic Tumor Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Au6Cu2(C2C6H4X)6(PPh2C6H4PPh2)3]2+ (X&#160;=&#160;NO2, denoted as NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2; X&#160;=&#160;H, denoted as H&#8208;Au6Cu2) clusters were synthesized for radiosensitizing studies. The NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2 nanoparticles demonstrated significantly enhanced radiosensitization compared to the H&#8208;Au6Cu2 nanoparticles, attributed to their higher electron affinity, which increases hypoxic cytotoxicity and mimics the oxygen effect by reacting with DNA free radicals. 








Abstract
Hypoxia&#8208;induced radioresistance primarily contributes to the failure of radiotherapy because it hinders the effective fixation of DNA damage. Despite the considerable antitumor activity of chemical molecules such as electron&#8208;affinic nitroimidazoles affirmed by clinical studies, their dose&#8208;dependent side effects and low radiotherapy efficacy have become major drawbacks. In this study, we synthesized nitrobenzene&#8208;functionalized Au6Cu2 (NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2) clusters, integrating metal clusters with chemical radiosensitizers. The ligand 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene's hypoxia&#8208;selective toxicity arises from reductase&#8208;mediated radical generation under hypoxia, depleting GSH and compromising radiotherapy ROS clearance. Our findings indicate that the electron affinity of interfacial ligands has a significant effect on the electron affinity and hypoxic cytotoxicity of metal clusters. Experimental results demonstrated that NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2 clusters exhibit a high sensitization enhancement ratio by leveraging the properties of gold clusters to augment radiotherapy and the oxygen&#8208;mimetic property of chemical molecules to impair DNA repair pathways. This research introduces a novel strategy for developing highly efficient metal cluster&#8208;based hypoxic radiosensitizers.

The NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles demonstrated significantly enhanced radiosensitization compared to the H-Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles, attributed to their higher electron affinity, which increases hypoxic cytotoxicity and mimics the oxygen effect by reacting with DNA free radicals. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia-induced radioresistance primarily contributes to the failure of radiotherapy because it hinders the effective fixation of DNA damage. Despite the considerable antitumor activity of chemical molecules such as electron-affinic nitroimidazoles affirmed by clinical studies, their dose-dependent side effects and low radiotherapy efficacy have become major drawbacks. In this study, we synthesized nitrobenzene-functionalized Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) clusters, integrating metal clusters with chemical radiosensitizers. The ligand 4-nitrophenylacetylene's hypoxia-selective toxicity arises from reductase-mediated radical generation under hypoxia, depleting GSH and compromising radiotherapy ROS clearance. Our findings indicate that the electron affinity of interfacial ligands has a significant effect on the electron affinity and hypoxic cytotoxicity of metal clusters. Experimental results demonstrated that NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clusters exhibit a high sensitization enhancement ratio by leveraging the properties of gold clusters to augment radiotherapy and the oxygen-mimetic property of chemical molecules to impair DNA repair pathways. This research introduces a novel strategy for developing highly efficient metal cluster-based hypoxic radiosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereocontrol in Conformationally Stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building in our expertize in the synthesis of trans&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans via organocatalyzed domino Michael/O&#8208;cyclization between &#946;&#8208;naphthols and nitroalkenes, we developed an efficient strategy to access a new family of atropisomers bearing a conformationally stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond and two stereogenic centers through simple and highly diastereoselective alkylation of dihydrofurans with structurally diverse electrophiles. This crucial step places the nitro group in a relative cis&#8208;configuration with respect to the aromatic moiety, effectively increasing the barrier to diastereomerization and stabilizing the molecular conformation.








Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step sequence for the enantioselective construction of a rare family of stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) atropisomers featuring two additional stereogenic centers. The process begins with an organocatalyzed dihydrobenzofurannulation that establishes and controls the stereochemistry of two carbon centers, followed by a highly diastereoselective functionalization that significantly enhances the barrier to diastereomerization of the C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond, effectively locking and stabilizing its configuration.

         <title>Phosphinoisocyanide/Alkyne Cycloaddition: Generation of Azaphospholylidene (NPHC) Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare examples of nitrogen phosphorus heterocyclic carbene (NPHC) complexes of group 6 and 7 metals arise from a facile [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of phosphinoisocyanides (LnM&#8208;CNPR2) with activated alkynes. The NPHC ligands are shown to be comparatively &#960;&#8208;acidic and the group 6 examples undergo facile transfer of the intact carbene to gold(I) centres.








Abstract
Phosphinoisocyanide complexes undergo facile [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions with activated alkynes to afford the first azaphospholylidene complexes which are rare examples of N,P&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NPHC). In addition to quantifying the donor/acceptor properties of this new class of carbene, their transmetalation reactions are also described.

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence Based on Center&#8208;Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a center&#8208;chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) design to enhance circularly polarized luminescence in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). By optimizing Lewis acid/base interactions, the approach overcomes the trade&#8208;off between polarization and efficiency, achieving record&#8208;high CPL performance, narrow emission, and high quantum efficiency for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) presents a significant challenge, particularly for center&#8208;chiral systems, due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between high luminescence efficiency and large luminescence dissymmetry factors. In this work, we introduce a center&#8208;chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) design to overcome this limitation. By integrating a stereogenic carbon center into a fluorene scaffold, we create a unique interaction between a boron&#8208;based multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) Lewis acid and an arylamine Lewis base. This sterically hindered design prevents strong charge transfer while optimizing the alignment between electric and magnetic dipole moments for amplified CPL signals. Our OLEDs achieve impressive electroluminescence (EL) dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) of 6.64&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 30.4%, and sub&#8208;30&#160;nm spectral linewidths. These improvements yield a Figure of Merit (FoM&#160;=&#160;EQE &#215; |gEL|) of 1.91&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, the highest reported for center&#8208;chiral CPL devices. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the center&#8208;chiral FLP design in overcoming the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between polarization and efficiency in CPL devices.

         <title>Co&#8208;Regulation of Interface and Bulk for Enhanced Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes in Stable and Practical Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable zinc metal batteries offer promise for energy storage due to high capacity, low cost, and safety but face challenges like dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and cathode degradation. We introduce an interfacial&#8208;enhanced localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte using 1,4&#8208;dioxane and 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium (emim+), achieving anion&#8208;rich, water&#8208;depleted electric double layer at both anode and cathode interfaces that suppress side reactions, promote uniform zinc deposition, and enhance cathode stability under practical conditions.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc metal batteries (RZMBs) are promising for energy storage due to their high capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their commercialization is hindered by challenges including dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and cathode degradation, particularly under low current densities and negative/positive (N/P) capacity ratios. Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes offer potential solutions, but their reliance on high salt concentrations to replicate solvation structures of high&#8208;concentration electrolytes limits their practicality, due to diluent's inherent inertness that limits its role in interfacial chemistry. Here, we present a co&#8208;regulation strategy that integrates bulk and interfacial properties to develop an interfacial&#8208;enhanced localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (ILHCE). By incorporating non&#8208;coordinating 1,4&#8208;dioxane diluent and 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium (emim+) cations into dilute aqueous electrolytes, dioxane molecules are pulled into electric double layer (EDL) through the interaction between emim+ and dioxane, achieving a pronounced dilution effect from bulk electrolyte to the EDL. This generates an anion&#8208;rich and water&#8208;depleted EDL at both anode and cathode interfaces, enhancing Zn2+ transport dynamics, ensuring cathode stability and deriving a robust anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Full batteries using Mn0.5V6O13 cathodes with a low N/P ratio of 1.77 demonstrate 80% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 0.2&#160;A g&#8722;1, highlighting ILHCE as a transformative electrolyte design toward real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrodimerization of Acetylene to 1,3&#8208;Butadiene Over Neighboring Cu Dual Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical acetylene hydrodimerization mechanisms are deciphered by correlating the nuclearity of Cu site in Cu&#8208;MOFs with catalytic performance. The neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF orchestrate three critical steps: acetylene adsorption, C&#8211;C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates, and 1,3&#8208;butadiene desorption, which contribute to the superior electrocatalytic selectivity of 1,3&#8208;butadiene.








Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic hydrodimerization of acetylene to 1,3&#8208;butadiene is a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive naphtha steam cracking route, but remains a grand challenge due to competitive acetylene semihydrogenation and oligomerization. Herein, we profoundly investigate the underpinning structure&#8211;performance correlations between diverse nuclear number of Cu sites and acetylene hydrodimerization over benchmark Cu&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts. The operando electrochemical Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies and theoretical simulations together reveal that single Cu site and double Cu sites are favorable for acetylene semihydrogenation and hydrodimerization, respectively. The as&#8208;designed neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF enable the adsorption of acetylene, subsequent C&#8211;C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates into 1,3&#8208;butadiene as well as the desorption of 1,3&#8208;butadiene. As a result, the trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF affords a 1,3&#8208;butadiene selectivity of 91% and a high 1,3&#8208;butadiene production rate of 64&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is about 2&#8208;fold and 20&#8208;fold higher than Cu2&#8208;MOF and Cu1&#8208;MOF. This work not only provides profound insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism of acetylene hydrodimerization but also guides the rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>Completing the Biosynthesis of the Clinically Important Diterpenoid Andrographolide in Andrographis Paniculata</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome P450s involved in andrographolide C&#8208;3, C&#8208;14, and C&#8208;19 hydroxylation, as well as lactone ring formation, were discovered by bioinformatic analysis along with N. benthamiana transient expression and yeast microsomal assays. Co&#8208;expression of ApCYP71D587, ApCYP71BE50, ApCYP706U5, and ApCYP72F1 with ent&#8208;copalol biosynthetic genes enabled production of andrographolide in N. benthamiana.








Abstract
Andrographolide is a prominent labdane diterpenoid extracted from Andrographis paniculata with exceptional anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Commercial production of andrographolide relies exclusively on extraction from plant resources. Although the scaffold of andrographolide ent&#8208;copalol has previously been biosynthesized, further oxidative modifications remain elusive. In this study, by taking an integrated analysis of transcriptomes and metabolomes, we were able to identify four cytochrome P450 enzymes constituting the minimal set of andrographolide biosynthetic genes. Specifically, ApCYP71D587 catalyzes the conversion of ent&#8208;copalol to 19&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;ent&#8208;copalol. Subsequently, ApCYP71BE50 mediates the formation of the lactone ring, ultimately yielding andrograpanin. Then ApCYP706U5 accomplishes the third step by mediating the C&#8208;3 hydroxylation reaction, thereby allowing the formation of 14&#8208;deoxyandrographolide. Ultimately, ApCYP72F1 completes the biosynthetic generation of andrographolide with C&#8208;14 hydroxylation of the lactone and rearrangement of the olefin bond. In addition, co&#8208;expression of the minimal gene set in N. benthamiana engineered to produce ent&#8208;copalol feasibly produces andrographolide, thus establishing an innovative metabolic engineering strategy to produce this medicine of historical importance, circumventing the need for plant extraction.

         <title>Air&#8208;Level Oxygen Enables 100% Selectivity in Urea Synthesis via Photocatalytic C&#9472;N Coupling of CO and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic coupling reaction of carbon monoxide and ammonia pays a new pathway for urea synthesis under mild conditions. Herein, we proposed a universal O2&#8208;mediated urea generation pathway via the O2&#8226;&#8211; radicals act as the dominant active species to drive the mild NH3 oxidation to &#8226;NH2 radicals, which then coupled with CO as the crucial step for urea production.








Abstract
The clean&#8208;energy&#8208;driven synthesis of urea from carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules has garnered significant interest but remained great challenges to achieve with high selectivity. Herein, we present a photocatalytic pathway for the selective urea synthesis through the oxidative coupling between CO and NH3. The key factor in this process is the atmospheric O2 level, which plays a crucial role in controlling both the urea production rate and its selectivity. Using oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 under an air&#8208;level (20%) O2 atmosphere, we achieved a urea generation rate of 54.31&#160;mg gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity. This rate is 38.52 times higher than under oxygen&#8208;free conditions, while further increasing the O2 level significantly reduces selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the process begins with the oxidation of NH3 to &#8226;NH2 through oxidative radicals generated on TiO2, especially the oxygen&#8208;derived O2&#8226;&#8211;. This &#8226;NH2 radicals then couple with CO to form urea. The concentration of radicals is controlled by the O2 level, with the optimal concentration under air&#8208;level O2 enabling efficient NH3 oxidation to &#8226;NH2 while preventing over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Dynamic Exchange Reactions as Self&#8208;Blowing Agents for the Production of Reprocessable Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative approach to designing self&#8208;blown foams by leveraging the irreversible and self&#8208;catalyzed transesterification of alkylester which release alcohol gas as blowing agents. The morphology and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of these foams can be precisely tailored by modifying the precursor structure. Remarkably, they can be reprocessed as rigid resins through reversible self&#8208;catalyzed transesterification reactions.








Abstract
Thermosetting foams are crucial in the polymer industry due to their unique lightweight and durable properties. Recent developments in sustainable chemistry intend to align foam lifecycles toward circular economy principles and reduce their environmental impact. In this study, this issue is addressed thanks to an innovative and straightforward approach, enabling the manufacture of single&#8208;component self&#8208;blowing vitrimer foam. The self&#8208;blowing mechanism originates from the in situ formation and release of the blowing agent via the polycondensation of an alkylester. This alkylester, composed of a benzoxazine matrix terminated with a &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine, undergoes in a cascade mechanism ring opening polymerization (ROP) and irreversible transesterification exchange, which in turn generates an alcohol gas. The cascade polymerization and alcohol release were optimized and fine&#8208;tuned to develop various foams that have an open&#8208;cell morphology, volume expansion of 223%&#8211;853%, porosity of 67%&#8211;86%, and compression modulus in the range of 3&#8211;38&#160;MPa. The polymerization process results in a dual crosslinked poly(benzoxazine&#8208;co&#8208;ester) network composed of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine moieties, alkyl, and &#946;&#8208;aminoester bonds, enabling reversible transesterification dynamic exchanges and mechanical reprocessability, achieving a foam&#8208;to&#8208;resin reprocessing.

         <title>Photocatalytic Boron Insertion into Thiaarenes via Boryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the editing of nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles. However, the single&#8208;atom editing of sulfur&#8208;containing heteroarenes remains a formidable challenge. Now, a photocatalytic strategy enables the insertion of a boron atom into a diverse range of thiaarenes through an unprecedented mechanism under mild conditions. 








Abstract
Skeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles represents a straightforward approach to rapidly expand the accessible chemical space. While notable progress has been made on the direct modification of various nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;heterocycles, editing of prevalent sulfur&#8208;containing heteroarenes, especially for single&#8208;atom insertion, remains exceedingly rare. This disparity is primarily attributed to the sulfur atom's inherent nucleophilicity and high susceptibility to oxidation. Here we present a conceptually distinct photocatalytic strategy that enables the insertion of a boron atom into a diverse range of thiaarenes, furnishing previously inaccessible cyclic thioborane scaffolds and synthetically valuable alkyl boronates in an efficient manner. Furthermore, mechanistic studies have revealed that the boron insertion step proceeds through an unprecedented mechanism.

         <title>Crystallization of L&#8208;Cysteine in Heavy Water Induces Intrinsic Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization of L&#8208;Cysteine in D2O${\rm D}_2{\rm O}$ generates a remarkably different structure compared to H2O${\rm H}_2{\rm O}$. The crystals formed in D2O${\rm D}_2{\rm O}$ display enhanced intrinsic fluorescence, and using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art excited state simulations, we determine the molecular origins of this luminescence and propose design principles for new intrinsic fluorophores.








Abstract
Developing noninvasive techniques that can probe how solvents modulate the nucleation pathways of bioorganic molecules in solution remains an active and open area of research. Herein, we investigate the crystallization of the amino acid L&#8208;Cysteine and show that both the structure of the crystal and its intrinsic fluorescence can be drastically altered by the solvent. Crystals formed in heavy water exhibit markedly different intermolecular packing as well as strikingly different monomer conformations compared to those in light water. Remarkably, these differences in the supramolecular packing result in significantly elevated intrinsic fluorescence in the crystal that is formed in heavy water. Using a combination of experimental techniques and advanced electronic structure approaches, we elucidate the molecular interactions within the crystals that govern both the electronic origins and the intensity of their emission. These findings demonstrate how tuning the solvent by changing its isotope leads to the emergence of design principles for new intrinsic fluorophores that could serve as novel sensing probes for biomedical applications.

         <title>Stable Diradical&#8208;Derived Conjugated Radical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel conjugated radical polymers (RPs) incorporating successive diradical monomers were prepared via a scarcely&#8208;used direct co&#8208;polymerization method. The resulting RPs exhibited attractive room&#8208;temperature quantum coherence properties, as well as well&#8208;balanced ambipolar semiconducting performances.








Abstract
Conjugated radical polymers (RPs) with polyradical structures in an &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymeric backbone have the potential to serve as both model molecules for spin&#8208;correlated condensed matters and as materials for optoelectronics and spin&#8208;based quantum applications. However, preparing RPs of this type with high stability and spin&#8208;delocalized nature presents a significant challenge. We report herein two ambient&#8208;stable conjugated RPs (RPH and RPC), synthetically obtained by an unprecedented straightforward copolymerization of two brominated diradical monomers (diradical characters up to 0.88) with bis&#8208;stannylated DPP units. Compared to diradical monomers with a singlet open&#8208;shell ground state, the diradical&#8208;derived RPs gave rise to favorable spin&#8208;delocalization of conjugated polyradicals over macromolecular chain with ground states of S&#160;=&#160;1/2, accompanied by featured electronic properties including intense near&#8208;infrared absorptions beyond 1000&#160;nm, multi&#8208;stage amphoteric redox characteristics, and intriguing &#960;&#8208;paramagnetism in solution and solid states. Impressively, thin&#8208;film state RPH exhibited superior ambipolar carrier&#8208;transporting properties with well&#8208;balanced hole/electron mobility of up to 0.41/0.38&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 as well as attractive room&#8208;temperature quantum coherence times (T1&#160;=&#160;1.88&#160;&#181;s, T2&#160;=&#160;218&#160;ns), reflecting practical significance for quantum information manipulations. This study introduces a facile approach for constructing stable conjugated RPs, along with their integrated electronic and spin properties.

         <title>Asymmetric Manganese Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent organic framework with asymmetric imine N and pyridine N coordination alters the charge distribution of manganese atoms and accelerates the electron/proton&#8208;oriented transfer, thus improving the catalytic efficiency for the nitrate reduction reaction.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) holds tremendous potential for remediating NO3&#8722; pollution while enabling clean ammonia (NH3) production. However, most catalysts achieve high conversion efficiency relying on high NO3&#8722; concentrations. How to catalyze the NO3&#8722;RR with a low concentration of NO3&#8722; is still a challenge due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein,&#160;we constructed a novel asymmetric isolated Mn atom based on N&#8208;coordination covalent organic framework (COF) (ImPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Mn), for efficient NO3&#8722;RR at a low NO3&#8722; concentration of 2&#160;mg mL&#8722;1. This bidentate&#8208;coordinated COF featured a robust and chemically stable framework, while the synergistic interaction between asymmetric imine N and pyridine N modified the charge distribution of Mn atoms to optimize catalytic efficiency. ImPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Mn demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance, with 95.64% NH3 selectivity and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 1927&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1, exceeding the corresponding parameters of symmetric Mn sites by factors of 1.27 and 1.41, respectively. In situ ATR&#8208;FTIR measurements and theoretical calculations revealed that the asymmetric isolated Mn facilitated a reduction in the energy barrier for *NO&#8208;to&#8208;*NOH conversion, and thus contributed to higher activity and selectivity.

         <title>Epitaxially Grown Lattice&#8208;Coherent Surface Enabling Superior Mechanical Integrity for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by the interdiffusion behaviors between transition metal elements, we developed a high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 cathode with the durable Co&#8208;containing Li&#8208;rich phase surface. The formed Li&#8208;rich phase was lattice&#8208;coherent with LiCoO2 lattice through epitaxial growth, eventually resulting in a superior mechanical integrity under high voltages. Accordingly, the designed LiCoO2 cathode can achieve an excellent cycling stability at 4.6&#160;V and even 4.7 V.








Abstract
The growing demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode is pushing LiCoO2 towards 4.6&#160;V operation. However, the structural and interfacial instability of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 is exacerbated when the charging cut&#8208;off voltage exceeds 4.55&#160;V, resulting in severe mechanical failure and subsequent dramatic capacity decay. Herein, through thermally driven element interdiffusion, a highly durable Co&#8208;containing Li&#8208;rich phase with the lattice coherence has been epitaxially grown along LiCoO2 surface, which enhances the intrinsic mechanical integrity of high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2. Through establishing the lattice&#8208;coherent Li&#8208;rich surface, adverse side reactions, irreversible phase transition and lattice oxygen loss are significantly inhibited in high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2, thereby alleviating cracks formation and maintaining the structural integrity. The presence of the Li&#8208;rich phase endows LiCoO2 with the additional capacity and the excellent cycling stability at 4.6&#160;V and even at 4.7&#160;V.

     alt="Epitaxially Grown Lattice-Coherent Surface Enabling Superior Mechanical Integrity for High-Voltage LiCoO2 Cathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabled by the interdiffusion behaviors between transition metal elements, we developed a high-voltage LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode with the durable Co-containing Li-rich phase surface. The formed Li-rich phase was lattice-coherent with LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lattice through epitaxial growth, eventually resulting in a superior mechanical integrity under high voltages. Accordingly, the designed LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode can achieve an excellent cycling stability at 4.6&#160;V and even 4.7 V.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing demand for high-energy-density cathode is pushing LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; towards 4.6&#160;V operation. However, the structural and interfacial instability of high-voltage LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is exacerbated when the charging cut-off voltage exceeds 4.55&#160;V, resulting in severe mechanical failure and subsequent dramatic capacity decay. Herein, through thermally driven element interdiffusion, a highly durable Co-containing Li-rich phase with the lattice coherence has been epitaxially grown along LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface, which enhances the intrinsic mechanical integrity of high-voltage LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Through establishing the lattice-coherent Li-rich surface, adverse side reactions, irreversible phase transition and lattice oxygen loss are significantly inhibited in high-voltage LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby alleviating cracks formation and maintaining the structural integrity. The presence of the Li-rich phase endows LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the additional capacity and the excellent cycling stability at 4.6&#160;V and even at 4.7&#160;V. This work taps into a new avenue of surface engineering on high-voltage LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Noncovalent Synthesis of Topological Heterostructures Using a Site&#8208;Selective Electrostatic Co&#8208;Assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly (SSECA) strategy was developed to fabricate a variety of topological heterostructures (THSs) with unprecedented architectures from two&#8208;component systems of organometallic complexes and block copolymers. The THSs are composed of rigid parts of closely stacked organometallic complexes and flexible segments formed from electrostatic co&#8208;assembly of BCPs and the complexes originally in the SPs. 








Abstract
Heterostructured nanomaterials composed of heterogeneous zones with dramatically different chemical and/or physical properties have attracted significant attention. However, achieving controllable synthesis of heterostructures integrated with segments of different stiffness and morphologies has been highly challenging, limiting their applications. Herein, a site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly strategy was developed to rationally fabricate topological heterostructures (THSs) containing rigid and flexible segments with different chemical compositions and morphologies. Cationic organometallic complexes have been employed to prepare 1D crystalline supramolecular polymers (SPs), followed by electrostatic co&#8208;assembly with oppositely charged block copolymers (BCPs) of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(acrylic acid). It has been found that the BCPs could interact and co&#8208;assemble with the complexes in SPs in situ at some specific sites bearing positively charged groups to form nanofiber&#8208;like moieties. The co&#8208;assembled nanofibers are connected to the intact parts of SPs, resulting in THSs composed of nanofibers and intact parts of SPs. The position of the defect sites on SPs and the dimension of SPs could be finely regulated by performing thermal annealing and/or sonication treatments, further enriching the architectures of the co&#8208;assembled THSs. This study unveils new topologies that exhibit enhanced higher&#8208;order structural complexity in the realm of supramolecular nanostructures, enabling the exploration of their properties and applications.

         <title>Equalized Dual Emissions from Copper Complexes via Multichannel Balanced Intersystem Crossing: Toward 100% Quantum Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual emissions containing equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence are achieved by a copper iodide complex QtBCzTTPPCuI, which exhibits &#8764;100% photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high twofold increased external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% among pure&#8208;yellow spin&#8208;coated organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, owing to the contributions of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer excited states to intersystem crossing.








Abstract
Luminescent materials have important applications in biology, medicine, catalysis, energy, information technology, and so on. However, to suppress quenching and improve efficiencies, how to balance singlet and triplet radiations for efficient dual emission composed of equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report that based on a rigid skeleton of triphosphine CuI complex, modification with carbazole donors results in high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer states, which provide additional channels for accurately optimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet ratios. We achieve equalized dual emissions containing 53% TADF and 47% phosphorescence, &#8764;100% photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% for pure&#8208;yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Photophysical and exciton kinetics analyses indicate the incorporation of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered triplet states into dual&#8208;emissive electroluminescence is based on energy&#8208;level matching with the first triplet states of host matrixes.

         <title>Surface Work Function&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Entropy Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation for Highly Stable Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel high&#8208;entropy solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with robust mechanical properties and fast K+ ion transport is constructed by driving the in situ conversion of the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 interfacial layer with a low work function on a porous scaffold, enabling dendrite&#8208;free potassium metal anodes. The resulting potassium metal anode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and full&#8208;cell performance, highlighting the critical role of interface design in high&#8208;efficiency potassium metal batteries.








Abstract
The failure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is a key issue limiting the practical application of potassium metal batteries. Herein, a novel high&#8208;entropy SEI layer rich in inorganic components is designed and constructed via in situ electrochemical conversion of the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 interfacial layer on a porous scaffold. Theoretical studies and experimental techniques reveal that the Sn3O4/Sn2S3 heterostructure, with its low work function and weak Sn&#9472;O/S bond, significantly enhances reactivity with the electrolyte, thereby facilitating the in situ formation of the high&#8208;entropy SEI layer. The in situ generated high&#8208;entropy SEI exhibits low surface roughness, low surface potential, fast potassium ion transport characteristics, and excellent mechanical properties (Young's modulus of 20.08&#160;GPa). Leveraging these advantageous properties of the high&#8208;entropy SEI, the resulting potassium metal anode achieves an excellent rate performance up to 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells and demonstrates outstanding cycling stability for 2500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. When paired with a perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode, the potassium metal full battery retains 81.6% of its capacity over 1650 cycles at 10 C. This work underscores a straightforward and effective approach for the establishment of a stable interphase on metallic potassium anodes.

         <title>Supramolecularly Confined Catalysis in Polyphthalocyanine&#8208;Crown&#8208;Ether Frameworks Boosts Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report flexible, two&#8208;dimensional polyphthalocyanine&#8208;crown&#8208;ether frameworks coating on carbon nanotubes, which not only serve as supramolecularly confined catalysts in lithium&#8211;sulfur chemistry but also suppress the growth of lithium dendrites. This newly designed catalysts achieve the long&#8208;term cycling operation of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with a tiny capacity decay rate of 0.711&#8240; per cycle. Our design strategy can be potentially applied to a wider spectrum of electrochemical catalysis.








Abstract
Metal phthalocyanines are considered as potent catalysts in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) chemistry. However, their adsorption capability is deficient to inhibit polysulfides from shuttling, which in turn retards the S&#8208;redox reaction in the cathode. Here we report flexible, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polyphthalocyanine&#8208;crown&#8208;ether (PPc&#8208;CE) frameworks that provide a supramolecularly confined space created with the single&#8208;atom catalytic nickel phthalocyanine nodes and crown&#8208;ether linkers as Li host. Electrochemical and theoretical analyses reveal that a cooperative redox catalysis with the enhanced lithiophilicity of PPc&#8208;CE&#8208;coated carbon nanotubes (PPc&#8208;CE/CNTs) boosts Li&#8211;S redox kinetics and, meanwhile, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites for the long term. A Li||S cell employing PPc&#8208;CE/CNT catalysts delivers a high discharge capacity of 1,363 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C and still retains a specific capacity of &#8764;700 mAh g&#8722;1 over 500 cycles at 1C. Our work provides insights into the molecular design of redox catalysts for Li&#8211;S batteries based on 2D polymers.

         <title>Employment of l&#8208;Citrulline as an Effective Molecular Bridge for Regulating the Buried Interface of Perovskite Solar Cells to Achieve High Efficiency and Good Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;Citrulline (CIT), with amino acid end groups (&#9472;COOH, &#9472;NH2) and a urea end group (&#9472;NH&#9472;CO&#9472;NH2), functions as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The optimized PSC device (0.07065 cm2) achieved an impressive champion PCE of 25.95%. The solar module with an active area of 23.26 cm2 achieved a PCE of 22.70%, which is one of the highest values reported recently using the slot&#8208;die coating method. The strategy offers valuable insights to advance the industrialization of large&#8208;area devices.








Abstract
Suppressing the defects from SnO2 and perovskite interface is essential for the fabrication of large&#8208;area n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the needed lifetime and efficiency for commercialization. Here, we report the employment of l&#8208;citrulline (CIT), which has amino acid (&#9472;COOH, &#9472;NH2) and urea (&#9472;NH&#9472;CO&#9472;NH2) groups, during SnO2 colloidal dispersion to function as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The amino acid group can effectively coordinate with Sn4+ to passivate the oxygen vacancy defects of SnO2, and the urea group can interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ and I&#8722;. These interactions not only improve the electron mobility of SnO2 but also facilitate the formation of larger grain&#8208;size perovskite film. In addition, they can also inhibit the generation of excess PbI2 and the nonphotoactive &#948; phase to result in suppressed trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the incorporation of CIT helps achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95% (0.07065 cm2) in PSC with improved shelf life/light soaking stability. When combined with an antisolvent&#8208;free slot&#8208;die coating technique in air, the solar modules (23.26 cm2) could achieve a PCE of 22.70%, which is among the highest PCE reported so far.

         <title>Aptamer as a Molecular Tethering Agent Induces PrPC Aggregation and Degradation to Inhibit Melanoma Proliferation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a molecular tethering agent, TTe&#8208;TTe, that binds to the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. TTe&#8208;TTe suppresses malignant melanoma proliferation by triggering PrPC to aggregate on the cell membrane surface, followed by its degradation. This versatile platform technology opens up new avenues for targeted protein degradation in a wide range of therapeutic applications, potentially advancing the field of drug discovery.








Abstract
Melanoma, a malignant tumor originating from melanocytes, is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. Previous studies have revealed that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is frequently overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to tumor progression. This study presents the first proof of concept evidence that nucleic acid aptamers can be used to construct a molecular tethering agent that regulates PrPC protein levels by inducing membrane&#8208;bound PrPC aggregation for antimelanoma therapy. Using a screening strategy combining cell&#8208;SELEX and cell&#8208;internalization SELEX, we obtained ssDNA aptamer, TT&#8208;1e, specifically binding to melanoma cells and tissues. We identified that the binding site of TT&#8208;1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. Based on the binding characteristics of TT&#8208;1e, we engineered an aptamer&#8208;based molecular tethering agent TTe&#8208;TTe. We found that TTe&#8208;TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrPC, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe&#8208;TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Post&#8208;CO Intermediates to Decode C&#9472;C Coupling Pathways in CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS) was used to observe the in situ CO2 electroreduction process by designing copper electrodes with unique structures. This dynamic observation allowed for the capture of the C&#9472;C coupling process, where CH2 asymmetrically couples with CO to form CH2CO. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) has emerged as a promising strategy for sustainable energy conversion and carbon utilization. Despite intensive research efforts, the understanding of intermediates and pathways leading from CO2RR to multicarbon (C2+) chemicals remains incomplete. The challenge is to gain insight into the activation of adsorbed CO and the subsequent pathways. Here, we design a specially tailored Cu nanowire array facing a hydrophobic interface as an electrode to highly enhance Raman signals in the in situ environment, allowing sensitive observation of the sequential change of various elusive intermediates during CO2RR, such as CO, CH2, CO coexisting with CH2, CH2CO, and CH3. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the C&#9472;C coupling during CO2RR originates from an asymmetric coupling between CH2 and CO to form CH2CO, identified as the rate&#8208;determining step in the formation of C2+ products. These findings deepen the understanding of the C&#9472;C coupling processes, which are crucial for advancing catalyst development in electrochemical CO2 upgrading.

         <title>Fluorination&#8208;Assisted Interfacial Dipole for CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with Over 22% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination&#8208;assisted interfacial dipole engineering is conducted for inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs, which could not only form more robust interfacial contact but also beneficial dipole alignment, leading to effective passivation and prominent energy level adjustment with additional charge transport channels, thus substantially suppressing interfacial energy losses. Consequently, the PSCs show an efficiency of up to 22.05% with superior device stability.








Abstract
Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite attracts widespread attention in photovoltaic applications due to its superior thermal stability and optoelectronic properties. However, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still suffer from severe energy losses due to interface nonradiative recombination and undesirable charge carrier transfer, predominantly limiting their photovoltaic performance. Herein, an interfacial dipole engineering is introduced for CsPbI3 PSCs, in which azetidinium chloride (Az) and its fluorinated derivative 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidinium chloride (DFAz) are employed to manipulate the interface properties of PSCs and thus diminish energy losses. Systematically theoretical calculations and experimental studies reveal that the fluorination&#8208;assisted ammonium molecule could form a stronger interaction with perovskites and thereby arrange the dipole alignment on the superficial layer of perovskites, which could simultaneously ameliorate the passivation effect and energy level alignment of the perovskite and hole transport layers, thereby suppressing interface recombination. Meanwhile, the coordinated bonding between the ammonium and hole transport layer facilitates charge transfer at the heterojunction interface by offering additional carrier transport channels. Consequently, the CsPbI3 PSCs deliver a high efficiency of up to 22.05%. This work provides important design principles of interface engineering for high&#8208;performance solar cells to minimize energy losses.

         <title>Atomic Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr Sites for Highly Selective Production of p&#8208;xylene from Tandem Upcycling of PET and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous catalyst Cu/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#8208;A with atomic Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites was successfully developed at ambient temperature and pressure, which not only exhibits efficient activation of C&#9552;O and H&#9472;H bonds but also possesses a fast hydrogen spillover effect. These properties endow this catalyst with superior catalytic activity for the upcycling of waste PET and CO2 into p&#8208;xylene (PX) and ethylene glycol (EG).








Abstract
Exploring an efficient catalytic system for tandem upcycling of CO2 and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is highly desirable for achieving efficient resource utilization of wastes. However, the high activation energy for C&#9552;O bonds (in both PET and CO2) and the difficulty in regulating the reaction pathways restricted PET recovery efficiency. Here, we demonstrated the rational design of a single&#8208;atom Cu catalyst for precisely catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol and tandem PET upcycling to ethylene glycol (EG) and p&#8208;xylene (PX). In the Cu/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#8208;A catalyst, Cu atoms are selectively anchored to the Zr&#8208;oxo nodes of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 to form Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites. The Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites can effectively activate both CO2 and H2 by reducing the activation energy and accelerate the transformation of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), which is further hydro&#8208;deoxygenated to yield PX. As a result, 20.4% CO2 conversion was obtained within 36&#160;h, with 89.5% and 92.1% yields of PX and EG, respectively. Rapid and precise hydrogen spillover from Cu atoms to adsorbed reactants/intermediates at the Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites also drives the reaction process.

         <title>Identification of an Activity Selector for the Nitroso&#8208;Forming Activity in Bacterial Type&#8208;III Copper Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small but crucial difference: Type&#8208;III copper enzymes, like tyrosinase (TYR) and o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase (AO), catalyze the oxidation of o&#8208;aminophenols (AP) to quinone imines. Unlike TYR, AO can further oxidize AP to nitrosophenols. This nitroso&#8208;forming activity is controlled by a key amino acid near the Cu(A) ion. Mutating Asn to Ile in the AO SgGriF converts it to a TYR, while the homologous Ile to Asn mutation in SzTYR switches it from a TYR to an AO. 








Abstract
O&#8208;aminophenol oxidases, a specialized subclass of type&#8208;III copper proteins, play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of bioactive nitrosophenols, which display antiretroviral and blood cholesterol&#8208;lowering activity. Another related subclass of type&#8208;III copper proteins, tyrosinases, closely resemble o&#8208;aminophenol oxidases structurally and enzymatically but lack their unique ability to oxidize o&#8208;aminophenols into nitrosophenols. To unpuzzle the catalytic disparities of both subclasses, highly conserved amino acid residues in the vicinity of the catalytic center were identified. Notably, the Asn43 residue in the o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase from Streptomyces griseus (SgGriF) plays a pivotal role in its nitroso&#8208;forming activity. Mutating the Asn43 residue in SgGriF to isoleucine, which is present at the homologous position Ile42 in the tyrosinase from Streptomyces sp. ZL&#8208;24 (SzTYR), resulted in the loss of the nitroso&#8208;forming activity in SgGriF. Conversely, exchanging Ile42 in SzTYR to asparagine generates nitroso&#8208;forming activity in SzTYR. The results presented herein demonstrate the feasibility of converting an o&#8208;aminophenol oxidase into a tyrosinase and vice versa through a single amino acid mutation, underscoring the potential of these findings for future applications in medicinal and material sciences.

         <title>Asymmetric B&#8592;N Functionalized Benzothiadiazoles for High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers based on asymmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N functionalized benzothiadiazole units (BTBN and FBTBN) are rationally designed and synthesized. These polymers feature an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and enhanced electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. The asymmetric half&#8208;fused molecular architecture not only promotes efficient n&#8208;type charge&#8208;transport property but also endows the polymers with improved mechanical flexibility.








Abstract
B&#8592;N containing polymers have emerged in organic electronics due to their fascinating optical and electronic properties. Despite these advantages, the development of B&#8592;N&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers for high&#8208;performance organic transistors remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective B&#8592;N containing acceptor units. In this work, we address this challenge through the rational design and synthesis of two asymmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives, BTBN and FBTBN. These compounds leverage the unique electronic properties of the B&#8592;N motif, enabling the development of two new n&#8208;type polymers, PBTBN and PFBTBN. Notably, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBTBN and PFBTBN are significantly lowered by 0.2&#8211;0.3&#160;eV compared to their counterparts without B&#8592;N functionalization, with PFBTBN achieving a LUMO of &#8764; &#8722;4.0&#160;eV. Importantly, PFBTBN exhibits exceptional unipolar n&#8208;type transistor performance with a high electron mobility (&#181;e) of 3.85 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The asymmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N molecular backbone not only stabilizes the electronic structure but also induces a near&#8208;amorphous morphology, thereby enabling PFBTBN&#8208;based flexible transistors to retain a high &#181;e of 3.16 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 even after 1000 bending cycles. This work demonstrates the transformative potential of incorporating asymmetric B&#8592;N functionalized acceptors for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuned Charge Density of Pt Single&#8208;Atom Sites for Controllable Hydrodeoxygenation of Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local charge density of Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst was fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the support structure to manipulate the product selectivity of lignin hydrodeoxygenation. The electron&#8208;deficient Pt1 sites produced cyclohexanols while electron&#8208;rich Pt1 sites favored cycloalkanes, which is due to their different adsorption strengths of the hydroxyl from the electron attraction and donation effect.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;selectivity conversion of lignin to value&#8208;added chemicals and biofuels remains a desirable but challenging target due to its complex structure with multiple reaction paths. Herein, we designed the robust Pt single&#8208;atom sites supported on NiAl layered double hydroxide (Pt1/NiAl&#8208;LDH) and intermetallic compound (Pt1/NiAl&#8208;IMC) with distinct local charge density for selectivity&#8208;controllable hydrodeoxygenation of lignin. The Pt1/NiAl&#8208;LDH with electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites hydrogenated 4&#8208;propylguaiacol into 4&#8208;propylcyclohexanol with 100% conversion and over 90% selectivity, while Pt1/NiAl&#8208;IMC with electron&#8208;rich Pt sites favored complete deoxygenation, yielding almost equivalent of propylcyclohexane. Similar results were achieved using lignin samples. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the deoxygenation capacity of Pt1/NiAl&#8208;IMC stems from the high electronic density of Pt single atoms, which injects electrons into the C&#9472;O bond and weakens its bonding energy. This study demonstrates that the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts in biopolymers hydrodeoxygenation can be optimized toward different products by well&#8208;controlled electronic structures.

         <title>Defective Poly(heptazine imide) Nanosheets for Efficient One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Photocatalytic O2 Reduction to Medical&#8208;Like H2O2</title>

         <dc:description>
Poly(heptazine imide) nanosheet photocatalysts with molecular reconfiguration were prepared by tetrabutylammonium cation exchange for the first time. High&#8208;concentration H2O2 was produced by a one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron pathway under simulated solar light irradiation, which is superior to most of the reported carbon nitride&#8208;based catalysts.








Abstract
Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) is a promising photocatalyst for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production; however, enhancing its specific surface area to expose internal active sites and understanding their roles in key mechanistic steps for the H2O2 synthesis remain challenging. Here, we utilized organic cations to exfoliate bulk PHI and fabricate PHI nanosheets for producing H2O2 at a rate of 27.35&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under simulated solar light irradiation, outperforming most of the reported carbon nitride&#8208;based catalysts. Importantly, after 36&#160;h of cyclic accumulation reactions in a self&#8208;created spiral flow reactor, the H2O2 concentration stabilized at 2.7&#160;wt.%, close to medical sterilization levels. In situ spectroscopic characterizations and density functional theory calculations revealed that the exfoliation results in molecular reconfiguration of the PHI basal planes, forming the active sites to promote charge separation and electron localization. This new structure also creates midgap states, enabling direct H2O2 production via a one&#8208;step, two&#8208;electron pathway, bypassing the superoxide radical pathway. Theoretical calculations suggest that the localized electronic structure created by the active sites favors the protonation of adsorbed O2 and stabilizes the *OOH species, which converts to H2O2. This study elucidates and underscores the importance of active&#8208;site reconfiguration for efficient photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathways.

         <title>Divergent Construction of Cyclobutane&#8208;Fused Pentacyclic Scaffolds via Double Dearomative Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A divergent synthetic strategy has been developed to construct cyclobutane&#8208;fused pentacyclic scaffolds via a photocatalytic intermolecular double dearomative cycloaddition of arenes.








Abstract
Cyclobutane&#8208;fused polycyclic scaffolds are structurally interesting cores in natural product synthesis and drug discovery. The construction of these skeletons often requires elaborate synthetic effort and gives low efficiency. We herein demonstrated the divergent construction of various cyclobutane&#8208;fused 2D/3D pentacyclic scaffolds by a photocatalytic intermolecular double dearomative cycloaddition of arenes. These skeletons, typically unattainable under thermal conditions, could be accessed with exclusive diastereoselectivity under mild photochemical conditions. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies elucidate that the reaction proceeds through a cascade sequence involving photocatalytic 1,4&#8208;hydroalkylation, alkene isomerization, and [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition via an intertwined single electron transfer (SET)/energy transfer (EnT) nature. This protocol provided a divergent synthetic approach for constructing (pseudo)&#8208;dimeric cyclobutane&#8208;fused 2D/3D pentacyclic scaffolds. The visible light induced intermolecular double dearomative cycloaddition between naphthalenes and benzothiophenes was also realized, providing indispensable methods for unprecedented structurally diverse polycyclic molecules that were difficult to access by conventional transformations.

The table of contents (TOC) figure provides a visual overview of the key innovations and findings of this study on high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The single&#8208;solvent electrolyte composed of 2.3&#160;M lithium salt in tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP), which enables stable LMB operation at ultra&#8208;high voltages up to 5.0&#160;V. The electrolyte forms large weakly&#8208;solvating nanometric aggregates (n&#8208;AGG), which contribute to enhanced oxidative stability and facilitate efficient redox reactions. Notably, the electrolyte exhibits exceptional cycling stability for over 1500 h, effectively suppressing dendrite formation and demonstrating strong compatibility with high&#8208;voltage cathodes, such as NCM811 and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO). The improved thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the electrolyte significantly enhances the high&#8208;voltage tolerance and cycling performance of LMBs, offering promising prospects for the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.








Abstract
The urgent need for high energy density (&gt; 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) has driven advancements in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. However, degradation of traditional electrolytes restricts high cut&#8208;off voltage&#160;&lt;&#160;4.4&#160;V, while low lithium transference numbers (tLi+) lead to polarization and early charge/discharge termination, which typically necessitate use of multiple solvents or salt&#8208;concentrated electrolytes to enable high&#8208;voltage chemistry. To address this challenge, we developed a single&#8208;solvent, single&#8208;salt electrolyte with tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP), achieving a high tLi+ of 0.78 and enabling ultra&#8208;high&#8208;voltage LMB operation up to 5.0&#160;V. Large molecular sterics and electron density delocalization of TFEP enabled dominant presence of local aggregates (AGGs), which further populated to form large and ion&#8208;rich weakly&#8208;solvating nanometric aggregates (n&#8208;AGGs), changing redox properties and promoting the interfacial stabilities to a greater extent. As a result, we showed suppressed dendrite formation with stable cycling for over 1500 h, and full&#8208;cell operations paired with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811) at 4.7&#160;V and with LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) at 5.0&#160;V. The tuning of bulk electrolyte properties from the scale of microscopic electronic structures to mesoscopic solvation structures has effectively enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the electrolyte, paving the way for LMBs with high&#8208;voltage tolerance.

         <title>HF&#8208;Free Manufacturing of Fluorochemicals from Fluorspar</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hazardous production of HF poses a major chemical and societal challenge. How to incorporate fluorine (F) atoms into organic molecules, circumventing HF generation? Recently, Gouverneur and co&#8208;workers reported an innovative method to activate fluorspar (CaF2), mitigating the environmental impact of the fluorination process.








Abstract
Fluorochemicals are vital in modern chemistry, from batteries to agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, their production still relies on a centuries&#8208;old method involving the production of hydrofluoric acid (HF). Recently, Gouverneur and co&#8208;workers developed innovative, and more sustainable approaches starting from naturally occurring fluorspar (CaF&#8322;), reducing environmental impact.

         <title>Molecular Design of Polymeric Metal&#8211;Organic Nanocapsule Networks for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the unique structure design, PolyMONC(Li) developed&#160;a multifunctional solid polymer electrolyte for lithium batteries. The molecular design of polymer chains to coordinate with MONC to form a polymer network helps to limit anions and provide a continuous pathway for Li+ conduction. The Li symmetric batteries exhibited excellent long&#8208;term cyclability for over 900&#160;h cycling. Remarkably, the solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries deliver a high discharge specific capacity of 133.5 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;C and the integrated Li&#8211;O2 battery exhibited a long&#8208;term cyclability for over 400 cycles. 








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) have emerged as high&#8208;priority materials for ensuring the safe operation of solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) batteries. However, current SSEs still face challenges of balancing stability and ionic conductivity, which limits their practical applications in solid&#8208;state Li batteries. Here, we report a general strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance SSEs by constructing a Li+&#8208;conducted polymeric metal&#8211;organic nanocapsule (PolyMONC(Li)) network through molecular design. With the unique cage structure and pore size, metal&#8211;organic nanocapsule (MONC) can achieve excellent anion confinement effects. The PolyMONC(Li) network with continuous Li+ conduction pathways serves as a solid electrolyte exhibiting a high ionic conductivity (0.18 mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and a high Li+ transference number (0.83). Combining the two superiorities of optimal balance between mechanical strength and excellent Li+ conductivity, the PolyMONC(Li) can still restrain the dendrite growth and prevent Li symmetric batteries from short&#8208;circuiting even over 900&#160;h cycling. The PolyMONC(Li)&#8208;based SSEs Li&#8208;metal batteries achieved a higher specific capacity than common polymer electrolytes such as polyethylene oxide&#8208;based SSE. Additionally, taking advantage of the PolyMONC(Li) electrode binder, the solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;O2 battery achieves a stable cycling over 400 cycles. This work provides a comprehensive guideline for developing porous solids from molecule design to practical application.

&lt;p&gt;Benefiting from the unique structure design, PolyMONC(Li) developed&#160;a multifunctional solid polymer electrolyte for lithium batteries. The molecular design of polymer chains to coordinate with MONC to form a polymer network helps to limit anions and provide a continuous pathway for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction. The Li symmetric batteries exhibited excellent long-term cyclability for over 900&#160;h cycling. Remarkably, the solid-state Li-metal batteries deliver a high discharge specific capacity of 133.5 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#160;C and the integrated Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery exhibited a long-term cyclability for over 400 cycles. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) have emerged as high-priority materials for ensuring the safe operation of solid-state lithium (Li) batteries. However, current SSEs still face challenges of balancing stability and ionic conductivity, which limits their practical applications in solid-state Li batteries. Here, we report a general strategy for achieving high-performance SSEs by constructing a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conducted polymeric metal&#8211;organic nanocapsule (PolyMONC(Li)) network through molecular design. With the unique cage structure and pore size, metal&#8211;organic nanocapsule (MONC) can achieve excellent anion confinement effects. The PolyMONC(Li) network with continuous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction pathways serves as a solid electrolyte exhibiting a high ionic conductivity (0.18 mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#160;&#176;C) and a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (0.83). Combining the two superiorities of optimal balance between mechanical strength and excellent Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity, the PolyMONC(Li) can still restrain the dendrite growth and prevent Li symmetric batteries from short-circuiting even over 900&#160;h cycling. The PolyMONC(Li)-based SSEs Li-metal batteries achieved a higher specific capacity than common polymer electrolytes such as polyethylene oxide-based SSE. Additionally, taking advantage of the PolyMONC(Li) electrode binder, the solid-state Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery achieves a stable cycling over 400 cycles. This work provides a comprehensive guideline for developing porous solids from molecule design to practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton Driving Mechanism Revealed in Sulfur&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Atom FeN2O2 Carbon Dots for Superior Peroxidase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that sulfur doping in FeN2O2 single&#8208;atom carbon dots induces a proton driving mechanism, significantly enhancing peroxidase&#8208;like activity. This mechanism facilitates H2O dissociation and proton transfer, providing an ample supply of H* for the conversion of H2O2 to&#183;OH, as verified through KIE, in situ experiments, and DFT calculations. 








Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doped single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAEs) hold great promise as enzyme mimics, yet their catalytic mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that the proton driving mechanism induced by sulfur doping in single&#8208;atom FeN2O2 carbon dots (S&#8208;FeCDs) significantly enhances peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity. Synthesized via low&#8208;temperature carbonization, S&#8208;FeCDs exhibit FeN2O2 coordination with sulfur in the second shell, as confirmed by XAFS and AC&#8208;STEM. The POD&#8208;specific activity of S&#8208;FeCDs reached 295&#160;U mg&#8722;1, which is 11.2&#8208;fold higher than that of sulfur&#8208;free FeCDs, with natural enzyme&#8208;like kinetics. In situ experiments, kinetic and mechanistic studies revealed that sulfur doping promotes H2O dissociation, enhances H+ adsorption, reduces the &#916;G for H2O2&#8208;to&#8208;&#183;OH conversion. DFT revealed a lowered energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (2*OH&#160;&#8594;&#160;*O&#160;+&#160;*H2O) from 2.50 to 1.62&#160;eV. In vivo, S&#8208;FeCDs demonstrated broad pH efficacy in MRSA&#8208;infected wound models, achieving near&#8208;complete healing within 7 days. The proton driving mechanism was further validated through nitro compound reduction, demonstrating accelerated N&#9472;H bond activation. This work highlights the critical role of sulfur&#8208;induced proton dynamics in enhancing SAEs performance, providing a rational strategy for designing multifunctional nanozymes in biomedical and catalytic applications.

         <title>Mechanism of First Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer of Water Oxidation at the BiVO4${\rm BiVO}_4$&#8211;Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;energy surface for the first step of the oxygen evolution reaction at the BiOV4${\rm BiOV}_4$&#8211;water interface is obtained through machine&#8208;learning potentials at the hybrid&#8208;functional level of accuracy. This work reveals that the proton transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step, consistent with kinetic&#8208;isotope&#8208;effect experiments.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the BiVO4${\rm BiVO}_4$&#8211;water interface is considered to be the bottleneck of the overall water splitting at this aqueous interface. To provide insight into the mechanism of this reaction, the focus is set on the first proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET). The free&#8208;energy surface of this first step is obtained by combining on&#8208;the&#8208;fly probability&#8208;enhanced sampling and machine learning potentials at the hybrid functional level of accuracy. Our study reveals that proton transfer precedes electron transfer and determines the reaction barrier, consistent with kinetic&#8208;isotope&#8208;effect experiments. The calculated reaction barrier amounts to 0.66&#177;0.09$0.66\pm 0.09$ eV. The proton moves from the adsorbed water molecule to a surface O atom through a direct transfer mechanism. The hole hopping to the resulting hydroxide occurs via the mediation of a surface Bi atom. The presented framework can be generally applied to other PCET steps and other oxides, thus opening the door to a comprehensive investigation of the OER mechanism at oxide&#8211;water interfaces.

         <title>Leveraging Sortase A Electrostatics for Powerful Transpeptidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic profile of sortase A pentamutant (SrtA&#8208;5M) is leveraged to improve SrtA&#8208;5M&#8208;mediated transpeptidations by incorporating short, charged peptidic modules into the substrates. The reaction is highly efficient, straightforward to implement, compatible with recombinant protein expression, and enables remarkably clean protein labeling and protein&#8208;protein coupling.








Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated transpeptidation is a powerful biochemical reaction to perform protein engineering. In this work, we leverage the unique electrostatic profile of sortase A pentamutant (SrtA&#8208;5M) to improve SrtA&#8208;5M&#8208;mediated transpeptidations by incorporating short, charged peptidic modules into the substrates. Importantly, the reaction proceeds with a minimal excess of nucleophile and is fast and highly efficient in the low micromolar substrate concentration range. Electrostatic assistance eliminates the need for additives or complex substrate engineering strategies, thereby giving it a broad scope. Our findings also provide fundamental insights into the influence of substrate charge on SrtA&#8208;5M activity, paving the way for further optimization of sortase A&#8208;catalyzed transpeptidation reactions.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Driven Stepwise Activation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Toward Industrial&#8208;Level Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a defect&#8208;driven stepwise activation strategy to precisely regulate adsorption behavior of defective Co&#8208;based MOF by tailoring interplay between local coordination geometry and electronic configuration. This approach effectively tunes the bonding states of Co&#8208;OOH* structural unit, overcoming high reaction barriers and enabling industrial&#8208;scale current densities in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring well&#8208;defined metal active sites and unique coordination environment, have recently emerged as ideal model catalysts for establishing precise structure&#8208;activity relationships in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, elucidating essential catalytic mechanisms responsible for dynamic reaction conditions remain challenging, primarily due to the complicated adsorption behavior and cross&#8208;step transfer of key adsorbates during OER. Herein, we propose a defect&#8208;driven stepwise activation strategy to meticulously control the adsorption behavior for defective Co&#8208;based MOF (termed D/CoFc&#8208;MOF) through tailoring the interplay between local coordination geometry and electronic configuration. Operando characterizations reveal that D/CoFc&#8208;MOF undergoes a unique stepwise activation during OER, progressing from pristine MOF state to intermediate &#945;&#8208;FeOOH state, and ultimately to active CoFeOOH phase, which markedly differs from conventional single&#8208;step surface phase conversion. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the electronic interaction between the active Co sites and OOH* intermediates of MOF&#8208;derived defective CoFeOOH can be effectively strengthened, thereby overcoming the high reaction barrier and enhancing OER activity. The D/CoFc&#8208;MOF anode, deployed in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, achieves industrial&#8208;scale current densities of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.69&#160;V and operates stably for 300&#160;h. This approach provides a fundamental insight into designing catalysts prone to dynamic phase transitions.

         <title>Covalent Elaboration of Confined Surfaces Steers C&#9472;C Coupling Pathway for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction at Ampere&#8208;Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel gasphilic Cu2O nanoparticle dispersed within the hierarchically porous carbon matrix as a high&#8208;efficiency CO2RR electrocatalyst switches in the reaction pathways from ethanol to ethylene during CO2RR at ampere&#8208;level current, depending on the multiscale microenvironment engineering. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ethylene achieved is as high as &#8764;71% with a partial current density of 513.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Microenvironmental engineering of electrocatalysts is pivotal for directing reaction pathways and stabilizing key intermediates in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multicarbon products, but it has yet to meet the industrial requirement for selectively producing a most desired product, such as ethylene or ethanol, at a steady above&#8208;ampere current level. Herein, a topotactic conversion cum covalent functionalization strategy is invoked to craft a catalyst with confined and modulated surfaces that can bias the reaction heavily for ethylene production with a 22&#8208;fold boost in the ethylene/ethanol ratio. The well&#8208;tuned covalent structural motif of &#9472;Si&#9472;O&#9472;Cu&#9472; on PDMS&#8208;Cu2O/C dramatically elevates the C2H4&#8208;forming activity with a faradaic efficiency reaching up to 71% and a high partial current density of 513.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Operando infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations unveil the ultralow coordination number and the upshifted d&#8208;band center. Notably, modulating the d&#8208;band center with the covalently elaborated surfaces allows control of the adsorption energies of CHO* and other intermediates along the ethylene path, largely lowering energy barriers for the key steps, particularly the formation of CH2CHO*. This work sheds light on the microenvironment modulation at the surface bonding to mesoscopic scales to precisely control catalytic processes and steer reaction pathways toward the target product.

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Polar Amino Acids Bearing &#946;&#8208;Leaving Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of enolate chemistry to functionalise amino acids with &#946;&#8208;heteroatom side&#8208;chains (serine, cysteine, threonine, etc.) is hampered by &#946;&#8208;elimination. We show that &#945;&#8208;arylation can be achieved by incorporating the side chain into a saturated heterocycle, making the unwanted elimination a disfavoured 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig reaction. An alternative, now favoured, unactivated intramolecular SNAr reaction provides a range of functionalised amino acid derivatives.








Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;arylation of amino acids may be achieved by intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions of amino&#8208;acid derived enolates, but for amino acids bearing &#946;&#8208;leaving groups, such reactions are complicated by competing E1cB elimination of the &#946;&#8208;substituent. In this paper we report an approach to the arylation of the polar amino acids serine, cysteine, diaminopropionic acid, and allothreonine by inducing intramolecular SNAr reactions of heterocycles, which the heteroatom substituent is stereoelectronically protected from elimination by incorporating it into the ring system of N&#8208;carbamoyl oxazolidines, thiazolidines, or imidazolidines. The sequence comprises the diastereoselective formation of a heterocyclic urea followed by an intramolecular N&#8208;to&#8208;C aryl migration, yielding bicyclic hydantoins that can be further hydrolysed to afford quaternary &#945;&#8208;aryl amino acids. The method is practical and scalable, avoids the use of transition metals or chiral auxiliaries, and provides the opportunity to access a variety of &#945;&#8208;arylated products bearing electronically diverse benzenoid or heterocyclic substituents (35 examples).

         <title>Suppressing the Interface Photodegradation Towards Efficient and Stable All Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All perovskite tandem solar cells (PTSCs) were expected to overcome the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Nevertheless, wide bandgap (WBG) subcells suffer from large photovoltage losses and device instability due to extensive film defect, interfacial degradation and phase segregation. Herein, a polymeric multi&#8208;dentate anchoring (PMDA) strategy by introducing poly(carbazole phosphonic acid) was employed to engineer the bottom interface and suppress phase segregation. The reinforced and homogeneous anchorage by multiple repeat phosphonic acid groups onto NiOx significantly optimise the bottom interface, suppress unfavourable interfacial reactions and thus alleviate phase segregation of WBG perovskite. As a result, the PMDA&#8208;modified WBG PSCs showed higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the control device (19.84% versus 18.18%), along with better device photostability (T80 = 1200 versus 500 hours). Coupled with narrow bandgap (NBG) PSCs, the PMDA&#8208;modified PTSCs reached a PCE of up to 28.51% with device operation photostability over 700 hours (T80).</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Engineering of Branched PdCoP x  Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing advanced cathode materials plays a positive role in lowering the charge/discharge overpotentials and improving the cycling performance of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Here we report a direct synthesis strategy to prepare high&#8208;dimensional branched PdCoPx series nanostructures, in which the Pd atoms are well dispersed within cobalt phosphide, leading to rich Pd&#8211;Co&#8211;P interfaces and evoking a prominent ligand effect between the elements. The Pd1Co2Px exhibits an excellent and stable activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.46 A mgPd&#8722;1, far exceeding that of commercial Pd/C (0.12 A mgPd&#8722;1) and Pt/C (0.17 A mgPt&#8722;1). Using Pd1Co2Px as the cathode, the resulting LOB shows an ultralow discharge/charge overpotential of 0.40 V and could run stably for over 240 cycles, which is a significant improvement compared with the counterparts using CoPx and Pd/C cathodes. Experimental and Density Functional Theory calculation results indicate that the dispersed Pd atoms could significantly enhance the ORR kinetics, and the Pd&#8211;Co&#8211;P interfaces could direct the two&#8208;dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film&#8208;like Li2O2 products. This feature successfully elevates both the charge and discharge performances, as well as the stability of the LOB.</dc:description>

         <title>Chroman Derivatives by Group Transposition and Atom Swapping in 1&#8208;Tetralones: Single Atom Editing Enabled by Oxidative Ring Contraction of Benzoxepine Silyl Ketene Acetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom editing of complex molecules is steadily filling the chemical toolbox with site&#8208;selective modification reactions. Herein, a stepwise scheme for carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen swap in tetralins leading to privileged chroman scaffolds is presented. Increasing the oxidation state at each stage, the substrate scope naturally extends: starting from tetralins via 1&#8208;tetralones and further via seven&#8208;membered lactones, the transformation results in diverse chroman&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acids and chroman&#8208;2&#8208;ols. The efficiency of this synthetic route is governed by the developed new oxidative ring&#8208;contractive transformations of tetrahydrobenzooxepinones, enabled by intermediate silylation into ketene acetals. The described carbon&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen swap is illustrated by 40+ examples, including skeletal editing of natural products and short formal synthesis of Heliannuol E. Formation of chroman&#8208;2&#8208;ols tentatively may proceed via original mechanism with extrusion of carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The essence for the classic pH&#8208;dependent catalytic behavior of Pt towards hydrogen electrochemistry, has been debated for decades. In stark contrast, Ru represents a unique exception by exhibiting intrinsically reverse pH&#8208;dependence among Pt&#8208;group metals, significantly challenging the universal validity of the existing mechanistic system derived from classic pH&#8208;effect. To decode the chemical essence beneath the unique anomalous pH&#8208;dependence, refined multidimensional structural characterizations and electrical transport spectroscopic studies reveal that the electron delocalization on Ru surface enables strong oxophilicity and unique pH&#8208;dependent coverage of OH*, essentially different from the H*&#8208;dominated Pt surface. The enriched OH* breaks the classic pH&#8208;dependent rule by forming hydrogen bond regulated interfacial water structures, thus creating a unique chemical environment for alkaline hydrogen catalysis. By clearly decoding the anomalous pH&#8208;dependent behavior of Ru, our work provides new chances to improve the physicochemical model for re&#8208;understanding hydrogen electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Rigidity&#8208;Enhancement and Electron&#8208;Rich Systems Engineering Robust Carbon Dots&#8208;Based ultra&#8208;Narrowband NIR Emitters for LEDs with Superior Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the controllable synthesis of carbon dots (CDs) with high color purity, narrow full width at half maxima (FWHM) of 29, 32 and 39 nm, and near&#8208;infrared emission at wavelengths of 683, 695 and 704 nm. Structural characterization, transient absorption, and temperature&#8208;dependent dynamics were investigated to elucidate the narrowband mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the high symmetry and substantial conjugation of the graphitic core enhance material rigidity with minimal exciton&#8208;capturing defects. The high pyrrole N content increases the conjugated electron delocalization, promoting radiative recombination of confined electrons and holes, thereby reducing FWHM. In addition, the large exciton binding energy, weak electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and simple radiative dynamics of the CDs further contribute to their ultra&#8208;narrow emission bandwidths. The CDs exhibit exceptional photo and thermal stabilities in extremely acidic or alkaline conditions and various organic solvents. No quenching or peak broadening is observed at high CD concentrations, rendering these materials suitable for applications in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Excitingly, CD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) can operate stably at a maximum current of 2000 mA and retain more than 94% of its performance for 150 h at 300 mA. LEDs utilizing these narrowband CDs provide high&#8208;color purity displays and specific steady&#8208;state lighting applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Resonance Hybrid Design for Stable Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules are promising candidates for aqueous redox flow batteries (AORFBs) due to their structural versatility, tunability, and reliance on Earth&#8208;abundant elements for sustainable energy storage solutions. However, achieving stability for organic molecules in aqueous batteries remains challenging due to water&#8208;induced degradation. The conjugated systems with enhanced rigidity such as anthraquinone or phenazine derivatives have shown improved stability, yet often exhibit unwanted restructuring reactions in the reduced state due to overly high electron densities, leading to the loss of redox activity. In the present work, we introduce a resonance hybrid, 2,3&#8208;dihydroxyl substituted phenazine dication (HSPC), whose redox center is distributed among different resonance forms between phenazine and quinone to enable efficient reversible electron transfer in aqueous environments. The electrochemical synthesis, resonance structure, and key properties of HSPC were investigated through a framework of combined electrochemical measurements, spectroscopic analysis, and theoretical studies. A high&#8208;concentration cell based on HSPC exhibits a low capacity decay rate (0.0009% per cycle, 0.006% per day at a 1.4 M electron concentration). These results indicate the significant potential of the resonance hybrid design to build stable redox materials for AORFBs and other energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive DNA Droplets for Controlling Enzyme Cascade Pathways  by Dynamic Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of enzymatic cascade pathways is essential for deepening our understanding of metabolic processes and designing synthetic biochemical systems. In this study, we present a novel approach to modulate these cascades using light&#8208;responsive DNA droplets. Y&#8208;motif sequences with azobenzene&#8208;modified sticky ends were designed to form DNA droplets via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. These droplets enable  selective sequestration of enzymes within compartments, allowing dynamic regulation of enzymatic cascades in response to ultraviolet and visible light stimuli. As a model system, we employed an incompatible enzymatic cascade involving glucose oxidase (GOx), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and catalase (CAT). Under visible light, the DNA droplets co&#8208;localize enzymes within the compartments, effectively regulating metabolic flux without altering the total enzyme concentration. Upon ultraviolet exposure, the droplets disassemble, releasing the sequestered enzymes and altering cascade dynamics. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated using an alternative enzymatic cascade system comprising galactose oxidase (GAO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and catalase (CAT). This system demonstrates that light&#8208;responsive DNA droplets are a powerful tool for regulating enzymatic pathways, with potential applications in synthetic biology, microreactor design, and bioengineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronically Asynchronous Transition State Tuned from Remote Site for Oxygen Atom Transfer by CuII&#8208;Nitrite Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) reduction to nitric oxide (NO) is of paramount interest in biology. Cu&#8208;nitrite reductase reduces NO2&#8722; to NO while alternatively NO2&#8722; can be reduced to NO at copper centre via oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to electron&#8208;rich substrate like PPh3. This work demonstrates&#160;tuning of LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy by remote site modification which leads to change in electrochemical property and OAT activity of CuII&#8208;NO2&#8722; involving electronically asynchronous transition state. For this purpose, we report here four CuII&#8208;NO2&#8722; complexes: [CuII(LCH2)(NO2)(ClO4)] (1), [CuII(LO)(NO2(ClO4)] (2), [CuII(LCH2Me)(NO2)(ClO4)] (3), [CuII(LOMe)(NO2)(ClO4)] (4) with similar primary coordination sphere but different substituents at remote site. In going from 1 &#8211; 4, by remote site substitution, there is systematic stabilization of LUMO energy which correlates linearly with the increased OAT to PPh3 resulting in 130 times reactivity enhancement for 4 compared to 1. This kind of significant reactivity enhancement by tuning LUMO energy from remote site is very rare. Mechanistic study involving experimental and computational study reveals asynchronous mechanism which was hitherto not reported for any OAT. The observed increase in OAT reactivity from 1 to 4 is attributed to an increase in the extent of asynchronicity in corresponding transition states controlled from remote site modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Nitrogen and Oxygen Active Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient adsorbents for precious metals, especially gold recovery, necessitates the integration of multiple critical properties, including high adsorption capacity, rapid adsorption kinetics, and exceptional selectivity, posing significant scientific challenges with substantial economic and environmental implications. Herein, we report a strategy to achieve highly efficient gold adsorption through synergistic effects of nitrogen and oxygen active sites into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Two &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs (NKCOF&#8208;77 and &#8208;78) with high&#8208;density nitrogen/oxygen active sites are rationally designed and synthesized via a Michael addition&#8208;elimination reaction approach. Notably, the comprehensive gold recovery performance for NKCOF&#8208;77 is among the best in the COF field, with the third highest adsorption capacity (up to 3225 mg g&#8208;1), ultrafast adsorption kinetics (&lt;5 min), and near&#8208;perfect selectivity (&gt;99.9% with 10 competitive cations and anions). Moreover, the COFs show exceptional ability for gold recovery from real e&#8208;waste solutions, demonstrating tremendous practical application potential. Various experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that strategically incorporating high&#8208;density nitrogen and oxygen active sites is crucial in&#160;significantly enhancing the gold adsorption capacity. This work provides a novel strategy for designing COFs as precious metal adsorbents, highlighting their promising potential for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ether&#8208;Oxygen Groups Modified Carboxylic Ester Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) operating at high cut&#8208;off voltages can achieve an energy density exceeding 500 Wh kg&#8208;1; however, they often suffer from severe capacity degradation due to electrolyte decomposition.

         <title>Multiply Substituted (Hetero)acenes with a Phosphonate Group at the Central Unit as High&#8208;Efficiency Light Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new variant of the Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;Bradsher reaction offers access to dialkoxyphosphoryl substituted (hetero)acenes, especially to previously unavailable three&#8208; to seven&#8208;substituted, tri&#8208; and tetracyclic compounds, and features high chemical yields up to 95%, excellent photoluminescence quantum yields (QY) up to 87.7%, large Stokes shifts up to 7943 cm&#8208;1 and very mild, room temperature reaction conditions. The (RO)2P(O) has a distinct effect on the photophysical properties of acenes, increasing QYs by more than twofold compared to identical acenes, not substituted by this group. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, combined with electron&#8208;hole analysis, indicated that local excitation (LE) had the dominant contribution to the electron excitation mechanism, and charge transfer (CT) of about 30% provided the highest fluorescence quantum yields. Multiply substitution of (hetero)acenes bearing phosphonate moiety and electron&#8208;diverse substituents combined with a lower number of fused aromatic rings, appear to be ideal for optimal chemical stability and high photoluminescence. The new, synthetic tool will accelerate exploitation of bulky (hetero)acene emitters for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species via Orbital Rehybridization between Intermediate and Active Site for Selective Methane Photooxidation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxidation of methane (POM) to CH3OH provides a promising pathway for sustainable chemical industry, while uncontrollable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) would proceed at the expense of compromised catalytic activity or selectivity of POM. Herein, we precisely control the type of as&#8208;formed ROS by introducing Au SAs&#160;on CuOx/ZnO (Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO), to simultaneously achieve high selectivity and productivity of CH3OH in POM. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the introduced Au SAs significantly altered the electronic structure of Cu atoms, leading to an energy level rearrangement of Cu 3d orbital and the upshift of d band center, which increased the energy levels of bonding and antibonding states of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO&#8208;*OOH. Thus, the hybridization between Cu active sites and the key intermediate *OOH was significantly enhanced, especially for the orbital hybridizations of dz2&#8208;pz and dxz/dyz&#8208;px. This facilitated the dissociation of O&#8722;O to form *OH intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the ROS type in aerobic POM. Additionally, the asymmetric electronic structure of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO could also lower the first C&#8722;H dissociation energy by structural polarization of CH4. Thus, Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO exhibited an excellent CH3OH productivity of 16856 &#956;mol&#183;gcat.&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity during POM at mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Evidence for Methylaluminoxane (MAO) Molecular Structure and Reactivity from Ultra&#8208;High Magnetic Field 27Al MAS NMR Spectroscopy Combined with DFT Calculations.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure and reactivity of methylaluminoxane (MAO), a reagent of major interest for olefin polymerization, both industrially and academically, has been probed using ultra&#8208;high magnetic field solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy (28.2 T, 1200 MHz for 1H Larmor frequency). High resolution methods combined with density functional calculations allowed for the identification and quantification of five major aluminum sites, providing precise information on the structure of MAO at the molecular level. Based on reactivity studies with THF and [ZrCp2Me2], the main reactive centers are identified as bismethyl aluminum species stabilized via a bridging methyl group from a neighboring Al center, featuring both high chemical shift and quadrupolar coupling constants (162 ppm and 27.4 MHz, respectively). The ultra&#8208;high magnetic field NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations combined approach demonstrates the ability to monitor the chemistry of MAO with unprecedented precision, enabling a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of its structure and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest Polarizability Directed Molecular &#8216;Freezing&#8217; within Non&#8208;metal Porous Salt Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoreticular non&#8208;metal salt frameworks with permanent porosity have emerged recently as a fantastic platform for molecular separation, but the underlying guest&#8208;framework interactions within their charge&#8208;separated ionic channels remain to be explored. Here, we report the first case of guest polarizability&#8208;directed molecular &#8216;freezing&#8217; of noble gas occurring within a non&#8208;metal porous organic ammonium framework, which bears well&#8208;organized, high&#8208;density chloride anions as nodes. Notably, the framework exhibits a distinctive, thermally&#8208;independent commensurate adsorption towards highly polarizable Xe, while traditional thermodynamic adsorption behaviors are observed for Kr with lower polarizability. A remarkable Xe adsorption capacity of 1.47 mmol/g and a record&#8208;high separation factor of 10.2 are thus achieved in dynamic Xe/Kr separation under ambient conditions. The practical potential for realistic Xe/Kr separation from the off&#8208;gas of used nuclear fuel (UNF) reprocessing is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations identify the presence of multiple strong Xe&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl interactions as the driving force within the size&#8208;matching ionic channels of the salt framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermediate Layer&#8208;Engineered Lanthanide Nanoparticles Enable Deep Bioorthogonal Liver Tumor and Vascular Imaging via Switchable NIR&#8208;II Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has become an attractive optical region for fluorescence imaging. However, due to the complexity in vivo, NIR&#8208;II light with various wavelengths for different imaging sences has not been investigated. Here, we found that 1525 nm light is suitable for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging due to low background interference, while its attenuation in vivo makes it unsuitable for deep imaging. The 1064 nm light is suitable for deep imaging. The impact of Yb3+ ions and the proportion of the intermediate layer in lanthanide nanoparticles on the modulation of emissions were investigated. The intense 1064 nm emission is achievable when the Yb3+ content is 80% and the intermediate layer proportion is 0.1. The bioorthogonal orthotopic liver tumor imaging could be achieved by modifying the lanthanide nanoparticles with DBCO&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;DSPE and establishing artificial receptors by N&#8208;azidoacetylmannosamine&#8208;tetraacylated (Ac4ManNAz). Lanthanide nanoparticles with the intermediate layer proportion of 0.66 and 80% Yb3+ facilitate intense 1525 nm emission, enabling the vascular imaging. Based on the imaging characteristics of NIR&#8208;II emissions with different wavelengths in vivo, this work achieves high&#8208;resolution imaging and deep imaging through intermediate layer regulation of lanthanide nanoparticles, providing an opportunity to explore a new generation of high&#8208;performance fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleation and Growth Mechanisms of Micro/Nano Structural Manganese&#8208;Trimesic Acid Coordinations for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleation and growth of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are critical for controlling their morphology, size, and performance. Guided by the crystal nucleation and growth theory, this study systematically explored the effects of the sequential addition of ligand trimesic acid (BTC) and manganese ions (Mn2+), ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ion ratio, solvent composition, and surfactants on the nucleation and growth of MnBTC. The regulatory mechanisms of the crystal morphology and internal structure were deeply revealed. Moreover, the established machine learning (ML) model can accurately predict the concentrations of &#8208;COO&#8208; and Mn2+, providing important guidance for the controlled synthesis of MOFs in the future. In practical, the electrochemical performance of MnBTC with different morphologies and sizes was evaluated for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The reaction mechanism of MnBTC during the charge&#8208;discharge process was investigated through a series of in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations, and MnBTC demonstrated excellent energy&#8208;storage performance.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nucleation and growth of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are critical for controlling their morphology, size, and performance. Guided by the crystal nucleation and growth theory, this study systematically explored the effects of the sequential addition of ligand trimesic acid (BTC) and manganese ions (Mn2+), ligand-to-metal ion ratio, solvent composition, and surfactants on the nucleation and growth of MnBTC. The regulatory mechanisms of the crystal morphology and internal structure were deeply revealed. Moreover, the established machine learning (ML) model can accurately predict the concentrations of -COO- and Mn2+, providing important guidance for the controlled synthesis of MOFs in the future. In practical, the electrochemical performance of MnBTC with different morphologies and sizes was evaluated for aqueous zinc-ion batteries. The reaction mechanism of MnBTC during the charge-discharge process was investigated through a series of in-situ and ex-situ characterizations, and MnBTC demonstrated excellent energy-storage performance. This study opens a new window for the precise synthesis of MOFs which show strongly controlled micro/nano structure and coordination environment based on the crystal nucleation and growth theory with the assistance of ML.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemistry&#8208;Driven Decarboxylative Primary Alkyl&#8208;Alkoxylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the first successful primary alkylation (or methylation) bifunctionalization reaction of olefins through sequential anodic oxidation in a simple electrochemical system, utilizing quaternary amine salts of acetic or long chain carboxylic acids as both methyl or primary alkyl radical precursors and electrolytes. ((The Table of Contents text should give readers a short preview of the main theme of the research and results included in the paper to attract their attention into reading the paper in full.

Abstract
Here, a primary alkylative difunctionalization of olefins based on the decarboxylation of carboxylate ions to obtain alkyl radicals by electrochemical anodic oxidation is reported. The reaction employs quaternary ammonium carboxylates as the source of alkyl radicals and does not require additional oxidizing agents or electrolytes. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate range and functional group compatibility. It gently converts mono&#8208; or disubstituted styrene substrates and alkyl carboxylate anions of various carbon chain lengths and substituents to products under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, it is important to note that not only alcohols but carboxylic acids and water can also serve as nucleophilic reagents to participate in the reaction and yield the corresponding products. Preliminary mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the reaction is enabled by the lower oxidation potential of the carboxylate anion compared to that of the olefin. The anodic oxidation of the carboxylate anion occurs prior to the oxidation of the olefin, followed by decarboxylation to obtain alkyl radicals.

         <title>In Situ Solid Conversion into Mechanically Adaptive LiF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase via MgF2 precursor on Si Surface in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon (Si) anodes hold exceptional promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity (~4200 mAh g&#8315;&#185;). However, their commercialization is severely hindered by the significant volume expansion&#160;(~300%) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional SEI, predominantly composed of organic species, suffers from low ionic conductivity, low electronic insulation and poor mechanical robustness, leading to rapid capacity decay. Herein, we propose an interface engineering strategy by decorating Si nanoparticles with an in&#8208;situ conversed MgF&#8322; layer (with coating integrity of 94.6%). During initial lithiation, the applied MgF&#8322; layer is in&#8208;situ conversed into SEI film with high ionic conductivity, electronic insulation and better mechanical adaptability. The prepared Si@MgF&#8322;&#8208;1 anode achieves a high initial coulombic efficiency (91.7%), superior rate capability (2000 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 10 C), and remarkable cycling stability (1794.9 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles). Full&#8208;cell based on the Si@MgF&#8322;&#8208;1 anode and NCM811 cathode further validate the practicality of this approach. The robust conversion strategy for the construction of a mechanically adaptive LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer holds significant promise for the advancement of durable silicon&#8208;based LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium/Indium Heterobimetallic Alloy as an Effective Catalyst for Reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O Silylation of Ethers with Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes. Not only the mixture of rhodium complex with indium reagent but also rhodium nanoparticles supported on indium oxide showed high catalytic activity, indicating a remarkable cooperative effect by the two metals. Notably, in both cases, the generation of rhodium/indium heterobimetallic alloy nanoparticles was revealed by mechanistic studies including XRD, XAS, and TEM imaging.








Abstract
C(sp3)&#9472;O bonds are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic small molecules as well as polymers. The methodology for functionalizing C(sp3)&#9472;O bonds is of great importance for reforming these molecular structures into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes.

         <title>Metathetical Exchange, Synthesis, and Carbon Dioxide Addition of Higher Homologues of Group 9 Metal Carbynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot synthesis for previously unknown heavy carbynes of Group 9 metals is presented. Furthermore, in a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction, the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride.








Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis for previously unknown heavy homologues of Group 9 metal carbynes [(Me3P)3Co&#8801;GeAr*] (1), [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;GeAr*] (2), [(Me3P)3Ir&#8801;GeAr*] (3), [(Me3P)3Ir&#8801;SnAr*] (5), and [(Et3P)3Ir&#8801;PbAr*] (7) is presented [Ar* = C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(Trip)2, Trip&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;C6H2iPr3]. During these preparations, the tetrylidynes [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;SnAr*] (4), and [(Me3P)3Rh&#8801;PbAr*] (6), were also prepared in a one&#8208;pot procedure. In a hitherto unknown metathetical exchange reaction, the transition metal plumbylidynes were converted into the respective stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl stannylene chloride, and the germylidynes were formed from the corresponding stannylidynes in reaction with terphenyl germylene chloride. These metathesis reactions were tracked by 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy, which shows complete exchange of the tetrel [EAr]&#8208;fragment and the formation of an intermediate in the rhodium plumbylidyne reaction with stannylene chloride (Ar&#160;=&#160;Ar*, Tbb). Reactions of the tetrylidynes (2&#8211;5) with carbon dioxide yield the products of a redox reaction [(Me3P)3(CO)M&#8208;E(&#951;2&#8208;O2CO&#8208;&#954;2O)Ar*] [E&#160;=&#160;Ge, M&#160;=&#160;Rh (11); M&#160;=&#160;Ir (12); E&#160;=&#160;Sn, M&#160;=&#160;Rh (14), M&#160;=&#160;Ir (16)] with a carbon monoxide coordinated at the transition metal and a carbonate coordinated at the Group 14 element. For tin the intermediates formed by mono CO2 addition [(Me3P)3M(&#956;,&#951;2&#8208;CO2&#8208;&#954;C:&#954;O)SnAr*] [M&#160;=&#160;Rh (13), M&#160;=&#160;Ir (15)] have been isolated.

         <title>Supramolecular Structure Enabled Photo&#8208;Responsive Charge Transport in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remarkable reduction of charge transport in a molecular junction under light illumination is realized in the self&#8208;assembled monolayers composed of porphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular cages. The efficient electron&#8208;hole pair separation in the excited TPyP cages, combined with the increased energy offset, collectively contributes to the notable reduction in conductance under light illumination.








Abstract
Supramolecular electronics offers a valuable opportunity to fabricate functional devices with tunable charge transport (CT) behaviors. Their diverse and non&#8208;covalent structures allow for precise modulation of CT with external stimuli. Despite their potential, achieving effective CT modulation in supramolecules through external stimuli remains challenging due to a lack of rigid systems with a predictable response to such stimuli. To address this challenge, we explore the use of porphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular structures and their CT responses to light illumination. By incorporating rigid ligands to increase the spatial distance between two porphyrin units, we diminish their interactions, fabricating porphyrin&#8208;contained cages that exhibit a higher efficiency of electron&#8208;hole pair separation compared to the monomer in solid state. Leveraging this advantage, a more effective photo&#8208;responsive CT is achieved for cages in solid&#8208;state junctions compared to that of monomers. The current through cage junctions reduces upon illumination. Theoretical calculations indicate that the reduction in conductivity arises from an increased energy offset between the molecule and electrode under light irradiation. Moreover, the photo&#8208;responsive CT can be finely tuned by adjusting the metal ion coordinated within the porphyrin and the distance between the cage and the electrode. This research paves a new way for developing supramolecular optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Phase Engineering for Achieving Full&#8208;Color Tunable Emission from Blue to Red and Multi&#8208;Level Information Security in Isomeric Hybrid Copper Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel isomeric hybrid copper halides, &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 featuring identical edge&#8208;sharing [Cu2I4]2&#8722; units, are successfully obtained through optimizing the reaction conditions and synthesis method. They exhibit distinct emission colors ranging from blue to yellow and to red. Intriguingly, &#945;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 shows unique multi&#8208;stimuli responsive properties, making it highly promising for advanced photonic applications, including reversible photo&#8208;patterning and multi&#8208;level information encryption and decryption systems. 








Abstract
The design and synthesis of novel hybrid metal halides polymorphs with full&#8208;color tunable emission are critical for the advancement of solid&#8208;state lighting and display technologies. However, it remains challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we successfully synthesized three new zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid isomeric copper (I) halides, namely &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 (where BuPh3P+&#160;=&#160;butyltriphenylphosphonium, C22H24P+), featuring the same edge&#8208;sharing [Cu2I4]2&#8722; units. Notably, the monoclinic &#945;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 and &#946;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4, both belonging to the P21/n space group, exhibit bright blue and orange emission, respectively. The orthorhombic&#8208;phase &#947;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 with space group Pbca and larger lattice volume shows vivid red emission, thus achieving tunable full&#8208;color emission wavelength spanning from blue (445&#160;nm) to red (667&#160;nm), representing the first instance of such broad tunability through adjusting the spatial arrangement of the organic and inorganic parts. Interestingly, &#945;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 undergoes a reversible photo&#8208;induced fluorochromism, transitioning from blue to green. Furthermore, a reversible phase transformation between &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;(BuPh3P)2Cu2I4 can be triggered by dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. As such, a photo&#8208;responsive switchable system and a multistage information encryption/decryption system are successfully devised through leveraging unique multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.

         <title>Multiple and Alternative Sites Make Tau Protein an Adaptable Sticky Surface for the SH3 Domain of Fyn Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR&#8208;based study, combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET methods, sheds light on the complex recognition mechanism between the intrinsically disordered protein Tau and the SH3 domain of Fyn kinase, highlighting how the multiple binding sites present in Tau make the protein an adaptable recognition surface that can function even when single consensus motifs are eliminated.








Abstract
The interaction between the microtubule associated protein Tau and the tyrosine kinase Fyn is believed to play a pivotal role in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have identified the SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain of Fyn as the binding receptor of several proline&#8208;rich motifs in Tau. However, the role of each proline&#8208;rich motif and their interplay in molecular recognition are still unclear. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of Fyn&#8208;SH3 recognition by the multiple PxxP sites inserted within the full&#8208;length Tau protein by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer) methods. Both in vitro and in&#8208;cell experiments revealed no single binding site strictly necessary for the binding. Instead, Fyn&#8208;SH3 contacts full&#8208;length Tau on multiple hot spot regions, located over a distance of 85 residues, through global moderate&#8208;to&#8208;low affinity interactions. Beyond two principal regions containing classical PxxP motifs, we identified a novel non&#8208;canonical binding site at the beginning of the microtubule binding domain. Our study indicates that multiple binding sites in Tau are involved in the interaction, making Tau an adaptable recognition surface that can function when single consensus motifs are deleted.

         <title>A Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Inorganic&#8208;Enriched Cathode Electrolyte Interphases Enabling 5.1&#160;V Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;voltage (5.1&#160;V) solid&#8208;state lithium battery (SSLIB) with superior stability and rate performance was achieved using an oxidation&#8208;resistant poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;co&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE) polymer and lithium difluorophosphate (LiDFP) as a functional additive, which forms a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) stabilizing the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode.








Abstract
Manufacturing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is an effective strategy for pursuing safe, energy&#8208;dense solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs). However, the challenges lie in obtaining high&#8208;voltage SSLIBs due to the lack of an electrochemically stable SPE and the degradation of the high&#8208;voltage cathode beyond 5&#160;V. Hence, we employed quantum chemical calculations to screen a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;co&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE, designated as PVTF) polymer with strong antioxidant capability to fabricate stable SPEs for high&#8208;voltage SSLIBs. Furthermore, a sacrificial additive (lithium difluorophosphate, LiDFP) was introduced in PVTF SPE to build a high&#8208;quality cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer to stabilize the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode, which is denoted as PVTF1.0@LiDFP. The Li|PVTF1.0@LiDFP|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cell operating at 5.1&#160;V sustains excellent cycling performance and remarkable rate performance, maintaining a long cycle life of over 200 cycles and achieving a high&#8208;rate capability of up to 2 C. Complementary characterization methods were utilized to dynamically observe the cathode structure and interphase evolution, revealing that the high antioxidant stability of the polymeric PVTF framework and the incorporation of LiDFP additive to form a high&#8208;quality CEI enriched with inorganic components realize the superior performance of Li|PVTF1.0@LiDFP|LNMO cell. Overall, the insights gained from our study provide a solid foundation for the development of high&#8208;voltage SSLIBs.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) is an effective strategy for pursuing safe, energy-dense solid-state lithium-ion batteries (SSLIBs). However, the challenges lie in obtaining high-voltage SSLIBs due to the lack of an electrochemically stable SPE and the degradation of the high-voltage cathode beyond 5&#160;V. Hence, we employed quantum chemical calculations to screen a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE-CFE, designated as PVTF) polymer with strong antioxidant capability to fabricate stable SPEs for high-voltage SSLIBs. Furthermore, a sacrificial additive (lithium difluorophosphate, LiDFP) was introduced in PVTF SPE to build a high-quality cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer to stabilize the LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LNMO) cathode, which is denoted as PVTF1.0@LiDFP. The Li|PVTF1.0@LiDFP|LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LNMO) cell operating at 5.1&#160;V sustains excellent cycling performance and remarkable rate performance, maintaining a long cycle life of over 200 cycles and achieving a high-rate capability of up to 2 C. Complementary characterization methods were utilized to dynamically observe the cathode structure and interphase evolution, revealing that the high antioxidant stability of the polymeric PVTF framework and the incorporation of LiDFP additive to form a high-quality CEI enriched with inorganic components realize the superior performance of Li|PVTF1.0@LiDFP|LNMO cell. Overall, the insights gained from our study provide a solid foundation for the development of high-voltage SSLIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Nanopipette Sensor for Electrochemical Interferent Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel sensor design strategy, integrating two interfaces in series within a nanopipette to create an &#8220;electrochemical Faraday cage&#8221;. This configuration addresses the long&#8208;standing challenge of endogenous ROS interference in oxidase&#8208;based sensors, achieving accurate glucose detection within cancer cells despite high levels of ROS interference.








Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;based sensors have been widely utilized for their superior selectivity. However, they cannot distinguish the same kind of redox mediators from different sources. Typically, both the H2O2 produced in glucose (analyte) oxidation by glucose oxidase (GOD) and the endogenous H2O2 (interferent) existing in the detection system can be simultaneously measured, causing inaccurate results in glucose detection. To address this long&#8208;standing and inevitable obstacle, we proposed a new sensor design strategy, a dual&#8208;interface nanopipette sensor (DINS), to shield against the interferent electrochemically. The DINS comprised an anti&#8208;interference interface at the orifice of the nanopipette, and a sensing interface located at the inner wall with a certain distance from the orifice. Anti&#8208;interference interface, functioning as an &#8220;electrochemical Faraday cage&#8221;, electrochemically eliminated the interferents with high efficiency while allowed the target species to pass through and be detected at the sensing interface. With the synergy of these two independent interfaces, the GOD&#8208;modified DINS (GOD&#8208;DINS) allowed the accurate detection of intracellular glucose with effectively eliminating endogenous H2O2, facilitating the quantitative study on the glucose metabolism inside single cells. Furthermore, this DINS configuration is expected to accurately quantify more substances, and reveal complex crosstalk interactions between multiple species in the physiological, pathological and pharmacological research.

         <title>Cooperative Photometallobiocatalysis: Nonheme Fe Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Radical Decarboxylative Azidation, Thiocyanation, and Isocyanation of Redox&#8208;Active Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the directed evolution of an underexploited nonheme Fe extradiol dioxygenase, we developed a unified cooperative photobiocatalytic strategy to allow for three types of enantioconvergent radical transformations, including azidation, thiocyanation, and isocyanation. Computational studies based on density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested a &#960;&#8208;facial selective radical rebound mechanism as the enantiodeter








Abstract
Cooperative catalysis with an enzyme and a small&#8208;molecule photocatalyst has recently emerged as a potentially general activation mode to advance novel biocatalytic reactions with synthetic utility. Herein, we report cooperative photobiocatalysis involving an engineered nonheme Fe enzyme and a tailored photoredox catalyst to achieve enantioconvergent decarboxylative azidation, thiocyanation, and isocyanation of redox&#8208;active esters via a radical mechanism. We repurposed and further evolved metapyrocatechase (MPC), a nonheme Fe extradiol dioxygenase not previously studied in new&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalysis, for the enantioselective C&#9472;N3, C&#9472;SCN, and C&#9472;NCO bond formation via an enzymatic Fe&#9472;X intermediate (X&#9552;N3, NCS, and NCO). A range of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl radical precursors were effectively converted by our engineered MPC, allowing the syntheses of organic azides, thiocyanates, and isocyanates with good to excellent enantiocontrol. Further derivatization of these products furnished valuable compounds including enantioenriched amines, triazoles, ureas, and SCF3&#8208;containing products. DFT and MD simulations shed light on the mechanism as well as the binding poses of the alkyl radical intermediate in the enzyme active site and the &#960;&#8208;facial selectivity in the enantiodetermining radical rebound. Overall, cooperative photometallobiocatalysis with nonheme Fe enzymes provides a means to develop challenging asymmetric radical transformations eluding small&#8208;molecule catalysis.

         <title>A Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing Protective Layer Enabling Stable Zinc Ion Batteries through Strong Zn&#8208;S Affinity and Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the strong and spontaneous Zn&#8208;S affinity between Zn metal and S atoms on the polythioctic acid (PTA) chain, a dynamic protective layer that tightly adheres to the electrode surface can be achieved, which delivered a strong adhesion force of up to 10.5&#160;N with Zn metal surface and high mechanical strength (Young's modulus&#160;&gt;&#160;15.1&#160;GPa).








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage, yet Zn metal anodes face issues like hydrogen evolution, dendrite growth, and corrosion. Herein, we develop a self&#8208;healable, adhesive polymer layer for AZIBs by polymerizing thioctic acid (TA) on Zn surfaces. Thanks to the strong and spontaneous affinity between Zn metal surface and S atoms on polymer chains, this protective layer can firmly and dynamically adhere to the Zn surface. Thus, even at a thickness of &lt;1&#160;&#181;m, the protective layer exhibits a strong adhesion force of up to 10.5 N with Zn surface, while the abundant carboxyl groups in the protective layer can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, endowing its high self&#8208;healing property and enhancing its strength (Young's modulus reaches 15.1 GPa). Such a protective layer effectively inhibits the dendrite growth physically and regulates the Zn2+ migration and deposition behavior chemically. Therefore, the symmetric cells can be cycled for more than 1000 h at the current densities of 1.0 and 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Full cells with NH4V4O10 also run stably for 1000 cycles with a high capacity retention. This work offers a promising strategy for designing multifunctional polymer coating towards high&#8208;stability and long&#8208;cycling AZIBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their review, Yang, Krueger, and Hamers highlight recent advances in diamonds that impact chemical scientists. Advances in growth of diamonds have yielded improved quality and lower cost, while new and emerging applications in areas such as energy storage, photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;catalysis, sensing, and quantum science have expanded applications.








Abstract
Diamond as a material has many unique properties. Its high optical dispersion, extraordinarily high mechanical strength, and unparalleled thermal conductivity have long made it a material of interest for applications such as high&#8208;temperature electronics and as wear&#8208;resistance coatings. More recently, diamond has emerged as a material with a wide range of applications in chemistry and biology. The high intrinsic stability of diamond, coupled with the ability to modify diamond surfaces with a wide range of inorganic, organic, and biological species via highly stable covalent linkages, provides a wealth of opportunity to couple diamond's chemical properties with its extraordinary physical properties. The practical utility of diamond has been greatly expanded in recent years through dramatic advances in the ability to produce diamond in bulk, thin film, and nanoparticle form, with controlled doping and purity at modest cost. These advances, together with diamond's highly stable and tunable surface chemistry with versatility of physical structure enable a wide range of emerging applications of interest to chemists, including quantum science, biomedicine, energy storage, and catalysis. Yet, to fully exploit the unique properties of diamond, some formidable chemical challenges lie ahead.
We begin by reviewing some of the features of diamond that are of particular importance to the chemistry community. We aim to highlight some of the important applications where diamond chemistry plays a key role, identify some of the key observations, and outline some of the future directions and opportunities for diamond in the chemical world.

         <title>Dynamic Crystal&#8208;Structure and Active&#8208;Site of Defective ZnAl&#8208;Catalysts During CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of operando X&#8208;ray diffraction/photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning probe spectroscopy has been conducted to correlate dynamic crystal&#8208;structure and active&#8208;site evolutions with CO2 reduction activity on defective ZnAl&#8208;LDH photocatalysts. 








Abstract
Understanding of surface defects of a catalyst during the reaction process is critical to establish an accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship. Herein, combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction/photoelectron spectroscopy with scanning probe microscope, we have first established the correlations between CO2 photoreduction activities and crystal&#8208;structure/active&#8208;site of defective ZnAl layered double hydroxides (ZnAl&#8208;LDH). Specifically, the introduction of oxygen vacancies in ZnAl&#8208;LDH could effectively promote the selective adsorption of both CO2 and H2O molecules on surface Al and Zn active sites, respectively, leading to opposite transition states and the evident shrinking of crystalline structures. Under light irradiation, the adsorbed CO2 molecules transformed into *COOH intermediate on surface Al active sites, while the H2O molecules dissociated into OH group on Zn sites to provide proton, simultaneously leading to the expansion of crystalline structures and increase of layer spacing. Accordingly, these defect&#8208;dependent evolutions of surface active sites and crystalline structure contributed to the significant improvement of CO2 reduction to CO activity (17.2&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), much higher than that of pristine ZnAl&#8208;LDH (6.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work provides new insights for in&#8208;depth understanding of the electronic and crystalline changes of defective photocatalysts during the reaction process.

         <title>Hyperbranched Polymer&#8208;Based Multipath Proton Transmembrane Transport System with Redox&#8208;Switchable Characteristics for Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hyperbranched polymer&#8208;based artificial transmembrane proton transport system was prepared by a convenient &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; cationic polymerization method. It produced multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonded chains, leading to effective and selective proton transport, which elevated lysosomal pH and induced mitochondrial damage, finally causing cancer cell apoptosis. By introducing selenide moieties, the system exhibited notable in situ redox&#8208;switchable &#8220;ON&#8211;OFF&#8221; transport activity.








Abstract
Natural channel proteins (NCPs) enable efficient and selective transport of specific species across cellular membranes and exhibit stimulus&#8208;responsive behaviors; however, replicating these features in their artificial counterparts poses significant challenges. Here, we report a hyperbranched polymer (HBP)&#8208;derived biomimetic multipath proton transport system, H3, by a straightforward &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; cationic polymerization of 3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;oxetane. H3 efficiently transports protons while rejecting other ions and water molecules by forming multiple hydrogen bonding chains like natural proton channels. Patch clamp experiments revealed that H3 facilitates rapid proton transport (&#947;H+&#160;=&#160;181&#160;&#177;&#160;4&#160;pS) comparable to that of natural gramicidin A (&#947;H+&#160;=&#160;213&#160;&#177;&#160;4&#160;pS) and demonstrates high H+&#8208;selectivity, with PH+/PK+, PH+/PNa+, and PH+/PCl&#8208; values reaching 78.4, 233.2, and 167.8, respectively. H3&#8208;induced proton transport causes elevated lysosomal pH and mitochondrial damage, ultimately resulting in severe cancer cell apoptosis (IC50: 0.23 &#181;M for U87MG; 1.04 &#181;M for B16F10). Interestingly, selenide moieties&#8208;containing H3&#8208;Se exhibits an unprecedented in situ redox&#8208;switchable &#8220;ON&#8211;OFF&#8221; of proton transport by regulating its hydrophilicity. This work will contribute to a deeper understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms of NCPs and treatments for cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Universal Metal&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Room Temperature Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;temperature limitations of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) synthesis, primarily thermal aggregation and low metal loadings, are overcome by a novel room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;exchange strategy. We leverage the weak Zn&#8211;N coordination in high&#8208;loading Zn SACs (12.1 wt%, synthesized via controlled ZIF&#8208;8 pyrolysis) as a platform for the facile exchange with a broad range of metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Pt, up to 12.67 wt%) and the creation of multi&#8208;metallic species. This ambient&#8208;temperature approach significantly reduces aggregation, enhancing the exposure of catalytic active sites and delivering superior multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like activities (catalase, peroxidase, oxidase). Our work not only provides a scalable, low&#8208;temperature route to high&#8208;performance SACs but also reveals crucial insights into the stability of SACs under metal&#8208;ion conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Negatively Curved&#160;Diaza&#8208;Octagon Heterocycle Fused with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) skeletons with narrowband emission is crucial for advancing ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Inspired by the aesthetic configuration of negatively curved octagonal rings and the multiple resonance (MR) effect, we designed a novel diaza&#8208;octagon heterocycle fused with PAHs, abbreviated as 8NN, and&#160;its phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative 8NNP. Crystal data and theoretical calculations show that their peripheral PAHs exhibit significant rigidity, while the internal diaza&#8208;octagon ring confers skeleton flexibility and flipping properties. Notably, owing to the strategic embedding and unique bonding form of nitrogen atoms, their MR effect is significantly enhanced. Finally, 8NN and 8NNP achieve deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 408 nm and 411 nm, with remarkably narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 19 nm and 17 nm, respectively, and aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission characteristics. Additionally, to further tune emission range of this new skeleton, boron&#8208;functionalized 8NNB was synthesized, achieving blue emission peaking at 461 nm in toluene, with a FWHM of 31 nm. Finally, the OLEDs based on 8NNP and 8NNB exhibit maximum external quantum efficiencies of 3.47% and 24.24%, with CIE coordinates of (0.172, 0.043) and (0.132, 0.256), respectively. These results validate the rational design of the novel skeleton and facilitate the development of narrowband emission materials.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Dynamic Compensation Strategy Enables Jahn&#8208;Teller Effect Suppression in Zn&#8208;Doped Dual&#8208;Active&#8208;Site CuHCF&#160;Cathodes for High&#8208;Energy and Ultra&#8208;Stable Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

         <dc:description>Copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) with 3D channels and high discharge plateau is widely recognized as a highly promising cathode material for ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) storage. However, the practical application of CuHCF has faced challenges due to limited capacity and structural instability, primarily arising from single active site and serious Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions. Herein, an innovative in&#8208;situ dynamic compensation strategy is reported to prepare Zn&#8208;doping dual&#8208;active&#8208;site CuHCF (ZnCuHCF) as high&#8208;energy and ultra&#8208;stable cathode materials for NH4+ storage. Zn doping induces fission of Cu e2g orbitals, causing lattice to aberrate and reach stable state, while during NH4+ intercalation process, changes mainly in Fe t2g electronic orbitals help maintain stability of ZnCuHCF structure. Consequently, ZnCuHCF in 23 m NH4OTf+0.5 m Zn(OTf)2 aqueous electrolyte exhibits high discharge potential of 0.94 V, high capacity of 121.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 and impressive capacity retention of 92.1% after 10,000 cycles. To highlight, fiber&#8208;shaped aqueous Zn/NH4 hybrid batteries based on ZnCuHCF cathode are successfully constructed, achieving admirable energy density of 85.73 mWh g&#8208;1 and remarkable capacity retention of 85.2% after 12,500 cycles. This work paves the way for designing CuHCF with high capacity, high voltage and robust cycling stability in NH4+ storage for applications in wearable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Assisted PCET and Formation of WIII&#8208;OH in Bis&#8208;dithiolene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The redox non&#8208;innocent nature of dithiolene ligands is well known for stabilizing high&#8208;valent metal ions and facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. Until now, proton reactivity at the dithiolene site has been primarily associated with low&#8208;valent metal centers, as high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;dithiolene complexes were not considered viable for such reactivity. This study introduces high&#8208;valent bis(dithiolene) tungsten (W)&#8208;oxo complexes featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, unveiling a novel proton reduction mechanism mediated by the dithiolene moiety. The process begins with a nucleophilic W&#8208;oxo forming a hydrogen bond, followed by a second hydrogen bond at the dithiolene&#8208;sulfur (S) site. These hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions significantly modulate the molecular orbital energy levels, enabling the WIV&#8594;III reduction at &#8211;1.75 V (Eexp) and allowing, for the first time, the acquisition of an EPR spectrum of a WIII&#8208;OH intermediate species. In contrast, direct electron transfer into the WIV=O state would populate the dithiolene &#960;* orbital, demanding substantially larger energy (Ecal = &#8211;3.45 V). For catalytic proton reduction, the proton transfer through the dithiolene&#8208;S site was identified as the energetically most favorable pathway for generating the WV&#8208;H catalytic species.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Trace&#8208;water&#8208;buffering Frameworks for Efficient Humid Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trace water is usually fatal to gas separation process because the adsorption sites of adsorbents can be readily devitalized under humid conditions. Here, we develop trace&#8208;water&#8208;buffering porous materials with reversible structural transformation triggered by water adsorption/desorption, achieving exceptional methane purification under humid conditions. Despite the different structures, both the hydrated and dehydrated materials show high adsorption capacities for bulky C3H8 and intermediate&#8208;sized C2H6 molecules but low CH4 uptake. Based on these unique properties, the dehydrated material achieves efficient separation of ternary CH4/C2H6/C3H8 mixtures even under 100% relative humidity, delivering high&#8208;purity CH4 (&gt;99.99%) with a remarkable yield of 7.2 mmol&#8729;g&#8722;1. This work sheds light on the designed synthesis of a new generation of microporous materials with reversible water&#8208;buffering performance for gas purification under practically humid conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Delicate Control over Electron Distribution and Water Dissociation Kinetics in Strongly Coupled Ru@NMoC Hybrid Catalyst Realizes Efficient Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delicate control over electron distribution in hybrid catalysts is crucial for improving hydrogen evolution catalysis, which remains an aspirational target in advancing efficient hydrogen production. Herein, we optimize the local electronic structures and balance the reaction steps by incorporating Ru clusters into nitrogen&#8208;doped molybdenum carbide (denoted as Ru@NMoC), addressing performance limitations in alkaline seawater. The Ru@NMoC catalyst demonstrates ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 8, 17, and 20 mV at 10 mA cm&#8315;&#178; in 1 M KOH, 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 M KOH seawater, respectively, significantly outperforming conventional HER catalysts. Operando spectroscopic techniques reveal strong ability for interface water dissociation and stable local charge structure in Ru@NMoC. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that N&#8208;doping of Ru clusters self&#8208;optimizes their electronic states and lowering the energy barrier for water dissociation. Self&#8208;powered H2 production system can be achieved using Zn&#8208;H&#8322;O batteries to drive anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cell, demoinstrating its practicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Base Electrolyte Additive Mediates Interfacial Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes play a crucial role in regulating interfacial chemistry, which is essential for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. Herein, we present an ether&#8208;based electrolyte system incorporating the simplest Grignard reagent, CH3MgCl, as an additive. This additive, endowed with Lewis&#8208;base characteristics, enhances the stability of the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface through bifunctional effects. During Li deposition, CH3Mg+ preferentially adsorbs onto the electrode surface, attracting more anions into the Helmholtz layer. Concurrently, CH3&#8211; creates an electron&#8208;rich environment, facilitating nucleophilic attacks on anions and promoting its reduction to form an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Additionally, Mg2+ undergoes electrodeposition prior to Li+, forming a Li&#8208;Mg alloy with subsequently deposited Li. This process lowers the nucleation barrier for Li deposition, resulting in improved deposition uniformity. Accordingly, the designed electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability for Li anodes in both Li||Cu half&#8208;cells and full&#8208;cells paired with LiFePO4 cathodes. Notably, Li||LiFePO4 batteries using a thin&#8208;film Li anode pre&#8208;deposited on Cu retain ~92.84% of their initial capacity after 300 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of ~99.74%. These findings highlight the critical role of additives in engineering interfacial chemistry and provide a promising strategy for designing advanced electrolytes to improve the cycling performance of Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Methanol&#8208;Facilitated Cascaded Polyolefin Upcycling Enabling the Efficient Generation of High&#8208;Value C9+ Alkylaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the domain of polyolefin chemical recycling and upcycling, the economic viability of the resultant products is of utmost significance.&#160;Polysubstituted alkylbenzenes, especially those within the C9&#8208;C12 alkylaromatic range, with a market price exceeding 1400 USD per ton, represent a high&#8208;value segment with substantial yet unexploited potential for further development. Herein, we present a novel methodology that utilizes methanol as a co&#8208;reactant, with the goal of achieving high&#8208;yield synthesis of polysubstituted alkylbenzenes. Under mild reaction conditions (280 &#176;C), the process attains a 97.8% conversion rate of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE, Mw = 300 kDa) and complete conversion of methanol. Based on the mass of polyethylene, it produces 37 wt % of aromatic products, accompanied by an 87% increase in the mass yield of C9&#8208;C12 alkylbenzenes. Isotope&#8208;labeling experiments conducted with 13CH3OH disclose that methanol acts synergistically to promote carbocation&#8208;mediated C&#8208;C bond cleavage and self&#8208;amplifying Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reactions. This mechanism steers the methylative homologation pathway towards the formation of polymethylated aromatics. The versatility of this approach, which is applicable to a wide variety of polyolefins, holds the promise of opening new pathways for a profitable circular economy in the plastics industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Supported Metallic Pt Single Atoms in Molten NaAlCl4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered widespread attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to their theoretical 100% atomic utilization efficiency. Isolated metal atoms usually exhibit high oxidation states rather than metallic state owing to the coordination with nonmetal atoms in the supports. Despite recent advances in modulating the coordination environments of SACs, achieving metallic state&#8208;dominated SACs remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a new configuration of metallic Pt single atoms (Pt0) anchored on the CeO2 support is constructed by introducing a localized Pt&#8208;Ce metal&#8208;metal coordination at the interface in molten NaAlCl4 environment. The extensive Pt&#8208;Ce bonding and electron transfer from the support to the Pt atoms ensure the metallic nature of isolated Pt atoms. This work opens up a new avenue for constructing metallic single atoms and enriches the SACs chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Sn Catalysts with Build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8722; as Proton Relay for Industrial&#8208;Grade CO2 Reduction at Low Overpotential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R) involves multi&#8208;proton electron transfer, characterized by sluggish reaction kinetics and challenges including high overpotential and subsequently poor stability. Facilitating proton transfer through rational catalyst design to reduce the applied potential enables effective and durable CO2 reduction. Herein,&#160;proton migration promotion strategy to accelerate the CO2 protonation and the overall ECO2R process was explored by Sn&#8208;based cyanamide catalysts. Catalysts with varying [NCN]2&#8211; content, from SnO to Sn2ONCN and SnNCN, were investigated to elucidate&#160;proton transfer mechanism of build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8211;. The reversible structural transformation between [N=C=N]2&#8211; and [N&#8801;C&#8211;N]2&#8211; from [NCN]2&#8211; group achieves an efficient proton relay effect. More efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH is achieved with a higher content of build&#8208;in [NCN]2&#8211; groups in structures. Among these catalysts, SnNCN showed a current density of 450 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 360 mV, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97.4% for HCOO&#8211; production and a peak cathodic energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of 79.6%. Furthermore, it produced formate (HCOO&#8722;) continuously for over 110 h at 200 mA cm&#8722;2 and pure formic acid (HCOOH) solution for 192 h at 135.8 mA cm&#8722;2. This study provides a novel material&#160;and fresh perspective for the design of efficient ECO2R catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C Addition of Glycinate to Nitroalkenes by Pyridoxal/Nd Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct enantioselective&#160;&#945;&#8208;C Michael addition of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to nitroalkenes is a significant organic transformation, which may provide a highly efficient strategy to make bioactive chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. However, it is extremely challenging to achieve this reaction due to the interference of the reactive NH2 group, potential [3+2] cycloaddition side reaction and complicated stereoselective control. Carbonyl catalysis is an effective strategy to activate glycinate by forming an imine to facilitate the conjugate addition. With a pyridoxal/Nd dual catalytic system, direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C conjugate addition of glycinate&#160;to nitroalkenes has been successfully developed for the first time, producing a broad range of chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 98% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, 98% ee). The products can be easily converted into various biologically significant chiral molecules maintaining the same enantiopurity.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly woven artificial solid electrolyte interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems, but they suffer from destructive dendrite growth. Here we integrate cutting&#8208;edge molecular weaving technology into the fabrication of artificial solid electrolyte interphases (ASEI) to realize dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;lasting LMBs. Specifically, weaving polymer chains into a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) plane endows polymer network crystals with high strength and elasticity, and creates angstrom&#8208;level meshes for Li&#8208;ion transport and uniform deposition. As a result, related Li plating experiments remained stable at an unprecedentedly high current density of 5 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, full cells with &#8220;woven&#8221; ASEI exhibited superior long&#8208;term cycling performance compared to existing 2D materials, achieving a capacity retention of 98% over 270 cycles under stringent testing conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Considerations of Ionic Conductive Elastomeric Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Zinc Metal Batteries with High Safety and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8722;ion batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for energy storage, but the severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth have impeded their application. In this study, we developed an Zn2+&#8208;ionic conductive elastomer solid&#8208;state electrolyte through the simultaneous hydrogen&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking between phytic acid (PA) molecules and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The large PA molecules inside the polymer electrolyte are favorable to maintaining stretched conformation of PVA chain and uniform interpenetrating distribution, enhancing the amorphous region of PVA polymer. And the high&#8208;density hydrogen bond network constructed from PVA chains and PA molecules builds a novel transport mode to promote the efficient Zn2+ ion transport, displaying significant ion conductivity of 6.05 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C and a higher transference number of 0.68. The special viscoelasticity of the elastomer facilitates close contact with electrodes, ensuring superior interface compatibility. The assembled Zn symmetric battery exhibits a stable cycle life of 2880 h under 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2/0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2, and the assembled Zn//VO2 full battery still maintains a capacity retention rate of 86.5% at 400 cycles under 1.0 A g&#8722;1. The development of ionic conductive elastomers offers a novel approach to solve the solid&#8208;state interface design of solid&#8208;state Zn&#8722;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoupling the SHG&#8208;Birefringence Trade&#8208;off in UV NLO Materials via Triple&#8208;Control Coordination Engineering: Achieving Synergistic Performance Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decoupling the trade&#8208;off between second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence (&#916;n) while maintaining a wide bandgap (Eg) is a critical challenge in the field of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. In this work, we introduce a novel &#8220;triple&#8208;control coordination engineering&#8221; strategy that successfully addresses this challenge. By integrating dihedral angle modulation, coordination mode switching, and polarizability engineering, we have synthesized three zinc halides&#8212;[(C5H6N2O2)(C5H5N2O2)ZnCl (I), (C5H6N2O2)ZnCl2(II), and (C5H6N2O2)ZnBr2 (III)]&#8212;that exhibit exceptional UV NLO performance. Through dynamic C&#8208;C&#8208;N bond rotation, we achieved precise control over the dihedral angle (81&#176;&#8594;84&#176;), effectively modulating optical anisotropy (&#916;n=0.048&#8208;0.071@1064 nm). pH/temperature&#8208;driven coordination mode evolution enabled complete alignment of the [ZnO2X2] polyhedron, while halogen substitution (Cl &#8594; Br) amplified polarizability gradients. These advancements resulted in a stepwise amplified SHG response (0.4&#8594;3.5&#8594;8.2&#215;KH2PO4, abbreviated as KDP), controlled &#916;n, wide Eg (&gt;5.0 eV), and remarkable thermal stability (&gt;250&#176;C). Notably, (C5H6N2O2)ZnBr2 stands out as the first zinc&#8208;based halide to simultaneously achieve large SHG (&gt;8&#215;KDP), moderate birefringence (0.05&lt;&#916;n&lt;0.1), and a wide bandgap (Eg&gt;5.0 eV). This work not only provides a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach to materials design but also paves the way for the development of UV NLO materials with superior comprehensive performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoacid&#8208;induced Supramolecular Network Disassembly: a Systems Approach to Stimuli&#8208;responsive Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of supramolecular motifs allows the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers whose physical properties can be changed by external triggers that affect the supramolecular binding. However, using this approach to create light&#8208;responsive materials that can be switched under isothermal conditions proves to be challenging. Here, we report a material systems approach to achieve this. Thus, supramolecular polymer networks, in which optically inert ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) groups assemble into reversible cross&#8208;links, are combined with a trigger molecule, the photoacid generator (PAG) 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#173;styryl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;bis(trichloromethyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (MBTT). Model experiments with a fluorescent, self&#8208;reporting UPy motif elucidate the sequence of processes that result from optical triggering, namely acid generation, protonation of UPy groups, and ultimately dissociation of the supramolecular cross&#8208;links. The optically stimulated transformation of gels and rubbery films into viscous liquids was quantitatively monitored by opto&#8208;rheological measurements, showing that the optical stimulation and resultant mechanical responses are intimately coupled. The potential usefulness of this approach to create materials with spatially graded mechanical characteristics and as the basis for debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand adhesives was explored in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments.</dc:description>

Model experiments with a fluorescent, self-reporting UPy motif elucidate the sequence of processes that result from optical triggering, namely acid generation, protonation of UPy groups, and ultimately dissociation of the supramolecular cross-links. The optically stimulated transformation of gels and rubbery films into viscous liquids was quantitatively monitored by opto-rheological measurements, showing that the optical stimulation and resultant mechanical responses are intimately coupled. The potential usefulness of this approach to create materials with spatially graded mechanical characteristics and as the basis for debonding-on-demand adhesives was explored in proof-of-concept experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Nitriles from Dinitrogen via N&#8208;Atom Transfer on Rhenium Nitride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the reduction of rhenium trichloride or oxo dichloride bearing a rigid acriPNP ligand under an atmosphere of N2, we facilely prepared a terminal rhenium nitride [(acriPNP)Re(N)Cl]. Upon reaction with RC(O)X (X&#160;=&#160;OTf, Cl), the nitride directly afforded a wide array of nitriles. Remarkably, these nitrile&#8208;forming protocols concomitantly regenerate the nitride precursors, efficiently completing a two&#8208;step synthetic cycle.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal mediated dinitrogen (N2) splitting into terminal nitrido moiety followed by N&#8208;atom transfer is an attractive strategy for N2 fixation beyond ammonia. While the functionalization of N2&#8208;derived nitride complexes have been widely investigated, their N&#8208;atom transfer reactions to provide N&#8208;containing organic compounds were rarely reported. Herein, we report the synthesis of a rhenium nitride complex [(acriPNP)Re(N)Cl] (acriPNP&#160;=&#160;4,5&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)&#8208;2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;acridin&#8208;10&#8208;ide) via reductive N2 cleavage from either rhenium trichloride or rhenium oxo dichloride complexes. The rhenium nitride exhibits N&#8208;atom transfer reactivity with acyl triflates or chlorides under mild conditions, affording nitriles concomitant with the regeneration of the nitride precursors, rhenium oxo or trichloride complexes, respectively. This overall N&#8208;atom transfer from N2 to acyl electrophiles produced a series of alkyl, aryl, and heterocyclic nitriles, in moderate to good yields, offering a versatile and practical strategy for accessing 15N&#8208;labeled nitriles. This work established a two&#8208;step synthetic cycle, offering valuable insights into transformations of N2 into nitrogenous products.

         <title>Ammonia Hydration in a Cu(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate Framework for Efficient Trace Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)&#8208;pyrazolate framework enables strong NH3 binding and a high adsorption capacity through a reversible hydration mechanism. It combines the merits of strong affinity, facile regeneration, and exceptional alkaline stability, setting a new standard for energy&#8208;efficient trace NH3 removal.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) emissions from industrial and agricultural activities pose severe environmental and health issues. Trace NH3 capture typically relies on chemisorption at Lewis acid sites or physisorption on porous adsorbents but usually suffers from irreversible binding, energy&#8208;intensive regeneration, and structural degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate a new hydration pathway as a promising solution. In a Cu(II)&#8208;pyrazolate framework, BUT&#8208;64(H2O), the bridging water molecules between adjacent Cu(II) ions serve as Br&#248;nsted acid sites to hydrate ammonia, achieving a remarkable NH3 packing density of 0.27&#160;g cm&#8722;3 at 0.1&#160;kPa and an adsorption capacity of 1.51&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 for 1000&#160;ppm NH3 under 80% relative humidity, among the leading adsorbents. The reversible hydration mechanism combines enhanced NH3 affinity with facile regeneration and mitigated moisture co&#8208;adsorption, overcoming the inherent trade&#8208;off. The remarkable alkaline stability of this material also highlights its potential as an energy&#8208;efficient sorbent for trace NH3 capture.

         <title>Nucleophilic Covalent Ligands Enable Simultaneous Surface Reconstruction and Passivation of Colloidal InSb Quantum Dots for Stable Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simultaneous surface reconstruction and passivation strategy is designed for indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) using sulfur&#8208;based nucleophilic covalent ligands. This leads to stable CQD inks and 1450&#160;nm&#8208;operating InSb CQD photodetectors with 28% external quantum efficiency and 300&#160;h operating lifetime.








Abstract
Indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors due to their large Bohr exciton radius and tunable bandgap in the 0.6&#8211;1.3&#160;eV range. However, the formation of metal oxides on InSb surfaces during synthesis impedes charge transport, necessitating CQD resurfacing strategies for integration into photodetectors. Previous reports achieved progress in device efficiency by resurfacing these CQDs with acid&#8208;halide sequential treatments, but the device operating stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a solution&#8208;phase strategy for surface reconstruction and passivation of InSb CQDs using sulfur&#8208;based nucleophilic covalent ligands. We find that short&#8208;chain thiol molecules remove surface metal oxides through nucleophilic attack and enable robust passivation of In and Sb via strong covalent bonds, whereas metal sulfides are less effective at oxide removal and passivation. Consequently, the thiolate&#8208;passivated CQDs exhibit a tenfold decrease in trap state density compared to controls and remain structurally and optically stable for 5 months. We demonstrate InSb CQD SWIR photodetectors that realize a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28% at 1450&#160;nm, with the highest operating stability among reported CQD SWIR photodetectors, retaining 95% of performance following 300&#160;h of biased and illuminated operation.

         <title>Bridging Nano to Micron: Architectural Engineering of Supramolecular Bottlebrushes for Extensively Tunable Structures and Photonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel molecular design enables well&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular surfactants in complex emulsion systems, yielding photonic supraballs with homogeneous porous structures. Precise architectural control allows broad structural tuning from the nano to micron scale, extending the photonic bandgap into the mid&#8208;wave infrared. This insight promises wide&#8208;ranging applications in nanotechnology, photonics, sustainable energy, and advanced biomedical technologies.








Abstract
Supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) offer greater architectural adaptability than covalent BBCPs. However, the dynamic nature of non&#8208;covalent interactions hinders precise control over their chain architecture, resulting in poorly controlled self&#8208;assembly, unpredictable morphologies, and limited utility. Herein, we introduce a novel molecular design for amphiphilic supramolecular BBCPs that overcomes key challenges in the field. The resulting materials exhibit superior thermodynamic stability in weakly polar solvents. This enables the first demonstration of well&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular surfactants within a complex emulsion system, leading to the formation of photonic supraballs with homogenous porous structures. Critically, precise chain architectural engineering enables pore diameter tuning over an unprecedented nanometer&#8208;to&#8208;micrometer range (67&#160;nm&#8211;1.92&#160;&#181;m), significantly surpassing the maximum domain sizes achievable with self&#8208;assembled covalent BBCPs. This extends the photonic bandgap into the mid&#8208;wave infrared range, paving the way for next&#8208;generation materials with potential applications in thermal management.

         <dc:description>Using high&#8208;purity oxygen (O2) for electrofixation would increase the production cost of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) because of requiring complex pre&#8208;treatment procedures. Atmospheric air is abundant source, but the direct air electrofixation has proved to be very challenging, that in common conception against nitrogen (N2) in the system.

         <title>Unveiling Nonadiabatic Pathways in Small Molecule Activation: Dinuclear Uranium&#8208;Mediated H2 and N2 Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonadiabatic effects have been extensively studied in photoexcited processes, but their role in thermal process so far has neither been thoroughly studied nor appreciated, despite their significance. In this work, H2 and N2 activation mediated by a diuranium complex was studied from a nonadiabatic perspective using multi&#8722;configurational ab initio calculations combined with density functional theory. Stepwise electron transfer during the reaction enhances degeneracy between electronic states, enabling state&#8208;to&#8208;state transitions, i.e., spin downshift. The dual functionality of transition states acting as thermodynamic gateways and channels for nonadiabatic transitions was disclosed. The &#960; and &#963; cooperative activation explains the unprecedented reactivity by the diuranium cooperation. Bonding analysis reveals that U5f/6d orbitals mixing with H1s/N2p orbitals afford some degree of covalency to the primarily ionic U&#8208;H/N interactions, with the 6d&#8208;orbitals contributing more pronounced than the 5f&#8208;orbitals in &#963; interactions, while the U&#8208;N &#960; bonding exhibits significant U5f contributions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperstable, Minimal&#8208;Length, and Blunt&#8208;Ended Collagen Heterotrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective assembly of the most stable and the shortest non&#8208;covalently assembled collagen heterotrimer to date was achieved. In addition, the first blunt&#8208;ended collagen triple helix and heterotrimers with defined strand overhangs were developed. The exquisite control over the stability and strand arrangement was enabled by frame&#8208;shifting and tailored aminoproline&#8211;aspartate (X&#8211;D) salt bridges.








Abstract
Most natural collagens are heterotrimers&#8212;triple helices formed from three non&#8208;identical peptide strands. The design of synthetic heterotrimeric collagen is challenging since a mixture of three different peptides can form as many as 27 unique triple helices. Here, we present a general method for the assembly of collagen heterotrimers with a wide range of lengths, thermal stabilities, and strand arrangements driven by complementary interstrand salt bridges between (2S,4S)&#8208;4&#8208;aminoproline and aspartate residues. We show how kinetic trapping of undesired trimers can be overcome by adjusting the annealing conditions to obtain the target heterotrimeric helix selectively under thermodynamic control. The design rules and annealing methods allowed the creation of the most stable supramolecular heterotrimer (32 residues, Tm&#160;=&#160;76&#160;&#176;C) and the shortest stable heterotrimer (17&#160;residues, Tm&#160;=&#160;19&#160;&#176;C) to date. Furthermore, frame&#8208;shifting enabled, for the first time, the creation of a collagen triple helix with blunt ends.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Asymmetric Molecular Engineering Enables Regioregular Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor with High Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;low Energy Loss in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic strategies of the double asymmetric core and symmetric/asymmetric terminal engineering are applied to develop multiple&#8208;asymmetric acceptors. By delicately tuning the number and position of peripheral F and Cl atoms, the regioregular triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary OSCs yield the first&#8208;class efficiency of 19.32% and ultralow nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) among selenium&#8208;substituted acceptors. 








Abstract
Asymmetric molecular engineering is utilized for developing efficient small molecular acceptors (SMAs), whereas adopting multiple asymmetric strategies at the terminals, side chains, and cores of efficient SMAs remains a challenge, and effects on reducing energy loss (Eloss) have been rarely investigation. Herein, four regioregular multiple&#8208;asymmetric SMAs (DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, TASe&#8208;2Cl2F, and TASe&#8208;2F2Cl) are constructed by delicately manipulating the number and position of F and Cl on end groups. Triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl not only exhibits a unique and most compact 3D network crystal stacking structure but also possesses excellent crystallinity and electron mobility in neat film. Surprisingly, the PM1:TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary organic solar cells (OSCs) yield a champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.32%, surpassing the PCE of 18.27%, 17.25%, and 16.30% for DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, and TASe&#8208;2Cl2F&#8208;based devices, which attributed to the optimized blend morphology with proper phase separation and more ordered intermolecular stacking and excellent charge transport. Notably, the champion PCE of 19.32% with ultralow nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) of 0.179&#160;eV marks a record&#8208;breaking result for selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our innovative multiple&#8208;asymmetric molecular engineering of precisely modulating the number and position of fluorinated/chlorinated end groups is an effective strategy for obtaining highly&#8208;efficient and minimal &#916;E3 of selenium&#8208;substituted SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs simultaneously.

First dinitrogen fixation with Sr was achieved using a heterobimetallic approach. This highly reducing product vigorously reacts with Teflon.








Abstract
DFT calculations on &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) complexes with the full series of alkaline&#8208;earth (Ae) metals show that (BDI)AeAe(BDI) complexes of the heavier Ae metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) have long weak Ae&#9472;Ae bonds that are prone to homolytic bond cleavage. However, isolation of (BDI)Sr(&#956;&#8208;N2)Sr(BDI) with a side&#8208;on bridging N22&#8722; dianion should thermodynamically be feasible. Attempts to stabilize such a complex with the super bulky BDI* ligand failed (BDI*&#160;=&#160;HC[(Me)C&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Et2CH&#8208;phenyl). First, N2 fixation with a Sr complex was enabled by a heterobimetallic approach. Reduction of (DIPePNN)Sr with potassium gave (DIPePNN)2Sr2K2(N2) (6&#8208;Sr); DIPePNN&#160;=&#160;DIPePN&#8208;Si(Me)2CH2CH2Si(Me)2&#8208;NDIPeP. A similar Ca product was also isolated (6&#8208;Ca). Crystal structures reveal a N22&#8722; anion with side&#8208;on bonding to Ae2+ and end&#8208;on coordination to K+. DFT calculations and Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules analyses show mainly ionic bonding. Both 6&#8208;Ae complexes are synthons for hitherto unknown (BDI*)AeAe(BDI*) (Ae&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr) and react by releasing N2 and two electrons. Although surprisingly stable in benzene, the reduction of I2 and H2 is facile. Fast reaction with Teflon led to formation of crystalline [(DIPePNN)SrKF]2 (7), which is labile and decomposed to KF and (DIPePNN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of 6&#8208;Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble reducing agents.

Abstract
Catalytic construction of alkyl fluorides through C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming transformations represents a formidable challenge in modern organofluorine chemistry. In this work, we present a decarboxylative monofluoromethylation protocol enabled by synergistic nickel/photoredox dual catalysis for aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives. A structurally diverse array of tertiary, secondary, and primary N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters underwent efficient conversion to their corresponding fluoromethylated products with excellent functional group tolerance (68 examples, up to 91% yield). The methodology's versatility was highlighted through late&#8208;stage monofluoromethylation of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal the involvement of a radical rebound pathway mediated by nickel(III) intermediate, with the homolytic substitution (SH2) process at sterically congested center representing a critical mechanistic distinction from conventional cross&#8208;coupling paradigms.

         <title>A Neutral Single&#8208;Molecule Carrier for Delivery of Phosphonate Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphate/phosphonate&#8208;based drugs (PDs), as multi&#8208;negative, hydrophilic molecules, face the greatest difficulty in diffusion across biological membranes, leading to poor bioavailability. Conventional drug delivery strategies to overcome this issue, including utilizing small&#8208;molecule prodrugs or nanoparticle carriers, often suffer from case&#8208;specific modifications or uncertainties in drug loading. Inspired by the anion coordination chemistry of natural phosphate transporters and artificial anion receptors, here we present the first use of a neutral anion receptor, i.e., bis(tripodal hexaurea) cage 1, as a &#8220;single&#8208;molecule carrier&#8221; for the delivery of PDs into living cells. Cage 1 features advantages of molecular&#8208;level encapsulation, enhanced intracellular accumulation, subcellular targeting, responsive drug release, and broad adaptability. It enhances PD accumulation in tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, enhancing the cellular uptake of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;phosphate/phosphonate substrates by up to 45&#8208;fold via a macropinocytosis&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathway. This work demonstrates the potential of neutral anion receptors to serve as single&#8208;molecule carriers and offers a promising solution for improving PDs bioavailability, advancing the development of antitumor phosphate&#8208;based drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Harmonizing Nanoparticle Exsolution from Ce&#8208;Sm Oxide Matrix for Stable Methane Dry Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst deactivation hinders the application of high&#8208;temperature catalysis such as methane dry reforming, where nanoparticle exsolution will likely clear the path. However, the harsh reaction conditions often easily unbalance the exsolution degree, leading to either sintering or insufficient exsolution of metal nanoparticles. Here, we achieve the fabrication of highly dispersed yet exposed Rh nanoparticles exsolved from the Ce&#8208;Sm oxide matrix. Starting from examining the metal&#8208;support interaction of Rh&#8208;CeO2 and Rh&#8208;Sm2O3, the exsolution dynamics of Rh nanoparticles are studied via multiple in&#8208;situ techniques. Rapid exsolution from CeO2 induces Rh sintering and catalytic deactivation, while sluggish exsolution from Sm2O3 results in Rh encapsulation with poor activity. The balanced metal&#8208;support interaction harmonizes the exsolution of Rh nanoparticles from the Ce&#8208;Sm oxide matrix, fabricating an anti&#8208;sintering and coke&#8208;resistant catalyst for methane dry reforming. This work provides insights into the development of catalysts with structural robustness, where the essence lies in the engineering of nanoparticle exsolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Indolocarbazole&#8208;Bridged Multiple Resonance Emitter through Steric Pre&#8208;Substitution for Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE over 40%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric pre&#8208;substitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W&#8208;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2 and 5,000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively. This work establishes a pre&#8208;substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.</dc:description>

However, methods to introduce selenium atoms into polymers remain limited, particularly for approaches that directly utilize elemental selenium. This work presents a novel copolymerization of gaseous carbon monoxide (CO), solid Se powder, and liquid oxetane (OX) to synthesize Se&#8208;containing polymers with tunable structure, using commercially available alkyl borane and organic bases as the binary metal&#8208;free catalyst system. The polymerization process includes two steps: the reduction of CO and Se to form COSe, and alternating copolymerization of COSe with OX. The O/Se exchange reaction (O/Se ER) was discovered during the polymerization, which can alter the polymer structure. The O/Se ER could be significantly suppressed by the binary organocatalyst system at 60&#176;C, affording well&#8208;defined poly(selenocarbonate) in a fast and selective manner. The poly(selenocarbonate) is semi&#8208;crystalline exhibiting a melting temperature of 116&#176;C, a number&#8208;average molecular weight of 39 kDa, a tensile strength of 5.0&#177;0.4 MPa, and an elongation of 5.5&#177;0.5%. Interestingly, the poly(selenocarbonate) could be completely converted into the poly(selenoether) by utilizing the O/Se ER, i.e., decarboxylation in the presence of organic bases at high temperatures. This work provides an efficient synthetic method for synthesizing Se&#8208;containing polymers from readily available monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Change in a Four&#8208;Tetrad DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex upon Intercalation of a Small&#8208;Molecule Ligand PyDH2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are non&#8208;canonical DNA structures implicated in a number of biological processes. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can alter stability and folding of G4s, which can potentially be exploited for therapeutic purposes. In this work, we investigate the interaction of telomeric DNA fragment from Tetrahymena thermophila (TET25, 5&#8242;&#8208;G(TTGGGG)4&#8208;3&#8242;) with a G4 ligand PyDH2 belonging to the bisquinolinium family. When alone, TET25 adopts a mixture of three conformations, with the most abundant being a four&#8208;tetrad hybrid G4. In the presence of PyDH2, surprisingly, TET25 folds into an antiparallel chair G4, with PyDH2 intercalated between G&#8208;tetrads 2 and 3, according to our crystal structure. The structure represents the second example, and the first crystallo&#173;graphic evidence, of ligand intercalation into a G4. In solution, the interaction of PyDH2 and TET25 leads to a number of complexes differing by G4 topology and binding stoichiometry, strong stabilization of G4 (&#8710;Tm = 12.4 &#176;C in the presence of one equiv. of PyDH2) and large hysteresis of &#8764; 10 &#176;C, suggesting that ligand binding and G4 folding processes are complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Material Recycling/Upcycling of Polyamide Waste Enabled by Cosolvent&#8208;Tunable Dissolution Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyamides (PAs, nylons) are a ubiquitous class of high&#8208;performance plastics used extensively in a wide range of applications. Their high resistance to many common solvents and tendency to hydrolyze in strong acids or bases creates a major hurdle to low&#8208;emissions material recycling (i.e., resource separation and recovery). In the present study, the first detailed investigation into the molecular mechanisms of polyamide dissolution, we show that introducing a weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonding cosolvent into formic acid can effectively tune the solvent&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;polymer interactions, drastically accelerates the room&#8208;temperature dissolution kinetics of common (short&#8208;chain) polyamides such as PA6 and PA66, as well as long&#8208;chain and semi&#8208;aromatic varieties. The recovered polymers show no change in their chemical structures or properties, and sufficient selectivity allows for fillers such as short and long fibers, inorganic nanoparticles, metals, and other mixed polymer phases to be recovered at high efficiency (&gt;95%) along with recirculation of all solvents (&gt;98%). This cosolvent&#8208;enabled approach has the potential to make polyamide recycling more sustainable and economical by reducing the energy input and CO2 emissions required to separate and recover the various constituent materials from automotive and electrical components, textiles, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiotemplated Polyketide Chain Fusion and Reductive Cyclization Build the Reactive Butenolide Core of Malleicyprol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Malleicyprol, a virulence factor of notorious animal and human pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group, features a molecular cyclopropanol warhead linked to a reactive butenolide core. Biosynthetic considerations suggested that this heterocycle was formed by the merger of two individual polyketide chains, but the precise mechanism has remained elusive. By combining chemical synthesis, complete in vitro reconstitution of the biotransformation, and mutational analysis, we show that two individually generated polyketide chains are joined by a non&#8208;canonical condensation domain of the PKS&#8208;NRPS hybrid synthetase BurF, which forms an ester bond. By mutagenesis, biochemical assays, and trapping of the aldehyde generated from a substrate surrogate, we found that the terminal reductase domain mediates a reductive chain release with concomitant ring formation. The feasibility of the proposed Knoevenagel&#8208;type intramolecular cyclization into the butenolide moiety was confirmed by a biomimetic synthesis of malleicyprol. The elucidation of the unprecedented thiotemplated butenolide biosynthesis by head&#8208;to&#8208;head fusion of two polyketide chains not only expands the synthetic biology toolbox but may also inspire the development of anti&#8208;virulence strategies against BP pathogen infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Induced Solid&#8208;like Condensates Formation of Engineered Peptide in Living Cells for Prostate Cancer Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes the rational design and synthesis of Hepsin&#8208;recognized amphiphilic branched peptides (DMN&#8208;SIPL) that can form solid condensates through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon enzymatic reaction. The peptide forms solid&#8208;like condensates both in vitro and in living cells, triggered by type&#8208;II membrane&#8208;associated serine peptidase, Hepsin, whose overexpression determines prostate cancer progression. Specifically, integrating self&#8208;assembly, Hepsin hydrolysis, and Hepsin binding domain generates a branched substrate that acts a precursor for enzyme induced LLPS. Upon binding Hepsin on the cell membrane, DMN&#8208;SIPL forms condensates initiated by Hepsin induced self&#8208;assembly. The prostate cancer cells then uptake these condensates via lipid raft&#8208;mediated endocytosis. The entrapped Hepsin in the condensates further hydrolyze the DMN&#8208;SIPL to stabilize the intracellular condensates. Structure activity relationship reveals the importance of enzyme binding motif, enzyme recognized motif, and the self&#8208;assembly motif. Mechanistic studies indicate that the resulting solid&#8208;like condensates modulate cancer cell metabolism by inhibiting Hepsin upstream protein activation and downstream signal transduction, ultimately inducing cancer cell growth inhibition selectively. As a first example, this work investigates enzymatic LLPS condensates formation in living cells, paving the way to generate functional synthetic biomolecular condensates through LLPS for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs), with their remarkable energy density, represent a pivotal advancement in energy storage technology. However, conventional Li&#8208;O2 batteries face significant obstacles. This study introduces polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;based polymer membranes and self&#8208;supporting cathodes fabricated via electrospinning and thermal treatment. By incorporating poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)&#8208;functionalized cathodes through electrostatic adsorption, a polymeric electrolyte&#8208;functional integrated linkage structure was developed. This design facilitates adaptive interface modulation, creating a stable low&#8208;impedance interface between the electrolyte and cathode while enabling efficient ion and electron transport. The resulting solid&#8208;state LOBs (SSLOBs) demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a specific capacity of 8600 mAh g&#8722;1 and a cycling lifespan of 191 cycles. The adaptive interface provides abundant reaction sites, promoting uniform ring&#8208;like discharge product growth and reversible decomposition. Additionally, flexible batteries incorporating this structure exhibit outstanding resilience to bending deformation. These advancements highlight the transformative potential of Li&#8208;O2 batteries, offering promising directions for future energy storage research.</dc:description>

Herein, starting from rational synthesis of visible light/pH&#8208;responsive integrated azobenzene monomer, side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers was elaborately crafted using a moderate epoxy&#8208;amino click&#8208;polycondensation. Followed by subsequent solution self&#8208;assembly, dual&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a diameter of ~253 nm and a vesicular thickness of ~2.1 nm were subtly produced based on the pendant hydrophobic conjugate stacking mechanism. The photoisomerization of azobenzene units and protonation of tertiary amines within UTPSs were accountable for the visible light&#8208; or pH&#8208;triggered reversible shape and physicochemical transitions (i.e., color, size, diameter, vesicular thickness, zeta potential, fluorescent intensity) as well as repeatable acidochromism from yellow to pink and recyclable fluorochromism, respectively. Benefiting from these attractive traits, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept 2D Quick Response code was meticulously crafted using the stimuli&#8208;chromic UTPSs into patterning lithography, showcasing a multi&#8208;level decryption, favorable reversibility, and preferable recyclability for advanced information security. Our work provides innovative guidelines for the development of dual&#8208;responsive UTPSs with multiple stimuli&#8208;chromism merits for the potential of complex information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Blocky Selective Post&#8208;Polymerization C&#8211;H Functionalization of Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H functionalization of commodity polyolefins affords functional materials derived from a high&#8208;volume, low&#8208;cost resource. However, current post&#8208;polymerization modification strategies result in randomly distributed functionalization along the length of the polymer backbone, which has a negative impact on the crystallinity of the resultant polymers, and thus the thermomechanical properties. Here, we demonstrate an amidyl radical mediated C&#8211;H functionalization of polyolefins to access blocky microstructures, which exhibit a higher crystalline fraction, larger crystallite size, and improved mechanical properties compared to their randomly functionalized analogues. Taking inspiration from the site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H functionalization of small molecules, we leverage the steric protection provided by crystallites and target polymer functionalization to amorphous domains in a semicrystalline polyolefin gel. The beneficial outcomes of blocky functionalization are independent of the identity of the pendant functional group that is installed through functionalization. The decoupling of functional group incorporation and crystallinity highlights the promise in accessing non&#8208;random microstructures through selective functionalization to circumvent traditional tradeoffs in post&#8208;polymerization modification, with potential impact in advanced materials and upcycling plastic waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Driven Bioactive Indazole Frameworks: Photoinitiated Demethylation&#8208;Aromatization Synthesis and Biosensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indazole frameworks are pivotal in medicinal chemistry and fluorescent conjugate design. Herein, we reported a photochemical strategy enabling efficient N&#8208;demethylation and aromatic cyclization of N&#8208;methyl amines via UV&#8208;induced nitroso intermediates, offering an environmentally benign route to structurally diverse 2H&#8208;indazole scaffolds. Diverging from conventional methods, this protocol demonstrates exceptional substrate compatibility with various alkyl/aryl amines, facilitating streamlined assembly of functionalized 2H&#8208;indazole modules. The methodology has been successfully applied to synthesize modified drugs and tumour&#8208;specific fluorescent probes targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes. Preliminary evaluations of physiological toxicity and cellular fluorescence imaging highlight their biomedical potential, establishing these strategies as potential tools for pharmacological development and bioimaging research.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Durable and Sustainable Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries via Molecularly Engineered Polyiodide Reservoirs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for safe and sustainable energy storage but are hindered by polyiodide shuttling, leading to rapid capacity decay and limited cyclability. In this work, we propose a &#8220;polyiodide reservoirs&#8221; concept, utilizing iodophilic covalent organic cages to confine polyiodide through multiple noncovalent interactions. By precisely engineering the nitrogen&#8208;active site densities around three&#8208;dimensional cavities, these cages evolve from open to near&#8208;enclosed structure, achieving molecular&#8208;level polyiodide entrapment. The optimized superphane cage (18 N&#8208;active sites) enables a ZIB with 90.1% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 5 C, even under extreme conditions (58.9 wt% iodine content within the cage and an iodine area loading of 3.7 mg cm&#8722;2 in the cathode). Importantly, the cage&#8217;s solubility&#8208;driven regeneration capability retains 85.4% initial capacity over three reuse cycles without stability compromise. This work establishes covalent organic superphanes as a transformative platform for long&#8208;life ZIBs, offering a dual solution to shuttle suppression and electrode sustainability through structural confinement and dynamic recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Coulombic Efficiency of Lithium Metal Anodes by Screening Electrolyte Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coulombic efficiency (CE) is a quantifiable indicator for the reversibility of lithium metal anodes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the quantitative relationship between CE and electrolyte properties has yet to be established, impeding rational electrolyte design. Herein, an interpretable model for estimating CE based on data&#8208;driven insights of electrolyte properties is proposed. Hydrogenbond acceptor basicity (&#946;) and the energy level gap between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap) of solvents are identified as the top two parameters impacting CE by machine learning. &#946; and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap of solvents govern anode interphase chemistry. A regression model is further proposed to estimate the CE based on &#946; and HOMOLUMO gap. Using the new solvent screened by above regression model, the Li metal anode in the pouch cell with an energy density of 418 Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 achieves the highest CE of 99.2%, which is much larger than previous CE ranging from 70&#8211;98.5%. This work provides a reliable interpretable quantitative model for rational electrolyte design.</dc:description>

         <title>Concurrent Production of Glycolic Acid via Anode Valorization of Plastic Paired with Cathode Upcycling of Biomass Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived (PET&#8208;derived) ethylene glycol (EG) into valuable chemicals, such as glycolic acid (GA), provides a sustainable route for reclaiming the carbon resource in plastic wastes. However, valorization of EG to GA is realized solely via anodic oxidation, which is typically accompanied with the generation of low&#8208;value hydrogen at cathode. Here, we develop a GA production system that combines anodic and cathodic GA production via oxidation of PET&#8208;derived EG paired with reduction of biomass&#8208;derived oxalic acid, which is made possible by the discovery of robust PdBi alloy anode and earth&#8208;abundant TiO2 cathode. Building on the theoretical understanding and experimental demonstration of anti&#8208;CO poisoning on the PdBi anode and temperature&#8208;dependent GA electrosynthesis on the TiO2 cathode, our integrated electrochemical system achieves a total Faradaic efficiency of 182% for GA production. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrochemical coupling strategy paves a way for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of surplus plastic&#8208;/biomass&#8208;derived feedstocks via renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;driven electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Promiscuity in Cobalt Mediated CO2 Reduction Reaction: One&#8208; versus Two&#8208;Electron Reduction Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We compare the carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) activity and selectivity of the complexes [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ and [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+, which contain two 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine chelating groups linked by &#8208;NH or &#8208;NCH3 moieties, respectively. Whereas [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ forms CO under electrocatalytic conditions in presence of phenol (PhOH) with high selectivity, [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+ shows higher hydrogen evolution reaction activity and low selectivity for CO production. The molecular origin of the difference in product selectivity was analysed based on spectroscopic trapping of reactive intermediates and detailed kinetic and theoretical studies. A difference in mechanism is evident; whereas an efficient proton relay mediated by the &#8208;NH group initiates a two&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 in case of [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+, one&#8208;electron chemistry prevails for [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+. Under stopped&#8208;flow conditions, we trapped the one&#8208;electron reduced CO2 radical anion in [(Mebbpya)CoI(CO2&#8208;&#8226;)], which forms oxalate under aprotic conditions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We compare the carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) activity and selectivity of the complexes [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ and [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+, which contain two 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine chelating groups linked by -NH or -NCH3 moieties, respectively. Whereas [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+ forms CO under electrocatalytic conditions in presence of phenol (PhOH) with high selectivity, [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+ shows higher hydrogen evolution reaction activity and low selectivity for CO production. The molecular origin of the difference in product selectivity was analysed based on spectroscopic trapping of reactive intermediates and detailed kinetic and theoretical studies. A difference in mechanism is evident; whereas an efficient proton relay mediated by the -NH group initiates a two-electron reduction of CO2 in case of [(Hbbpya)CoII]2+, one-electron chemistry prevails for [(Mebbpya)CoII]2+. Under stopped-flow conditions, we trapped the one-electron reduced CO2 radical anion in [(Mebbpya)CoI(CO2-&#8226;)], which forms oxalate under aprotic conditions. This study underlines the importance of subtle electronic and protonation changes in controlling the CO2RR product selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lignin Dissolution and Direct Ultrasmall&#8208;Lignin&#8208;Nanoparticle Formation in Acidic and Alkaline Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Molecular&#8208;Level Insight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have demonstrated significant potential in lignin processing, their influence on molecular stacking and conformational evolution during lignin dissolution and nanoparticle formation remains insufficiently understood. Here, we develop a green, straightforward, and single&#8208;step approach to produce self&#8208;assembled lignin nanoparticles (LNPs). The LNPs obtained using the acidic DES method exhibited a great size reduction, with an average size approximately one&#8208;ninth of that produced by conventional solvent&#8208;exchange methods. To gain mechanistic insights into the reconstruction, dissolution, and self&#8208;assembly of lignin in DESs, we integrate structural characterization with molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we simulate the dynamic behavior and configurational states of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass lignin models (4,182 g/mol) in aqueous solvent systems. The results reveal the critical role of molecular structure, intra/intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, stacked conformations, solvent&#8208;specific effects in determining the size and compactness of LNPs. Notably, the DES stabilizes lateral&#8208;shifted configurations, promoting the formation of small and compact LNPs. In contrast, the tetrahydrofuran/H2O solvent system favors offset&#8208;stacked configurations and hydrophobic interactions, leading to larger, spherical LNPs. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of LNP formation using DESs, demonstrating the possibility of regulating and controlling lignin assemblies through solvent parameters.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate Preorganization within Photoactive Pt12L24&#160;Nanospheres for Accelerated Decarboxylation Catalysis at Low Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis with short&#8208;excited state lifetimes or in dilute conditions is challenging because the photochemical mechanism relies on collisions within the excited state of the photocatalyst. In this work, we use substrate preorganization within Pt12L24&#160;nanospheres as strategy to perform photoredox catalysis at low concentrations. We show that Pt12L24&#160;nanospheres are efficient photocatalysts for the decarboxylative oxygenation reaction. Nanospheres endo&#8208;functionalized with guanidinium groups (Pt12LGua24) pre&#8208;organize the substrate, which increases the catalytic turnover frequency by two orders of magnitude. Crucially, this preorganization ensures that Pt&#173;12LGua24&#160;retains its photocatalytic activity at extremely low concentrations (2 &#956;M). This strategy thus overcomes the concentration limitations of photoredox catalysis and may be interesting for applications in dilute environments such as water purification and cellular photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomalous Piezochromic Luminescence in Covalent Triazine Frameworks via Molecular Insertion: Blue&#8208;Shifted and Enhanced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic materials typically exhibit pressure&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifted&#160;and quenched emission due to enhanced intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and molecular planarization. Consequently, achieving blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains a significant&#160;challenge. Here, we report anomalous piezochromic luminescence&#160;in covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) via&#160;molecular insertion. Upon introducing methanol into the nanopores of CTFs, a blue&#8208;shift in emission from 507.0 to 485.5 nm, accompanied by enhanced intensity, is observed under compression up to 1.22&#160;GPa, distinctly contrasting the red&#8208;shifted and quenched emission typically observed in compressed pristine CTFs and other crystalline porous materials (CPMs).&#160;Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal&#160;that methanol can weaken the interlayer &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and intralayer conjugation of CTFs by forming weak interactions with CTFs, such as hydrogen bonding, to realize the interlayer slip and intralayer distortions of CTFs, which results in the blue&#8208;shifted&#160;and enhanced emission. This strategy also proves effective with other molecular insertions, offering a general approach to achieving anomalous piezochromic luminescence in CTFs. Our findings establish molecular insertion as a robust method for engineering pressure&#8208;responsive luminescent materials and provide valuable insights for the design of advanced optical sensors and stimuli&#8208;responsive systems.</dc:description>

In this process, Csp3&#8208;enriched 4&#8208;alkylated 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenones are obtained with commendable functionality tolerance.

         <title>A universal P&#8208;type heterointerface for efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverted perovskite solar cells with self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high efficiency and long&#8208;term operational stability. However, the hole extraction at the SAMs/perovskite interface is generally less efficient with respect to the electron extraction. Here, we report the construction of a universal P&#8208;type heterointerface between SAMs and perovskite with heterocyclic dipolar compounds imidazole hydroiodide (ImHI). We found that the strong interaction by hydrogen bonds together with formative dipole layer were observed between ImHI and perovskite. This allows more P&#8208;type contacts with relatively small energy barriers at SAMs/perovskite heterointerfaces by downshifting the Fermi level, reducing the energy mismatch and facilitating the hole extraction. The P&#8208;type contact enhancement was further confirmed by a series of SAMs at the perovskite buried interface. As a result, a best&#8208;performing solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.05% was achieved, with maintaining 96% of the initial efficiency for 2000 h under nitrogen&#8208;filled glove box, 94% of the initial efficiency for 800 h at 55&#176;C/55% RH, and 86% of the initial efficiency for 1000 h under continuous light stress at maximum power point.</dc:description>

In their Research Article (e202500957), Lin Qiu and co&#8208;workers discover an intriguing Al2O3 nanopore confinement space effect that synchronously enhances the thermal conductivity and Young's modulus of phase change materials, as corroborated by their nanometer resolution thermal and mechanical mapping technique called 3&#969;&#8208;SThM. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the underlying reason is the shortening of the hydrogen bond that enhances the heat conduction and resistance to deformation.

         <dc:description>
Accelerated microbial corrosion and destruction of passive films on stainless steel caused by electroactive Shewanella oneidensis biofilms are reported by Dake Xu et al in their Research Article (e202425220). The changes in surface properties were verified due to the accelerated electrochemical reactions mediated by extracellular electron transfer (EET). Cytochrome proteins and electron mediators accelerate EET process and redox reactions at the interface between electroactive bacterial biofilm and 316L stainless steel.

The mechanism by which surface cation vacancies induce high activity of metastable lattice oxygen is reported by Yao Xiao, Xiaoxian Zhao, Weibo Hua, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202419664). The grasping of the robotic arm is used to metaphorically describe the directional extraction of Li+ on the surface by dilute acid. The ripples spreading layer by layer from the center outward in a circular ring shape metaphorically represent the redistribution of electrons.

         <title>Chemical Bonds Containing Hydrogen: Choices for Hydrogen Carriers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen carriers utilizing B&#9472;H, C&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, and O&#9472;H bonds are evaluated for their potential in hydrogen storage and release. Key candidates such as methanol, ammonia, and formic acid are examined with a focus on critical factors influencing performance, including the nature of chemical bonds, reaction pathways, and catalytic processes. Both fundamental and applied research efforts are crucial to advancing hydrogen carrier technologies for large&#8208;scale hydrogen deployment. 








Abstract
Compounds containing B&#9472;H, C&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, or O&#9472;H bonds with high hydrogen content have been extensively studied as potential hydrogen carriers. Their hydrogen storage performance is largely determined by the nature of these bonds, decomposition pathways, and the properties of the dehydrogenation products. Among these compounds, methanol, cyclohexane, and ammonia stand out due to their low costs and established infrastructure, making them promising hydrogen carriers for large&#8208;scale storage and transport. They offer viable pathways for decarbonizing society by enabling hydrogen to serve as a clean energy source. However, several challenges persist, including the high temperatures required for (de)hydrogenation, slow kinetics, and the reliance on costly catalysts. To address these issues, strategies such as chemical modification and catalyst development are being pursued to improve hydrogen cycling performance. This review highlights recent progress in hydrogen carriers with B&#9472;H, C&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, or O&#9472;H bonds. It examines the fundamental characteristics of these bonds and carriers, as well as advances in catalyst development. Our objective is to offer a comprehensive understanding of current state of hydrogen carriers and identify future research directions, such as molecular modification and system optimization. Innovations in these areas are crucial to advance hydrogen storage technologies for a large&#8208;scale hydrogen deployment.

Their hydrogen storage performance is largely determined by the nature of these bonds, decomposition pathways, and the properties of the dehydrogenation products. Among these compounds, methanol, cyclohexane, and ammonia stand out due to their low costs and established infrastructure, making them promising hydrogen carriers for large-scale storage and transport. They offer viable pathways for decarbonizing society by enabling hydrogen to serve as a clean energy source. However, several challenges persist, including the high temperatures required for (de)hydrogenation, slow kinetics, and the reliance on costly catalysts. To address these issues, strategies such as chemical modification and catalyst development are being pursued to improve hydrogen cycling performance. This review highlights recent progress in hydrogen carriers with B&#9472;H, C&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, or O&#9472;H bonds. It examines the fundamental characteristics of these bonds and carriers, as well as advances in catalyst development. Our objective is to offer a comprehensive understanding of current state of hydrogen carriers and identify future research directions, such as molecular modification and system optimization. Innovations in these areas are crucial to advance hydrogen storage technologies for a large-scale hydrogen deployment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Weak Attractive Noncovalent Interactions in Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of utilizing weak attractive noncovalent interactions, including only CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N interactions, has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the activity and/or enantioselectivity of metal catalysts in asymmetric hydrogenations, particularly for low&#8208;activity Earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts. Among these interactions, the weakest CH&#8943;HC interactions, when present in multiple instances, have been shown to exert a significant synergistic effect. This review summarizes recent progress in this field and provides a brief outlook on its future development.








Abstract
Weak attractive noncovalent interactions, specifically CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N contacts, between catalysts and substrates have recently gained renewed attention in asymmetric hydrogenations, despite their historical underappreciation due to challenges in detection. Emerging evidence underscores the significant role of these interactions in improving reactivity and/or enantioselectivity, particularly in sustainable catalytic systems that utilize Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. This minireview summarizes advancements in asymmetric hydrogenations catalyzed by both noble and Earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes under an H&#8322; atmosphere, with a focus on the roles of CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N noncovalent interactions in improving reactivity and/or enantioselectivity. Taking into account the weak attractive character of these noncovalent interactions, it is expected to help the design of novel chiral transition metal catalysts and develop more efficient asymmetric hydrogenation systems for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of diverse chiral compounds.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Site Distance Effect in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inter&#8208;site distance effects (ISDE) challenge classical models in heterogeneous catalysis by revealing long&#8208;range interactions between adjacent nonbonded sites. This work reviews the synthetic strategies to regulate inter&#8208;site distances, applications of ISDE, relevant characterization, and computational methods, offering insights to unlock efficiency bottlenecks in electrocatalysts for energy and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
The inter&#8208;site distance effect (ISDE) has gained significant attention in heterogeneous catalysis, challenging classical models that treat adjacent nonbonded sites as isolated. Recent studies demonstrate that these sites can exhibit long&#8208;range cooperative interactions, enhancing reaction efficiencies. Fully leveraging the ISDE to overcome limitations in site reactivity requires a multidisciplinary approach and advanced techniques. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ISDE in electrocatalysis, starting with strategies for synthesizing materials with tunable inter&#8208;site distances. It examines ISDE across various catalyst models, including monometallic and heteronuclear atomic sites, active sites within clusters, and the lattice of nanocatalysts, focusing on their electronic structures, spatial geometries, and synergistic interactions. Advanced characterization and computational methods are highlighted as essential for identifying inter&#8208;site structures and distances, providing a systematic framework for understanding ISDE's role in electrocatalysis. The review also proposes best practices for studying ISDE, addressing current challenges and offering future perspectives. These insights aim to inform the design of highly efficient catalysts, enhance the understanding of catalytic mechanisms, and contribute to the development of more efficient energy conversion technologies, providing a foundation for further research into optimizing electrocatalysts.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescent Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared chemiluminescent probes with the advantages of deep&#8208;tissue permeability, free autofluorescence, and structural diversity have attracted growing attention for disease theranostics. This review discusses the molecular design strategies for these probes, with the highlight of their biomarker activity for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Molecular chemiluminescence probes with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offer promising benefits in deciphering complex pathological processes in a living system, as NIR chemiluminescence minimizes autofluorescence, enhances deep&#8208;tissue penetration, and improves signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Molecular engineering using single&#8208;luminophore design and dual&#8208;luminophore design with intramolecular energy transfer provides ways to develop conventional chemiluminophore scaffolds into NIR chemiluminescence probes with ideal chemiluminescence quantum yield and half&#8208;life. By virtue of the structural diversity, 1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;based NIR chemiluminophores with biomarker activity have been developed. This review summarizes the molecular design strategies of NIR chemiluminescence theranostic probes (NCTPs), followed by introducing activatable NCTPs with their biomedical applications for disease theranostics. Lastly, future perspectives and potential challenges of NIR chemiluminescence imaging in preclinical research and clinical translational potential are discussed.

         <title>Stereochemistry at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level: From Monitoring to Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines major advances in stereochemistry, emphasizing real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule isomerization tracking via scanning probe microscopies and molecular junctions, alongside dynamic control strategies using light, electricity, and force. It explores the chirality from detection to manipulation, highlights nanotechnology&#8208;integrated molecular devices, and predicts critical challenges that bridge basic research with practical applications.








Abstract
Traditional stereochemistry analysis is crucial for understanding the molecular behavior, but relies on measurements that encompass multiple molecules and obscure individual molecular dynamics. Single&#8208;molecule techniques enable real&#8208;time tracking of stereochemical transformations. These techniques include electrical methods (such as scanning probe microscopy, single&#8208;molecule junction techniques, and nanopore technology) and non&#8208;electrical approaches (such as circular dichroism spectroscopy and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy). This review highlights recent advances in monitoring and regulation of stereochemical properties at the single&#8208;molecule level. Techniques that bridge macroscopic observations with molecular&#8208;scale dynamics are emphasized. Key isomerization phenomena (constitutional, configurational, and conformational isomerizations) are explored to demonstrate how light, electric field, and mechanical force regulate molecular states. The use of chiral molecules in optical tweezers, chiral&#8208;modified scanning tunneling microscopies, and graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule junctions to leverage the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect for enantiomer discrimination and manipulation is highlighted. Despite progress in this field, challenges persist in resolving ultrafast isomerization pathways, understanding chiral origin mechanisms, and integrating single&#8208;molecule devices. Emerging strategies combining multimodal stimuli, machine learning, and nanofabrication are promising for advancing stereochemical research and applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This work underscores the transformative potential of single&#8208;molecule techniques in unveiling fundamental chemical dynamics and designing functional molecular systems.

         <title>Ultrarobust, Stretchable, and Highly Elastic Supramolecular Elastomer with Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Interactions via sp2 Hybridized Boron&#8208;Urethane Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear polyurethane elastomers prepared with phenylboronic acid as a chain extender exhibit excellent mechanical properties, such as high mechanical strength (63.9&#160;MPa), high toughness (442.2 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3), and rapid recovery (stretching up to 16 times the original length), due to the enhanced hydrogen bonding between segments caused by the sp2 plane structure of boron atoms.








Abstract
Elastomers are omnipresent in everyday life and industry, yet the development of an elastomer with both superb stress and toughness presents a prodigious challenge. In this report, a high&#8208;strength, tough, and high&#8208;elastic elastomer derived from sp2 hybrid orbitals of phenylboronic acid was designed. The spatial conformation of network becomes significantly more compact due to the sp2 hybridization of boron. This enhances supramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, resulting in a marked improvement in the material's mechanical properties. Notably, the hydrogen bonding energy in the polyurethane chain segments enhanced by 37%. The robust hydrogen bonding imparts the elastomer with super high true stress (1.30&#160;GPa), superior toughness (442.2 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3), and super puncture resistance strength of 167.8&#183;N&#183;mm&#8722;1. The material exhibited excellent fatigue resistance during continuous tensile cycles, while the irreversible deformation disappeared after standing at room temperature. Moreover, the elastomer bespeaks extraordinary elastic restorability, swiftly reverting to its primitive length after being extended to 16 times. This work provides a strategy that the mechanical properties of materials can be enhanced and toughened by utilizing spatial conformational changes in intermolecular interactions.

         <title>Uncovering Chemical Principles Governing Nanophase Formation in Ternary Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report an experimental investigation of how the types of intermolecular interactions present between systematically varying pairs of cosolvents and oils bias the formation of thermodynamically stable nanophases when mixed with water. We focus on the role of different functional groups or chemical characteristics (alcohols, carboxylic acids, amides, ketones, aldehydes, and aromaticity) that are present in the oil, cosolvent, or both.








Abstract
Nanoscopic phases, such as oil&#8208;enriched pockets dispersed in water, have been observed in ternary mixtures of oil, water, and cosolvent in the absence of surfactants. Such nanophases are found across a portion of compositions within the single&#8208;phase region of the ternary phase diagram. However, the principles governing the formation of nanophases under certain conditions but not others, regarding both volumetric and chemical makeup, are unclear. Here, the nanophase behavior of ternary mixtures of water with a suite of cosolvents and oils containing strategically chosen functional groups is systematically analyzed to probe the role of intermolecular interactions. Dynamic light scattering is used to quantify the nanophase structure. It was found that stronger classes of intermolecular interactions such as H&#8208;bonding or n&#8211;&#928;* interactions between oil and cosolvent notably contribute to forming thermodynamically stable nanophases. Ternary mixtures in which the oil has only van der Waals interactions with the water and cosolvent do not stabilize nanophases detectable by dynamic light scattering. Aromatic groups favor nanophase formation. The most prominent structuring (highest number and largest sizes of nanophases) is found in water&#8208;rich compositions near the miscibility gap. This experimental study provides chemical insight into the chemical formulation of ternary solvent mixtures favoring nanophase formation.

         <title>Electrophotocatalysis for Reductive Defluorination of PTFE and PFASs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supercapacitor&#8208;electrophotocatalysis system combining electrical and photochemical energy to achieve efficient defluorination of PTFE at low temperatures is developed. The utilization of sunlight as the light source and supercapacitor as the electrical energy source makes the reaction portable and enables its outdoor applications.








Abstract
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is among the most inert poly&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and its degradation under mild conditions remains underdeveloped. We report a supercapacitor&#8208;assisted electrophotocatalysis, incorporating the strength of both electrochemical and photochemical energy, for the efficient defluorination of PTFE and other PFASs at low temperatures. CBZ6 worked as a photoreductant for injecting electrons into the inert carbon&#8211;fluorine bond, whereas the supercapacitor enabled the generation of the catalytically active species via an electrophotochemical process. Furthermore, the utilization of sunlight as the light source and supercapacitor as the electrical energy source makes the reaction portable and enables its outdoor applications.

         <title>Alternating Binary Droplets&#8208;Based Protocell Networks Driven by Heterogeneous Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binary liquid droplet&#8208;based protocell network, composed of coacervate and aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) droplets from associative and segregative LLPS, facilitates the spatially segregated and reconfiguration&#8208;mediated biological reactions by spatial recruitment of biomacromolecules and morphological&#8208;regulation based on external stimulus.








Abstract
As the emergence of prototissues promotes the evolutionary transformations of protolife, tissue&#8208;like networks derived from cytomimetic systems have been studied by using artificial cells as building blocks to mimic prototissues at a higher organizational level. However, liquid&#8208;like networks originating from liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS), especially heterogeneous LLPS, are less reported. Herein, we report a binary liquid droplet&#8208;based protocell network composed of coacervates and aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) droplets arranged in an alternating sequence, integrating both associative and segregative LLPS. This network with worm&#8208;like chains can be specifically achieved only when the attached droplets are partially engulfed, mediated by the interfacial tension between coacervate and ATPS droplets. Notably, the interconnected droplets within the network are capable of spatially self&#8208;sorting of biomacromolecules into separate domains, thereby facilitating biomacromolecular extraction and biological reactions within designated droplets. Upon changes in the external environment, the network can be reconfigured to enable morphological regulation of trienzymatic cascade reactions. Overall, this work highlights that an all&#8208;aqueous network, coupling both associative and segregative LLPS, can be engineered as a possible route toward a hybrid prototissue&#8208;like system, offering new insights into the design of higher&#8208;ordered biomimetic systems utilizing liquid soft matter.

         <title>A Versatile Route to Shape Polymer Nanoparticles by Deforming Nanoreactors Made from Magnetic Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping up! Polymer nanoparticles are typically spherical, constrained by their structures. Now, a unique magnetic surfactant enables rod&#8208;shaped polymer nanoparticles. Through emulsion polymerization and a magnetic field, the surfactant elongates nanoreactor droplets. Nanorods of polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, and polythiophene demonstrate versatility. This recyclable surfactant offers a sustainable path to polymer nanorods for many uses.








Abstract
Directions are equivalent in an amorphous system, so anisotropy cannot emerge of its own accord, resulting in a gap for preparing polymer nanoparticles deviating from a spherical shape. Unlike inorganic nanocrystals for which faceting controls shape, polymers are not directly available as rod&#8208;like particles, for instance. Here, we show a highly versatile, nontoxic, novel approach to break this paradigm and obtain polymer nanorods by emulsion polymerization using a unique surfactant comprising a magnetic head group. Surprisingly, even applying a weak magnetic field to the magnetic surfactant within an emulsion polymerization transforms diamagnetic polymers into rod&#8208;like nanoparticles instead of their usual spherical shapes. The polarization in a magnetic field exerts a torque on the molecular structure, and as a result, the emulsion droplets deform. The method can be applied to different polymers such as polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, or polythiophene. The magnetic surfactant is recovered quantitatively and can be reused; one obtains metal&#8208;free polymer particles, and the process is sustainable. The straightforward approach presented here will unlock several applications of these previously inaccessible polymer nanorods, particularly in the case of conducting polymers.

         <title>Transaminase&#8208;Triggered Cascades for the Synthesis and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Chiral N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step biocatalytic route to complex indolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids is described that relies on transaminase&#8208;triggered double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael methodology. In one case, a retro&#8208;double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction enables dynamic kinetic resolution.








Abstract
Biocatalysis is now a well&#8208;established branch of catalysis and the growing toolbox of natural, evolved and designer enzymes is enabling chemistry previously deemed inaccessible. However, most enzyme methodologies have been developed for functional group interconversions, such as the conversion of a ketone into an amine or alcohol, and do not result in the generation of significant 3D molecular complexity. The application of enzyme&#8208;triggered reaction cascade methodologies has the potential to transform simple substrates into complex sp3&#8208;rich molecules in one step. Herein, we describe a single&#8208;step biocatalytic route to high&#8208;value, complex indolizidine, and quinolizidine alkaloids, which relies on a transaminase&#8208;triggered double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction. This approach allows access to architecturally complex, natural&#8208;product&#8208;like N&#8208;heterocycles and reveals intriguing examples of diastereoselectivity in these enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. Significantly, we demonstrate an elegant example of a biocatalytic cascade where the transaminase plays a dual role in generating complex N&#8208;heterocycles and where a retro&#8208;double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction mediates a dynamic kinetic resolution and enables the isolation of sp3&#8208;rich indolizidine diastereoisomers containing five stereocenters, as single isomers.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Short Peptides Activates Specific ER&#8208;Phagy and Induces Pyroptosis for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present stable ER&#8208;targeting short peptides that mimic misfolded proteins through self&#8208;assembly, selectively inducing ER&#8208;phagy without initiating autophagy of other organelles. Persistent ER&#8208;phagy triggered by these peptides leads to pyroptosis and antitumor immune responses via Ca2+ and mtROS dysregulation. We provide a powerful tool for elucidating ER&#8208;phagy mechanisms and a promising strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Developing specific endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;autophagy (ER&#8208;phagy) inducers is highly desirable for discovering new ER&#8208;phagy receptors and elucidating the detailed ER&#8208;phagy mechanism and potential cancer immunotherapy. However, most of the current ER&#8208;phagy&#8208;inducing methods cause nonselective autophagy of other organelles. In this work, we report the design and synthesis of simple and stable short peptides (D&#8208;FFxFFs) that could specifically trigger ER&#8208;phagy, which further induces pyroptosis and activates the immune response against tumor cells. D&#8208;FFxFFs locate preferentially in ER and readily self&#8208;assemble to form nanosized misfolded protein mimics, which lead to distinct upregulation of dedicated ER&#8208;phagy receptors with no obvious autophagy of other organelles. Significant unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated via IRE1&#8208;JNK and PERK&#8208;ATF4 pathways. Interestingly, the persistent ER&#8208;phagy triggers ER Ca2+ release and a surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, resulting in GSDMD&#8208;mediated pyroptosis other than apoptosis. The ER&#8208;phagy induces pyroptosis and activates a distinct antitumor immune response without evolving the acquired drug resistance. This work not only provides a powerful tool for investigating the mechanism and function of ER&#8208;phagy but also offers an appealing strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Induced Quantum Confinement of Negative Charge Carriers by Organic Nanoporous Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>

Excess&#8208;electrons in organic nanoporous systems&#8212;nanohoops, their assemblies, and COFs&#8212;can be confined and transported via diffuse states stabilized by long&#8208;range polarization forces. These nanopore&#8208;bound states, localized in nanopores or away from molecular scaffolds, exhibit enhanced electron coupling and nearly&#8208;free&#8208;electron bands, unlike traditional skeletal&#8208;bound states, thus presenting a promising pathway for electron transport.








Abstract
We characterize the attachment of excess&#8208;electrons to organic nanoporous systems such as molecular nanohoops and models of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using many&#8208;body methods. All the nanopore systems exhibit diffuse electronic states where the excess&#8208;electron is bound to the molecular scaffold via long&#8208;range polarization forces, and the excess&#8208;electron is predominantly localized in the interior of the nanopore or away from the molecular scaffold. Such &#8220;nanopore&#8208;bound&#8221; states show an enhanced electron&#8208;transfer coupling compared to more strongly&#8208;bound skeletal&#8208;states (or valence&#8208;bound states), where the excess&#8208;electron is confined to the molecular skeleton. For 1D assemblies of nanohoops, the bands formed from nanopore&#8208;bound states have a consistent nearly&#8208;free&#8208;electron character, indicating an efficient excited&#8208;state pathway for charge&#8208;carriers, while the bands from skeletal&#8208;states have higher effective mass along certain lattice directions. The nanopore&#8208;bound states show distinct size&#8208;dependent variations in electron affinities compared to skeletal&#8208;states and previously observed molecular quantum corral states. We conclude that nanopore&#8208;bound states emerge from polarization&#8208;induced quantum confinement, forming a distinct common feature of organic nanoporous matter with potential for efficient&#160;electron&#8208;transport.

         <title>Aqueous Dehydrogenation of Methyl Formate Catalyzed by a Recyclable Polymer&#8208;Grafted Manganese(I) Pincer Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a polymer&#8208;grafted pincer&#8208;type catalyst of earth&#8208;abundant Mn that catalyzes the aqueous dehydrogenation of methyl formate, an emerging liquid organic hydrogen carrier. This immobilized catalyst retains the well&#8208;defined structure and high reactivity of the corresponding homogeneous molecular catalyst and exhibits marked stability and recyclability, achieving a high total hydrogen&#8208;based TON of 230525 after 5 consecutive recycling rounds.








Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are an effective solution for the long&#8208;term storage of hydrogen and its long&#8208;distance transportation, but one that requires efficient catalysis for hydrogen uptake and release. Homogeneous molecular catalysts employed in LOHC systems usually exhibit high reactivity and selectivity but are difficult to recover and reuse, a fact that severely limits their practical application. Herein, we report an easily synthesized polymer&#8208;grafted pincer&#8208;type complex of earth&#8208;abundant manganese, which can catalyze the aqueous dehydrogenation of methyl formate, an emerging LOHC material. Importantly, this immobilized Mn&#8208;pincer catalyst retains the high reactivity of the corresponding molecular catalyst, yet is also recyclable, exhibiting high stability and achieving a total hydrogen&#8208;based turnover number of more than 230000 after 5 consecutive recycling rounds.

     alt="Aqueous Dehydrogenation of Methyl Formate Catalyzed by a Recyclable Polymer-Grafted Manganese(I) Pincer Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a polymer-grafted pincer-type catalyst of earth-abundant Mn that catalyzes the aqueous dehydrogenation of methyl formate, an emerging liquid organic hydrogen carrier. This immobilized catalyst retains the well-defined structure and high reactivity of the corresponding homogeneous molecular catalyst and exhibits marked stability and recyclability, achieving a high total hydrogen-based TON of 230525 after 5 consecutive recycling rounds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are an effective solution for the long-term storage of hydrogen and its long-distance transportation, but one that requires efficient catalysis for hydrogen uptake and release. Homogeneous molecular catalysts employed in LOHC systems usually exhibit high reactivity and selectivity but are difficult to recover and reuse, a fact that severely limits their practical application. Herein, we report an easily synthesized polymer-grafted pincer-type complex of earth-abundant manganese, which can catalyze the aqueous dehydrogenation of methyl formate, an emerging LOHC material. Importantly, this immobilized Mn-pincer catalyst retains the high reactivity of the corresponding molecular catalyst, yet is also recyclable, exhibiting high stability and achieving a total hydrogen-based turnover number of more than 230000 after 5 consecutive recycling rounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Containing Hybrid SEI Layer Enabling High Mass Loading and Anode&#8208;Less Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithium&#8208;containing hybrid SEI layer is designed for the Na metal anode by incorporating inorganic components (e.g., LiF, Li&#8323;N, and Li&#8322;CO&#8323;) from the SEI layer of a Li metal anode. This design leverages the advantages of the SEI layer formed on Li anodes, which has a higher Young's modulus and better electrochemical stability (due to the lower redox voltage window of Li metal) compared to that formed on Na anodes. Simulations and extensive characterizations reveal that, with the benefits of high ionic conductivity, enhanced Young's modulus, reduced interfacial side reactions, and uniform Na+ deposition, the system achieves robust electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full cells.








Abstract
The continuous rupturing and rebuilding of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer during cycling would block Na+ diffusion and induce Na dendrite formation, ultimately limiting the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium metal batteries. Herein, a hybrid SEI layer containing Li&#8208;species is dexterously constructed on the surface of sodium metal anode. Li&#8208;containing inorganic components (Li3N, LiF, and Li2CO3) are introduced to stabilize the Na/electrolyte interface and enhance the mechanical and diffusion kinetic properties of the SEI layer, which can reduce the side reactions and gas generation, regulate Na+ flux during cycling and promote rapid Na+ migration for uniform dendrite&#8208;free Na deposition. As a result, the constructed Na symmetric cells achieve low overpotential and long cycle life of 5900, 1800, and 500&#160;h at current densities of 3, 10, and 30&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Furthermore, the full cells paired with the Na&#8323;V&#8322;(PO&#8324;)&#8323; cathode demonstrate high specific capacity and excellent cycle stability, even at an ultra&#8208;high cathode loading of 39.3&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a low N/P ratio (negative/positive electrode capacity ratio of 1.21).

         <title>Breaking Linear Scaling Relation Limitations on a Dual&#8208;Driven Single&#8208;Atom Copper&#8208;Tungsten Oxide Catalyst for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Cu&#8208;bearing WO3 catalyst (Cu1/WO3) was developed to break linear scaling relation limitations of single&#8208;atom catalysts for NH3&#8208;N synthesis using NO3&#8722; pollutants as feedstocks. Specifically, WO3 dissociated water molecules and supplied Cu1 with ample protons, whereas the Cu1 in an electron&#8208;deficient state converted NO3&#8722;&#8208;N to NH3&#8208;N efficiently.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;, NO3RR) on single&#8208;atom copper catalysts (Cu&#8208;SACs) offers a sustainable approach to ammonia (NH3) synthesis using NO3&#8722; pollutants as feedstocks. Nevertheless, this process suffers from inferior NO3RR kinetics and nitrite accumulation owing to the linear scaling relation limitations for SACs. To break these limitations, a single&#8208;atom Cu&#8208;bearing tungsten oxide catalyst (Cu1/WO3) was developed, which mediated a unique dual&#8208;driven NO3RR process. Specifically, WO3 dissociated water molecules and supplied the Cu1 site with ample protons, whereas the Cu1 site in an electron&#8208;deficient state converted NO3&#8722; to NH3 efficiently. The Cu1/WO3 delivered an impressive NH3 production rate of 1274.4 mgN h&#8722;1 gCu&#8722;1, a NH3 selectivity of 99.2%, and a faradaic efficiency of 93.7% at &#8722;0.60&#160;V, surpassing most reported catalysts. Furthermore, an integrated continuous&#8208;flow system consisting of a NO3RR cell and a vacuum&#8208;driven membrane separator was developed for NH3 synthesis from nitrate&#8208;contaminated water. Fed with the Yangtze River water containing &#8764;22.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1 of NO3&#8722;&#8208;N, this system realized an NH3 production rate of 325.9 mgN h&#8722;1 gCu&#8722;1 and a collection efficiency of 98.3% at energy consumption of 17.11 kwh gN&#8722;1. This study provides a new dual&#8208;driven concept for catalyst design and establishes a foundation for sustainable NH3 synthesis from waste.

         <title>Immunoengineering of a Photocaged 5&#180;&#8208;triphosphate Oligoribonucleotide Ligand for Spatiotemporal Control of RIG&#8208;I Activation in Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for precise control of RIG&#8208;I (retinoic acid inducible gene I), an innate immune receptor of RNA that, when activated, induces anti&#8208;tumor immune responses and cancer cell death. By incorporating photocage modifications into RNA ligands, we enable a spatially and temporally regulated immune response and offer a targeted strategy for cancer therapy while minimizing systemic effects.








Abstract
Photochemical control of oligonucleotides bears great potential for the spatio&#8208;temporal control of therapeutic targets, such as immune sensing receptors. Retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I (RIG&#8208;I) is a cytoplasmic receptor of the innate immune system that triggers antiviral responses upon detection of viral RNA. RIG&#8208;I can be specifically activated by short double&#8208;stranded (ds) RNA with a blunt 5&#8242; end bearing a triphosphate, mimicking nascent viral transcripts. Tumor cells are specifically sensitive to RIG&#8208;I&#8208;induced cell death. Here we developed a potent oligonucleotide ligand for spatiotemporally controlled activation of RIG&#8208;I by light exposure. Through structural considerations and functional studies we identified a combination of two nucleoside positions in a RIG&#8208;I oligonucleotide ligand for which the substitution of both respective 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy groups of the ribose by photolabile protecting groups (2&#8242;&#8208;photocages) resulted in a complete loss of RIG&#8208;I ligand activity, whereas photocaging the individual positions was not sufficient to turn off RIG&#8208;I. Light exposure fully restored RIG&#8208;I activation by the photocaged RIG&#8208;I ligand, enabling light&#8208;controlled RIG&#8208;I&#8208;mediated cell death of human cancer cells which had internalized the photocaged RIG&#8208;I ligand prior to light exposure. This novel photoactivatable RIG&#8208;I oligonucleotide ligand may be applicable for precise light&#8208;controlled induction of tumor cell death in superficial cancer such as melanoma.

An amphiphilic polymer additive PVEMA was polymerized by imidazole ionic liquid and methacrylamide to fast Zn2+ diffusion rate, inhibit shuttle effect of polyiodides for cathode and alleviate the side reactions on Zn anode. Moreover, the &#945;&#8208;methyl group can enhance the hydrophobic property of polymer for further side reaction resistance, thus rendering the Zn&#8211;I2 battery with stable cycling and rate performances at various scenario.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are prospective on energy storage, yet the practical application is severely hindered by side reactions of Zn metal and the shuttle effects for polyiodide. Herein, a polymer additive was copolymerized by 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (VEImOTf) and methacrylamide (MAAm) (PVEMA) to alleviate the above issues. The polymer chain of PVEMA endows amphipathic properties for Zn2+ diffusion and solvation structure regulation, and the &#945;&#8208;methyl of MAAm enhances the hydrophobic properties to avoid side reactions on Zn metal. In addition, the imidazole groups adsorb onto Zn metal with electrostatic shielding effect for further side reaction alleviation and mitigate shuttle effects by electrostatic interactions with polyiodides. Consequently, the PVEMA confers the symmetrical Zn battery with great cycling stability for over 400&#160;h at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high depth of discharge (DOD) of 77.7%. The Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with PVEMA also demonstrate stable cycling performance under various current densities and temperatures.

         <title>From Polymers to Rings and Back Again: Chemical Recycling of Polyesters to Macrolactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the chemical recycling of polyesters derived from the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of cyclic anhydride with epoxide is presented. The polyesters are selectively depolymerized using commercial tin(II) octoate to form 16&#8208; and 18&#8208;membered lactones with high selectivity and conversions. The recycled macrolactones undergo catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerizations to produce polyesters with equivalent properties to the virgin materials.








Abstract
Cyclic anhydride and epoxide ring&#8208;opening copolymerization is a versatile and controlled route to make polyesters, gaining attention in different application sectors. But so far, the chemical recycling of these polyesters to cyclic monomers is under&#8208;explored. Here, the catalytic chemical recycling of aliphatic polyesters to selectively form 16&#8208; and 18&#8208;membered lactones is presented. The recycling reactions are catalyzed using commercial tin(II) octoate and conducted in the polymer melt (230&#160;&#176;C) resulting in high conversions to the macrolactones (&gt;90%). The recycled macrolactones undergo catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerizations to produce polyesters with equivalent properties to the virgin materials.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Triazenylarenes Enable Vicinal Sandmeyer&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;triazenylarenes enable vicinal disubstitution reactions. The reactions can be performed in one step or in a sequential fashion, and they allow introducing a range of different nucleophiles including fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, hydroxide, methoxide, and acetamide.








Abstract
The introduction of two nucleophiles in the vicinal position of arenes via Sandmeyer&#8208;type reactions is compromised by the problematic diazotization of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes. Herein, it is shown that vicinal substitution reactions are facilitated by the use of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;triazenylarenes. Two distinct methodologies for the synthesis of these triazenes are presented. The first approach involves the sequential conversion of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;iodoarenes into first mono&#8208; and then bis&#8208;triazenylarenes. The second procedure is based on Ru&#8208;catalyzed [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions between diynes and a 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;triazenylalkyne. The two triazene groups in the products can be substituted sequentially by a range of nucleophiles including fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, hydroxide, methoxide, and acetamide.

         <title>Activating Molybdenum Peroxide Scissors for Converting Polyamide Plastic into Low Carbon Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molybdenum peroxide scissors, composed of localized radicals on quasi&#8208;2D Mo&#8208;O sheets, are activated by H2O2 through a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process to upgrade micro&#8208;scale Polyamide 6 to low carbon alcohols with exceptionally high efficiency and selectivity.








Abstract
Direct chemical conversion of plastic waste into low&#8208;carbon oxygenates, rather than carbon dioxide, with renewable energy, is important yet challenging. Due to high C&#9472;X (X&#9552;C, H, N) bond energy, fully optimized catalysts are required to enable precise bond cleavage for boosted efficiency and selectivity. Here, adaptable and recyclable molybdenum peroxide photocatalysts that demonstrate chemical scissors for the selective conversion of polyamide to alcohols are reported. It shows that dimensionally adaptable Mo(+5.8)&#8208;(O2) is activated via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process for localized catalysis to precisely cleave C&#9472;X bonds into C2 and C1 alcohols. The additional hydrogen peroxide facilitates the activation and regeneration of the catalytic scissors. These scissors ultimately cut PA6 into methanol with an efficiency of 2.55&#160;mmol&#160;L&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 82.4&#160;%. This work provides insights into the role of adaptable metal peroxides in precisely cutting C&#9472;X bonds, which benefits chemical conversion of plastic wastes.

         <title>Leaflet&#8208;Specific Structure and Dynamics of Solid and Polymer Supported Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript investigates the structural and dynamic properties of polyethylene glycol&#8208;supported lipid bilayers using a method based on graphene&#8208;induced energy transfer and line&#8208;scan fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy, providing subnanometer spatial resolution and millisecond temporal resolution within a single experiment.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;supported or tethered lipid bilayers serve as versatile platforms for mimicking plasma membrane structure and dynamics, yet the impact of polymer supports on lipid bilayers remains largely unresolved. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that combines graphene&#8208;induced energy transfer (GIET) with line&#8208;scan fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (lsFLCS) to examine the structural and dynamic properties of lipid bilayers. Our findings reveal that polymer supports markedly influence both the structural parameters, such as the membrane height from the substrate, its thickness, as well as dynamic properties, including leaflet&#8208;specific diffusion coefficients and interleaflet coupling. These findings highlight the complex interplay between a polymer support and the lipid bilayers. By resolving leaflet&#8208;specific diffusion and heights of the two leaflets from the substrate, this study emphasizes the potential of GIET&#8208;lsFLCS for probing membrane dynamics and structure. These insights significantly advance the understanding and application of polymer&#8208;supported membranes across diverse research contexts.

The highly stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation has been achieved via synergistic combinations of reagent modulation, remote participation, and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects. A variety of &#945;&#8208;xylosides motifs have been effectively prepared by this 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation protocol, including hemicellulose xyloglucan, xyloglucosyl trisaccharide motif from mammalian cells, core M3 matriglycan motif, and even &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;xylosides up to 12&#8208;mer.








Abstract
Stereoselective constructions of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic bonds are long&#8208;standing challenges in chemical synthesis. In particular, achieving highly stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation remains a difficult task in carbohydrates chemistry. Here, we report that highly stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation could be achieved via synergistic combinations of reagent modulation, remote participation, and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects. A variety of &#945;&#8208;xylosides motifs have been effectively prepared by this 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation protocol, including hemicellulose xyloglucan, xyloglucosyl trisaccharide motif from mammalian cells, core M3 matriglycan motif, and even &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;xylosides up to 12&#8208;mer. Furthermore, DFT calculations provided the origins of this stereoselective and synergistic 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation through SN1 and SN2 pathways.

         <title>Surface Nonbonding Oxygen State Regulation for Reversible Anionic Redox Chemistry in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface nonbonding oxygen state is modulated by an integrated surface structure engineering to stabilize anionic redox chemistry. The oxidized oxygen of the designed material cannot become O2 gas and escape, but rather exists more in the form of high&#8208;valence oxygen dimer anions, reducing the reaction extent of surface anionic redox and inhibiting oxygen loss.








Abstract
Activated by the Li&#8211;O&#8211;Li configuration with nonbonding O 2p state (lO2p), anionic redox reaction (ARR) in Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) contributes to additional capacity but exhibits significant irreversibility, leading to severe surface oxygen loss. Herein, surface nonbonding oxygen state (SNBOS) is regulated by the integrated surface structure engineering to suppress surface oxygen loss and enhance the reversibility of ARR. On the outermost layer, the conversion of layered structure into a LiLaO2 layer and spinel phase structure eliminates lO2p, thereby preventing the activation of ARR and suppressing side reactions between electrolyte and oxidized oxygen ions. Besides, by introducing 5d metal La on the near surface, the energy of lO2p is decreased corresponding to the increased charge&#8208;transfer gap &#916; and the d&#8211;d coulomb repulsion term U is reduced, making U/2 decrease close to &#916; and enhancing ARR reversibility. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the oxidized oxygen of the modified sample cannot become O2 gas and escape, but rather exists more in the form of high&#8208;valence oxygen dimer anions O2n&#8722;$O_2^{n - }$, reducing the reaction depth of surface ARR and inhibiting oxygen loss. Therefore, the designed material demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and kinetics performance.

         <title>Engineering Aqueous Electrolytes with Vicinal S&#8208;based Organic Additives for Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile sulfur&#8208;based organic electrolyte additive, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dithiobis&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid disodium salt (SPS), has been introduced in aqueous electrolyte, enabling dense (100) growth through a unique symmetrically aligned concentration&#8208;controlled adsorption network, affording structural uniformity and compactness to the Zn deposit layer. SPS additive afforded stabilization of the Zn anode under severe testing conditions with high reversibility.








Abstract
The commercial deployment of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is hampered by dendrites, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and corrosion reactions. To tackle these challenges, we have introduced 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dithiobis&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid disodium salt (SPS), a symmetrical sulfur&#8208;based organic salt, as an electrolyte additive for AZIBs. Unlike conventional electrolyte additives that favor (002) deposition, SPS enables dense (100) growth through a unique symmetrically aligned concentration&#8208;controlled adsorption network, affording structural uniformity and compactness to the Zn deposit layer. The dual&#8208;action symmetrical SPS additive adsorbs onto the Zn surface via vicinal sulfur atoms, blocking electrolyte access to the Zn anode, enhancing the transportation kinetics of Zn2+, and simultaneously promoting desolvation by displacing water molecules from the solvation shell. This synergistic effect improves the stability of the Zn anode by mitigating HER and corrosion, resulting in over 1100 h of cycling at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, stable operation at even 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 15 mAh cm&#8722;2, and achieving impressive Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.41%. As validation, the Zn/NaV3O8&#183;1.35H2O cell with SPS&#8208;additive afforded high cycling stabilization and excellent capacity retention of 95.5%. This study offers valuable insights for advancing AZIBs and other metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>A DNP&#8208;Supported Solid&#8208;State NMR Approach to Study Nucleic Acids In Situ Reveals Berberine&#8208;Stabilized Hoogsteen Structures in Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria are vital for energy production and rely on intricate nucleic acid structures to regulate gene expression. Using DNP&#8208;ssNMR (dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR), we observed G&#8208;quadruplex formation in intact mitochondria treated with berberine. This method enables detailed studies of mitochondrial nucleic acids in their native environment, advancing research into mitochondrial diseases and therapies.








Abstract
Mitochondria are central to cellular bioenergetics, with the unique ability to translate and transcribe a subset of their own proteome. Given the critical importance of energy production, mitochondria seem to utilize higher&#8208;order nucleic acid structures to regulate gene expression, much like nuclei. Herein, we introduce a tailored approach to probe the formation of such structures, specifically G&#8208;quadruplexes, within intact mitochondria by using sensitivity&#8208;enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization&#8208;supported solid&#8208;state NMR (DNP&#8208;ssNMR). We acquired NMR spectra on isolated intact isotopically labeled mitochondria treated with berberine, a known high&#8208;affinity G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer. The DNP&#8208;ssNMR data revealed spectral changes in nucleic acid sugar correlations, increased signal intensity for guanosine carbons, and enhanced Hoogsteen hydrogen bond formation, providing evidence of in vivo G&#8208;quadruplex formation in mitochondria. Together, our workflow enables the study of mitochondrial nucleic acid&#8208;ligand interactions at endogenous concentrations within biologically relevant environments by DNP&#8208;ssNMR, thus paving the way for future research into mitochondrial diseases and their potential treatments.

         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage dication pool strategy using alkenyl thianthrenium intermediates has been developed for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization. This method differs from previous approaches in its reaction mechanism and addresses their most significant limitation, namely, the restricted generality of the nucleophile. The approach has been extended to other challenging transformations, including anti&#8208;Wacker&#8208;type oxidation, hydroacetylenation, hydrogenation, and deuterium labeling.








Abstract
The anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of terminal, unactivated olefins is an evergreen synthetic challenge in organic chemistry. Several direct and indirect anti&#8208;Markovnikov methods have been developed, ranging from the classical hydroboration/oxidation protocol to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoredox catalytic, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed, and enzymatic procedures. Despite the ever&#8208;expanding suite of synthetic capabilities, these methods still have limited generality in their substrate scope, especially with nucleophiles. Herein, we show that terminal, unactivated olefins can be transformed into anti&#8208;Markovnikov products via an alkenyl thianthrenium intermediate that undergoes sequential hydride and nucleophile addition. The strategic advantage of this method lies in the ability to utilize a diverse array of oxidatively sensitive nucleophiles as reaction partners. This is accomplished through a mechanistically distinct, two&#8208;stage dication pool anti&#8208;Markovnikov approach, where separate oxidative olefin activation by thianthrenation is followed by the selective generation of a reactive alkyl thianthrenium salt.

         <title>Degradation of Glyphosate to Benign N&#8208;Formyl Glycine Using MOF&#8208;808 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF&#8208;808) with different crystal sizes and designed defect sites was employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the complete degradation of glyphosate at room temperature. The degradation mechanism produces N&#8208;formyl glycine and hydroxymethyl&#8208;phosphonate.








Abstract
Glyphosate (N&#8208;phosphonomethyl glycine, GPh) is an industrial herbicide used worldwide in modern agricultural practices. With the growing concerns regarding cumulative environmental and health effects, pathways for catalytic GPh degradation to benign products are becoming a pressing societal need. This report demonstrates that Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF&#8208;808) with different crystal sizes and designed defect sites can be employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the complete degradation of GPh at room temperature. Importantly, the degradation mechanism produces N&#8208;formyl glycine and hydroxymethyl&#8208;phosphonate, which are largely innocuous chemicals, especially when compared to more common GPh degradation products. Nanocrystalline MOF&#8208;808 (nMOF&#8208;808) exhibits enhanced reactivity than larger MOF&#8208;808 crystals, attributed to the higher coordination of hydroxyl and water molecules to the secondary building units (SBU) as determined using a range of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques. These studies indicate that the crystal size&#8208;dependency in GPh degradation is related to structural modifications on coordinative unsaturated Zr site that promote the fast exchange of weakly bonded ligands. Taken together, this study demonstrates that GPh degradation can be optimized through ligand field tuning in MOFs, which can help improve overall reactivity while also pushing the reaction toward desirable, nontoxic products.

         <title>Deciphering the Impact of Polysulfide Solvation Structure on Electrical Double Layer Chemistry in Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tetrahydropyran (THP)&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) has been developed for reversible sodium&#8211;sulfur (Na&#8211;S) batteries, which regulates the sodium polysulfides (NaPS) solvation structure, enables a robust electrical double layer chemistry, and suppresses side reactions between NaPS and Na&#8211;metal anodes. As a result, the Na&#8211;S cells with THP&#8208;based LHCE display long&#8208;term cycle stability with excellent rate performance.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are garnering attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical application is hindered by challenges, such as the shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS) and dendrite growth. The high solubility of NaPS in the electrolyte is particularly problematic. It disrupts electron transfer and obstructs mass transport in the electrical double layer (EDL) region. The EDL plays a pivotal role in governing the interfacial chemistry between the electrode and electrolyte, significantly impacting the overall electrochemical performance. Through simulations and experimental screening of various solvents, including 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and tetrahydropyran (THP), along with ethyl 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl ether (ETFE) as a diluent, the relationship between NaPS solvation structure and EDL chemistry has been elucidated. Our findings reveal that THP&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) not only reduces the solubility of NaPS by altering its solvation structure but also promotes the formation of a stable inorganic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and improves compatibility with sodium metal. Consequently, Na&#8211;S batteries with LHCE&#8208;THP/ETFE exhibit long&#8208;term stability over 500 cycles at 1C rate with a capacity decay rate of only 0.07% per cycle. This study provides a methodology for designing electrolytes based on molecular structure, polysulfide solvation properties, and EDL interfacial chemistry.

         <title>Double Sb&#8208;N Coordination Enables Record&#8208;High Birefringence in UV&#8208;Transparent Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>

A UV&#8208;transparent hybrid birefringence crystal, (C12H8N2)SbF3 (PNSF), with a record&#8208;breaking birefringence of 0.79 at 546&#160;nm, surpassing all previously reported UV&#8208;transparent birefringent materials, was successfully designed and synthesized through a transformative organic&#8211;inorganic coordination approach.








Abstract
Achieving high birefringence in ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;transparent crystals has remained a significant challenge due to the absence of systematic design methodologies. Herein, we present a novel organic&#8211;inorganic coordination strategy that combines &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic ligands ([C12H8N2]) with inorganic Sb&#8208;based polyhedra featuring stereochemically active lone pairs. This approach facilitates the formation of the first coplanar double Sb&#8208;N coordination framework, enabling the synthesis of two new birefringent hybrid crystals: (C12H8N2)SbF2(H2PO3) (PNSP) and (C12H8N2)SbF3 (PNSF). Notably, PNSF demonstrates an unprecedented birefringence of 0.79 at 546&#160;nm, exceeding all known UV&#8208;transparent birefringent materials to date. These results not only expand the performance limits of birefringent hybrid crystals but also emphasize the pivotal role of stereochemically induced anisotropy in manipulating optical properties. Our study establishes a solid foundation for the rational design of next&#8208;generation optical materials, offering significant advancements for applications in cutting&#8208;edge photonic technologies, including UV polarizers and optical modulators.

         <title>Regiochemistry and Side&#8208;Chain Engineering Enable Efficient N&#8208;Type Mixed Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The backbone regiochemistry and side&#8208;chains engineering contribute to an enhanced electrochemical doping efficiency and optimal chain orientation in thiazole&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based homopolymers. This results in high doping efficiency and balanced ionic&#8208;electronic charge transport in organic electrochemical transistors, leading to a significant figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) of 96.3 F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and a low threshold voltage of 0.31&#160;V.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting (OMIEC) polymers with simple structural motifs is still challenging. We show that high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;threshold&#8208;voltage n&#8208;type OMIEC polymers can be achieved using a simple diketopyrrolopyrrole unit flanked by thiazole groups, which is functionalized with glycolated side chains. Interestingly, the regiospecific sp2&#8208;N position in the repeating unit's thiazole governs the polymer chains' solvation and molecular packing.

&lt;p&gt;The backbone regiochemistry and side-chains engineering contribute to an enhanced electrochemical doping efficiency and optimal chain orientation in thiazole-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole-based homopolymers. This results in high doping efficiency and balanced ionic-electronic charge transport in organic electrochemical transistors, leading to a significant figure-of-merit (&lt;i&gt;&#181;C&lt;/i&gt;*) of 96.3 F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low threshold voltage of 0.31&#160;V.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing high-performance n-type organic mixed ionic-electronic conducting (OMIEC) polymers with simple structural motifs is still challenging. We show that high-performance, low-threshold-voltage n-type OMIEC polymers can be achieved using a simple diketopyrrolopyrrole unit flanked by thiazole groups, which is functionalized with glycolated side chains. Interestingly, the regiospecific sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-N position in the repeating unit's thiazole governs the polymer chains' solvation and molecular packing. This specific backbone chemistry enhances conjugation efficiency, reduces trap density, and improves electrochemical doping efficiency. Moreover, systematic variation of glycolated side-chain lengths induces a sequential shift in molecular orientation&#8212;from edge-on through bimodal to face-on preferential alignment. This structural evolution achieves optimized ionic-electronic transport balance, resulting in exceptional device metrics: a geometrically normalized transconductance of 31.9 S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a figure-of-merit &lt;i&gt;&#181;C&lt;/i&gt;* of 96.3&#160;F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a threshold voltage of 0.31&#160;V, positioning these materials among the highest-performing n-type OMIECs.

         <title>Facile Access to Piezoelectric Polyamides by Polyamidation of Carboxylic Acids and Ynamides for Potent Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We establish a simple polyamidation of carboxylic acids and ynamides to synthesize versatile piezoelectric polyamides, with the merits of 100% atom economy, no waste generation, and additive&#8208;free as well as catalyst&#8208;free system. Tetraphenylethene containing polyamides can generate reactive oxygen species and elicit robust immunogenic cell death induction for suppressing distant tumor proliferation under US irradiation. This work provides a strategy to designing new piezoelectric polymers for effective tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Polyamides are a fascinating group of piezoelectric materials that are largely synthesized by the polycondesation of dicarboxylic acids with diamines or the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of special lactams. However, developing a green polymerization approach for the facile synthesis of piezoelectric polyamides is highly desirable but also challenging. Here, a simple polyamidation of carboxylic acids and ynamides is successfully established to synthesize versatile piezoelectric polyamides. This polymerization also possesses the merits of 100% atom economy, no waste generation, and additive&#8208;free as well as catalyst&#8208;free system. A range of polyamides are synthesized in moderate to good yields with satisfactory molecular weights. Importantly, piezoelectric polyamides containing tetraphenylethene (P1e/2b) can generate a bundant reactive oxygen species under ultrasound (US) exposure, thereby eliciting robust immunogenic cell death induction for augmented piezoelectric immunotherapy. Furthermore, P1e/2b exhibits distinctive aggregation&#8208;induced emission property that allows fluorescence imaging. In vivo evaluation using a bilateral tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model manifested that P1e/2b administration reinforced systemic immunity and triggered immune memory under US exposure, thereby leading to primary tumor eradication and distant tumor suppression. Therefore, this work represents a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and waste&#8208;free polymerization paradigm for the construction of piezoelectric polyamides, providing a distinct strategy to designing new piezoelectric polymers for effective tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Molecule Differentiation Encoding Microscopy to Dissect Dense Biomolecules in Cellular Nanoenvironments below Spatial Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule differentiation encoding microscopy by orthogonal tandem repeat DNA identifiers is reported to digitize the dense biomolecules below spatial resolution. The method encodes each copy of the same biomolecules into different types of DNA barcodes based on stochastic multiplexed reactions. It transforms the overlap of the same spectrum into the overlap of different spectra, overcoming the common challenge of optical crowding.








Abstract
Cellular biomolecules may exhibit dense distribution and organization at the nanoscale to govern vital biological processes. However, it remains a common challenge to digitize the spatially dense biomolecules under the spatial resolution of microscopies. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle method, molecule differentiation encoding microscopy by orthogonal tandem repeat DNA identifiers is reported, to resolve the copy numbers of dense biomolecules in cellular nanoenvironments. The method encodes each copy of the same biomolecules into different types of DNA barcodes based on stochastic multiplexed reactions. It can transform the overlap of the same spectrum into the overlap of different spectra. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed to automatically quantitate overlapping spots and individual spots. Using this method, RNAs in the cytoplasm, DNA epigenetic modifications in the cell nucleus, and glycans and glycoRNAs on the cell surface are dissected, respectively. It is found that all these biomolecules present dense distribution with diverse degrees in crowded cellular nanoenvironments. Especially, an average 17% copies of U1 glycoRNA of single cells are gathered in various nano environments on the cell surface. The strategy provides a powerful tool for digitally quantitative visualization of dense biomolecules below the spatial resolution of microscopies and can provide insights into underlying functions and mechanisms of the dense distribution information.

         <title>Accelerated Destruction of Passive Film and Microbial Corrosion of 316&#8197;L Stainless Steel via Extracellular Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated microbial corrosion and destruction of passive film on stainless steel were caused by electroactive Shewanella oneidensis biofilm. The changes in surface properties were verified due to the accelerated electrochemical reactions mediated by extracellular electron transfer (EET). Cytochrome proteins and electron mediators accelerated EET process and redox reactions at the interface between electroactive bacterial biofilm and 316&#8197;L stainless steel.







Abstract
The dense passive film on 316&#8197;L stainless steel is the key in its corrosion resistance. Its interactions with an electroactive biofilm are critical in deciphering microbial corrosion. Herein, an in&#8208;depth investigation using genetic manipulations and addition of an exogenous electron mediator found that extracellular electron transfer (EET) mediated by the electroactive S. oneidensis biofilm grown aerobically accelerated the destruction of the microstructure and weakened the passive film. The changes in surface properties accelerated the electrochemical reactions and increased pitting corrosion. The redox state on the surface also changed due to the activity of the electroactive biofilm. A synergistic EET corrosion mechanism, including both direct and mediated electron transfer with passive film destruction was proposed to illustrate the corrosion caused by electroactive S. oneidensis. The techniques used in this work provide a systematic approach to probe EET impact on microbial corrosion by electroactive biofilms with electron transfer across the biotic&#8208;abiotic interfaces.

         <title>Radical Chemistry of Tetrazenes: Access to Polymers with Pristine Tetrazenyl Chain Ends and Depolymerization Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;Atom abstraction in the &#945; position of tetrazenes generates for the first time a C&#8208;centered radical capable of polymerization initiation while maintaining the integrity of the tetrazene moiety. Depending on the conditions selected, the resulting polymer 4N chain ends can lead to either re&#8208;initiation and chain extension, or unzipping depolymerization.








Abstract
We report the first radical reaction of tetrazenes&#8212; i.e., functions with four consecutive nitrogen atoms with a linear N&#8211;N&#9552;N&#8211;N chain&#8212;that retains the characteristic 4N pattern. Selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) in the &#945;&#8208;position of the 4N chain enables the free radical polymerization of various polar and nonpolar monomers. The tetrazene units play a dual role. Its decomposition generates aminyl radicals that can undergo HAT with another tetrazene molecule and lead to initiating C&#8208;centered radicals. Contrary to what was previously thought the aminyl radicals never add to the monomers. The polymers obtained feature tetrazene chain ends, which can be harnessed as macro&#8208;initiators to further grow the polymer chains. Heating of the former above the ceiling temperature leads to cleavage of the tetrazene function, which enables depolymerization by unzipping of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS).

         <title>Identifying Spatially Segregated Ir Sites Within ZSM&#8208;5 for Enhanced Redox Cycle in NOx Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir@ZSM&#8208;5 was prepared via a one&#8208;pot synthesis, where Ir clusters were confined within the zeolite pores, achieving valence state balance through spatial confinement. SO2 and O2 synergistically regulate the valence states of Ir species, thereby influencing the reaction pathway of NOx reduction by CO.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance Ir&#8208;based catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NOx by CO (CO&#8208;SCR) under low temperatures remains challenging. This study presents an Ir&#8208;based catalyst encapsulated in Zeolite Socony Mobil&#8208;5 (Ir@ZSM&#8208;5), with Ir species partially confined in micropores (Ir&#948;+) and partially aggregated on the surface (Ir0), achieving &#8764;88% NOx conversion at 230&#160;&#176;C in the presence of 5% O2 and 100&#160;ppm SO2. The confined Ir&#948;+ species exhibit enhanced stability and oxidation states, whereas surface&#8208;aggregated Ir0 species, with weaker oxygen coordination, remain in a metallic state. The dynamic equilibrium between Ir&#948;+ and Ir0 significantly improves the balance of CO oxidation and NO reduction. O2 promotes the oxidation of Ir0 to Ir&#948;+, whereas SO2 facilitates the reverse, forming a reversible cycle that sustains catalytic efficiency. This work underscores the strategic interplay of Ir valence states and highlights a pathway for designing stable, high&#8208;performance Ir&#8208;based catalysts tailored for CO&#8208;SCR under complex reaction conditions.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Robust Supraparticles for Spatially Orthogonal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the preparation of multicomponent, millimeter&#8208;sized, robust ionic supraparticles via electrostatic assembly within water droplets is developed. This strategy enables the synthesis of spatially orthogonal cascade catalysts in which incompatible acidic, basic, and metal sites are integrated in a single millisphere. The developed catalysts work well in industrially preferred fixed&#8208;bed reactors, exhibiting significantly enhanced cascade catalysis efficiency and outstanding operational stability. 








Abstract
Macroscopically sized supraparticles (SPs) are emerging as cutting&#8208;edge materials for industrial applications because of their unique properties unachievable for their nano&#8208;building blocks, but their effective methods are lacking. Here, a conceptually novel strategy is developed to assemble binary or ternary nanoparticles (NPs) within compartments of droplets through electrostatic interactions, making it possible to facilely fabricate millimeter&#8208;sized multicomponent ionic supraparticles (ISPs). The assembled ISPs possess unexpectedly high mechanical strength (50&#160;N per bead), being amenable to practical applications. The key factors governing the assembly behavior of nano&#8208;building blocks within water droplet compartments are identified through regulating the size and charge density of NPs or ionic strength, providing key insights into the multileveled assembly of NPs beyond the conventional assembly. The strategy is demonstrated to be versatile since a library of tailor&#8208;made ISPs containing multicomponent, diversely shaped, and differently sized NPs can be facilely fabricated. As proof of this concept, it is showcased that this method enables the preparation of spatially orthogonal cascade catalysts by co&#8208;assembling acidic, basic, and metal sites in single millimeter&#8208;scaled particles. The catalysts exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency in a one&#8208;pot cascade synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated nitriles and high operational stability (200&#160;h) in industrially preferred fixed&#8208;bed reactors.

         <title>Double&#8208;Chain Copolymer Network via In Situ Polymerization Enables High&#8208;Stability and Lead&#8208;Safe Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive poly(amide ester) (PAE) with photosensitive properties was designed to construct a unique double&#8208;chain copolymer network via in situ polymerization induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The vast network provides an effective defense to delay the degradation of devices and maximize the suppression of toxic lead leakage. The devices protected by the network achieved a champion efficiency of 26.20% (certified as 25.69%) with excellent stability and lead safety.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made significant progress due to their low cost and high efficiency. However, the long&#8208;term stability and lead toxicity of PSCs remain a huge challenge for further commercialization. Herein, we designed a multifunctional additive, poly(amide ester) (PAE), with photosensitive properties to overcome these difficulties. A unique double&#8208;chain copolymer network can be constructed via in situ polymerization induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The multiple active sites in the polymer chains can passivate various defects and enhance charge transfer. Meanwhile, the vast network provides an effective defense for perovskite to stabilize the internal structure and resist harsh external environments, thus delaying the degradation of devices and maximizing the suppression of toxic lead leakage. Remarkably, the devices protected by the network achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.20% (certified as 25.69%), the unencapsulated devices suppressed 80% of lead leakage, and the encapsulated devices maintained 93% of the initial PCE after 1000&#160;h in a humid and thermal environment (65&#160;&#176;C and 85% RH).

         <title>Synthesis of Linear and Cyclic Poly(allenamer)s by Powerful Cyclic&#8211;Alkyl&#8211;Amino&#8211;Carbene (CAAC) Ruthenium Catalysts and Facile Post&#8208;modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized linear/cyclic poly(allenamer)s (PAs) from cycloallenes by CAAC&#8208;Ru catalysts. Mechanism studies suggested CAAC ligands enhanced the stability of propagating Ru vinylidene, producing various PAs with TON up to 1360 and Mn up to 549&#160;kDa. Their cyclic structure has been characterized by MALS SEC with viscometer. Controlled ROMP of one &#945;&#8208;OTBS cycloallene was achieved using Grubbs G3 catalyst. Lastly, we disclosed facile post&#8208;modifications on PAs with 1&#176; and 2&#176; alcohols in excellent efficiency and selectivity. 








Abstract
Cyclic polymers are very attractive due to their unique properties; however, so far, they have simple and less reactive backbone structures due to synthetic limitations, restricting their further post&#8208;modification. Notably, allenes present a potentially useful platform in polymer chemistry due to their well&#8208;established toolbox in organic chemistry. Nevertheless, the biggest challenge remains in synthesizing poly(allenamer)s with high allene contents or polymerization efficiency, as well as synthesizing different types of cyclic poly(allenamer)s. Herein, we synthesized linear and cyclic poly(allenamer)s via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and ring&#8208;expansion metathesis polymerization (REMP), employing highly efficient cyclic&#8211;alkyl&#8211;amino&#8211;carbene (CAAC) ruthenium catalysts. Mechanistic studies suggested CAAC ligands enhanced stability of propagating Ru vinylidene, enabling various linear and cyclic poly(allenamer)s with turnover number up to 1360 and molecular weight reaching 549&#160;kDa. Their cyclic architecture was thoroughly characterized by multiangle light scattering size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (MALS SEC) with viscometer. Moreover, controlled ROMP of a highly reactive &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic allene was achieved using third&#8208;generation Grubbs' catalyst. Finally, we demonstrated highly efficient and selective post&#8208;modifications on poly(allenamer)s with primary and secondary alcohols. This broadens the scope of cyclic polymers with improved efficiency and structural control, affording a practical platform for diverse macromolecules.

         <title>Amphipathic Antimicrobial Peptides Illuminate a Reciprocal Relationship Between Self&#8208;assembly and Cytolytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we demonstrate a reciprocal relationship between self&#8208;assembly and membrane lytic activity for a class of antimicrobial peptides derived from amphipathic helices. Peptide modifications that stabilized the assembly abrogated membrane activity, while modifications that promoted dynamic behavior induced lytic activity. CryoEM was employed to determine the structure of the AMP assembly, which revealed a unique helical bilayer nanotube. 








Abstract
Amphipathic character, encoded within the polar sequence patterns of antimicrobial peptides, is a critical structural feature that influences membrane disruptive behavior. Similarly, polar sequence patterns induce self&#8208;assembly of amphipathic peptides, which results in the formation of ordered supramolecular structures. The relationship between self&#8208;assembly and membrane activity remains an open question of relevance for the development of effective antimicrobial peptides. Here, we report the structural investigation of a class of lytic peptides that self&#8208;assemble into filamentous nanomaterials. CryoEM analysis was employed to determine the structure of one of the filaments, which revealed that the peptides are self&#8208;assembled into a bilayer nanotube, in which the interaction between layers of amphipathic &#945;&#8208;helices was mediated through hydrophobic interactions. The relative stability of the filament peptide assemblies depended on the influence of sequence modifications on the helical conformation. Antimicrobial assays indicated that cytolytic activity was associated with dynamic disassociation of the filamentous assemblies under the assay conditions. Structural modifications of the peptides that stabilized the filaments abrogated lytic activity. These results illuminate a reciprocal relationship between self&#8208;assembly and antimicrobial activity in this class of amphipathic peptides and that reversible assembly was critical for the observation of biological activity.

         <title>Ferritin&#8208;Inspired Encapsulation and Stabilization of Gold Nanoclusters for High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferritin&#8208;inspired covalent organic cage encapsulates gold nanoclusters, stabilizing them against aggregation while achieving exceptional photothermal conversion efficiency and solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor generation performance. This system demonstrates durability, salt tolerance, and scalability, advancing sustainable solutions for energy and water purification technologies. 








Abstract
Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are highly promising for applications in photothermal conversion due to their exceptional surface area and optical properties. However, their high surface energy often leads to aggregation, compromising stability and performance. To address this, we developed a ferritin&#8208;inspired covalent organic cage with a near&#8208;enclosed cavity to physically stabilize AuNCs. This superphane cage coordinates with Au3&#8314; ions, forming highly stable and uniform AuNCs upon reduction. The encapsulated AuNCs exhibit broad absorption (250&#8211;2500&#160;nm) and achieve remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency of 92.8% under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. At low power densities (0.5&#160;W/cm2), temperatures reach 150 &#176;C, and under one&#8208;sun illumination (1&#160;kW/m2), the solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor generation efficiency reaches 95.1%, with a water evaporation rate of 2.35&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1. Even after 20 seawater desalination cycles, the system maintains a stable evaporation rate of 2.24&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, demonstrating excellent salt tolerance and durability. This ferritin&#8208;inspired strategy offers a robust platform for enhancing the stability and performance of AuNCs, advancing sustainable energy and water purification technologies.

         <title>Rapid and In Situ Active Sites Regeneration for OER Activity Recovery and Greatly Prolonged Water&#8208;Splitting Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high demand for catalyst stability originates from the difficulty in replacing catalysts in assembled electrolyzers. This work proposes an active site regeneration strategy to in situ recover the anodic catalytic activity within the electrolyzer to extend its operational life.








Abstract
Inspired by the continuous regeneration of enzymes in living organisms that enables sustained long&#8208;term enzymatic reactions, we propose an active site regeneration strategy to rapidly and in situ recover the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the electrode through switching anode solution, to substantially prolong the service life of the electrolytic cell. The OER activity of anodic NiFe(S)/NM catalyst synthesized by coating S&#8208;doped NiFe&#8208;LDH on nickel mesh (NM) exhibited excellent initial activity, then experienced gradual active site and activity losses due to the nanosheet detachment from NM after a long&#8208;term OER process. Attractively, such a damaged catalyst and its active sites can be effectively regenerated by an in situ redox reaction followed by electrochemical oxidation through switching the anode into the different solutions, resulting in the full recovery of the OER activity to its initial value. The recovered catalyst (R&#8208;NiFe(S)/NM) retains 90% of the initial activity and can be operated stably for over 80&#160;h at 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 even after four cycles of being damaged and recovered, and the established electrolyzer equipped with in situ recovered catalyst can be operated at the identical current density and almost the same cell voltage to that of the initial one.

         <title>Concurrent Folding and Fluorescent Functionalization of Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles via Heterogeneous Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous photochemistry achieves single&#8208;chain polymer folding alongside concurrent fluorescent functionalization. Amphiphilic heterograft random copolymers pre&#8208;fold into hetero&#8208;aggregates, creating distinct domains that enable two concurrent photochemical processes: intrachain crosslinking via photodimerization in aggregated domains, and fluorescent functionalization via photocyclization to form a green fluorophore in dispersed regions.








Abstract
The controlled folding of synthetic polymers, mimicking the complex behaviors of biomacromolecules, offers the potential to create sophisticated nanostructures with diverse functionalities. Of great significance is the integration of functionalization directly with chain folding, especially through the incorporation of artificial elements not found in nature, which allows unprecedented flexibility in materials design. However, this approach faces significant synthetic challenges, owing to the intricate integration of multiple chemical processes within a single chain. Here, a heterogeneous photochemistry strategy is presented to achieve single&#8208;chain polymer folding alongside concurrent fluorescent functionalization, inspired by the stepwise folding mechanism of green fluorescent protein. This method involves pre&#8208;folding amphiphilic heterograft random copolymers in water, which facilitates heterogeneous aggregation into distinct domains within single&#8208;particle nanostructures, including closely aggregated and molecularly dispersed regions. By employing spatial organization&#8208;dependent photochemical reactivity of cyanostilbene moieties, two concurrent processes are enabled: intrachain crosslinking via photodimerization in aggregated domains and fluorescent functionalization via photocyclization to form a green fluorophore in dispersed regions. Additionally, the incorporation of fluorescent dyes via intrachain excitation energy transfer allows for the modulation of emission properties, extending from green to red, and even including white light, making them promising candidates for bioimaging and related applications.

         <title>Mechanism Switch Between Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover and Radical Buffering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical buffering scenario, which features the reversible radical dissociation from alkyl chromium(III) followed by the metal&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;coupled (MCC) radical addition to form the C&#9472;C bond, is established for Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl alkylation. This new radical bonding model provides an orthogonal avenue to radical&#8208;polar crossover for the design of radical coupling reactions.








Abstract
Radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) is a classic concept that bridges one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron chemistry. It has been widely used in Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl addition reactions to clarify the formation of alkyl chromium(III) intermediate and subsequent carbonyl insertion. Herein, we proposed an orthogonal bonding model, the radical buffering scenario, for Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl alkylation. This radical bonding model features the radical dissociation from the alkyl chromium(III) complex followed by the Cr(II)&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;coupled radical addition to form the C&#9472;C bond. The mechanism switch between the radical and polar bonding models is affected by the radical stability, radical nucleophilicity, radical size, and the presence of an &#945;&#8208;heteroatom or &#945;&#8211;&#960; bond. The collaborative computational and experimental studies have verified the reliability of the radical mechanism. More importantly, we demonstrated that this radical buffering scenario possesses a different stereoselectivity control model from that in the RPC scenario. A general enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity control model derived from the multiple ligand&#8208;radical interactions is thus established for CrCl2/bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric radical addition.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical-polar crossover (RPC) is a classic concept that bridges one- and two-electron chemistry. It has been widely used in Cr-catalyzed carbonyl addition reactions to clarify the formation of alkyl chromium(III) intermediate and subsequent carbonyl insertion. Herein, we proposed an orthogonal bonding model, the radical buffering scenario, for Cr-catalyzed carbonyl alkylation. This radical bonding model features the radical dissociation from the alkyl chromium(III) complex followed by the Cr(II)-carbonyl-coupled radical addition to form the C&#9472;C bond. The mechanism switch between the radical and polar bonding models is affected by the radical stability, radical nucleophilicity, radical size, and the presence of an &#945;-heteroatom or &#945;&#8211;&#960; bond. The collaborative computational and experimental studies have verified the reliability of the radical mechanism. More importantly, we demonstrated that this radical buffering scenario possesses a different stereoselectivity control model from that in the RPC scenario. A general enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity control model derived from the multiple ligand-radical interactions is thus established for CrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/bisoxazoline-catalyzed asymmetric radical addition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and theoretical calculations on a series of model complexes determine the intrinsic tendencies of the late 3d metals to undergo one&#8208;versus two&#8208;electron reactions and unravel the factors controlling the selectivity.








Abstract
Although organometallic complexes of the late 3d elements are known to undergo both one&#8208;and two&#8208;electron reactions, their relative propensities to do so remain poorly understood. To gain direct insight into the competition between these different pathways, we have analyzed the unimolecular gas&#8208;phase reactivity of a series of well&#8208;defined model complexes [(Me3SiCH2)nM]&#8722; (M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu; n&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;4). Applying a combination of tandem&#8208;mass spectrometry, quantum&#8208;chemical computations, and statistical rate&#8208;theory calculations, we find several different fragmentation reactions, among which the homolytic cleavage of metal&#8208;carbon bonds and radical dissociations are particularly prominent. In all cases, these one&#8208;electron reactions are entropically favored. For the ferrate and cobaltate complexes, they are also energetically preferred, which explains their predominance in the corresponding fragmentation experiments. For [(Me3SiCH2)4Ni]&#8722; and, even more so, for [(Me3SiCH2)4Cu]&#8722;, a concerted reductive elimination as a prototypical two&#8208;electron reaction is energetically more favorable and gains in importance. [(Me3SiCH2)3Ni]&#8722; is special in that it has two nearly degenerate spin states, both of which react in different ways. A simple thermochemical analysis shows that the relative order of the first and second bond&#8208;dissociation energies is of key importance in controlling the competition between radical dissociations and concerted reductive eliminations.

         <title>Charge Tuning and Anchor Effect Achieving Stable High&#8208;Voltage Layered Metal Oxides for Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing La into the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode material, the release of lattice oxygen is suppressed due to the charge tuning effect of La. Simultaneously, the as&#8208;formed LaO6 octahedra serve as stable anchors to stabilize the TM layers, ultimately improving the performance of NFM under various extreme conditions.








Abstract
Layered metal oxides (LMOs) that can stably operate at high voltage are vital to developing high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the irreversible oxygen redox reaction of LMOs at the high voltage region (i.e., &gt;4.0&#160;V vs. Na+/Na) will cause serious oxygen evolution and structural instability, and therefore sharp capacity fading. Herein, we report the charge tuning and anchor effect of La doping to enhance the cycling stability of layered NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) under extreme conditions (e.g., high voltage and temperature). The La doping introduces additional negative charges to the oxygen ligands of transition metals (TM) and facilitates charge transfer, thereby reducing oxygen evolution at 4.1&#160;V and enhancing the kinetics of the redox process. Moreover, the as&#8208;formed LaO6 octahedra serve as stable anchors for the TM layers, preventing the formation of lattice nanocracks. As a result, the La&#8208;modified NFM exhibits a high capacity of 173.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C (1C = 150&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and capacity retention of 71.21% at 2.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V after 500 cycles at 1C, which are higher than those of NFM. Additionally, the full cell achieves a high energy density of 438.78&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on cathode mass), with a retention of 70.2% over 400 cycles, implying the great application potential of this concept.

         <title>Selective Masking of Active Sites in Zinc Metal via Galvanic Replacement Reaction for Highly Reversible Ah&#8208;Level Zinc&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>

An ultrathin, hydrophobic copper phosphate (CP) membrane passivates Zn anodes via galvanic replacement, selectively masking active Zn sites to curtail corrosion and dendrite growth. Achieving &gt;11000 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a 1.2&#8209;Ah Zn||I2 pouch cell, this approach promises high&#8209;energy, long&#8209;life aqueous Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Zinc metal anodes suffer from severe dendrite formation and corrosion due to active Zn sites. Here, an ultrathin, hydrophobic copper phosphate (CP) membrane is introduced that selectively masks active Zn sites with electrochemically inactive copper through a galvanic replacement reaction (Zn0 + Cu2+&#160;=&#160;Cu0 + Zn2+). Copper is deliberately chosen for its higher redox potential (Cu2+/Cu0; +0.34&#160;V vs SHE), which effectively inhibits both the corrosion reaction (H+/H2; 0&#160;V vs SHE) and dendrite formation (Zn2+/Zn0; &#8722;0.76&#160;V vs SHE). In this way, the CP layer masks protrusions and grain boundaries on the zinc anode surface with inactive copper, blocking corrosion and dendritic growth, while its hydrophobic top layer reduces water activity at the interface. Benefiting from the deactivated anode surface, the resulting CP/Zn anode demonstrates exceptional stability, sustaining over 11,000 plating/stripping cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98&#160;%. Moreover, a CP/Zn||I2 full cell with an N/P ratio of 1.85 achieves an energy density of 187&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1electrodes, while a 1.2&#8208;Ah pouch cell validates its practical feasibility. This work highlights the importance of designing suitable surface chemistry to protect the Zn metal anode and indicates promising applications in other metal anodes.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Exploration of Chemical Space of MOF&#8208;5 Analogs for Enhanced C2H6/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study outlines a data&#8208;driven approach for identifying potential candidates for effectively separating C2H6/C2H4 mixtures. By integrating machine learning and molecular simulations, the chemical space of MOF&#8208;5 analogs was explored for large C2H6 adsorption capacity and high C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. The most promising MOF was synthesized, and its exceptional C2H6/C2H4 separation capability was validated through experimentation. 








Abstract
Adsorptive separation using C2H6&#8208;selective adsorbents can produce high&#8208;purity C2H4 directly, making it an energy&#8208;efficient separation method with the potential to replace cryogenic distillation. Although many C2H6&#8208;selective MOFs have been reported, developing MOFs with both large C2H6 adsorption capacity and high C2H6/C2H4 selectivity remains challenging. Herein, we present a machine learning&#8211;assisted molecular simulation strategy to explore the C2H6/C2H4 separation capability of pcu&#8208;MOFs isoreticular to MOF&#8208;5. The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm showed high accuracy in predicting the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity and C2H6 uptake, where Henry coefficient ratio (S0) and Henry coefficient of C2H6 (K(C2H6)) were identified as key factors. We further synthesized the top&#8208;performing MOF termed A&#8208;66 and experimentally verified its large C2H6 adsorption capacity and excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation performance. This work provides a valuable strategy for exploring the chemical space of MOF&#8208;5 analogs and identifying promising candidates for the efficient purification of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures.

&lt;p&gt;This study outlines a data-driven approach for identifying potential candidates for effectively separating C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures. By integrating machine learning and molecular simulations, the chemical space of MOF-5 analogs was explored for large C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity and high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. The most promising MOF was synthesized, and its exceptional C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation capability was validated through experimentation.

&lt;p&gt;Adsorptive separation using C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-selective adsorbents can produce high-purity C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; directly, making it an energy-efficient separation method with the potential to replace cryogenic distillation. Although many C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-selective MOFs have been reported, developing MOFs with both large C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity and high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity remains challenging. Herein, we present a machine learning&#8211;assisted molecular simulation strategy to explore the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; separation capability of &lt;b&gt;pcu&lt;/b&gt;-MOFs isoreticular to MOF-5.

         <title>Anchor Peptide&#8208;Based Immobilization Strategy Promote the Applications of Pickering Emulsion System in Natural Products Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designs an anchor peptide&#8208;based immobilization strategy to expand the application of Pickering emulsion to glycosyltransferases (GTs) for the first time, addressing low conversion challenge in aqueous solutions. The glycosylation Pickering emulsion achieved more than 90% conversion of natural product glycosides with high recyclability, offering a practical approach to broaden the applications of natural enzymes in Pickering emulsion.








Abstract
Pickering emulsion systems serve&#160;as an advanced platform for efficient fine chemical production in biphasic enzymatic catalysis, though their applications are currently limited to a few commercial enzyme classes. Herein, we designed an anchor peptide&#8208;based immobilization strategy for Pickering emulsions to achieve efficient glycosylation of natural products by glycosyltransferases (GTs). Firstly, through enzyme mining, natural GTs were utilized to synthesize pharmaceutically important acacetin glucoside and galactoside. However, the best&#8208;performing enzymes, BacGT and BarGT&#8208;3, still showed low conversions for acacetin glucoside (&lt;40%) and galactoside (&lt;10%). Then, Spy chemistry was employed to cyclize these two GTs (Spy_BacGT and Spy_BarGT&#8208;3) for improved robustness, and a Pickering emulsion was formed with the free two Spy_GTs, using 20% 2&#8208;hexanone and 1% mesoporous silica nanoparticles (carriers of mesoporous, CM), achieving 70% and 66% conversions of acacetin glucoside and galactoside, respectively. Further immobilization of the cyclized GTs onto CM via the anchor peptide liquid chromatography peak I (LCI) (Spy_BacGT/BarGT&#8208;3_LCI@CM) further enabled the system to reach more than 90% conversions of acacetin glycosides, retaining 90% conversions after 6&#8211;8 cycles. Moreover, this strategy was applied to GTs exhibiting substrate selectivity, achieving efficient nonselective catalysis. This study provides a simple and efficient immobilization strategy to broaden the applications of the Pickering emulsion system in enzymatic glycosylation.

         <title>Fluorescence of Helical Molecular Springs Under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of &#960;&#8208;extended [n]helicenes (n&#160;=&#160;7 and 9) were selected as model systems for molecular springs to study the relationship between optical properties and molecular structures at high pressure in a diamond anvil cell. Based on experimental and simulation results, the fluorescence properties of these molecular springs were found to be influenced not only by the intermolecular interaction but also by the unique intramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between their overlapping helices.








Abstract
Although the unique structure of helicenes resembles molecular springs, the effects of their extension&#8211;contraction cycles on their properties have rarely been explored. Here, we investigated the fluorescence of two &#960;&#8208;extended [n]helicenes with different helical lengths n, named [7] and [9], under high pressures in a diamond anvil cell. The experimental results showed that compound [9], with a longer helical length, exhibited a more sensitive fluorescence response than [7] in both crystalline and solvated states upon compression. Theoretical calculations reveal that &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlapping at their helices in these molecular springs provides an additional contribution to their fluorescence properties under compression when the overlap becomes sufficiently strong. Our results provide insights into structure&#8211;property relationships of helical molecules under high&#8208;pressure conditions and verify the potential of helicenes as molecular springs for future applications in molecular machines.

         <title>An Olefin Radical Based Thiele's Hydrocarbon Derivative and Macrocyclic Tetraradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent boron&#8208;containing derivative of Thiele's hydrocarbon and a macrocyclic tetraradical were synthesized under mild conditions. They both had an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, and the macrocyclic tetraradical showed considerable tetraradical character and weak macrocyclic anti&#8208;aromaticity with an anticlockwise ring current. This method to construct a cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated tetraradical paves the way for future developments in cyclic polyradicals.








Abstract
A persistent Thiele's hydrocarbon derivative, containing two five&#8208;membered dioxoborocyclic monoradical units bridged by a p&#8208;phenylene moiety, was generated. It exhibits an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a large singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap. A macrocyclic molecule composed of two units of the Thiele's hydrocarbon derivative was also prepared. The macrocyclic molecule possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state but with considerable tetraradical character. The diradical and tetraradical compounds can be viewed as a zwitterionic species containing olefin radical cations. These newly formed compounds are stable in both the solid state and solution under an inert atmosphere for several days. They have been fully investigated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, and SQUID measurements, as well as theoretical calculations.

         <title>Nanopore Confinement&#8208;driven Synchronous Enhancement of Thermal and Mechanical Properties of Phase Change Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing Al2O3 nanopore confinement space effect that synchronously enhances the thermal conductivity and Young's modulus of representative PCMs is corroborated by nanometer resolution thermal and mechanical mapping technique. With the decreasing pore size, the enhancement is more pronounced. MD simulation reveals the underlying reason is the shortening of hydrogen bond that enhances the heat conduction and resistance to deformation of PCMs.







Abstract
Phase change materials (PCM) need highly thermally conductive inorganic porous skeletons to encapsulate and shape to reduce their leakage and enhance their thermal conduction. With the pore size shrinking to nanoscale, the crystallization, kinematic and thermal transport behaviors of PCM would be significantly changed. This work experimentally corroborates an intriguing nanopore confinement space effect that synchronously enhances the thermal conductivity and Young's modulus of representative PCM once encapsulated in nanoporous aluminum oxide using nanometer resolution thermal and mechanical mapping technique. Molecular dynamic simulation further reveals that the shortened hydrogen bond length due to the nanopore confinement facilitates the heat conduction of PCM, which refreshes the routine understanding that smaller space leads to reduction in thermal and mechanical properties.

With the decreasing pore size, the enhancement is more pronounced. MD simulation reveals the underlying reason is the shortening of hydrogen bond that enhances the heat conduction and resistance to deformation of PCMs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase change materials (PCM) need highly thermally conductive inorganic porous skeletons to encapsulate and shape to reduce their leakage and enhance their thermal conduction. With the pore size shrinking to nanoscale, the crystallization, kinematic and thermal transport behaviors of PCM would be significantly changed. This work experimentally corroborates an intriguing &lt;i&gt;nanopore confinement space effect&lt;/i&gt; that synchronously enhances the thermal conductivity and Young's modulus of representative PCM once encapsulated in nanoporous aluminum oxide using nanometer resolution thermal and mechanical mapping technique. Molecular dynamic simulation further reveals that the shortened hydrogen bond length due to the nanopore confinement facilitates the heat conduction of PCM, which refreshes the routine understanding that smaller space leads to reduction in thermal and mechanical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Abiotic Supramolecular Polymers Inside Living Cells via Organocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully abiotic supramolecular polymers (SPs) have been in situ&#8208;synthesized in living cells by virtue of organocatalyst (CAT)&#8208;accelerated intracellular formation and self&#8208;assembly of hydrazone&#8208;based monomers (HA3) from non&#8208;assembling hydrazide (H) and aldehyde (A). The generated SPs are found to restrict intracellular diffusion and interfere with the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby hindering the migration of cells.








Abstract
Cells execute mesmerizing functions using supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed through the self&#8208;assembly of biological precursors. Integration of the vast array of synthetic SPs with living cells would offer a powerful way to remold cellular functions and bridge the gap between synthetic materials and the biological realm, yet remains a challenge because of the lack of robust abiotic SP systems that can be triggered to self&#8208;assemble inside cells. Here, we report how fully abiotic SPs can be synthesized inside living cells via an organocatalysis&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly strategy, and how the in situ&#8208;generated SPs are capable of interfering and can interfere with cellular functions. The incorporation of a nucleophilic organocatalyst (CAT) into living cells accelerates the intracellular conversion of hydrazide (H) and aldehyde&#8208;derived precursors (A) to hydrazone&#8208;based monomers (HA3) that locally self&#8208;assemble into SPs. Interestingly, the in situ&#8208;generated SPs possess ignorable effects on cell viability and proliferation but remarkably hinder cell migration. Furthermore, the presence of SPs is found to retard intracellular diffusion and alter the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, both of which are suggested to be responsible for the hindered cellular migration. In considering the vastly wide range of synthetic SPs, tremendous non&#8208;natural cellular functionalities can be obtained by in situ&#8208;synthesizing SPs.

         <title>A Crystalline Polymer Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered crystalline polymer (PTABQ) was designed as a cathode for SOBs. Benefiting from the crystalline structure with one&#8208;dimensional O&#8208;channels and highly conjugated backbone, PTABQ features high electronic conductivity and fast ion diffusion ability. The as&#8208;prepared PTABQ cathode displays a discharge capacity of 380 mAh g&#8722;1 and nearly 90% capacity retention after ultra&#8208;long 2800 cycles at 3 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;organic batteries (SOBs) are widely recognized as a rising star in large&#8208;scale energy storage technology because of their abundant resources, high energy density, and environmental friendliness. However, the poor cyclability and rate performance due to high solubility and poor conductivity with organic electrode materials limit their practical applications. Here, we constructed a new crystalline polymer, poly(tetraaminobenzoquione) (PTABQ), featuring a layered structure with a conjugated backbone and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Benefiting from the crystalline structure with one&#8208;dimensional O&#8208;channels and highly conjugated backbone, PTABQ shows high electronic conductivity (10&#8722;7 S cm&#8722;1) and fast ion diffusion ability (&#8764;10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1). PTABQ displays a discharge capacity of 380 mAh g&#8722;1 with an average voltage of 2.0&#160;V and nearly 90% capacity retention after ultra&#8208;long 2800 cycles at 3 A g&#8722;1 (&#8764;8 C), which is superior to the reported organic cathode materials. It also exhibits an impressive rate performance of 290 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 A g&#8722;1 (&#8764;20 C). Our work highlights the importance of constructing the crystal structure for effective utilization of active sites and fast ion diffusion, which sheds light on the development of an efficient and sustainable energy storage system.

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Core Thermotropic Liquid Crystal with a Well&#8208;Defined Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a unique strategy to align graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) by using the principles of thermotropic liquid crystallinity to form a GNR&#8208;based thermotropic liquid crystal (GNR&#8208;LC). The inherent self&#8208;assembly capability of GNR&#8208;LC facilitates the homeotropic alignment, thereby establishing efficient 1D charge transport pathways and generating significant hole mobility.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with hierarchical and well&#8208;ordered structures are believed to deliver superior performance in semiconductor device applications. Despite this potential, traditional alignment techniques for GNRs often fall short in producing defect&#8208;free and precisely defined molecular architectures. Here, we introduce a strategy for the fabrication of highly ordered GNR by empowering them with thermotropic liquid crystallinity, utilizing a bottom&#8208;up solution synthesis approach. The resulting GNR liquid crystal (GNR&#8208;LC) molecule can self&#8208;assemble into a hexagonal columnar phase. The homeotropic alignment of GNR&#8208;LC is enabled by the intrinsic self&#8208;assembly capabilities of the thermotropic liquid crystalline state, thereby forming 1D charge transport pathways. Devices incorporating GNR&#8208;LC have demonstrated significantly enhanced hole mobility, reaching up to 2.4 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, underscoring their viability as organic semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Key Fragment in Carbon Schwarzite Unit Cells and Its Triple [6]Helicene Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the conditions of Scholl reactions has enabled the selective synthesis of polycyclic arenes with two related &#960;&#8208;skeletons. One &#960;&#8208;skeleton is a key fragment of theoretical carbon schwarzites, while the other is a triple [6]helicene, which exhibits unique supramolecular structures in the clathrate with chloroform and an absorption dissymmetry factor of 0.015. Both &#960;&#8208;skeletons were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT calculations.








Abstract
This study explores two structurally related &#960;&#8208;skeletons. The &#960;&#8208;skeleton of compounds 1a&#8211;e containing three heptagons represents a key fragment in theoretical carbon schwarzites, while that of 2a&#8211;b is a triple [6]helicene. Compounds 1a&#8211;e were synthesized via Scholl reactions, and using a weaker acid allowed the reaction to stop at an intermediate stage, yielding 2a&#8211;b. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed not only distinct stereochemistry of 1b and 2a but also unique supramolecular assemblies in the clathrate of 2a with chloroform. Compound 1b adopts a saddle&#8208;like geometry, while 2a exhibits a propeller&#8208;like structure with C3 symmetry, consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The &#960;&#8208;skeleton of 1a&#8211;e is flexible, enabling rapid enantiomerization, whereas that of 2a&#8211;b is rigid, allowing resolution of 2b into optically pure forms with an absorption dissymmetry factor as high as 0.015. Comparative analysis shows that presence of seven&#8208;membered rings in 1a&#8211;e does not significantly alter the local aromaticity of the triple [6]helicene framework.

The &#960;-skeleton of &lt;b&gt;1a&#8211;e&lt;/b&gt; is flexible, enabling rapid enantiomerization, whereas that of &lt;b&gt;2a&#8211;b&lt;/b&gt; is rigid, allowing resolution of &lt;b&gt;2b&lt;/b&gt; into optically pure forms with an absorption dissymmetry factor as high as 0.015. Comparative analysis shows that presence of seven-membered rings in &lt;b&gt;1a&#8211;e&lt;/b&gt; does not significantly alter the local aromaticity of the triple [6]helicene framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing Kinetic Features of a Macrocyclization Reaction Using Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Augmented Data</title>

A phrase closely associated with machine learning simulations, &#8220;to predict is not to explain&#8221;, can be rephrased as &#8220;to predict can be to explain&#8221; by integrating physicochemical, least&#8208;squares fitting studies of kinetics with machine learning predictions.








Abstract
We developed a method to reveal the kinetic features of macrocyclization using machine&#8208;learning&#8208;augmented data. Thirty&#8208;six experimental yield datasets were expanded to two hundred datasets through machine learning, enabling kinetic analyses of concentration&#8208;dependent yields. This augmented data allowed the chemistry underlying the predictive black box to be elucidated, providing quantitative insights such as rate constants and effective molarity through least&#8208;squares fitting of differential rate equations. These quantitative measures offered physicochemical explanations for the optimal conditions identified by the machine learning. Additionally, linear relationships between effective molarity and strain energy were found, highlighting key aspects of oligomeric macrocyclization via nickel&#8208;mediated coupling.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Coupled NIR Organic Hybrid Solar Cells Achieving an 84.2% Fill Factor and a 25.2% Efficiency: A Comprehensive Mechanistic Exploration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we eliminate the need for p&#8208;type polymers and achieve a remarkably higher FF (exceeding 84%), thanks to the excellent compatibility between our new NIR dye and PCBM, which enables ultrafast charge separation for the first time.








Abstract
The integration of organic dyes in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to utilize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons remains a challenge. In this study, a selenium&#8208;incorporated ortho&#8208;benzodipyrrole&#8208;based NIR dye CB&#8208;2Se was developed. CB&#8208;2Se, featuring a lower bandgap of 1.35&#160;eV, was blended with PCBM to form a bulk&#8208;heterojunction layer in PSCs for electron extraction and transport. Compared to Y6&#8208;16 acceptor, the removal of the Tz unit in CB&#8208;2Se suppresses self&#8208;aggregation, improving its compatibility with PCBM. A CB&#8208;2Se:PCBM&#8208;incorporated PSC achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.18% with a VOC of 1.164&#160;V, a JSC of 25.71&#160;mA/cm2, a Fill Factor of 84.15%, outperforming that of the PCBM&#8208;only reference device (24.35%) and the PCBM:Y6&#8208;16&#8208;based device (24.49%). The PCBM:CB&#8208;2Se layer enhanced the long&#8208;term stability of PSCs, retaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h under ambient air and thermal conditions. The photophysical interactions between NIR dyes and PSCs have been comprehensively investigated by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Ultrafast exciton separation into free charges occurs within 200 femtoseconds at the interfaces between PCBM and CB&#8208;2Se. For the first time, a transfer of holes from CB&#8208;2Se back to the perovskite was detected, providing valuable insights into the charge dynamics of PSCs utilizing NIR dyes.

         <title>A Site&#8208;Specific Photo&#8208;Crosslinking Proteomics Approach Provides Insights into Noncanonical Pyroptotic Caspase&#8208;4 Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caspase&#8208;4 plays critical roles in mediating noncanonical pyroptosis. We employed a site&#8208;specific photo&#8208;crosslinking proteomics approach to profile caspase&#8208;4 substrates. Among the newly identified substrates, caspase&#8208;5/12 and an important kinase, AKT1, were validated to be cleaved into their active forms. Our findings provide insights into the pathways that interact with the pyroptosis pathway.








Abstract
Inflammatory caspases (1/4/5) are key effectors in the process of pyroptosis by cleaving and activating the pore&#8208;forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). Unlike other caspases whose substrates have been well characterized, the substrates for caspase&#8208;4, which mediate noncanonical pyroptosis, remain poorly understood. Here, we combined noncanonical amino acids, photo&#8208;crosslinking, and proteomics to profile caspase&#8208;4 substrates, enabling the capture of transient protein interactions with activated caspase&#8208;4. A set of new substrates were identified by photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry, revealing the signaling pathway and biological process affected by pyroptosis. Notably, we found that AKT1 is cleaved at D108, which removes its autoinhibition and membrane localization domain, resulting in the release of activated AKT1. Our results also showed the precursor of caspase&#8208;5/12 could be cleaved by caspase&#8208;4 to form the p20/p10 active conformation, uncovering a previously unrecognized pyroptotic caspase cascade. Overall, this study presents an approach for identifying caspase&#8208;4 substrates and offers further understanding of noncanonical pyroptosis.

         <title>Simultaneous Activation of Bicyclobutanes and Indolyl Alcohols with HFIP: Access to Indole&#8208;Fused Bicyclo[3.1.1]Heptanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indole&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.1.1.]heptanes were synthesized by the (3&#160;+&#160;3) annulation of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with indolyl alcohols through dual activation with 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol (HFIP). HFIP activates BCBs to ester enolates and indolyl alcohols to cationic indolenium species. This method is straightforward in operation, proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, and exhibits good functional group compatibility.








Abstract
The concept of strain release to unleash unique reactivity that drives a wide range of synthetically valuable transformations has long intrigued chemists. Among the various strained systems, highly reactive bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) have recently emerged as versatile building blocks for constructing bicyclic scaffolds. Despite the existence of various activation pathways for BCBs, the use of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol (HFIP) to activate BCBs has not been realized so far. Herein, we report the first HFIP&#8208;promoted (3&#160;+&#160;3) annulation of BCBs with indolyl alcohols through the simultaneous activation of both partners, facilitating the metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free synthesis of indole&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes. Mechanistic studies reveal the role of HFIP in activating both components, and the reaction proceeds by an initial (3&#160;+&#160;2) annulation followed by a ring expansion/aromatization cascade.

         <title>Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Halogen&#8208;Doped PbSnS2 with Optimized Thermoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PbSnS2 single crystal was grown using the Bridgman method, and its crystal structure was refined to determine with Pb and Sn atoms occupying a crystallographic site. Subsequently, halogen elements are used as dopants, which enhances the power factor and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity due to the increase in electron concentration and the weakening of the Pb/Sn&#9472;S bond.








Abstract
Here, we investigate PbSnS2, a wide band gap (1.13&#160;eV) compound, as a promising thermoelectric material for power generation. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals its 2D&#8208;layered structure, akin to the GeSe structure type, with Pb and Sn atoms sharing the same crystallographic site. The polycrystalline PbSnS2 exhibits an intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of 0.37&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 573&#160;K. However, the low carrier concentration (n) leads to suboptimal electrical conductivity (&#963;), capping the ZT value at 0.1. Accordingly, the halogen elements (Cl, Br, and I) are employed as the n&#8208;type dopants to improve the n. The DFT results indicate a significant weakening of Pb/Sn&#9472;S bonds upon halogen&#8208;doping, contributing to the observed reduction in &#954;lat. Our analysis indicates the activation of multiconduction band transport driven by halogen substitution. The PbSnS1.96Br0.04 has a high power factor of five times that of intrinsic PbSnS2. Halogen&#8208;doping weakens the Pb/Sn&#9472;S bonds and enhances the phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow &#954;lat of 0.29&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 873&#160;K for PbSnS1.96Br0.04. Consequently, PbSnS1.96Br0.04 achieved a maximum ZT value of 0.82 at 873 K.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Industrial Preparation of SWCNTs&#8208;Confined High&#8208;Entropy Oxides as Self&#8208;Supported Electrodes for Continuous Electrosynthesis</title>

Spatially confined oxidation enables large&#8208;scale synthesis of 1D HEO@SWCNTs with high aspect ratios and mechanical properties, featuring self&#8208;supported electrodes for continuous electrosynthesis with excellent stability and electrochemical activity.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are emerging as highly promising materials for electrochemical applications due to their exceptional electronic properties and active sites. However, the synthesis of 1D HEO with high aspect ratios and mechanical properties has been challenging, particularly on an industrial scale. Herein, we report a spatially confined oxidation (SCO) method to synthesize 1D HEO@SWCNTs with high specific surface area and stability. This method enables the large&#8208;scale production of HEO@SWCNTs, achieving quasi&#8208;industrially quantities in a single batch, and can be extended to seven&#8208;element 1D HEO. The resulting exhibit a homogeneous distribution of elements and a single&#8208;phase solid solution structure, as confirmed by STEM&#8208;EDS and XRD analysis. The Fermi level of SWCNTs is downshifted into the valence band upon HEO doping, enhancing conductivity and electrochemical activity. The HEO@SWCNTs electrode demonstrates superior flexibility and self&#8208;supported properties, making it suitable for large&#8208;scale electrochemical applications. Chronoamperometric measurements reveal excellent stability, maintaining 94% current retention after 20&#160;h. Notably, in the electrochemical epoxidation reaction cycloolefin, the HEO@SWCNTs self&#8208;supported electrode achieves an average FE of 70.7% for epoxy&#8208;cyclohexane over 24&#160;h. This work provides a scalable and versatile approach to the synthesis of self&#8208;supported electrodes for advanced electrochemical systems.

         <title>Unlocking Reactivity of Unprotected Oximes via Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Dual Copper/Organophotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct N&#9472;O bond fragmentation of free oximes is challenging due to their tendency to engage in other side reaction pathways, which severely restricts their utilization in organic synthesis. To overcome this limitation, a novel strategy is developed for the direct cyclization of unprotected oximes with enals through green&#8208;light&#8208;promoted dual copper/photoredox catalysis. This protocol activates free oximes via single&#8208;electron reduction&#8208;induced N&#9472;O bond fragmentation, enabling facile construction of highly functionalized pyridines, including bioactive and solvatochromic fluorescent molecules.








Abstract
Oximes are widely used precursors in synthetic chemistry due to their broad availability and versatile chemical properties, in which N&#9472;O bond fragmentation represents a key reactivity mode. However, these transformations typically require the use of oxygen&#8208;protected oximes, and a general strategy to directly utilize free oximes remains challenging due to their vulnerability to side reaction pathways, rendering low tendency towards N&#9472;OH bond cleavage. Here a unified platform is reported to achieve direct cyclization of unprotected oximes with enals, as well as other coupling partners through dual copper/organophotoredox catalysis under green light irradiation. This protocol enables concurrent activation of both N&#9472;OH and &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds of free oximes to form multisubstituted pyridines with exceeding structural diversity and functional group tolerance. In this process, Rose Bengal serves as a hydrogen atom transfer agent to generate radical intermediates. In the meanwhile, copper catalyst activates of free oximes via single&#8208;electron reduction&#8208;induced N&#9472;O bond fragmentation and controls the selectivity for intermediate trapping. The synthetic utility of this approach is further demonstrated by its successful applications in late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active compounds and rapid assembly of solvatochromic fluorescent materials.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Polarization&#8208;Induced Anisotropy Enhances Protein Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarization of the optical trapping laser has a significant impact on the crystallization of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme. The anisotropy of the high&#8208;concentration domain composed of HEWL molecules/clusters plays a crucial role in the crystallization process. Linear polarization promotes crystallization by inducing strong anisotropy, whereas circular polarization leads to weak anisotropy and minimal enhancement of crystallization.








Abstract
Protein crystallization plays a critical role in structural biology and drug development, driving extensive research into its control. We present a novel approach for manipulating protein crystallization by controlling the anisotropy of the high&#8208;concentration domain (HCD) composed of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) through laser polarization in optical trapping. The anisotropy of the HCD was assessed through fluorescence anisotropy measurements and polarized Raman spectroscopy. The results revealed that linear polarization significantly enhances crystallization efficiency by inducing anisotropy of the HCD and promoting nucleation. In contrast, circular polarization resulted in weak anisotropy with minimal crystallization efficiency. This study highlights the crucial role of protein molecule anisotropy in crystallization under optical trapping conditions, providing a new strategy to optimize laser conditions for various protein molecules and pave the way for the development of innovative crystallization techniques, potentially revolutionizing structural biology and drug discovery efforts.

         <title>Electron Itinerancy Mediated by Oxygen Vacancies Breaks the Inert Electron Chain to Boost Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate synergistic mechanisms between dopants and host matrices remain inadequately elucidated. This study verified that oxygen vacancies (Vo) act as &#8220;electron pumps,&#8221; while Ru1 functions as &#8220;electron buffers,&#8221; thereby successfully enabling &#8220;electron itinerancy&#8221; and activating the [Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Ti] electronic chain. Ultimately facilitating the high activity and stability of the bidirectional self&#8208;regulating characteristics inherent to Li&#8211;O2 batteries throughout the cycling process.








Abstract
The synergistic effect of dopants and oxygen vacancies (Vo) in metal oxides is crucial for enhancing the adsorption and electron transfer processes in lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, Ru single&#8208;atom&#8208;modified TiO2 nanorod array (Ru1&#8211;TiO2&#8722;x) electrocatalysts with abundant Vo were fabricated, serving as an efficient catalyst for Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Experimental and theoretical investigations have demonstrated that Vo functions as an &#8220;electron pump&#8221;, facilitating electron itinerant behavior, while Ru1 serves as an &#8220;electron buffer&#8221; to further activate the [Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Ti] electronic chain. This synergistic interplay endows Li&#8211;O2 batteries with a highly active and stable bidirectional self&#8208;regulating capability during the process of circulation, exhibiting an ultra&#8208;low charge polarization (0.42V) and exceptional cycling stability (1680 h). Vo and Ru1 synergistically modulate the d&#8208;band center at the Ti site to establish an adaptively tunable Ru&#8211;Ti dual&#8208;active site. This adjustment effectively balances the binding strength with the interface oxygen intermediate (*O), thereby significantly reducing the activation barrier. The Hamiltonian layout further revealed the crucial role of remote orbital coupling in maintaining the structural stability. This study not only provides profound insights into Vo&#8208;dependent electron transfer kinetics but also proposes new strategies and theoretical guidance for the activation of inert materials.

&lt;p&gt;The intricate synergistic mechanisms between dopants and host matrices remain inadequately elucidated. This study verified that oxygen vacancies (V&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) act as &#8220;electron pumps,&#8221; while Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; functions as &#8220;electron buffers,&#8221; thereby successfully enabling &#8220;electron itinerancy&#8221; and activating the [Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Ti] electronic chain. Ultimately facilitating the high activity and stability of the bidirectional self-regulating characteristics inherent to Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries throughout the cycling process.

         <title>Synergistic Assembly of Single&#8208;Crystal 2D Porphyrin&#8208;Based Organic Polymers via Dative B&#9472;N Bonds and Halogen Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
The pioneering instances of single&#8208;crystal 2D porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers, namely BN&#8208;Cl and BN&#8208;Br, have been successfully synthesized through an innovative synergistic assembly approach that leverages halogen bonding and dative B&#8211;N interactions. Both BN&#8208;Cl and BN&#8208;Br crystals can attain sizes exceeding 1&#160;mm, making them ideal candidates for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis to elucidate their intricate structures. Remarkably, their single crystals exhibit exceptional photocatalytic performance in generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen, without the necessity of adding sacrificial agents.








Abstract
The rigorous synthetic methodologies have significantly impeded the progress in developing single&#8208;crystal extended organic polymers. Notably, the existence of macroscopic single&#8208;crystalline 2D porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers has never been documented in the literature until now. In this study, we present a groundbreaking example of single&#8208;crystal 2D porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers that are compatible with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD) for precise structural elucidation. Their formation is fundamentally dependent on the synergistic assembly facilitated by dative B&#9472;N bonds and halogen bonds. These crystals exhibit remarkable stability in both air and aqueous environments. Notably, the formation of the B&#8211;N Lewis pairs within these crystals significantly enhances the separation of photogenerated carriers, and their single crystals demonstrate exceptional photocatalytic activity for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen, without the requirement for sacrificial agents. This pioneering discovery establishes a new approach for crystalline control within the realm of organic polymers.

         <title>Reversible CO2 Hydrogenation, Neutron Crystallography, and Hydride Reactivity of a Triiridium Heptahydride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel triiridium heptahydride cluster catalyzes reversible CO2 hydrogenation. Foundational structural and reactivity studies that combine neutron crystallography and spectroscopy, electrochemistry, synthetic studies, and kinetics uncover previously elusive metal&#8211;metal cooperative reactivity that enables a unique approach to functionalizing CO2.








Abstract
The authors report the structure, reactivity, and catalytic utility of a triiridium complex, [Ir3H6(&#956;3&#8208;H)(PN)3]2+ (2&#8208;H, PN = (2&#8208;pyridyl)CH2PBut2). Despite its unusual stability to unsaturated organics, electrophiles, and even CF3SO3D, they find that complex 2&#8208;H catalyzes hydrogenation of CO2 to formate (TONIr&#160;=&#160;9600) and reverse formic acid dehydrogenation (TONIr&#160;=&#160;54&#160;400). The hydrogenation operates via a reactive intermediate [Ir3H4(&#956;&#8208;H)4(PN)3]+ (5). Neutron crystallography and DFT&#8208;supported neutron vibrational spectroscopy of 2&#8208;H reveal Ir&#9472;H bond lengths and elucidate the vibration modes within the Ir3H7 core. Stoichiometric oxidation of 2&#8208;H produces four classes of iridium complexes of varied nuclearity and hydride structure: tetra&#8208; and pentanuclear clusters [Ir3H6(&#956;3&#8208;AuPPh3)(PN)3]2+ (2&#8208;Au) and [Ag{Ir2H4(&#956;&#8208;OAc)(PN)2}2]3+ (6) are generated using AuPPh3+ and AgOAc, respectively. Further oxidation to class [Ir2H3(&#956;&#8208;X)2(PN)2]+ is possible with AgOAc, Hg(OAc)2, or I2. Finally, a TEMPO/HCl system completely oxidizes the hydrides and gives [Ir2Cl4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(PN)2] (11).

         <title>Engineering Solvent&#8208;Coordinated Heterometallic&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wide&#8208;Range Tuning of Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence toward Time&#8208;Resolved Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination solvent and second metal ion costrategy is firstly proposed to synthesize seven robust heterometallic&#8211;organic frameworks (HMOFs, ZnAe&#8208;sol) with ultralong room temperature phosphorescence. Theoretical calculations confirm this strategy can effectively regulate the excited state lifetime of ZnAe&#8208;sol. Based on the diverse afterglow times, the ZnAe&#8208;sol have been used for information encryption and anticounterfeit.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proven promising ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials for anticounterfeit due to their unique optical properties. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve the desired phosphorescent properties due to the limited regulatory methods and indistinct mechanism. Herein, the coordination solvent and second metal ion costrategy is firstly proposed to prepare seven robust heterometallic&#8211;organic frameworks (HMOFs) with two configurations, ZnMg/Ca&#8208;sol [sol&#160;=&#160;H2O, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), and formyldiethylamine (DEF)] and ZnSr/Ba&#8208;H2O, exhibiting different ultralong RTP. The tunable phosphorescence lifetimes within 14.5&#8211;195.4&#160;ms are achieved gradually by altering the type of alkaline earth metals, coordination solvent, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding in the HMOFs. Significantly, the theoretical calculations reveal that the promotion of spin&#8211;orbit coupling by heavy metals and the rigid constraint on the skeleton by solvent result in excellent balance between high phosphorescence quantum yield (&#1060;P) and long lifetime, especially for ZnSr&#8208;H2O (6.8%, 195.4&#160;ms). Depending on the wide&#8208;range tuning of ultralong RTP and great stability, the HMOFs are successfully applied in spatial&#8208;time resolved anticounterfeiting and multilevel information encryption. This work may provide a new approach to designing target phosphorescent materials while resolving the contradiction between high &#1060;P and long lifetime.

Significantly, the theoretical calculations reveal that the promotion of spin&#8211;orbit coupling by heavy metals and the rigid constraint on the skeleton by solvent result in excellent balance between high phosphorescence quantum yield (&lt;i&gt;&#1060;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) and long lifetime, especially for &lt;b&gt;ZnSr-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/b&gt; (6.8%, 195.4&#160;ms). Depending on the wide-range tuning of ultralong RTP and great stability, the HMOFs are successfully applied in spatial-time resolved anticounterfeiting and multilevel information encryption. This work may provide a new approach to designing target phosphorescent materials while resolving the contradiction between high &lt;i&gt;&#1060;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; and long lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Titanium Silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) Catalyst with Abundant Active Ti&#8208;VI Species for Efficient Conversion of Ethylene to Glycol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective dual&#8208;alkali post&#8208;treatment strategy for preparing the bifunctional TS&#8208;1 catalyst involving highly active TiO4&#160;+&#160;Ti&#8208;VI species and enhanced diffusion properties was explored through the clear understanding of Ti species transformation law. The resulting catalyst exhibits an outstanding activity for ethylene to glycol, achieving 98.6&#160;% conversion of H2O2 and 99.8&#160;% selectivity of EG, which is &#8776;2 times of the conventional TS&#8208;1.








Abstract
One&#8208;pot synthesis of glycol from ethylene and H2O2 is simple and environmentally friendly, making it a potential alternative for glycol production. The key to the success of this is to have a bifunctional catalyst with both oxidative activity for ethylene epoxidation and acidic centers for the hydration of ethylene oxide. Typically, the incorporation of trivalent metal ions into titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) framework can provide the two types of active centers, but this often results in decreased oxidative activity. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;chemical post&#8208;treatment regime to introduce acid centers in TS&#8208;1 while simultaneously improving oxidative activity. The combined tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH)&#160;+&#160;(NH4)2CO3 post&#8208;treatment not only produces abundant Ti(OSi)2(OH)4 (Ti&#8208;VI) species from Ti(OSi)4, but also creates internal cavities within TS&#8208;1. Ti&#8208;VI possesses both high oxidative activity and acidic sites. The presence of internal cavities enhances the diffusion on the catalyst as well as increases the accessibility of Ti&#8208;VI species. Consequently, when applied as a catalyst, the combined&#8208;treated TS&#8208;1 demonstrates an outstanding catalytic performance, achieving 98.6&#160;% conversion of H2O2 and 99.8&#160;% selectivity of EG, which is &#8776;2 times of the conventional TS&#8208;1. This study also unveils the formation mechanism of Ti&#8208;VI during the post&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Miniaturized Separation&#8208;Sensing Tandem Enabled by Fluorescent Monoliths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bifunctional porous fluorescent monoliths were synthesized for the first time inside a capillary column, enabling a miniaturized separation&#8208;sensing platform for mixture sensing. This platform not only realizes quantitative analysis for trace water in methanol, a sarin simulant, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and metal ions but also shows baseline separation for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene at nanogram levels.








Abstract
Discriminative sensing for mixture by either fluorescent sensor or other sensors remains a challenge. This issue is attributed to the absence of a separation unit prior to the sensor. Here, we report a new sensing medium, named porous fluorescent monolith, which can separate mixture and meanwhile be integrated into a sensor for discriminative detection. The fluorescent monoliths are prepared via polymerization of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8244;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzaldehyde with diamines. Their photophysical property and hierarchical porosity are systematically studied. On this basis, we set up a separation&#8208;sensing platform and realize quantitative analysis for trace water in methanol, a sarin simulant, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and metal ions. The separation&#8208;sensing platform furthermore demonstrates baseline separation for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, with limit of detections of 86, 54, 19, and 58&#160;ng, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a fluorescent monolith is used to realize a separation&#8208;sensing tandem. We anticipate our findings will provide a promising strategy for producing portable devices with the on&#8208;site discriminative sensing ability for real samples.

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanostructure Monolayers as SERS Substrates for Ultrasensitive Detection of Enantiomer Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral gold nanostructures induced by D&#8208;/L&#8208;cysteine&#8211;leucine (D&#9472;/L&#9472;CL) dipeptide were used as SERS substrates for the detection of chiral molecules, specifically D&#8208;kynurenine (Kyn), which would be a new biomarker of Alzheimer's disease for clinical diagnosis.








Abstract
The early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), requires the identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers. Detecting chiral molecules at concentrations relevant to disease states remains challenging. Herein, a new type of chiral gold nanostructure induced by D&#8208;/L&#8208;cysteine&#8211;leucine dipeptides with a g&#8208;factor of 0.1 was successfully synthesized for enantiomer biomarker detection.&#160;To enhance the discrimination performance, the chiral gold nanostructures were assembled into D&#8208;/L&#8208;Au monolayers. As surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, the D&#8208;/L&#8208;Au monolayers simultaneously deliver molecular structural specificity and enantioselectivity within a single spectrum, which can be a versatile, label&#8208;free chiral discrimination strategy for the detection of D&#8208;/L&#8208;kynurenine (Kyn). The mechanism was unveiled to involve high enantioselective adsorption energies between L&#8208; and D&#8208;Kyn on the lattice plane (221), resulting in enantioselective sensing.&#160;The results showed that the L&#8208;Au monolayer reached a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.7&#160;nm for L&#8208;Kyn, while the D&#8208;Au monolayer reached an LOD of 3.6&#160;nM for D&#8208;Kyn.&#160;Notably, there was a significant difference in D&#8208;Kyn levels between AD patients and healthy individuals in serum samples, a distinction not observed for L&#8208;Kyn, which positioned D&#8208;Kyn as a potential novel biomarker for clinical prediagnosis of AD patients, marking the first report of its kind worldwide.&#160;This study provides a robust tool for advancing biomedical science and clinical diagnostics.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Gold Clusters Based on Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Driven Intercluster Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiomeric pairs of clusters, R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue and R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red, were assembled by intercluster hydrogen bonds. Both solid clusters exhibit reversible CPL transformations in response to organic vapors, temperature, or mechanical stimuli, attributed to the disruption and reformation of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. Their capacity for reversible switching in CPL renders these clusters promising for information encryption applications.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) metal clusters hold significant potential in high&#8208;security encryption and sensing applications, yet the exploration of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven CPL&#8208;active metal clusters remains limited. Here, we report the synthesis of an enantiomeric pair of rhomboid Au4 clusters utilizing chiral R/S&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;5&#8208;methyloxazole&#8208;2&#8208;thione (R/S&#8208;HMMT) ligands. Two enantiomeric pairs of self&#8208;assembled metal clusters R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue and R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red were obtained, by constructing distinct intercluster hydrogen bonds through the use of different crystalline solvents. In R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue, 1,4&#8208;dioxane guest molecules were observed to form a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with the hydroxyl groups of the cluster surface ligands. In contrast, a different hydrogen&#8208;bond network involving the hydroxyl groups of the surface ligands was identified in R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red, resulting in a distinct stacking pattern. The unique intercluster couplings mediated by hydrogen bonds result in R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue exhibiting a blue CPL emission at 466&#160;nm, while R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red shows a dual CPL emission at 446 and 727&#160;nm. Theoretical calculations reveal that hydrogen&#8208;bond driven intercluster couplings in R&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red are significantly stronger than in R&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue. Additionally, both solid R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue and R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red undergo reversible CPL transformations in response to organic vapors, temperature, or mechanical stimuli, due to the destruction and reconstruction of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks.

&lt;p&gt;Two enantiomeric pairs of clusters, &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-blue&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-red&lt;/b&gt;, were assembled by intercluster hydrogen bonds. Both solid clusters exhibit reversible CPL transformations in response to organic vapors, temperature, or mechanical stimuli, attributed to the disruption and reformation of hydrogen-bond networks. Their capacity for reversible switching in CPL renders these clusters promising for information encryption applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) metal clusters hold significant potential in high-security encryption and sensing applications, yet the exploration of hydrogen-bond-driven CPL-active metal clusters remains limited. Here, we report the synthesis of an enantiomeric pair of rhomboid Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; clusters utilizing chiral &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-4-hydroxymethyl-5-methyloxazole-2-thione (&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-HMMT&lt;/b&gt;) ligands. Two enantiomeric pairs of self-assembled metal clusters &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-blue&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-red&lt;/b&gt; were obtained, by constructing distinct intercluster hydrogen bonds through the use of different crystalline solvents. In &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-blue&lt;/b&gt;, 1,4-dioxane guest molecules were observed to form a hydrogen-bond network with the hydroxyl groups of the cluster surface ligands. In contrast, a different hydrogen-bond network involving the hydroxyl groups of the surface ligands was identified in &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-red&lt;/b&gt;, resulting in a distinct stacking pattern. The unique intercluster couplings mediated by hydrogen bonds result in &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-blue&lt;/b&gt; exhibiting a blue CPL emission at 466&#160;nm, while &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-red&lt;/b&gt; shows a dual CPL emission at 446 and 727&#160;nm. Theoretical calculations reveal that hydrogen-bond driven intercluster couplings in &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-red&lt;/b&gt; are significantly stronger than in &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-blue&lt;/b&gt;. Additionally, both solid &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-blue&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R/S&lt;/i&gt;-Au&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(HMMT)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-red&lt;/b&gt; undergo reversible CPL transformations in response to organic vapors, temperature, or mechanical stimuli, due to the destruction and reconstruction of hydrogen-bond networks.

         <title>Allenylidene Phosphonium Ion: An Isoelectronic Phosphorus Analogue of [3]Cumulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first isolobal and isoelectronic incorporation of a phosphorus atom into a [3]cumulene. This trigonal planar phosphonium allenylidene demonstrates exceptional Lewis acidity via a &#960;* acceptor orbital and exhibits unique reactivity through a reversible intramolecular dearomative [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction.








Abstract
Herein, we disclose the synthesis, characterization, and bonding analysis of a crystalline allenylidene phosphonium ion ([R2P&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;CAr2]+) [2]+ (R&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;diisopropylphenylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino, CAr2&#160;=&#160;9&#8208;fluorenylidene), an isolobal analogue of [3]cumulenes. The cation was prepared via methoxide ion abstraction of an alkynyl phosphine 1. Electron rich N&#8208;heterocyclic imine substituents and a &#960; conjugated fluorenyl scaffold together stabilize the resulting three&#8208;coordinate phosphonium center of [2]+. [2]+ features a trigonal planar phosphorus atom which is electrophilic, as evidenced experimentally by the preparation of a Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine, and fluoride ion affinity calculations. Crystallographic and computational investigations of [2]+ support a structure with considerable P&#9552;C double bond character. Furthermore, this P&#9552;C double bond participates in a thermally reversible intramolecular dearomative [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition with an arene moiety of one of its supporting 1,3&#8208;diisopropylphenylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino substituents to give a tetracyclic isomer [2cyclo]+. The isolation of a free [R2P&#9552;C&#9552;C&#9552;CAr2]+ draws further parallels between the properties and reactivity of low&#8208;coordinate phosphorus compounds and related carbon compounds.

         <title>Three Birds with One Stone: Triple Defect Passivation of Tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) Phosphate Enables 25.69% Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional molecule, tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TTFP), is utilized to concurrently address multiple defects on both the top and bottom surfaces of perovskite films, as well as within the perovskite bulk. Consequently, the TTFP&#8208;incorporated p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells exhibit a high efficiency of 25.69%, along with exceptional long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Defect passivation is widely acknowledged as a crucial strategy for enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it remains a formidable challenge to effectively address multiple defects simultaneously on both the top and bottom surfaces of perovskite films, as well as within the bulk, through a facile method. To tackle this dilemma, we have devised a triple passivation strategy, aiming to achieve a holistic passivation of defects at the aforementioned locations using a singular passivator. Specifically, a multifunctional molecule, tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TTFP), is meticulously engineered as an additive in the antisolvent. This approach capitalizes a top&#8208;down gradient distribution of TTFP along the perovskite film, thereby enabling to mitigate the interfacial and bulk defects. Meanwhile, the unique molecular structure of TTFP facilitates simultaneous interactions with both cationic and anionic defects. Additionally, TTFP exerts a pronounced influence on the crystallization kinetics, thereby promoting the formation of highly crystalline perovskite films with substantially enlarged grain sizes. Consequently, the TTFP&#8208;based devices exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.69%, accompanied by a notable improvement in stability. This work represents the successful implementation of comprehensive defect passivation, marking a significant instance in the advancement of efficient and stable PSCs technology.

         <title>Conditional Activation of Protein Therapeutics by Templated Removal of Peptide Nucleic Acid Masking Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the conditional activation of therapeutic proteins utilizing removable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) masking groups is presented. Site&#8208;specific installation of &#8220;Lock&#8221;&#8208;PNAs containing a cleavage thioester linkage enabled steric blockage of receptor binding sites. On&#8208;demand unmasking induced by a complementary &#8220;Key&#8221;&#8208;PNA containing a cysteine residue allowed the controlled release of active proteins.








Abstract
Interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2)&#8208;based therapeutics are emerging as treatments for immunotherapy; however, systemic activation of immune cells hampers their success. Chemically controlling the activity of potent cytokines could mitigate unwanted T cell stimulation and widen their therapeutic window. In this study, we developed a strategy for the conditional activation of proteins utilizing removable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) masking groups. Site&#8208;specific installation of &#8220;Lock&#8221;&#8208;PNAs containing a cleavage thioester linkage enabled steric blockage of receptor binding sites. Rapid unmasking and activation were performed by the addition of a complementary &#8220;Key&#8221;&#8208;PNA containing a cysteine (Cys) residue, which forms a PNA&#8211;PNA duplex leading to a proximity&#8208;accelerated cleavage step and release of the active protein. We exemplified the versatility of this methodology on de novo cytokine neoleukin&#8208;2/15 (Neo&#8208;2/15) through the preparation of PNA conjugates including homodimers, PNA&#8208;stapled conjugates, and dual PNA&#8208;bridged dimers. All constructs were effectively unmasked at low micromolar concentrations. Further, we demonstrated the conditional activation of a masked conjugate of Neo&#8208;2/15 in binding studies to the IL&#8208;2 receptors and in an ex vivo T cell signaling assay displaying a 480&#8208;fold potency increase upon activation. Finally, we extended the strategy to a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) activating the human CD40 receptor demonstrating successful masking and unmasking.

         <title>Using Color to Control Conformation in a Chemical System Containing Multiple Tricyanofuran Photoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a solution of two metastable photoacids with contrasting absorption maxima, the solution pH may be control by varying the wavelength of the visible light input. This pH change governs the interaction between the Zn2+ cation and two competing anionic chiral ligands, detected by a change in circular dichroism (CD) spectra. Variation of the relative proportions of the photoacids allows the construction of an AND/OR logic gate and a wavelength detector.








Abstract
Color vision relies on selective, reversible isomerization by visible light of a mixture of retinyl chromophores in photoreceptor cells. Synthetic molecular mimics of this wavelength&#8208;dependent induction of function are rare, despite the attractiveness of controlling chemical processes solely by the wavelength of incident light. Here, we report a color&#8208;responsive chemical system that is composed of a cationic receptor complex, two competing chiral anionic ligands, and two metastable photoacids with contrasting absorption properties. Tricyanofuran photoacids are synthesized with absorption maxima of varying wavelengths across the whole visible spectrum. Protons released by the photoacids upon selective&#160;irradiation reversibly mask the more basic receptor&#8208;bound ligand, leading to ligand exchange that can be observed as a shift in the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the reporter complex. A &#8776;90&#160;nm separation between the absorbance maxima of the photoacids allowed each to be selectively photoisomerized in the presence of the other. The concentration of released protons, and hence the magnitude of the shift in CD response, are controlled by changing the wavelength of the incident visible light. Different output behaviors (OR/AND logic gates and wavelength detection) are programmed into the system by varying the relative proportions of the photoacids.

Stepwise one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction of the dimeric germole&#8208;ligated sandwich complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy) produces the isostructural complex anions [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; and [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722;, respectively. The additional electrons populate bonding molecular orbitals extending across the {M2Ge2} rings, resulting in four&#8208;center, multielectron bonding.








Abstract
Reduction of the germole&#8208;ligated sandwich complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (1M, M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy) with one or two equivalents of KC8/2.2.2&#8208;cryptand produces [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; (2M) and [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722; (3M), respectively, as salts of [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ (CpGe&#160;= [GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8211;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;, Cpttt&#160;=&#160;1,2,4&#8208;C5tBu3H2. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that the bond lengths within the central {M2Ge2} rings contract markedly with each reduction. Computational analysis reveals the presence of unusual four&#8208;center, multielectron {M2Ge2} bonds, with the reduction increasing the germanium&#8211;germanium and metal&#8211;germanium bond orders while reducing the metal&#8208;Cpttt bond order. Analysis of 2Y by EPR spectroscopy reveals delocalization of the unpaired spin across both yttrium centers. Magnetic measurements on radical&#8208;bridged 2Gd show a large exchange coupling constant of &#8722;95 cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2&#160;J formalism). Single&#8208;molecule magnet behavior is found for the dysprosium&#8211;germole complexes. Complexes 1Y, 2Y, and 3Y can be interconverted by one&#8208;electron oxidation or reduction reactions of 2Y, which itself can also be formed by comproportionation of 1Y and 3Y. The masked divalent reactivity of 3Y is demonstrated through one&#8208;electron reduction of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl to give [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)Y(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)]&#8722; (4Y) and activation of Ph2Se2 to give [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)Y(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)(SePh)]&#8722; (5Y).

         <title>Understanding and Tuning Singlet&#8211;Triplet (S1&#8211;T1) Energy Gaps in Planar Organic Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new framework for tuning singlet&#8211;triplet (S1&#8211;T1) gaps based on electrostatic interactions of the transition density is developed. Three widely applicable design rules for maximizing the singlet&#8211;triplet gap are derived: minimizing the number of electrons, localizing the excitation, and optimizing through&#8208;space interactions.








Abstract
Molecules with large gaps between their first singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) are key components of various modern technologies, most prominently singlet fission photovoltaics and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC). The design of these molecules is hampered by the fact that only limited rules for maximizing &#916;EST exist, other than increasing the overlap between the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO). Here we suggest a new strategy for tuning and maximizing &#916;EST based on a detailed analysis of the underlying quantum mechanical energy terms. We present a model based on the transition density and derive three straightforward design rules: &#916;EST values can be maximized by (i) minimizing the overall number of &#960;&#8208;electrons, (ii) reducing delocalization, and (iii) optimizing specific geometric interactions. The validity of these rules is first exemplified for a set of 18 hydrocarbon backbones before proceeding to a varied set of dye molecules, highlighting their transferability to realistic settings. We believe that the developed rules will provide an enormous boost to the field, enabling rational design instead of trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of going beyond the FMO approximation in designing advanced molecular materials.

         <title>Convergent Assembly of Homo&#8208; and Heterotypic Ubiquitin Chains from Functionalized, Expressed Monomers via Thiol&#8208;Ene Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generating functionalized ubiquitin building blocks via expression in E. coli paves the way to different di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;ubiquitin chains. Light&#8208;induced thiol&#8208;ene click reactions, combined with a masking and protection strategy, are harnessed to establish controlled ubiquitin chain assembly and to allow the semisynthesis of site&#8208;selectively ubiquitylated Tau4.








Abstract
Nature constructs ubiquitin tags with high spatiotemporal precision to execute defined functions that critically rely on the exact molecular composition of the ubiquitin chain. Deciphering the complex ubiquitin code is of paramount interest in biology and requires flexible access to homogeneous ubiquitin tags. As enzymatic approaches suffer from inherent drawbacks such as hardly controllable chain length or connectivity and substrate&#8208;specificity, we apply a combination of expression and chemical tools to assemble ubiquitin chains. Our strategy includes expression of ubiquitin&#8211;intein fusion constructs to obtain large quantities of defined ubiquitin monomers with C&#8208;terminal modifications such as hydrazides and propargylamides. Linkages between ubiquitins are generated via photoinitiated thiol&#8208;ene click (TEC) chemistry, resulting in a nearly native isopeptide bond. We demonstrate the generation of homo&#8208; and heterotypic ubiquitin oligomers with K27, 29, 48, and 63 linkages up to a K48&#8208;linked tetramer. The presented toolbox allows selective installation of ubiquitin on target peptides and proteins with reactive cysteine residues as demonstrated for segments of the microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau. Such segments can be implemented into protein semisyntheses as shown here for ubiquitylated full&#8208;length Tau4. The presented work combines minimal synthetic effort with high fidelity linkage chemistry, paving the way toward homogeneously ubiquitylated proteins.

         <title>Energy Efficiency Limit in CO&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electroreduction and the Method to Advance Toward</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient CO&#8208;electroreduction system featuring high active&#8208;site density with nanometer intersite spacings is designed, which achieves an ultralow full&#8208;cell potential of 1.87&#160;V with CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ and CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 energy efficiencies &gt;50% and 40%, C2+ and C2H4 Faradaic efficiencies &gt;90% and 70% in a 25&#160;cm2 membrane electrode assembly at 4&#160;A.








Abstract
The electrified synthesis of high&#8208;demand feedstocks (C2H4) from CO and H2O through a CO electroreduction (COR) protocol is attractive for large&#8208;scale applications; however, a high reaction potential and modest Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) limit its practical energy efficiency (EE). In this study, a quantitative reaction&#8211;transport model was constructed to analyze the root causes of low performance in COR, which revealed low volumetric exchange current density and limited intermediate surface reaction as key factors, constraining CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ and CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion energetics and selectivities. Consequently, a robust, high active&#8208;site density electrode, featuring nanometer&#8208;scale interspacing between the active, Nafion&#8208;wrapped Cu+&#8211;Cu nanosheet catalysts, was designed. This design increases volumetric COR activity with an efficient intermediate surface reaction mechanism for C2H4 production, substantially lowering the full&#8208;cell COR potential to 1.87&#160;V at 4&#160;A in a 25&#160;cm2 membrane electrode assembly, thereby achieving a record &gt;50% C2+ EE with a 90&#160;&#177;&#160;1% FE along with a &gt;40% C2H4 EE with a 71&#160;&#177;&#160;1% FE throughout stable &gt;100&#160;h operation. Similarly designed high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;activity Bi and Ag nanosheet catalysts enabled &gt;60% and &gt;55% EEs for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electroreduction, demonstrating the broader applicability of our electrochemical activity and EE enhancement concept on a three&#8208;phase interface.

         <title>High Entropy Boosts the Low Temperature Na+&#8208;Storage Performance of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7</title>

Herein, spherical high entropy (HE) Na4Fe2.95(MgCaAlCrMn)0.01(PO4)2P2O7 (HE&#8208;NFPP) cathode materials have been produced by utilizing a spray&#8208;drying combined with solid&#8208;state reaction method. The transition metals (TMs) co&#8208;doping in NFPP through HE strategy can effectively mitigate the volume change and improve its electronic conductivity by reducing the bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. While, the 3D network Na+ ions diffusion channels formed in NFPP by TM ions co&#8208;doping through HE strategy facilitate the Na+ ions diffusion, leading to an enhanced electrode reaction kinetics at low temperatures. 








Abstract
Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is considered a promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the inferior electronic conductivity and inadequate Na+ ions diffusion kinetics of NFPP at low temperatures hinder its practical applications. In this study, high entropy Na4Fe2.95(MgCaAlCrMn)0.01(PO4)2P2O7 (HE&#8208;NFPP) has been synthesized via a spray&#8208;drying and high temperature sintering technique. The incorporation of transition metal (TMs) ions into NFPP through HE strategy facilitates electron transportation by reducing the bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. Meanwhile, the 3D network Na+ ions diffusion channels formed in HE&#8208;NFPP can effectively improve the Na+ ions diffusion efficiency, resulting in enhanced electrode reaction kinetics at low temperatures. Moreover, it leads to a significantly mitigated volume expansion/contraction in HE&#8208;NFPP caused by Na+ ions extraction/insertion during (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the fabricated HE&#8208;NFPP exhibits an excellent rate and cyclic performance at low temperatures.

The catalytic advantages of&#160;covalent organic frameworks&#160;(COFs) for sustainable CO&#8322; utilization have been demonstrated by the photocatalytic reduction of CO&#8322; by&#160;a redox&#8208;active, phenazine&#8208;based COF (Phen&#8208;COF). Phen&#8208;COF efficiently converts CO&#8322; into formate, oxalate, and carbon monoxide under light irradiation, achieving significantly higher yields than a comparable monomer.








Abstract
The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) into valuable products will contribute to sustainable carbon use. Here we report the photocatalytic reduction of CO&#8322; to carbon monoxide, formate, and oxalate ions using a redox&#8208;active phenazine&#8208;based 2D covalent organic framework (Phen&#8208;COF) and its phenazine monomer. Under similar irradiation conditions, Phen&#8208;COF produced 2.9 times more CO, 11 times more formate, and 13 times more oxalate compared to equimolar amounts of the monomeric phenazine, demonstrating that the COF architecture enhances catalytic performance (TOFCOF: 10&#8722;7 s&#8722;1 CO, 10&#8722;8 s&#8722;1 formate, and 10&#8722;11 s&#8722;1 oxalate). Structural analysis, including X&#8208;ray diffraction and N&#8322; porosimetry, confirmed the COF's long&#8208;range order and porosity. Mechanistic studies suggest a sequential formate&#8208;to&#8208;oxalate pathway, with CO and formate acting as intermediates. These results demonstrate the potential of the COF architecture to improve the performance of metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;active aromatic systems such as phenazines to facilitate efficient and selective CO&#8322; conversion under mild conditions.

         <title>Capturing Unstable Carbanionic Intermediates via Halogen Transfer: Base&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Coupling Reactions of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluoromethylarenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The merger of deprotonation and halogenation into compatible processes provides a new strategy for functionalizing traditionally unstable carbanionic intermediates, including &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic carbanions. This capability is leveraged toward the first general method for oxidative coupling of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethylarenes with common pronucleophiles to produce valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic (thio)ethers.








Abstract
We describe how the merger of deprotonation, halogenation, and substitution into compatible processes enables the productive functionalization of traditionally unstable carbanionic intermediates. This strategy enables the first oxidative coupling protocol of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic C&#9472;H bonds with heteronucleophiles. Here, transiently generated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzylic carbanionic intermediates undergo halogen transfer from 2&#8208;bromothiophenes to form electrophilic ArCF2Br compounds for in situ nucleophilic substitution, thereby avoiding &#945;&#8208;fluoride elimination pathways that typically plague &#945;&#8208;fluorocarbanions. This method streamlines the modular synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorobenzyl(thio)ethers and led to the broader realization that halogen transfer to unstable carbanions is an enabling principle across diverse C(sp2)&#9472;H and C(sp3)&#9472;H systems.

         <title>Suppressing Spontaneous Acidic Corrosion and Hydrogen Evolution for Stable Zn//MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of p&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde (M4) into the electrolyte is proposed to mitigate acidic corrosion and hydrogen evolution by regulating the Zn2+ solvation structure. This strategy suppresses side reactions, enhances the reversibility of Zn anode, and extends the lifespan of Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn//MnO2 batteries have attracted significant attention due to their high safety and cost&#8208;effective for potential large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the severe acidic corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Zn anodes in acidic electrolytes pose critical challenges to their practical application. Here, we introduce trace amounts of p&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde (M4) into the electrolyte to address the above anode issues. Leveraging its strong affinity for Zn2+ and H2O, M4 molecules reconstruct the Zn(H2O)62+ solvation sheath and adsorb onto the anode surface, effectively blocking direct contact between H+ and Zn. This dual action significantly mitigates acidic corrosion and HER, enhancing Zn anode reversibility and stability. Benefiting from these merits, symmetric cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability of over 2000 h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2, delivering a fivefold increase in lifespan compared to conventional electrolytic cells. Moreover, Zn//MnO2 batteries demonstrate stable operation for more than 3000 cycles in acidic electrolyte with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 97.3%. The assembled pouch cell delivers a high capacity of 1.68&#160;Ah, maintaining stable operation for over 100 cycles. This work presents unique perspectives and offers promising avenues to improve the stability and efficiency of aqueous battery systems.

         <title>Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Water and Air Over Water&#8208;Dispersible Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design and synthesis of novel anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (AQ&#8208;PAFs) photocatalyst composed of AQ and thiophene&#8208;derived fragments are presented. The interfacial hydrogen bonding enables mono&#8208;dispersion states of these AQ&#8208;PAFs in water&#8208;only systems, which ensures the optimal exposure of catalytically active sites to light and reactants. This catalyst system promotes the optimal H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air in the absence of any organic alcohols, in a high H2O2 production rate of 7124&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. A continuous H2O2 production in AQ&#8208;PAFs&#8208;based flow system for 190&#160;h is also achieved.








Abstract
Photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide from earth&#8208;abundant water and air over organo&#8208;based semiconducting materials is a promising alternative to the traditional anthraquinone (AQ) method. However, the generally hydrophobic nature of organic semiconductors has led to their poor dispersibilities in aqueous systems, which built huge barriers for photon capture and reactant contact in water&#8208;based photocatalysis. Aiming at this issue, this study reports the facile synthesis of AQ&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (AQ&#8208;PAFs) by coupling AQ fragments with thiophene&#8208;derived linkers via robust carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Remarkably, the interfacial hydrogen bonding interactions between water molecules and AQ sites on the surface improve the general hydrophilicity of AQ&#8208;PAFs, which can be well&#8208;dispersed in water&#8208;only systems with uniform particle size distributions. Moreover, the AQ moieties also function as mediators of photoinduced electrons, and the protons produced from water oxidation reaction (WOR), which would kinetically favor the charge separation and subsequent electron transfer reactions. The mono&#8208;dispersed AQ&#8208;PAF photocatalyst promotes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis from water and air under visible light achieving a high productivity of 7124&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the absence of any organic alcohol reagents among organic semiconductor photocatalysts. Furthermore, a continuous H2O2 photosynthesis for 190&#160;h is also achieved in a flow system.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Dipole Coupling Ion&#8208;Dipole Engineering Induced Rational Solvation&#8208;Desolvation Behavior for Constructing Stable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Electric&#8208;dipole coupling ion&#8208;dipole engineering improves the solvation&#8208;desolvation behavior and enables rapid Li+ transfer kinetics in composite polymer electrolytes. The tailored solvation environment promotes the generation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI/CEI and ensures the long&#8208;term cycling stability of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with high ionic conductivity, a wide voltage window, and an ultrastability electrolyte/electrode interface are essential for practical applications of solid lithium&#8208;metal batteries but particularly challenging. The key to overcoming these long&#8208;term obstacles lies in the rational design of the Li+ solvation&#8208;desolvation behavior in SPEs. Herein, we propose an electric&#8208;dipole coupling ion&#8208;dipole strategy to modulate the Li+ solvation structure and enhance Li+ desolvation kinetics. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the free solvents and FSI&#8722; are anchored by ion&#8211;dipole interactions, which facilitate the transfer of Li+ and obtain a wide electrochemical stability window. Coupling the electric&#8208;dipole interactions that promote lithium salt dissociation and rapid ion desolvation contributes to obtaining more mobile Li+ and realizing an inorganic&#8208;rich electrolyte/electrode interface. Benefiting from the above benefits, the assembled lithium symmetric cells and the full cells demonstrate ultralong cycling life. More importantly, full cells with high&#8208;loading cathodes (LiFePO4 with 11.25&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, NCM811 with 7.84&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and pouch cell still display stable cycling. This research gives valuable insights into regulating the solvation&#8208;desolvation behavior in SPEs and facilitates the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li metal batteries.

         <title>Donor&#8208;&#928;&#8208;Acceptor Self&#8208;Adaptive Conjugated Perylene Derivative with Low Solubility, High Capacity, and Swift Ion Transport Kinetics for High Performance Organic Cathode</title>

         <dc:description>
The perylene derivative (DPL), encapsulated within a hollow nanocage terminated with radical PO polymer molecules bearing N&#9472;O radicals, has been conceptualized and designed to showcase high efficiency in potassium storage. This is attributed to the smart construction of helically twisted D&#8208;&#928;&#8208;A self&#8208;adaptive coordination conjugate (TSCC). This design yields exceptional fast&#8208;charging and long durable stability based on the small organic molecules.








Abstract
Organic perylene has been heralded as a promising candidate due to abundant structural diversity and tunability. However, its practical application is severely plagued by facile solubility, scarce redox&#8208;active sites, and andante kinetics behaviors. Herein, the perylene derivative (DPL), i.e., (1,6,7,12&#8208;tetrakis (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxy) perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride) conjugates with polyoxime ester (PO) and is further nested with N, P grafted hollow matrix with anchored Cu single atoms (Cu&#8208;NPC). Such Cu&#8208;NPC@DPL@PO with helically twisted donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) conjugate bridged by Cu atoms was evaluated for K+ storage. Based on extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated structure, intensified interactions between PO and DPL, the minimal solubility of DPL is approached. Together with the core&#8208;shell solvation structure and compact cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) synergistically improves its long lifespan. The abundant stabled radical nitroxides, isocyano groups, and sp&#8208;C sites contribute greatly to the capacity elevation. The twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A self&#8208;adaptive coordination conjugate (TSCC) significantly elevates the distortion toward for the easier tendency to flipping and vibrating and thus expedited kinetics behaviors. Consequently, Cu&#8208;NPC@DPL@PO reconciles the trade&#8208;off between fast&#8208;charging and long cycle stability involved 8&#8208;electron participation. This work exemplifies the importance of advanced design of the molecular scale engineering, including modulated redox&#8208;active sites and high stability toward for fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;lifespan cell devices.

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Switching Between Nonlinear&#8208;Optical&#8208;Active Nitrate&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physical mechanisms of both crystal nucleation and growth and phase transitions have been clarified based on polymorphs &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;(C2H5N4)(NO3), among which &#945;&#8208;phase polymorph exhibits excellent UV NLO properties including a strong SHG response, wide bandgap, and moderate birefringence.








Abstract
Tailored syntheses of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals, particularly those of metastable NCS polymorphs, remain extremely challenging due to the complex interactions of their constituent primitives. In this work, we report the first successful synthesis of a set of three nitrate supramolecular polymorphs (C2H5N4)(NO3) (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phases) by a pH&#8208;modulation secondary&#8208;bond strategy, via the assembly of two types of &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar primitives. Solutions of different pH result in differing orientation of secondary bonds between [C2H5N4] and [NO3] primitives. Secondary bonds dominate the packing of primitives in crystal lattices; varying these secondary bonds can afford NCS or centrosymmetric nitrate supramolecular polymorphs, with 2D &#945;&#8208;phase irreversibly transformed to 2D &#946;&#8208;phase in a solution of appropriate pH. These two polymorphs display distinctly different SHG responses and birefringences, ascribed to variation in stacking of 2D hydrogen&#8208;bond layers resulting from the differing environmental pH. Supramolecular crystal structures comparison and theoretical studies confirm the crucial role played by secondary&#8208;bond interactions between adjacent primitives in the rare nitrate supramolecular polymorphs. This work paves the way in elucidating the supramolecular polymorph transition&#8208;mechanisms and correlating the polymorph structures and their NLO properties, and thereby discloses a new paradigm for development of high&#8208;performance NCS materials with tailored optical properties.

         <title>Helicene&#8208;Fused Propellanes: A Geometrically Rigid Multihelicene Nanocarbon with Amplified Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two geometrically rigid 3D nanocarbons comprising three &#960;&#8208;extended [6]helicene subunits fused on a [3,3,3]propellane have been synthesized and characterized. The resulting nanocarbons display high solubility and a very stable configuration. Notably, the circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties of the nanocarbons are significantly improved relative to the reference &#960;&#8208;extended [6]helicene.








Abstract
Here we report the synthesis of a geometrically distinct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) chiral nanocarbon, which is composed of three &#960;&#8208;extended [6]helicene subunits fused on a [3,3,3]propellane with P,P,M/M,M,P configurations in the helicene subunits. This nanocarbon can isomerize into the thermodynamically more stable isomer with PPP/MMM configurations in the helicene subunits. Both 3D nanocarbons display a very stable configuration, which can be separated by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Notably, the nanocarbons display significantly enhanced chiroptical properties compared to the reference &#960;&#8208;extended [6]helicene, due to the improved alignment of magnetic and electric transition dipole moments. The twisted [6]helicene subunits in the nanocarbon provide concave surfaces that are suitable&#8212;albeit relatively weak&#8212;hosts for C60, forming a 1:2 host&#8208;guest complex in the solid&#8208;state.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pair Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis Enables Cr&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation of Ketones Using Hydrocarbon Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the allylation of ketones using simple alkenes promoted by a chromocene catalyst and an ion&#8208;pair hydrogen atom transfer (IP&#8208;HAT) catalyst. This catalytic system can be applied to a wide range of ketones, including aliphatic ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance.








Abstract
We report a catalytic allylation of ketones using simple hydrocarbon alkenes, enabled by a synergistic system comprising chromocene and photo&#8208;activatable ion&#8208;pair hydrogen atom transfer (IP&#8208;HAT) catalysts derived from a thiophosphoryl imide and N&#8208;heteroaromatics. This catalyst system generates highly nucleophilic, electron&#8208;rich allylchromium(III) species directly from unactivated alkenes, demonstrating broad applicability to various ketones, including aromatic, aliphatic, and multifunctional ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance. The modular design of the IP&#8208;HAT catalysts allows precise tuning of redox potential and HAT activity, with the enhanced reduction potential of the reduced N&#8208;heteroaromatics catalyst playing a pivotal role in efficiently regenerating the electron&#8208;rich chromocene(II) catalyst.

         <title>Size&#8208;Programmable Matteson&#8208;Type Annulation: Construction of Spirocycles from Simple Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iterative boron&#8208;homologation approach is developed to enable programmable syntheses of various carbocycles with different sizes stereoselectively from simple precursors. This method utilizes an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) as a handle to enable intramolecular Matteson&#8208;type couplings, leading to diastereoselective and enantioselective ring formation. It also allows convenient preparation of diverse hard&#8208;to&#8208;make spirocycles from simple cyclic ketones.








Abstract
Despite the recent advancement, Matteson&#8208;type reactions are almost exclusively used to construct linear molecules. Herein we report an iterative boron&#8208;homologation approach to construct various carbocycles from a single precursor. This method utilizes an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) as a handle to enable intramolecular Matteson&#8208;type couplings, leading to diastereoselective and enantioselective ring formation. An intriguing role of the Lewis acid additive is identified. This approach proves to be general for preparing carbocycles with different ring sizes and multiple stereocenters. The annulation processes are also scalable, and the products can undergo various transformations to provide synthetically valuable structural motifs. In addition, this method can be extended to the preparation of diverse hard&#8208;to&#8208;make spirocyclic compounds from simple cyclic ketones. Moreover, an iterative approach to synthesize double spirocycles is also demonstrated.

         <title>Organic Room&#8208;Temperature near&#8208;IR Phosphorescence Harvested by Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Sensitization in Composite Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular energy transfer in bichromophore molecules, regulated by the spatial separation between organic and metal&#8208;containing components, allows to attain room temperature near&#8208;IR phosphorescence of polyaromatic dyes, including those with very low intersystem crossing rates, by using conventional organometallic fragments as sensitizers.








Abstract
A family of coordination compounds with short intramolecular spatial separation between an organic chromophore and a metal center was studied. The specific geometry was realized by means of anthracene&#8208;functionalized tertiary aryl phosphanes. Their silver and gold complexes (1, 2) operate as conventional fluorophores, with photophysical behavior defined by anthracene&#8208;localized allowed transitions. In contrast, bichromophoric species, containing phenyl bipyridine&#8208; (3, 5, 6, 8) or terpyridine&#8208; (4, 7) derived platinum(II) fragments, demonstrate fast intersystem crossing to the triplet state associated with the pincer metal component. Theoretical results corroborated that the short intramolecular distance between the platinum constituent and the adjacent anthracene facilitates subsequent through&#8208;space triplet (T2, pincer fragment)&#8594;triplet (T1, anthracene) energy transfer. This process occurs at a rate of &#8764;1011 s&#8722;1, surpassing the rates of T2&#8594;S0 relaxation. This prevents visible phosphorescence from the platinum(II) motifs but enables near&#8208;IR organic phosphorescence in the solid state, including dyes with very inefficient intersystem&#8208;crossing (ISC). Thus, the composite molecules 3&#8211;8 illustrate a feasible approach to the tunable sensitization of organic dyes and the design of low&#8208;energy triplet emitters.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy for Acidic Water Oxidation at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>

Non&#8208;iridium high&#8208;entropy RuMnFeMoCo alloy catalyst with synergistic effects of different transition metal elements accelerates reaction kinetics and reduces overpotential of acidic oxygen evolution reactions, leading to the superior activity and stability in industrial proton exchange membrane water electrolysis at high current densities.








Abstract
Designing active and cost&#8208;effective catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critically important for improving proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) used in hydrogen production. In this study, we introduce a rapid and straightforward method to synthesize a quinary high&#8208;entropy ruthenium&#8208;based alloy (RuMnFeMoCo) for acidic OER. This iridium&#8208;free catalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 170&#160;mV and exceptional stability, enduring a 1000&#8208;hour durability test at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Microstructural analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the incorporation of corrosion&#8208;resistant elements such as Ru, Mo, and Co enhances the overall stability of the catalyst under acidic conditions. Concurrently, the presence of Mn, Fe, and Co significantly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the OER process, thus accelerating the OER kinetics and lowering the overpotential. The PEMWE employing the RuMnFeMoCo catalyst operates stably at high current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 300&#160;hours with negligible performance degradation. This work illustrates a strategy for designing high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by synergistically integrating the benefits of multiple elements, potentially overcoming the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off typically encountered in the catalyst development.

         <title>Reactions of R3PNNPR3 Species with Boranes: Classical Adducts, FLPs, and Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the substituents, bis&#8208;phosphazine species R3PNNPR3 (R&#160;=&#160;Ph 1, Cy 2) react with boranes to give Lewis acid&#8211;base adducts, generate frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP), or effect single electron transfer affording a frustrated radical pair (FRP). The B(C6F5)3 and BF3 adducts of 1 and the radical salts [R3PNNPR3]&#8226;+[BF4] (R&#160;=&#160;Cy 5b Cy 6) were obtained and studied structurally and computationally.








Abstract
Although the nature of bis&#8208;phosphazine species is of much interest, there are few reports of their reactivity. Herein, we show that the bis&#8208;phosphazine species Ph3PNNPPh3 1 react with Lewis acids to give the Lewis acid adducts Ph3PNN(B(C6F5)3)PPh3 3 and Ph3PN(BF3)N(BF3)PPh3 4. Compound 1 also generates a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) in the presence of BPh3 and thermolysis of 1/BPh3, or 3 at 80&#160;&#176;C released N2 while 4 was stable at 80&#160;&#176;C. In contrast, the species Cy3PNNPCy3 2 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to effect single electron transfer affording a frustrated radical pair (FRP). Independent reactions of 1 and 2 with [Cp2Fe][BF4] gave the corresponding radical salts [R3PNNPR3]&#8226;+[BF4] (R&#160;=&#160;Cy 5b Ph 6).

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the substituents, &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-phosphazine species R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PNNPR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (R&#160;=&#160;Ph &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, Cy &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) react with boranes to give Lewis acid&#8211;base adducts, generate frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP), or effect single electron transfer affording a frustrated radical pair (FRP).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the nature of &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-phosphazine species is of much interest, there are few reports of their reactivity. Herein, we show that the &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-phosphazine species Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PNNPPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; react with Lewis acids to give the Lewis acid adducts Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PNN(B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; also generates a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) in the presence of BPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and thermolysis of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;/BPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; at 80&#160;&#176;C released N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; while &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; was stable at 80&#160;&#176;C. In contrast, the species Cy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PNNPCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>La3ZrGa5O14: Band&#8208;Inversion Strategy in Topology&#8208;Protected Octahedron for Large Nonlinear Response and Wide Bandgap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy involving electron band inversion to enhance the SHG response of LGS while preserving its advantageous wide bandgap. The highly symmetrical ZrO6 structure in the LGZr framework effectively mitigates the bandgap reduction typically associated with cation energy level splitting. This distinctive electronic structure of the Zr4+ facilitates a promising pathway to enhance the SHG response without compromising its essential bandgap characteristics. LGZr crystal exhibits an impressive bandgap of 5.16&#160;eV, a high LDT, a large SHG response, and an extended infrared absorption edge. Our innovative band&#8208;inversion approach not only elucidates the underlying mechanisms but also paves the way for designing new IR NLO crystals.








Abstract
The contradictory relationship between band gaps and the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response constitutes a formidable challenge in the rational design of infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. In oxide&#8208;based crystals, the incorporation of strongly distorted octahedra containing d&#176; cations as central elements are a common approach to enhance SHG responses, while inadvertently leading to a significant decrease in band gaps due to the unfavorable energy level splitting. In this study, an innovative &#8220;4d/5s electron band&#8208;inversion&#8221; strategy is introduced to enhance SHG response while preserving a wide band gap within the octahedron&#8208;symmetry&#8208;protected langasite structure. A novel high&#8208;performance IR NLO crystal, La3ZrGa5O14 (LGZr) is successfully synthesized, where the unoccupied 4d orbitals of the Zr4+ cation underwent a transition from the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band, and the ZrO6 octahedra exhibited minimal distortion. Consequently, LGZr exhibited the largest SHG response observed to date (reaching up to 2.4 &#215; La3Nb0.5Ga5.5O14) and the broadest band gap (5.16&#160;eV) within the langasite family. Furthermore, LGZr is revealed with a remarkable laser damage threshold (1.66&#160;GW/&#8764;cm2) and broad IR transmission capabilities (&#8764;7.8&#160;&#181;m) and supported the growth of centimeter&#8208;sized single crystal. The &#8220;band&#8208;inversion strategy&#8221; offers significant advantages to realize high&#8208;performance IR NLO crystals.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Network Assisted Ultrafast Ion Transport of Anion Exchange Membrane Grafting with Covalent Organic Frameworks for Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COF) grafted polymers not only achieve high ionic transport but also maintain the mechanical stability of the membrane. The tailored COFs contain abundant polar groups, such as &#9472;NH, &#9472;OH, C&#9552;N, and &#9472;O&#9472;, particularly the &#9472;OH groups, which form a well&#8208;developed hydrogen bond network within the membrane, thereby facilitating the rapid transport of hydroxide ions by the Grotthuss mechanism.








Abstract
The development of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) capable of facilitating rapid hydroxide ion transport, while maintaining robust mechanical stability, is considered a key direction for advancing hydrogen energy conversion systems. Herein, we synthesized a series of AEMs by grafting covalent organic frameworks (COFs) onto triphenylpiperidine copolymer and systematically evaluated the performance of AEMs. The tailored COFs, characterized by an extensive hydrogen bond network and high micro&#8208;porosity, created interconnected high&#8208;speed ion transport channels, significantly reducing the resistance to hydroxide ion conduction. Remarkably, the COF&#8208;grafted membranes exhibited superior ionic conductivity compared to pristine triphenylpiperidine, even at lower ion exchange capacities. Additionally, the crystalline and highly rigid structure of the grafted COFs effectively preserved the mechanical stability of the membranes. The optimized COF&#8208;grafted AEMs demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving a peak power density of 1.54&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8211;O2 fuel cells and exceptional current densities of 4.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V in 1&#160;m KOH and 1.1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V in pure water at 80&#160;&#176;C. The present work provides an effective strategy for enhancing AEM performance through the grafting of COFs.

         <title>Low&#8208;Symmetry Face&#8208;Capped Fe(II) Tetrahedra Through Anisotropic Ligand Extension</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the formation of low&#8208;symmetry face&#8208;capped Fe(II) tetrahedra using anisotropic ligand extension is reported. The degree of distortion in the resulting tetrahedra correlates to the stability of the assemblies and the oxidation potentials of their metal ions.








Abstract
Low&#8208;symmetry cages are attractive metallo&#8208;supramolecular targets, as they may possess different characteristics to their higher symmetry analogs. There are no current generalizable routes for the formation of low&#8208;symmetry face&#8208;capped tetrahedra. We report here a strategy using tritopic tris&#8208;bidentate ligands with arms of different lengths to access novel tetrahedra. The use of &#8220;isosceles&#8221; ligands (two arms the same, one different) gives tetragonal disphenoid structures, while a &#8220;scalene&#8221; ligand (all three arms different) gives a rhombic disphenoid structure. In this last case, diastereoselectivity is also achieved. Distortion away from a perfect tetrahedron resulted in alteration of the character of the respective cage. More distorted cages were more prone to loss of structural integrity upon introduction of highly coordinating dimethyl sulfoxide solvent into the cage in acetonitrile solution. As well, increasing distortion was shown to increase the ease of oxidation from Fe(II) to Fe(III) within the cages.

         <title>Aza&#8208;Diphosphazenanes: Inorganic Cyclohexane&#8208;like Connectors with Stereochemically Tunable Exit Vectors for Molecular and Macromolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New aza&#8208;diphosphinanes have been prepared and a model has been developed to explain their cis/trans isomerization. Two&#8208;fold oxidation leads to new aza&#8208;diphosphazenanes as robust inorganic connectors with selectable stereochemistry. Polycondensation reactions results in the first inorganic cyclo&#8208;linear polyphosphazenes which have high&#8208;molecular weights and are air stable, solution processable materials.








Abstract
Molecules that place functional groups at well&#8208;defined angular and radial separations are valued as connectors in synthetic chemistry. Examples include rigid, polyvalent arenes and bicyclic compounds featuring strong C&#9472;C or C&#9472;H bonds. Aliphatic rings are rare in this context due to the challenge of stereochemical control over C&#9472;H functionalization. Here we investigate inorganic cyclohexane&#8208;like P2N4 rings (aza&#8208;diphosphinanes) and develop a model based on negative hyperconjugation and diaxial strain to explain their cis/trans isomerization. Informed by this model, we rationally make 1,4&#8208;disubstituted aza&#8208;diphosphinanes, and stereoselectively oxidize them to aza&#8208;diphosphazenanes, which retain their cis (77&#176;) or trans (180&#176;) covalent exit vectors. These compounds show high stability but nevertheless react as 1,4&#8208;dinucleophiles, supporting their classification as new cyclohexane&#8208;like connectors. Appropriate connector choice in polycondensations enables the divergent synthesis of low&#8208;molecular weight macrocyclic oligomers (from the cis variant) or the first example of high molecular weight cyclo&#8208;linear polyphosphazenes (from the trans variant). These results provide fundamental insight into the stereochemistry of inorganic heterocycles and molecular dimensionality, debut connectors that fill a niche left by organic ones, and offer access to new classes of inorganic polymers for future investigation.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Accelerated Design of High&#8208;Efficient Lithium Adsorbents for Salt Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building on data from previous experiments, we developed a machine learning&#8208;guided screening protocol to rapidly discover efficient doping schemes for aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbents. The recommended doped adsorbent demonstrated a nearly 40% increase in stable adsorption capacity in various brine types, which could significantly advance the Salt Lake&#8208;based lithium extraction industry.








Abstract
The urgent demand for lithium resources has been advancing the development of highly efficient lithium extraction from brines. Aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, as the only one used in the Salt Lake industry, is limited in further improving the extraction efficiency due to the low adsorption capacity. Here, we develop a high&#8208;throughput screening framework via interpretable machine learning (ML) to rapidly determine high&#8208;performance modification strategies for the aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, avoiding the huge workload of traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error doping experiments in view of multiple doping schemes and the unique trade&#8208;off between performance and structural stability. Relying on the recommended modifications, a series of doped adsorbents are prepared and the structure stability and cyclic adsorption performance are verified, which match well with the uncovered correlation between dopant features and adsorption capacity. Experimental validations confirm the screened doped one exhibits an increased stable adsorption capacity by nearly 40% in various types of brine. These results indicate that ML&#8208;accelerated approach can significantly promote the upgrading of lithium resource adsorption industry in Salt Lakes.

         <title>Switching on Supramolecular DNA Junction Binding Using a Human Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulus responsive control of DNA junction formation: Enzyme action cleaves flexible arms from a metallo&#8208;supramolecular cylinder, transforming an inert metallo&#8208;supramolecular structure into an active metallo&#8208;supramolecular agent, and switching on its ability to assemble, bind and stabilize DNA three&#8208;way junction structures.








Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical DNA junction structures are important in human disease and in nucleic acid nanoscience and there is a growing interest in how to bind and modulate them. A key next step is to exert &#8220;on command&#8221; control over such binding. Herein we develop a new metallo&#8208;supramolecular triple&#8208;helicate cylinder agent that is inert to DNA junction binding until activated by human enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and its cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). This inactive cylinder bears six flexible arms each with a quinone group at the termini. Reduction by the enzyme leads to all six arms being removed, transforming the inert cylinder into a new and active metallo&#8208;supramolecular agent that binds junctions. This gives the ability to &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8221; DNA junction formation and binding in response to the presence of two external stimuli &#8211; a human enzyme overexpressed in many disease states, and NADPH &#8211; and absence of inhibitor, giving NAND logic control. Modelling indicates the binding activation originates not in steric unblocking but changes in conformational flexibility. The work provides the foundation for and a route map toward future designs of sophisticated, inert, and supramolecular structures which are transformed by enzymes into new, active, and supramolecular structures for a variety of potential applications.

         <title>Boosting Nonradiative Decay of Boron Difluoride Formazanate Dendrimers for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed a dendrimer engineering strategy to develop the boron difluoride formazanate (BDF) dye BDF&#8208;8OMe for photoacoustic imaging&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy. The multiple identical dendritic units of BDF&#8208;8OMe significantly enhanced the molecular motions, enabling the nanoparticles to release 94.4% of the excited state energy rapidly through nonradiative decay at a rate of 11.7&#160;ps. Under 1064&#160;nm photoirradiation, BDF&#8208;8OMe NPs achieved a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 62.5%, facilitating NIR&#8208;II photothermal theranostics.








Abstract
The development of small molecular dyes excitable in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) is crucial for deep&#8208;tissue penetration and maximum permissible exposure in cancer photothermal theranostics. Herein, we employed a dendrimer engineering strategy to develop the boron difluoride formazanate (BDF) dye BDF&#8208;8OMe for photoacoustic imaging&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy. BDF&#8208;8OMe, characterized by an increased molecular branching degree and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, exhibited broad absorbance peaked at 905&#160;nm, with the absorption tail extending to 1300&#160;nm. Additionally, reorganization energy calculation, molecular dynamics simulation, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the multiple identical dendritic units of BDF&#8208;8OMe significantly enhanced the molecular motions, enabling the nanoparticles (NPs) to rapidly release 94.4% of the excited state energy through nonradiative decay at a rate of 11.7&#160;ps.

         <title>Enhancing Immune Responses Through Modulation of Innate Cell Microenvironments in Lymph Nodes with Virus&#8208;Mimetic Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a versatile platform for co&#8208;delivering antigens and adjuvants, termed virus&#8208;mimetic vaccines (VMVs). VMVs drain into the lymph nodes, recruiting and activating multiple antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs), including CD8+ and CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and neutrophils. This process modulates the innate cell environments, enhancing immune responses.








Abstract
Nanovaccines hold significant promise for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. However, the efficacy of many nanovaccines is often limited by inadequate stimulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Herein, we explore a rational vaccine strategy aimed at modulating innate cell microenvironments within lymph nodes (LNs) to enhance the generation of effective immune responses. Inspired by the structure and natural infection process of viruses, we developed a versatile antigen and adjuvant co&#8208;delivery platform, termed virus&#8208;mimetic vaccines (VMVs). Specifically, polyarginine&#8208;tagged antigens were noncovalently assembled onto nucleic acid nanogels containing cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide via a salt&#8208;bridge zipper mechanism, which can activate Toll&#8208;like receptor 9. Upon intramuscular immunization, VMVs effectively drained into the LNs, recruiting and activating multiple innate cells, including CD8+ dendritic cells (DCs), CD103+ DCs, macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs, and neutrophils.

&lt;p&gt;We develop a versatile platform for co-delivering antigens and adjuvants, termed virus-mimetic vaccines (VMVs). VMVs drain into the lymph nodes, recruiting and activating multiple antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and neutrophils. This process modulates the innate cell environments, enhancing immune responses.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanovaccines hold significant promise for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. However, the efficacy of many nanovaccines is often limited by inadequate stimulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Herein, we explore a rational vaccine strategy aimed at modulating innate cell microenvironments within lymph nodes (LNs) to enhance the generation of effective immune responses. Inspired by the structure and natural infection process of viruses, we developed a versatile antigen and adjuvant co-delivery platform, termed virus-mimetic vaccines (VMVs). Specifically, polyarginine-tagged antigens were noncovalently assembled onto nucleic acid nanogels containing cytosine-phosphate-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide via a salt-bridge zipper mechanism, which can activate Toll-like receptor 9. Upon intramuscular immunization, VMVs effectively drained into the LNs, recruiting and activating multiple innate cells, including CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dendritic cells (DCs), CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DCs, macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs, and neutrophils. This activation modulates the innate cell microenvironments and relocates antigen-presenting cells within LNs, optimizing adaptive immune responses. VMVs induced a robust antigen-specific immune response, characterized by high levels of neutralizing antibodies, augmented memory T cell activity, and enhanced development of germinal center B cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that dynamic modulation of innate cell microenvironments by VMVs leads to optimized generation of both humoral and cellular immunity against infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Color Single&#8208;Molecule Blinking Ratiometricity: A Functional Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging Approach for Resolving Lysosomal pH and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced two&#8208;color single&#8208;molecule blinking ratiometricity (2C&#8208;SMBR) for simultaneous nanoscale imaging and pH measurement in lysosomes. Using two pH&#8208;dependent blinking fluorophores, 2C&#8208;SMBR resolved lysosomal pH heterogeneity (4.0&#8211;6.0) and enabled real&#8208;time correlation of lysosomal dynamics with pH changes, offering new insights into lysosomal function.








Abstract
Fluorescence super&#8208;resolution microscopy has enabled nanoscale imaging of intracellular structures, but it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve structural imaging and quantitative functional characterization, such as pH measurement, within the same region. Here, we introduce two&#8208;color single&#8208;molecule blinking ratiometricity (2C&#8208;SMBR), a novel method that integrates structural and functional imaging with single&#8208;molecule precision. By loading lysosomes with two pH&#8208;dependent spontaneously blinking fluorophores of distinct colors, 2C&#8208;SMBR leverages single&#8208;molecule localization of either fluorophore to achieve nanoscale structural imaging of lysosomes, whereas the ratiometric analysis of blinking dynamics between the two fluorophores provides quantitative pH measurement at the single&#8208;lysosome level. This dual&#8208;color ratiometric approach at the single&#8208;molecule level enables precise quantification of lysosomal pH with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Using 2C&#8208;SMBR, we reveal that lysosomal pH is highly heterogeneous at the single&#8208;lysosome level, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting diverse pH values. Our measurements show a pH range of 4.0&#8211;6.0 within lysosomes, with perinuclear lysosomes averaging a pH of approximately 4.88, whereas peripheral lysosomes average around 5.64. Crucially, 2C&#8208;SMBR enables real&#8208;time correlation between lysosomal dynamics and pH changes, overcoming a key limitation of super&#8208;resolution imaging. This approach not only advances nanoscale organelle characterization but also provides mechanistic insights into lysosomal physiology and function.

         <title>A d&#8208;Electron Deficient Pd Trimer for Exceptional Pyridine Hydrogenation Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel Pd trimer catalyst confined by the TiO2 lattice exhibits a 0.42 d&#8208;electron deficiency, effectively achieving nearly complete conversion of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine (PPY) to 2&#8208;phenylpiperidine (PPD) and maintaining performance over extensive use, with minimal activity or selectivity loss. This remarkable catalytic efficiency is attributed to the constrained adsorption of the pyridyl ring and the stabilization of the negatively charged transition state.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of pyridines containing reducible groups such as 2&#8208;phenylpyridine (PPY) typically has low yields due to strong nitrogen coordination with the metal as well as nonselective and over&#8208;hydrogenation. We report the synthesis of a novel Pd trimer catalyst through confined growth on an ordered mesoporous carrier, characterized by a 0.42 d&#8208;electron deficiency to address this challenge. This catalyst achieved a nearly complete conversion of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine and selectivity to 2&#8208;phenylpiperidine (PPD), maintaining its performance across eight batch cycles and continuous flow in the liquid phase for 800&#160;h with negligible loss of activity or selectivity. We discuss the roles of active sites, including Pd d charge and ensemble structure, in relation to activation entropy, a Hammett study, and the adsorption configuration of the reactant. The exceptional 2&#8208;phenylpyridine hydrogenation activity and selectivity are attributed to the adsorption constraint of the pyridyl ring and the stabilization of the negatively charged transition state in the rate&#8208;determining step produced by the d&#8208;electron deficient Pd trimer.

         <title>Thermal Activation of Asymmetry Amplification Effects in Helical Polymer&#8211;Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of helical polymer&#8208;metal complexes between chiral poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) and metal ions can trigger different asymmetry amplification effects, e.g. screw&#8208;sense enhancement, helix inversion, or the sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers effect. Adding a metal&#8208;scavenger resin (nonreversible) or lowering the temperature (reversible) can reverse the amplification, allowing the development of a metal ion or a temperature switch from a single chiral PPA.








Abstract
Dynamic helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) exhibit different asymmetry amplification effects, e.g., helix inversion or screw&#8208;sense induction, in the presence of different external stimuli such as temperature, solvents, or metal ions that usually operate independently through interaction with the pendant on the monomer repeating units (m.r.u.). In this work, we will demonstrate that the helical structure of a chiral PPA can be tamed by playing with two different external stimuli such as temperature and metal ions. Thus, when a metal ion salt is delivered to a chloroform solution of a chiral PPA to generate a chiral PPA (m.r.u.)/Mn+ complex in a ratio of 1.0/&lt;0.5&#160;mol/mol, a temperature&#8208;responsive material is obtained. Interestingly, when the temperature is lowered to about 278&#8211;283&#160;K, the metal ion uncomplexes, which recovers the initial helical structure adopted by the PPA. This complexation&#8211;decomplexation between the chiral PPA and the metal ions is fully reversible and triggers different asymmetry amplification effects&#8208;helix inversion, screw&#8208;sense induction or Sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;Soldiers (SaS), among others&#8212;, allowing the creation of a temperature&#8208;responsive helical polymer&#8211;metal complex (HPMC) from a metal&#8208;responsive helical polymer.

         <title>Ligand Modulation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Derived Regenerable Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>

An &#945;&#8208;FeOOH coated Ni&#8208;catecholate metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;CAT MOF) catalyst converts into ligand&#8208;coordinated &#947;&#8208;NiFeOOH species during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which can revert to more stable &#945;&#8208;phase counterparts, showing &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;regenerate&#8221; characteristics. The ligand enhances the adsorption energies of oxygenic intermediates, strengthens bonding states, and electron delocalization interactions, leading to superior catalytic OER performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as promising pre&#8208;catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. However, the coordination chemistry of MOF ligands in reconstructed species remains poorly understood, particularly regarding how ligand modulation influences the electronic configurations of catalytic sites. In this study, we present the synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;FeOOH coated Ni&#8208;catecholate MOF composite (FeOOH@Ni&#8208;CAT), which transforms into a ligand&#8208;coordinated &#947;&#8208;NiFeOOH active species during OER. Notably, this active species can revert to its stable &#945;&#8208;phase counterpart, exhibiting an &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;regenerate&#8221; characteristic. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the ligand significantly enhances the adsorption energies of oxygenic intermediates involved in the OER, while also modulating electronic structures by strengthening bonding states and promoting electron delocalization between active sites and intermediates. As a result, the FeOOH@Ni&#8208;CAT pre&#8208;catalyst exhibits exceptional OER performance, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 180&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and impressive durability over 384&#160;h (16 days), leveraging the regenerable property. This work advances the understanding of high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based pre&#8208;catalysts by elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of structural reconstruction during OER and highlighting the role of ligand modulation in improving OER activity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as promising pre-catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. However, the coordination chemistry of MOF ligands in reconstructed species remains poorly understood, particularly regarding how ligand modulation influences the electronic configurations of catalytic sites. In this study, we present the synthesis of an &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FeOOH coated Ni-catecholate MOF composite (FeOOH@Ni-CAT), which transforms into a ligand-coordinated &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-NiFeOOH active species during OER. Notably, this active species can revert to its stable &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-phase counterpart, exhibiting an &#8220;easy-to-regenerate&#8221; characteristic. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the ligand significantly enhances the adsorption energies of oxygenic intermediates involved in the OER, while also modulating electronic structures by strengthening bonding states and promoting electron delocalization between active sites and intermediates. As a result, the FeOOH@Ni-CAT pre-catalyst exhibits exceptional OER performance, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 180&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and impressive durability over 384&#160;h (16 days), leveraging the regenerable property. This work advances the understanding of high-performance MOF-based pre-catalysts by elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of structural reconstruction during OER and highlighting the role of ligand modulation in improving OER activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PPh3/Isocyanide and N2/Isocyanide Exchange: Pathways to Isolable Alkali Metal Keteniminyl Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of isolable keteniminyl anions through substitution of the phosphine ligand in metalated ylides or the N&#8322; ligand in diazomethanides with isocyanides is reported. The anions feature a bent geometry, with the angle decreasing with increasing donor ability of the nitrogen substituent, and exhibit broad applicability in the formation of heterocycles via cycloaddition reactions. 








Abstract
Keteniminyl anions hold significant promise for advancing ketenimine chemistry, yet their isolation has remained elusive until now. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in ligand exchange reactions at carbon, we report the successful synthesis of a series of isolable alkali metal keteniminyl anions through substitution of the phosphine ligand in metalated ylides or the N&#8322; ligand in diazomethanides with isocyanides. The exchange reactions were found to proceed more rapidly with aryl isocyanides than with the more electron&#8208;rich alkyl&#8208;substituted derivatives and were also more efficient when starting from the diazo compounds. The resulting keteniminyl anions exhibit bent geometries, which can be attributed to a donor&#8211;acceptor interaction with the isocyanide, giving rise to a carbone&#8208;like structure. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the nitrogen enhance backbonding, thus leading to larger bending angles and a more pronounced ynamide character as also evidenced by a blue&#8208;shifted ketenimine stretch in the IR spectrum. The keteniminyl anions react efficiently with unsaturated compounds to form a diverse array of heterocycles, highlighting their potential as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Biaryl Phosphates and Phosphonates as Selective Inhibitors of the Transcription Factor STAT4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transcription factor STAT4 is a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases. Here, para&#8208;biaryl phosphates and phosphonates are presented as the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of STAT4. The phosphonate Stafori&#8208;1 selectively stabilizes STAT4 against thermal denaturation in cell lysates, and its cell&#8208;permeable prodrug Pomstafori&#8208;1 selectively inhibits STAT4 activation in cultured human cells at low micromolar concentrations.








Abstract
The transcription factor STAT4 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. Here, we report p&#8208;biaryl phosphates and phosphonates as the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of STAT4. The most potent p&#8208;biaryl phosphate inhibited the protein&#8211;protein interaction domain of STAT4, the SH2 domain, with submicromolar potency (Ki&#160;=&#160;0.35&#160;&#181;M) and 14&#8208;fold selectivity over the closely related family member STAT3, which has the same core peptide binding motif as STAT4. Further development resulted in the phosphatase&#8208;stable inhibitor Stafori&#8208;1, which protected STAT4 but not STAT3, against thermal denaturation in cell lysates. Its cell&#8208;permeable prodrug Pomstafori&#8208;1 selectively inhibited STAT4 phosphorylation in cultured human cells at low micromolar concentrations. Our data open up the possibility of exploring STAT4 as a target protein for small molecules in the treatment of unmet medical needs.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical C&#9472;H Chlorination of Terminal Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free electrochemical method for the chlorination of terminal C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds of alkanes is described. The specific cavity size of organic molecular catalysts ensures high regioselectivity, while the use of inexpensive and readily reusable graphite felt electrodes, a simple electrochemical device, and mild conditions enables the reaction to maintain good efficiency even when applied in flow electrochemistry and used for kilogram&#8208;scale production.








Abstract
Although research on the activation of C&#9472;H bonds in alkanes has been ongoing for decades, there are still few strategies that are both highly selective and suitable for industrial production. Herein, we report a highly selective method for the chlorination of terminal C&#9472;H bonds in alkanes by combining electrochemistry and organocatalysis. The specific cavity size of organic molecular catalysts ensures high regioselectivity, while the use of inexpensive and readily reusable graphite felt electrodes, a simple electrochemical device, and mild conditions enables the reaction to maintain good efficiency even when applied to kilogram&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Durable Anode Catalyst Layer Constructed with Deformable Hollow IrOx Nanospheres in Low&#8208;Iridium PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deformable hollow IrOx nanospheres as a structural&#8208;engineered catalyst architecture achieve an ultralow Ir packing density in anode catalyst layer while maintaining excellent catalytic activity and durability at reduced Ir loadings. The quasi&#8208;ordered close packing of hollow IrOx nanospheres simultaneously maximizes electrochemically active surface area, suppresses particle migration and agglomeration, and establishes percolated electron highways and rapid mass transport channels.








Abstract
Reducing iridium packing density (gIr&#160;cm&#8722;3 electrode) represents a critical pathway to lower geometric Ir loading in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), yet conventional approaches often cause performance issues of anode catalyst layer due to decreased structural stability and limited electron/mass transport efficiency. Here, we present deformable hollow IrOx nanospheres (dh&#8208;IrOx) as a structural&#8208;engineered catalyst architecture that achieves an ultralow Ir packing density (20% of conventional IrO2 nanoparticle&#8208;based electrodes) while maintaining high catalytic activity and durability at reduced Ir loadings. Scalable synthesis of dh&#8208;IrOx via a hard&#8208;template method&#8212;featuring precise SiO2 nanosphere templating and conformal Ir(OH)3 coating&#8212;enables batch production of tens of grams. Through cavity dimension and shell thickness optimization, dh&#8208;IrOx demonstrates excellent mechanical resilience to necessary electrode fabrication stresses, including high&#8208;shear agitation, ultrasonic processing and hot&#8208;pressing. In the anode catalyst layer, the quasi&#8208;ordered close packing of dh&#8208;IrOx nanospheres simultaneously maximizes electrochemically active surface area, suppresses particle migration and agglomeration, and establishes percolated electron highways and rapid mass transport channels. The architected anode delivers high PEMWE performance (e.g., 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 @1.60&#160;V and 2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 @1.75&#160;V@80&#160;&#176;C), while demonstrating excellent operational durability with&#160;&lt;1.5% voltage loss over 3000&#160;h.

         <title>Stable Cobalt&#8211;Zeolite Propane&#8208;Dehydrogenation Catalysts Enabled by Reaction&#8208;Driven Reconstruction</title>

This study demonstrates that reaction&#8208;driven CoOx reconstruction within S&#8208;1 zeolite yields a highly efficient and durable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation that outperforms the previously reported performance of Co&#8208;based catalysts. This work highlights the importance of reaction&#8208;driven reconfiguration in catalyst design and provides a simple strategy for developing high&#8208;performance PDH catalysts.








Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;based catalysts have emerged as promising substitutes for Pt&#8208; and Cr&#8208;based propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts. However, controlling the distribution of Co species and achieving stable active centers remains challenging. Here, we report that reaction&#8208;driven reconstruction of metallic cobalt (Co0) species within pure silica MFI zeolite (S&#8208;1) into CoOx clusters within silanol nests during PDH yields efficient and durable performance. Atomically dispersed CoOx clusters exhibit exceptional durability and high propylene space&#8208;time yield (STY), maintaining an ultrahigh propylene STY of 17.2&#160;mmolC3H6&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 for over 260&#160;h under industrially relevant conditions, surpassing previous cobalt&#8208;based PDH catalysts. Moreover, the catalyst operates stably at 520&#160;&#176;C for 170&#160;h with near&#8208;equilibrium propane conversions. Comprehensive characterizations indicate the dynamic evolution process from the silanol nests effectively capturing and stabilizing Co0 species within S&#8208;1 zeolite, thereby promoting the dynamic formation of CoOx clusters during the PDH process. We also demonstrate that stable Co&#9472;O active centers formed by this unique anchoring strategy improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation and promoting efficient propane dehydrogenation.

         <title>Halogen Bonding as a Tool to Control Morphology and Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces halogen bonding (XB) as an effective strategy for controlling morphology and enhancing charge transport in organic semiconductors. By incorporating directional XB donors with pyridine&#8208;functionalized naphthalene diimide derivatives, improved molecular packing, crystallinity, and electron mobility are achieved. These findings establish XB as a versatile tool for optimizing organic electronic materials. 








Abstract
The solid&#8208;state structure and morphology of organic semiconductors (OSCs) are critical in determining the performance of organic electronic devices, as they directly influence charge carrier mobility. Improved molecular packing and ordering are key to achieving better device performance. While halogen bonding (XB) has been extensively used in supramolecular crystal engineering, its potential for organic electronics remains largely untapped. Here, we show that strong and directional XB can significantly enhance the morphology and optoelectronic properties of a pyridine&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivative. By employing various XB donors with differing interaction strengths and comparing them to a nonbonding reference compound, we achieve a two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in field&#8208;effect mobility and ION&#8208;IOFF ratio. Furthermore, the geometric substitution pattern of the XB donors is found to strongly influence molecular packing, crystalline domain formation, and, ultimately, device performance.

         <title>A Structurally Simple Polymer Donor Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Minimal Energy Losses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>

A structurally simple wide bandgap polymer, PBDCT, based on 3,4&#8208;dicyanothiophene, is developed, which is free from halogen substituents and fused ring electron&#8208;deficient building blocks. A record&#8208;breaking low energy loss of 0.476&#160;eV has been obtained, which resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 19.84%, the highest value achieved by halogen&#8208;free polymer donors in binary organic solar cells to date.








Abstract
Energy loss (Eloss) between optical energy gap (Eg) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (eVoc) sets efficiency upper limits for organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, further breaking the limit of Eloss in OSCs is challenging, especially via structurally simple materials in binary OSCs. Herein, a structurally simple nonhalogenated polymer donor, namely PBDCT, is developed for realizing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs with record&#8208;breaking Eloss. The critical building block 3,4&#8208;dicyanothiophene with high electron affinity results in a deep&#8208;lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which effectively reduces radiative and nonradiative recombination energy losses in OSCs. Meanwhile, the finely tuned alkyl chains offer high crystallinity and low energetic disorder for the polymer, which enables efficient exciton dissociation at low energy loss. Moreover, bi&#8208;continuous crystalline fibrillary network structure is formed in the blend consisting of PBDCT due to the optimal aggregation property of the polymer, which is conducive to exciton diffusion and charge transport. Consequently, the OSC with a record&#8208;breaking low Eloss of 0.476&#160;eV has been achieved, which thereby resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.84%, the highest value achieved by nonhalogenated polymer donors in binary OSCs to date. This work demonstrates the prospect of breaking the limit of Eloss and realizing efficiency breakthroughs in OSCs.

         <title>Fast Sodium Ion Conductivity in Pristine Na8SnP4: Synthesis, Structure and Properties of the Two Polymorphs LT&#8208;Na8SnP4 and HT&#8208;Na8SnP4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion conductors show great promise for use in rechargeable solid&#8208;state batteries due to the high natural abundance of sodium. As a pristine material, Na8SnP4 demonstrates relatively high ionic conductivity and offers significant room for further enhancement, owing to its structure built on well&#8208;known tetrahedral building blocks. Additionally, its existence as both high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature polymorphs provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;property relationship.








Abstract
Achieving high ionic conductivities in solid state electrolytes is crucial for the development of efficient all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries. Considering future availability and sustainability, sodium materials hold promises for an alternative for lithium materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, due to the higher abundance. Here, we report on a sodium phosphide ion conductor Na8SnP4 with a conductivity of 0.53&#160;mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature as a pristine material. Due to the simple tetrahedral SnP4 structure units, Na8SnP4 has potential for optimization through aliovalent substitution as successfully applied in sulfide&#8208;based materials. Na8SnP4 is easily accessible from exclusively abundant elements and forms a high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature polymorph, which further allows for a fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship. Both polymorphs are structurally characterized by synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and MAS&#8211;NMR spectroscopy. Ion conductivity and activation energy for ion mobility is determined by temperature dependent impedance spectroscopy and static 23Na&#8208;NMR measurements. Both MEM analysis of scattering densities as well as structure determination by Rietveld methods hint for ionic motion between special Na positions in the structure and that ion migration proceeds along pathways passing triangular faces of neighboring tetrahedral and octahedral voids. The specific voids filling in the disordered HT&#8208;phase are found to be a crucial parameter for ion migration.

         <title>Exploring the Mechanism of Surface Cationic Vacancy Induces High Activity of Metastable Lattice Oxygen in Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>

A combined approach of H3BO3 treatment, followed by water washing and low&#8208;temperature calcination, is proposed to construct a shell with Li vacancies on the surface of Li&#8208;rich layered cathode materials. Encouragingly, the metastable On&#8722; (0&lt;n&lt;2) is also activated. Consequently, the modified Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and Li1.2Ni0.16Co0.08Mn0.56O2 exhibit an initial coulombic efficiency of up to about 88&#8201;%, significantly higher than traditional LMLOs (~70&#8201;%).







Abstract
Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides exhibit high specific capacity due to the cationic and anionic reaction process during high&#8208;voltage cycling (&#8805;4.6&#8197;V). However, they face challenges such as low initial coulombic efficiency (~70&#8201;%) and poor cycling stability. Here, we propose a combination of H3BO3 treatment and low temperature calcination to construct a shell with cationic vacancy on the surface of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 (LLNMO). The H3BO3 treatment produces cationic vacancy and lattice distortion, forming an oxidized On&#8722; (0&lt;n&lt;2) on the surface, accompanied by electrons redistribution. Low temperature calcination eliminates lattice distortion, activates metastable On&#8722; and promotes coherent lattice formation. In addition, the cationic vacancy shell reduces the diffusion energy barrier of Li+, allowing more Li+ and oxygen to participate in deeper reactions and increasing the oxidation depth of oxygen. The modified material (LLNMO&#8208;H10&#8208;200) exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of up to 88&#8201;% and a capacity of 256&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, similar enhancements were observed with Co&#8208;containing lithium&#8208;rich materials, with a 280&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 discharge capacity and 89&#8201;% coulombic efficiency. These findings reveal the correlation between cationic vacancy, metastable oxygen activation and bulk phase activity, offering a novel approach to enhancing the initial coulombic efficiency and cycle stability of Li&#8208;rich materials.

         <title>Silylation of Aryl and Alkyl Chlorides by a Seven&#8208;Membered Dialkoxysilyl Group Si(pan)Me via an In Situ Generated Silylpotassium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals a facile silylation protocol that enables the delivery of a stable and activatable dioxasilepanyl group, Si(pan)Me, to aryl and alkyl chlorides. Of note is the X&#8208;ray structure of 18&#8208;C&#8208;6&#183;K&#8211;Si(pan)Me, which elucidates a pivotal silylpotassium intermediate. Our experimental mechanistic studies reveal a halogen&#8208;metal exchange (HME) pathway, with a partial SN2 mechanism for alkyl substrates, supported by computational rationale.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;containing compounds are increasingly vital in pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, yet existing silylation methods face critical limitations: poor reactivity of unactivated silanes and instability of activated silylation reagents and their products. Here, we present a seven&#8208;membered dialkoxysilyl unit, dioxasilepane, abbreviated as Si(pan), that combines exceptional stability with controllable reactivity. We demonstrate a versatile method for Si(pan)Me incorporation into organic molecules through reactions with diverse aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl chlorides. Notably, we have isolated and structurally characterized the key silylpotassium intermediate as its 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 complex through X&#8208;ray crystallography. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that this silylpotassium species mediates the transformation primarily through halogen&#8208;metal exchange (HME). Computational investigations confirm the HME pathway while suggesting a concurrent SN2 mechanism for specific primary alkyl chlorides. This methodology establishes Si(pan) as a robust building block for constructing silicon&#8208;containing molecular frameworks, addressing a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Enabled Asymmetric C&#9472;H Acylation of Trifluoroethanol by Dual Nickel/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric C&#9472;H acylation of trifluoroethanol under nickel/photoredox cocatalysis gave products that could be further reduced through a one&#8208;pot process to generate fluoroalkyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;antidiols with adjacent stereocenters. Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the transition state control the stereoselectivity of the reaction. 








Abstract
Serving as a bioisostere for methyl groups, the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) has become a key area of interest in pharmaceutical lead optimization for its unique combination of steric bulk and high electronegativity. Recognizing the widespread application of optically pure &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy carbon centers in drug molecules, the introduction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxytrifluoroethyl groups into stereogenic centers holds significant potential. Herein, we describe an asymmetric trifluoroalkylation protocol utilizing nickel/photoredox cocatalysis to synthesize enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl acyloins via a 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom migration strategy. Density functional theory calculations guided the reaction design, revealing hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the transition state that control the chiral outcome. The resulting products can be further reduced through a one&#8208;pot process to yield fluoroalkyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols with adjacent stereocenters. This hydrogen&#8208;bonding synergistic methodology demonstrates excellent stereochemical control, mild conditions, and broad functional group tolerance, enabling the efficient asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of complex molecules and offering new avenues for chiral drug development.

         <title>Iridium(III) Carbene Complexes Featuring Either Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) or Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer (TSCT) Blue Luminescence</title>

Ir(III) complexes with contrasting MLCT or TSCT transition characters were synthesized, among which the TSCT emitter f&#8208;ct13b gave PhOLED device with an EQEmax of 22.2% and CIExy of (0.155, 0.120). Additionally, hyper&#8208;OLED bearing another TSCT sensitizer, f&#8208;ct13c and v&#8208;DABNA terminal emitter, achieved a narrowband blue hyperphosphorescence with EQEmax of 28.2% and CIExy of (0.123, 0.129), highlighting the effectiveness of TSCT phosphor in realizing blue electroluminescence.








Abstract
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT), rather than the commonly postulated metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) process, was proposed in getting the lowest lying excited state of newly designed Ir(III) blue phosphors. Accordingly, two benzo[d]imidazolylidene pro&#8208;chelates, L12H2+ and L13H2+, one with two cyano groups at the peri&#8208;benzo and N&#8208;aryl pendent and the other with its peri&#8208;cyano group being replaced with methyl substituent, were employed in syntheses of Ir(III) complexes f&#8208;ct12b,c and f&#8208;ct13b,c. Notably, complexes f&#8208;ct12b,c exhibited the traditional MLCT process, while f&#8208;ct13b,c were dominated by the TSCT transition, resulting in a smaller S1&#8211;T1 energy gap &#916;EST. Next, it prompted us to explore whether their long&#8208;lived emission originated from phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Although temperature&#8208;dependent emission studies favor TADF, the unresolved concerns are still discussed in depth. For application, OLED with the TSCT&#8208;based dopant f&#8208;ct13b delivered a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.2% and a max. luminance of 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8210;2, together with CIExy of (0.155, 0.120). Moreover, the hyper&#8208;OLED with f&#8208;ct13c sensitizer and v&#8208;DABNA terminal emitter exhibited a max. EQE of 28.2% and CIExy of (0.123, 0.129), demonstrating a new approach in developing efficient Ir(III) blue phosphors.

         <title>Combining the Active Site Construction and Microenvironment Regulation via a Bio&#8208;Inspired Strategy Boosts CO2 Electroreduction Under Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic decorating layer based on the biomimetic strategy is constructed to provide sufficient channels for reactant transport while maintaining hydrophobicity simultaneously, which are favorable for the CO2 electroreduction toward C2+ products with high efficiencies and long&#8208;term stability. 








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 reaction (CO2RR) is recognized as a complicated process involving multiple steps on the gas&#8211;electrode&#8208;solution interface. Hence, it is equally important to construct highly efficient active sites and regulate favorable microenvironments around the reaction interface. Herein, we propose a bio&#8208;inspired strategy to address both issues simultaneously in one catalytic system. We first evaporate isolated Au sites on the surface of the Cu layer to tune the intrinsic activity of the Cu catalyst, then fix hexanethiol (HEX) molecules onto the Au sites through Au&#9472;S bonds to regulate reaction microenvironments (CuAu&#8208;HEX). Specifically, those Au/Cu bimetallic active sites can decrease the energy barriers for the C&#9472;C coupling procedure and accelerate the generation of multicarbon products. More importantly, those stable and nondense HEX molecules on Au sites can ensure long&#8208;term hydrophobicity and high local concentration of CO2 around active sites, rather than block the channels for reactant transfer. Consequently, this unique structure is favorable for the pathways toward multicarbon products, generating &gt;70% Faradaic efficiencies (FE) for multicarbon products even at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Intriguingly, this modification layer is very similar to animal hair follicles, which might present a new strategy to regulate the interfacial environments in various electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Realization of Tunable Ferroelectricity in Perovskite Crystals for Multidirectional Self&#8208;Driven Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper investigates the design of 2D perovskite ferroelectrics OA2Csn&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 with layer&#8208;dependent properties. Importantly, the unique multiaxial polarization combined with the enhanced transport of photon&#8208;generated carrier enables OA2Cs2Pb3Br10 to show high&#8208;performance self&#8208;driven photodetection in multiple directions. The study presents a layer&#8208;regulation strategy to efficiently regulate ferroelectric polarization for next&#8208;generation intelligent photodetection.








Abstract
Halide perovskite ferroelectrics endowed with a distinctive spontaneous polarization effect have been regarded as prospective electroactive materials and are prevalently utilized in solar cells, photoelectric detection, and other domains. Among them, multipolar&#8208;axis ferroelectrics featuring multiple equivalent polarization directions are particularly desirable for diverse areas of applications. Nevertheless, the design and regulation of multipolar axis perovskite ferroelectrics remains a significant challenge. Here, guided by the strategy of layer regulation, we successfully designed and regulated a series of 2D homologous perovskites OA2Csn&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 (OA&#160;=&#160;n&#8208;octylammonium, n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;3). Notably, OA2Csn&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 exhibits layer&#8208;dependent ferroelectricity: OA2PbBr4 exhibits non&#8208;ferroelectricity, OA2CsPb2Br7 displays uniaxial ferroelectricity, while OA2Cs2Pb3Br10 has multiaxial ferroelectricity. Moreover, the devices fabricated based on OA2Cs2Pb3Br10 achieve high&#8208;performance self&#8208;driven photodetection in multiple directions. This precise layer&#8208;regulation strategy offers an efficient approach to obtaining and regulating multipolar&#8208;axis perovskite ferroelectrics, presenting the potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of S(IV)&#8208;Stereogenic Sulfinimidate Esters by Sulfinamide Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfinamide activation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of S&#8208;chiral sulfinimidate esters by employing a naturally occurring cinchonidine catalyst is disclosed. The catalytically obtained enantioenriched sulfinimidate esters offer a versatile platform for the construction of a wide range of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfilimines and sulfoximines.








Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled approaches for the synthesis of S&#8208;stereogenic compounds have propelled significant advancements in asymmetric synthetic chemistry. In contrast, control over S&#8208;heteroatom (e.g., O) bond formation to access sulfinimidate esters remains an underexplored area. Drawing inspiration from recent progress in electrophilic amide activation, herein, we present a sulfinamide activation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of S&#8208;chiral sulfinimidate esters. This method involves the activation of racemic sulfinamides by sulfonyl chloride, yielding a reactive aza&#8208;sulfinyl mixed anhydride intermediate. Employing a naturally occurring cinchonidine catalyst, the process achieves excellent enantiocontrol in the subsequent formation of S&#9472;O bonds with alcohols involving a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process, resulting in sulfinimidate esters with excellent enantioselectivity. The catalytically obtained enantioenriched sulfinimidate esters offer a versatile platform for the construction of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfilimines and sulfoximines, with promising applications in asymmetric synthesis and drug discovery.

Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed stereochemical editing of tertiary C&#9472;H bonds of steroids enabled concise syntheses of (25S)&#8208;&#916;7&#8208;dafachronic acid, demissidine, and smilagenin. Acetate protection of the hydroxyl group in the synthesis of (25S)&#8208;&#916;7&#8208;dafachronic acid, protonation of the amino group in the synthesis of demissidine, and steric hindrance control in the synthesis of smilagenin provided robust solutions to the issue of the regioselectivity associated with hydrogen atom abstraction.

         <title>Modulating Binding Strength and Acidity of Benzene&#8208;Derivative Ligands Enables Efficient and Hysteresis&#8208;Free Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically explored the impact of binding strength and acidity of a library of molecules on the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite surface to fabricate efficient and hysteresis&#8208;free perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Ultimately, (2&#8208;phenylethyl)phosphonic acid (PEPA) has the optimal passivation effect and enhances the charge extraction capability, achieving a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 32.13% (certified 31.72%) for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Passivating defects at the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite/C60 interface without impeding interfacial charge transport can effectively enhance the efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). Herein, we study the impact of benzene&#8208;derivative ligands with elaborately modulated binding strength and acidity on wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites for high&#8208;performance perovskite/silicon TSCs. Specifically, the acidity/alkalinity and binding strength are preliminarily tuned using different functional groups of &#8208;PO&#8323;H&#8322;, &#8208;COOH, and &#8208;NH&#8322;, and further finely adjusted by altering the chain lengths between the benzene ring and the functional groups. The results show that strong binding is indispensable for effectively suppressing voltage loss. However, the commonly used benzylphosphonic acid (BPPA) for firm surface binding exhibits too strong acidity that can etch the perovskite surface, resulting in halide&#8208;vacancy defects and pronounced hysteresis. Increasing the side chain length of BPPA to (2&#8208;phenylethyl)phosphonic acid not only enables a suitable acid dissociation constant (pKa) to avoid acid&#8208;induced etching but also achieves robust anchoring to the perovskite surface with a parallel adsorption orientation, which reduces the charge transport barrier at the interface. These properties enable strong&#8208;adsorption surface termination (SAST) of the perovskite surface while preventing acid&#8208;induced etching. As a result, the SAST strategy achieves a remarkable efficiency of 32.13% (certified 31.72%) for hysteresis&#8208;free perovskite/silicon TSCs.

Herein, we study the impact of benzene-derivative ligands with elaborately modulated binding strength and acidity on wide-bandgap perovskites for high-performance perovskite/silicon TSCs.

The results show that strong binding is indispensable for effectively suppressing voltage loss. However, the commonly used benzylphosphonic acid (BPPA) for firm surface binding exhibits too strong acidity that can etch the perovskite surface, resulting in halide-vacancy defects and pronounced hysteresis.

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Control of Chiral Phases for Higher Performance and Inverted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of calamitic axially chiral luminescent liquid crystals with high&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were synthesized. A near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (98.4%) and high glum value (up to 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) were achieved with an exceptional figure of merit of 0.02. Crucially, in situ CPL switching is realized through pathway&#8208;dependent phase control, which driven by slight excited&#8208;state molecular packing differences, enables reversible CPL tuning without altering molecular chirality.








Abstract
Chiral luminescent materials have garnered increasing attention for their exceptional ability to emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) along with their excellent applications. Here, a cyclohexylidene scaffold was conceptualized as a chiral source for developing higher&#8208;performance CPL materials in terms of simultaneously enhanced quantum yields (PLQYs) and dissymmetry factor. It was found that the axially chiral scaffold attached with a cyanostilbene showed a pathway&#8208;dependent assembly route to form chiral luminescent liquid crystals and crystals upon fast and slow cooling, respectively. A significant enhancement of PLQYs (98.4%) and a dissymmetry factor (glum) value (2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2), and consequently, a high figure of merit (FM) of up to 0.02 was achieved in the chiral liquid crystal phase. Moreover, the liquid crystal and crystal phases showed the opposite CPL signals while maintaining the same circular dichroism signs. Through a thorough evaluation of UV absorption, CPL emission, wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray diffraction, and theoretical calculations, it was revealed that the reversal of the CPL sign was linked to distinct phases of excited state molecular packing. This research utilized a novel intrinsically axially chiral source to develop a pathway&#8208;dependent and higher&#8208;performance CPL materials.

         <title>Customizing Room&#8208;Temperature Perovskite Ferroelectrics&#160; toward the Multichannel Domain Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>

We have customized a series of perovskite ferroelectrics with controllable phase transition temperatures, which allows unprecedented multichannel manipulation of domain dynamics toward future applications in smart memory devices.








Abstract
Manipulating domain structure in ferroelectrics by external stimuli presents a fascinating avenue for new&#8208;generation electronic devices. However, multichannel controlling of ferroelectric domains is still a challenge, due to the lack of knowledge on their bistability to diverse physical stimuli. Herein, we have customized a series of perovskite ferroelectrics, (CnH2n+1NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Br10 (n&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;7), of which the Curie temperatures are modulated in a wide temperature range (&#916;T&#160;=&#160;74&#160;K) by tailoring chain length of organic spacers. Strikingly, the n&#160;=&#160;7 member is a room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric with bistable characteristics, thus endowing the manipulation of domains via four channels (i.e., thermal, stress, light, and electric fields). Such a non&#8208;volatile memory behavior of the stress&#8208;switching domain is unprecedented in hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics. This manipulation of domains reveals the unique bistability of its ferroelectric orders, which sheds light on the future advance of customizing electric&#8208;ordered materials toward smart device applications.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysts with Fe Single Atoms and Fe3C Clusters for Accelerated Oxygen Adsorption Kinetics in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonprecious tandem catalyst incorporating Fe single atoms and Fe3C clusters within nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers is developed. The Fe3C clusters modulate the electronic structure of the Fe centers, optimizing the adsorption energies of intermediates, lowering reaction barriers, and thereby enhancing ORR activity and stability. This work provides a cost&#8208;effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance tandem electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The design of cost&#8208;effective and efficient catalysts based on transition metal&#8211;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial yet challenging for energy&#8208;conversion devices like metal&#8211;air batteries. In this work, we present a cost&#8208;effective strategy for preparing catalysts consisting of single&#8208;atomic Fe sites and Fe3C clusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers (FeSA&#8208;Fe3C/NC). The FeSA&#8208;Fe3C/NC electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding ORR performance in alkaline electrolytes, achieving a high half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2&#160;=&#160;0.902&#160;V), 4e&#8722; ORR selectivity, and robust methanol tolerance. The exceptional ORR catalytic performance is credited to the relatively substantial specific surface area and the optimal arrangement of active sites, including atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N sites and synergistic Fe3C clusters. In situ spectroelectrochemical characterization and theoretical calculations verify that Fe3C clusters disrupt the symmetric electronic structure of Fe&#8211;N4, optimizing 3d orbitals of Fe centers, thereby accelerating O&#9472;O bond cleavage in *OOH to boost ORR activity. Furthermore, a zinc&#8211;air battery constructed with FeSA&#8208;Fe3C/NC demonstrates excellent potential in energy storage application, yielding a maximum power density of 151.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and robust cycling durability surpassing that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. This study establishes a cost&#8208;effective route for producing metal&#8208;based carbon electrocatalysts with exceptional performance using environmentally friendly raw materials.

     alt="Synergistic Catalysts with Fe Single Atoms and Fe3C Clusters for Accelerated Oxygen Adsorption Kinetics in Oxygen Reduction Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nonprecious tandem catalyst incorporating Fe single atoms and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C clusters within nitrogen-doped carbon layers is developed. The Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C clusters modulate the electronic structure of the Fe centers, optimizing the adsorption energies of intermediates, lowering reaction barriers, and thereby enhancing ORR activity and stability. This work provides a cost-effective strategy for designing high-performance tandem electrocatalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of cost-effective and efficient catalysts based on transition metal&#8211;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial yet challenging for energy-conversion devices like metal&#8211;air batteries. In this work, we present a cost-effective strategy for preparing catalysts consisting of single-atomic Fe sites and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C clusters encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon layers (FeSA-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C/NC). The FeSA-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C/NC electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding ORR performance in alkaline electrolytes, achieving a high half-wave potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.902&#160;V), 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity, and robust methanol tolerance. The exceptional ORR catalytic performance is credited to the relatively substantial specific surface area and the optimal arrangement of active sites, including atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N sites and synergistic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C clusters. In situ spectroelectrochemical characterization and theoretical calculations verify that Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C clusters disrupt the symmetric electronic structure of Fe&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, optimizing 3d orbitals of Fe centers, thereby accelerating O&#9472;O bond cleavage in *OOH to boost ORR activity. Furthermore, a zinc&#8211;air battery constructed with FeSA-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C/NC demonstrates excellent potential in energy storage application, yielding a maximum power density of 151.3&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and robust cycling durability surpassing that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. This study establishes a cost-effective route for producing metal-based carbon electrocatalysts with exceptional performance using environmentally friendly raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Anions and Water Molecules by Lewis Acid&#8211;Base for Highly Stable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fumed silica (FS) particles with Lewis acid&#8211;base functional groups are introduced into traditional ZnSO4 electrolyte. The Si&#9472;O&#9472;Si and Si&#9472;OH functional groups on FS can simultaneously constrain SO42&#8722; ions and H2O molecules, which enhances the Zn2+ migration kinetics and suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Therefore, Zn anodes in such electrolytes display a stable plating/stripping behavior and high Coulombic efficiency.








Abstract
In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), Zn anodes often suffer from Zn dendrite and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in traditional electrolytes. Herein, fumed silica with both Lewis acid&#8211;base functional groups were introduced into traditional electrolytes. Owing to the strong Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions between Si&#9472;O&#9472;Si functional groups and SO42&#8722; ions, the Zn2+ ion transference number is significantly increased in electrolyte, and thus more Zn2+ ions reach the Zn anode surface. As a result, the distribution of Zn2+ ions will be more homogeneous and dendrites growth will be suppressed on the Zn anode surface. In addition, Si&#9472;OH functional groups on fumed silica can also constrain the free and solvated H2O molecules in electrolyte simultaneously through Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions between electronegative O atoms in Si&#9472;OH functional groups and electropositive H atoms in H2O molecules, ensuring that the HER is inhibited on Zn anodes. Therefore, in the fumed silica&#8208;contained electrolyte, the Zn anodes exhibit a high reversibility and Zn||MnO2 full batteries demonstrate a superior cycling performance.

         <title>Thermally Conductive Naphthalene Epoxy Resin by Tailoring Flexible Chain Length and Liquid Crystal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalene&#8208;based liquid crystal epoxy monomers (LCEs) with low liquid crystal temperature ranges (67&#8211;78&#160;&#176;C) were synthesized by modifying the flexible chain length on both sides of naphthalene. The LCEs were cured within liquid crystal temperature to form naphthalene liquid crystal epoxy resin (LCER) with high intrinsic thermal conductivity (0.40&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), which is about 2.2 times higher than that of E&#8208;51.








Abstract
Epoxy resins with high thermal conductivity (&#955;) are widely used in electronic packaging, bonding, and coating. However, those with high intrinsic &#955;, typically synthesized using biphenyl or aromatic rings extended by ester linkages as the mesogenic unit, often exhibit high liquid crystal transition temperatures and poor processability. In this study, a series of naphthalene&#8208;based liquid crystal epoxy monomers (LCEs) were synthesized, using naphthalene as the mesogenic unit and modifying the flexible chain length on both sides. The resulting LCEs were cured within its liquid crystal phase to form naphthalene liquid crystal epoxy resin (LCER). The results show that the network order, radius of gyration, and low&#8208;frequency vibrational density of states all initially increase and then decrease with increasing flexible chain length. For LCER2, with a three&#8208;carbon flexible chain, these parameters reach their maximum values, facilitating phonon diffusion and enhancing &#955;. The liquid crystal transition temperature, &#955;, heat resistance index, and storage modulus of LCER2 were 67&#8211;78&#160;&#176;C, 0.40&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 158.8&#160;&#176;C, and 2059&#160;MPa, respectively, approximately 2.2 times higher than that of E&#8208;51 resin (0.18&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). This work offers insights into designing epoxy resins with low liquid crystal transition temperature, high intrinsic &#955;, and excellent mechanical properties for thermal management.

         <title>Biomimetic Localized Gel Electrolyte for Practical Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a biomimetic antifreeze protein localized gel electrolyte (ALGE), which combines electrolyte modification and interface optimization to tackle the challenges of zinc batteries. ALGE suppresses hydrogen evolution and promotes uniform zinc deposition, enabling excellent cycling performance in both symmetric cells and pouch cells. This solution demonstrates scalable potential without relying on costly or exotic materials.








Abstract
Incompatible electrode/electrolyte interface often leads to dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and corrosion, posing significant challenges to the application of Zn anodes. Herein, we introduce a biomimetic antifreeze protein localized gel electrolyte (ALGE) with multifunctional capabilities to address these issues by combining electrolyte modification with interface optimization. ALGE modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure and the hydrogen&#8208;bond network adjacent to the zinc anode, effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution. Additionally, ALGE promotes (002)Zn crystal plane&#8208;dominated deposition by protein&#8208;zinc surface interactions, enabling a long&#8208;range dendrite&#8208;free deposition. The absence of by&#8208;products and inhibited corrosion further highlights the practical potential of ALGE. Symmetric cells with ALGE&#8208;modified zinc demonstrate an impressive lifespan of 610&#160;&#160;h under a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The pouch cell integrating a manganese dioxide cathode and ALGE&#8208;modified Zn anode retains 75.8% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This localized gel electrolyte strategy offers a practical and scalable approach to stabilizing Zn anodes for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>SiO2 Nanoparticles&#8208;Induced Antifreezing Hydrogel Electrolyte Enables Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries with Complete and Reversible Four&#8208;Electron&#8208;Transfer Mechanisms at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antifreezing hydrogel electrolyte (HC&#8208;SiO2) is developed through the gelation of a high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (1&#160;m Zn(OAc)2 + 21&#160;m LiCl, HC) with SiO2 nanoparticles. The interactions between negatively charged SiO2 surface and cations facilitate a reduction in close ion&#8208;pairs (CIPs) and aggregations (AGGs) by dissociating ion&#8208;pairs, which alleviates salt precipitation in the concentrated electrolyte and further lowers the freezing point, enabling low&#8208;temperature operation of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with complete and reversible I&#8722;/I2/I+Cl&#8722; processes.








Abstract
Four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries hold significant promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high specific capacities. However, achieving four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms under subzero temperatures remains challenging due to freezing point limitations of conventional aqueous electrolytes and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an antifreezing hydrogel electrolyte (HC&#8208;SiO2) is developed through the spontaneous gelation of a high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (1&#160;m Zn(OAc)2 + 21&#160;m LiCl, HC) with SiO2 nanoparticles, enabling low&#8208;temperature operation of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with complete and reversible four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes.

Additionally, the utilization of low&#8208;concentration Zn(OAc)2 combined with high&#8208;concentration LiCl increases availability of free Cl&#8722; by mitigating strong ionic interaction in conventional ZnCl2&#8208;based concentrated electrolytes, thereby enhancing reaction kinetics of the I2/I+ conversion. Benefiting from synergistic manipulation of ionic interaction, water activity, and Cl&#8722; activity, the HC&#8208;SiO2 hydrogel achieves a high capacity of 490.9 mAh g&#8722;1 and durable lifespan exceeding 11,000 cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. These findings offer valuable insights for advancing practical low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

&lt;p&gt;An antifreezing hydrogel electrolyte (HC-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is developed through the gelation of a high-concentration electrolyte (1&#160;m Zn(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 21&#160;m LiCl, HC) with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. The interactions between negatively charged SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface and cations facilitate a reduction in close ion-pairs (CIPs) and aggregations (AGGs) by dissociating ion-pairs, which alleviates salt precipitation in the concentrated electrolyte and further lowers the freezing point, enabling low-temperature operation of quasi-solid-state Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with complete and reversible I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; processes.

&lt;p&gt;Four-electron-transfer aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries hold significant promise for large-scale energy storage due to their high specific capacities. However, achieving four-electron-transfer mechanisms under subzero temperatures remains challenging due to freezing point limitations of conventional aqueous electrolytes and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an antifreezing hydrogel electrolyte (HC-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is developed through the spontaneous gelation of a high-concentration electrolyte (1&#160;m Zn(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 21&#160;m LiCl, HC) with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles, enabling low-temperature operation of quasi-solid-state Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with complete and reversible four-electron-transfer processes. Abundant interactions between dispersed SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles and cations enlarge ion-pair distances, reducing close ion-pair formation and lowering the freezing temperature (&#8722;60.7&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the quasi-solid-state hydrogel electrolyte combines advantages of reduced water activity and disrupted hydrogen-bond networks, effectively suppressing I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hydrolysis while inhibiting ice nucleation.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Machine Learning in Co&#8208;crystal Prediction by a Novel Approach Integrating Molecular Thermodynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>

A novel framework integrating thermodynamic mechanisms and machine learning was developed to predict coformers and reaction solvents for co&#8208;crystallization. The model showcased superior performance in coformer and solvent predicting with accuracy over 90% in independent test sets. SHAP analysis revealed key thermodynamic drivers, enhancing mechanistic insights. Experimental validation on ketoconazole further confirmed the model's effectiveness.








Abstract
Co&#8208;crystal engineering is of interest for many applications in pharmaceutical, chemical, and materials fields, but rational design of co&#8208;crystals is still challenging. Although artificial intelligence has revolutionized decision&#8208;making processes in material design, limitations in generalization and mechanistic understanding remain. Herein, we sought to improve prediction of co&#8208;crystals by combining mechanistic thermodynamic modeling with machine learning. We constructed a brand&#8208;new co&#8208;crystal database, integrating drug, coformer, and reaction solvent information. By incorporating various thermodynamic models, the predictive performance was significantly enhanced. Benefiting from the complementarity of thermodynamic mechanisms and structural descriptors, the model coupling three thermodynamic models achieved optimal predictive performance in coformer and solvent screening. The model was rigorously validated against benchmark models using challenging independent test sets, showcasing superior performance in both coformer and solvent predicting with accuracy over 90%. Further, we employed SHAP analysis for model interpretation, suggesting that thermodynamic mechanisms are prominent in the model's decision&#8208;making. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies on ketoconazole validated the model's efficacy in identifying coformers/solvents, demonstrating its potential in practical application. Overall, our work enhanced the understanding of co&#8208;crystallization and highlighted the strategy that integrates mechanistic insights with data&#8208;driven models to accelerate the rational design and synthesis of co&#8208;crystals, as well as various other functional materials.

         <title>Formulating Electrophilic Electrolyte for In Situ Stabilization of 4.8 V Li&#8208;Rich Batteries with 100% Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an electrophilic electrolyte engineering to extraordinarily stabilize the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces on both the cathode and anode. The core of this electrolyte strategy lies in stabilizing surface lattice oxygen through nucleophilic interactions between electrolyte additive and LLO cathode, ultimately boosting reversible anion redox and fast reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathodes are expected to overcome the energy density limitations, but their applicability is hindered by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases with sluggish kinetics. Here an elaborate electrophilic electrolyte is proposed that effectively stabilizes the surface lattice oxygen of the LLO cathode, facilitates the formation of dense and fast&#8208;ion&#8208;transport electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, and prevents Li&#8208;dendrites on the anode. The nucleophilic reaction mechanism driven by the electrolyte enables LLO to exhibit a reversible capacity of 310 mAh g&#8722;1 with a record ICE of 100%, as well as impressive 3C fast&#8208;charging stability, remarkably superior to that in the basic electrolyte. Using this engineered electrolyte, the assembled 4.5 Ah&#8208;class pouch cell of graphite||LLO displays high energy density and remarkable reversibility during cycling, demonstrating wide applicability. This work provides valuable insights and pragmatic strategies in electrolyte chemical engineering for advancing high&#8208;energy density and fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <dc:description>
This study was carried out to prepare highly uniform nickel&#8208;based complex nanospheres (NiSH) under the subtle force of hydrogen bonding. Nanocomposites with micro&#8208; and mesopores were synthesized in situ on the basis of ligand competition with salicylic acid structural analogs. The incorporation of hydrophobic functional groups effectively protected the electrode materials from degradation and corrosion. This research is expected to deepen the understanding of materials synthesis and pave the way for more sustainable energy solutions.








Abstract
In situ composite methods have aroused research interest in materials science and acted as a novel strategy to achieve structural tailoring of materials. However, the controllable preparation of composites containing functional groups remains a challenge. Herein, we report an approach based on competitive coordination between structural analogs, by which the functionally composite metal complex (NiSH@Ni&#8208;FSA) was synthesized. The introduction of different functional groups allows precise control of the functionality of composites, ranging from NiSH@Ni&#8208;ClSA&#8208;D, NiSH@Ni&#8208;BrSA to NiSH@Ni&#8208;CF3SA. More interestingly, the synthesized material retained the microporous and mesoporous structure of the original complexes. The incorporation of hydrophobic functional groups effectively protects the electrode materials from degradation and corrosion. Meanwhile, the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding facilitates new composite nanomaterials with better performance for advanced energy storage applications.

         <title>The Cooperative Effects of the Rh&#8208;M Dual&#8208;Metal Atomic Pairs in Formic Acid Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Rh&#8208;M dual atomic pairs (M&#160;=&#160;V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts (DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN) have been synthesized via a host&#8208;guest strategy. DAP&#8208;(Cr, Rh)/CN shows the highest mass activity toward formic acid oxidation among the reported catalysts as far as it is known. The most suitable adsorption strength of HCOO on the Cr sites cooperated with the acceptance of H on the Rh sites and accelerated the FAOR rates.








Abstract
The continuously increasing mass activity of precious metal in formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is the key to achieving the practical application of direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). Herein, Rh&#8208;based dual&#8208;metal atomic pairs supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts [DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN] with adjacent interatomic Rh&#8208;M (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) have been synthesized by a &#8220;host&#8208;guest&#8221; strategy. It is discovered that DAP&#8208;(Cr, Rh)/CN shows the highest mass activity of 64.1&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1, which is 3.8 times higher than that of the single atom Rh catalyst (17.0&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1) and two orders of magnitude higher than Pd/C (0.58&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1). Interestingly, the mass activity of DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN first increases from 11.7&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1 (Rh&#8208;V) to 64.1&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1 (Rh&#8208;Cr) and then decreases to 21.8&#160;A&#160;mg&#8722;1 (Rh&#8208;Cu), forming a volcano curve of the reaction activity. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) spectra reveal that formic acid oxidized on a series of DAP&#8208;(M, Rh)/CN catalysts through the formate route with the subsidiary M metal atoms binding the HCOO species and the Rh atom accepting the H atoms.

     alt="The Cooperative Effects of the Rh-M Dual-Metal Atomic Pairs in Formic Acid Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of Rh-M dual atomic pairs (M&#160;=&#160;V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts (DAP-(M, Rh)/CN) have been synthesized via a host-guest strategy. DAP-(Cr, Rh)/CN shows the highest mass activity toward formic acid oxidation among the reported catalysts as far as it is known. The most suitable adsorption strength of HCOO on the Cr sites cooperated with the acceptance of H on the Rh sites and accelerated the FAOR rates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuously increasing mass activity of precious metal in formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is the key to achieving the practical application of direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). Herein, Rh-based dual-metal atomic pairs supported on nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts [DAP-(M, Rh)/CN] with adjacent interatomic Rh-M (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) have been synthesized by a &#8220;host-guest&#8221; strategy. It is discovered that DAP-(Cr, Rh)/CN shows the highest mass activity of 64.1&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 3.8 times higher than that of the single atom Rh catalyst (17.0&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and two orders of magnitude higher than Pd/C (0.58&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Interestingly, the mass activity of DAP-(M, Rh)/CN first increases from 11.7&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (Rh-V) to 64.1&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (Rh-Cr) and then decreases to 21.8&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (Rh-Cu), forming a volcano curve of the reaction activity. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) spectra reveal that formic acid oxidized on a series of DAP-(M, Rh)/CN catalysts through the formate route with the subsidiary M metal atoms binding the HCOO species and the Rh atom accepting the H atoms. The most suitable adsorption strength of HCOO on the Cr sites luckily contributes to two spontaneous elementary steps and thus accelerates the FAOR rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetrical Triatomic Sites with Long&#8208;Range Electron Coupling for Ultra&#8208;Durable and Extreme&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

The hetero&#8208;trimetallic FeCoNi SA catalyst (FCN&#8208;TM/NC) processes the asymmetric FeN4 configuration, long&#8208;distance hetero&#8208;metallic electron coupling, modulated local microenvironment, and optimized d orbital energy levels, exhibiting extraordinary oxygen electrocatalysis. The zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) equipped with FCN&#8208;TM/NC exhibits ultra&#8208;stable rechargeability (over 5500&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;60 &#176;C) and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability from &#8722;60 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Reversible zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) is a promising alternative for sustainable fuel cells, but the performance is impeded by the sluggish oxygen redox kinetics owing to the suboptimal adsorption and desorption of oxygen intermediates. Here, hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (TACs) uniquely incorporate an electron regulatory role beyond primary and secondary active sites found in dual&#8208;atom catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and Raman spectroscopy elucidate Fe in FeCoNi SA catalyst (FCN&#8208;TM/NC) functions as the main active site, leveraging long&#8208;range electron coupling from neighboring Co and Ni to boost catalytic efficiency. The ZAB equipped with FCN&#8208;TM/NC exhibits ultra&#8208;stable rechargeability (over 5500&#160;h at 1&#160;&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C). The in&#8208;depth theoretical and experimental investigations attribute such superior catalytic activity to the asymmetric FeN4 configuration, long&#8208;distance electron coupling, modulated local microenvironment, optimized d orbital energy levels, and lower energy barrier for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. This work provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the structure&#8208;reactivity relationship in TACs for energy conversion.

         <title>Identification, Characterization, and Catalytic Mechanism of Regioselective UbiA Prenyltransferases in Morus Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MaPT21, MaPT24, MaPT25, MaPT27, MaPT29, and MaPT30 enzymes catalyze regioselective prenylation and geranylation at the C5, C7, C2&#8242;, and C4&#8242; sites of moracin M. Rational mutation guided by molecular docking and dynamics simulation altered the site preference of MaPT27 from C7 to C5.








Abstract
UbiA prenyltransferases (PTs) play an indispensable role in the prenylation of plant metabolites, yielding numerous natural products with enhanced pharmacological activities, such as cannabinoids, polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols, prenylated flavonoids, and stilbenoids. These enzymes typically target specific carbon atoms or hydroxy groups of aromatic substrates. Despite the recent identification of dozens of plant&#8208;derived UbiA PTs, their catalytic mechanism remains poorly understood, particularly regarding the precise control of regioselectivity. In this study, we identified and characterized a total of 10 members that catalyzed the regioselective prenylation and geranylation of moracin substrates through comprehensive analysis of the UbiA superfamily in Morus alba. Molecular dockings, dynamics simulations, and quantum chemical calculations revealed the substrate&#8208;induced conformational changes leading to the formation of the hydrophobic reaction pocket, as well as the differential binding between various MaPTs and moracin M. Additionally, the recognition of prenyl donors by MaPT27 and the potential mechanism underlying the reversal of regioselectivity induced by different donors are discussed. Finally, structure&#8208;based rational mutation altered the site preference from C7 to C5. These findings suggest that the regioselectivity of plant UbiA PTs is governed by both the inherent chemoselectivity of reaction sites and intricate protein&#8211;substrate interactions.

         <title>Switchable Divergent Photocatalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycosyl Benzoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radical deoxygenation C&#8208;glycosylation method using simple, stable glycosyl benzoates via reductive anomeric C&#9472;O bond cleavage enables divergent synthesis of alkyl and alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with excellent stereoselectivity. This study highlights the innovative use of glycosyl benzoates as radical precursors and CO2&#8226;&#8722; as a reductant, opening new directions for radical glycosylation.








Abstract
Metabolically robust C&#8208;glycosides are crucial in various biological and medical applications, underscoring the need for efficient synthesis methods. While radical C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are known for their reliability and functional group tolerance, challenges such as glycosyl donor stability and atom economy persist. In this study, we investigate the underexplored potential of condition&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of C&#8208;glycosides through a switchable photocatalytic C&#8208;glycosylation strategy, involving reductive anomeric C&#9472;O bond cleavage. Utilizing simple, readily available, and bench&#8208;stable glycosyl benzoates as novel O&#8208;based glycosyl radical precursors, we successfully achieve deoxygenative glycosylation of simple alkenes and styryl boronic acids, establishing a versatile platform for C&#8208;glycoside synthesis. A critical aspect of the challenging reductive cleavage of these benzoate esters is the introduction of strong single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reductants, combined with Br&#248;nsted acids to accelerate fragmentation following substrate reduction. Notably, CO2&#8226;&#8722;, generated via the consecutive photon&#8208;induced electron transfer process, is utilized for the first time in glycosylation reactions. By meticulously tuning the reaction conditions, including photocatalysts and formate additives, we facilitate the divergent synthesis of alkyl and alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with good to high stereoselectivity and yields. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the reaction pathway and the underlying rationale behind this finely tuned, easily controlled photocatalytic system.

         <dc:description>
Mn(acac)3 with weak electrolyte properties had an ion&#8208;molecule coexistence state. The ionized Mn3+ is reduced and doped Li2O2 through in situ electrochemical implantation, altering its insulating properties. Mn(acac)3 molecule stabilized the intermediate LiO2 and facilitated its further disproportionation to Li2O2, as well as enhancing its decomposition, leading to an ultra&#8208;low overpotential and remarkable cycle stability for Li&#8208;O2 battery.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 batteries significantly limit their performance. To address this issue, the insulating characteristics of the discharge product Li2O2 and the reactivity of highly active superoxide species are examined. Herein, organic metal salts with weak electrolyte properties are utilized as bifunctional additives. The ionized metal ions can be reduced and doped Li2O2 through in situ electrochemical implantation, thereby altering its insulating properties. Additionally, organic metal salts function as redox mediators (RMs), stabilizing the intermediate LiO2 and facilitating its further disproportionation to Li2O2, as well as enhancing the decomposition reaction during charging, which are further proven by the in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy. Notably, Li&#8208;O2 batteries incorporating Mn(acac)3 demonstrate an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 0.43&#160;V and sustain 250 long cycles at 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, when combined with the optimized cathode, a remarkable cycle stability of 3850 cycles at 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 is achieved. These findings offer novel insights into the design of advanced Li&#8208;O2 battery systems and the enhancement of their performance.

         <title>Using Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry to Examine the Effects of Porosity and Catalyst&#8208;Support Interactions on CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous framework materials and carbon nanotubes are often used to immobilize molecular electrocatalysts. Herein, we employ metalloporphyrin nanocages (M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Co) and their host&#8208;guest complexes with C60/C70 as discrete counterparts to these hybrid catalytic materials. The cages achieve high current densities for reducing CO2 to CO at low overpotentials, and performance can be improved by fullerene guests, suggesting that porosity is not needed for good activity. 








Abstract
Bis&#8208;porphyrin nanocages (M2BiCage, M&#160;=&#160;FeCl, Co, Zn) and their host&#8208;guest complexes with C60 and C70 were used to examine how molecular porosity and interactions with carbon nanomaterials affect the CO2 reduction activity of metalloporphyrin electrocatalysts. The cages were found to adsorb on carbon black to provide electrocatalytic inks with excellent accessibilities of the metal sites (&#8776;50%) even at high metal loadings (2500&#160;nmol cm&#8722;2), enabling good activity for reducing CO2 to CO. A complex of C70 bound inside (FeCl)2BiCage achieves high current densities for CO formation at low overpotentials (|jCO| &gt;7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, &#951; = 320&#160;mV; &gt;13.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, &#951; = 520&#160;mV) with &#8805;95% Faradaic efficiency (FECO), and Co2BiCage achieves high turnover frequencies (&#8776;1300&#160;h&#8722;1, &#951; = 520&#160;mV) with 90% FECO. In general, blocking the pore with C60 or C70 improves the catalytic performance of (FeCl)2BiCage and has only small effects on Co2BiCage, indicating that the good catalytic properties of the cages cannot be attributed to their internal pores. Neither enhanced electron transfer rates nor metal&#8208;fullerene interactions appear to underlie the ability of C60/C70 to improve the performance of (FeCl)2BiCage, in contrast to effects often proposed for other carbon nanosupports.

         <title>Tuning Ru&#8211;O Coordination for Switching Redox Centers in Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 21, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controlling the Ru&#8211;O coordination number, the dominant acidic OER mechanism in RuOx&#8208;based catalysts is switched from the detrimental lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) to the more favorable oxide path mechanism (OPM), achieving both high activity and robust stability. Our findings reveal that Ru2&#8211;O11 moieties enable selective redox switching, while Ru2&#8211;O9 and Ru2&#8211;O8 moieties either activate both LOM and OPM or bypass them entirely.








Abstract
Avoiding lattice oxygen involvement (oxygen redox) while promoting the coupling of adjacent adsorbed oxygen (metal redox) during the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for gaining high activity and robust stability in RuO2&#8208;based catalysts but remains elusive. Here, we present a precise strategy to selectively activate the metal redox process while suppressing the undesired oxygen redox pathway by fine&#8208;tuning the Ru&#8211;O coordination number in amorphous RuOx. The optimized catalyst exhibits outstanding acidic OER performance, achieving a low overpotential of 215&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for 300 h with a negligible degradation rate of 100 &#181;V h&#8722;1. X&#8208;ray absorption measurements and multiple operando spectra reveal that only Ru2&#8211;O11 moieties can selectively activate the metal redox process, whereas Ru2&#8211;O9 and Ru2&#8211;O8 moieties either trigger both redox pathways or bypass them. Theoretical calculations reveal that Ru2&#8211;O11 moiety reduces crystal field splitting energy at active Ru sites, disables lattice oxygen activation, and lowers the energy barrier for oxygen coupling. The strategy developed in this work offers new avenues for switching redox centers and refining OER mechanisms to enhance catalytic performance and long&#8208;term stability.
