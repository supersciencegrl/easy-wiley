         <title>Dearomative Construction of 2D/3D Frameworks from Quinolines via Nucleophilic Addition/Borate&#8208;Mediated Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative construction of multiply&#8208;fused 2D/3D frameworks, composed of aromatic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rings and saturated three&#8208;dimensional (3D) rings, from readily available quinolines has greatly contributed to drug discovery. However, dearomative cycloadditions of quinolines in the presence of photocatalysts usually afford 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline (THQ)&#8208;based polycycles, and dearomative access to 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based structures remains limited. Herein, we present a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective dearomative transformation of quinolines into 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based 6&#8208;6&#8208;4&#8208;membered rings without any catalyst, through a combination of nucleophilic addition and borate&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the photoexcited borate complex, generated from quinoline, organolithium, and HB(pin), accelerates the cycloaddition and suppresses the rearomatization that usually occurs in conventional photocycloaddition. Based on our mechanistic analysis, we also developed further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate over a Cu2O Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrate ions into urea offers an attractive route for both nitrogen fertilizer production and environmental remediation. However, achieving this transformation under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient photoelectrochemical method for urea synthesis by co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate ion over a Cu2O photocathode, delivering urea formation rate of 29.71&#177;2.20 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.90&#177;1.15 % at low external potential (&#8722;0.017 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Experimental data combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the adsorbed CO* and NO2* species are the key intermediates, and associated C&#8722;N coupling is the rate&#8208;determining step. This work demonstrates that Cu2O is an efficient catalyst to drive co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to urea under light irradiation with low external potential, showing great opportunity of photoelectrocatalysis as a sustainable tool for value&#8208;added chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Atomic&#8208;coupling in Dual&#8208;cavity Boride Nanoreactor to Achieve Hierarchical Catalytic Engineering for Sulfur Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic process of Li2S formation is considered a key pathway to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Due to the system's complexity, the catalytic behavior is uncertain, posing significant challenges for predicting activity. Herein, we report a novel cascaded dual&#8208;cavity nanoreactor (NiCo&#8208;B) by controlling reaction kinetics, providing an opportunity for achieving hierarchical catalytic behavior. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, the multilevel structure can effectively suppress polysulfides dissolution and accelerate sulfur conversion. Furthermore, we differentiate the adsorption (B&#8208;S) and catalytic effect (Co&#8208;S) in NiCo&#8208;B, avoiding catalyst deactivation caused by excessive adsorption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared battery displays high reversible capacity, even with sulfur loading of 13.2 mg cm&#8208;2 (E/S=4 &#956;l mg&#8208;1), the areal capacity can reach 18.7 mAh cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Functionalization of Cyclopropenes via Cyclopropenium Cation Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalytic decarboxylative functionalization of cyclopropenes is reported. Starting from a broad range of redox&#8208;active ester&#8208;substituted cyclopropenes, cyclopropenylphthalimides can be synthesized in the absence of a nucleophile. Alternatively, different carbon and heteroatom nucleophiles can be introduced. The transformation proceeds most probably through the formation of an aromatic cyclopropenium cation, followed by trapping with the nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Hydrogen Generation from Ammonia Borane Hydrolysis on a Tandem Ruthenium&#8211;Platinum&#8211;Titanium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) involves multiple undefined steps and complex adsorption and activation, so single or dual sites are not enough for the rapidity of the multiple processes. Designing multi&#8208;site catalysts is necessary to enhance the catalytic performance of AB hydrolysis reactions but revealing the matching reaction mechanisms of AB hydrolysis is a great challenge. In this work, we propose to construct RuPt&#8208;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts with the metal&#8208;support synergy effect to clarify the multi&#8208;site tandem activation mechanism of AB hydrolysis. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the multi&#8208;site tandem mode can respectively promote the activation of NH3BH3 and H2O molecules on the Ru and Pt sites as well as facilitate the fast transfer of *H and the desorption of H2 on Ti sites at the same time. RuPt&#8208;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts exhibit the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 1293 min&#8208;1 for AB hydrolysis reaction, outperforming the single&#8208;site Ru, dual&#8208;site RuPt and Ru&#8208;Ti catalysts. This study proposes a multi&#8208;site tandem concept for accelerating the dehydrogenation of hydrogen storage material, aiming to contribute to the development of cleaner, low&#8208;carbon, and high&#8208;performance hydrogen production systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Chiral Metal Nanoclusters for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized light (CPL) detection is of great significance in various applications such as drug identification, sensing and imaging. Atomically precise chiral metal nanoclusters with intense circular dichroism (CD) signals are promising candidates for CPL detection, which can further facilitate device miniaturization and integration. Herein, we report the preparation of a pair of optically active chiral silver nanoclusters [Ag7(R/S&#8208;DMA)2(dpppy)3] (BF4)3 (R/S&#8208;Ag7) for direct CPL detection. The crystal structure and molecular formula of R/S&#8208;Ag7 clusters are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. R/S&#8208;Ag7 clusters exhibit strong CD spectra and CPL luminescence both in solution and solid states. When used as the photoactive materials in photodetectors, R/S&#8208;Ag7 enables effective discrimination between left&#8208;handed circularly polarized and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light at 520 nm with short response time, high responsivity and considerable discrimination ratio. This study is the first report on using atomically precise chiral metal nanoclusters for CPL detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Charge&#8208;Neutral Anion Receptors for Reversible Binding and Release of Highly Hydrated Phosphate in water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control&#160;of phosphate capture and release is vital in environmental, biological, and pharmaceutical contexts. However, the binding of trivalent phosphate (PO43&#8208;) in water is exceptionally difficult due to its high hydration energy. Based on the anion coordination chemistry of phosphate, in this study, four charge&#8208;neutral tripodal hexaurea receptors (L1 &#8208; L4), which were equipped with morpholine and PEG terminal groups to enhance their solubility in water, were synthesized to enable the pH&#8208;triggered phosphate binding and release in aqueous solutions. Encouragingly, the receptors were found to bind PO43&#8208; anion in a 1:1 ratio via hydrogen bonds in 100% water solutions, with L1 exhibiting the highest binding constant (1.2&#180;103 M&#8208;1). These represent the first neutral anion ligands to bind phosphate in 100% water and demonstrate the potential for phosphate capture and release in water through pH&#8208;triggered mechanisms, mimicking native phosphate binding proteins. Furthermore, L1 can also bind multiple bioavailable phosphate species, which may serve as model systems for probing and modulating phosphate homeostasis in biological and biomedical researches.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Dynamic Molecular Motions of a Twin&#8208;Cavity Cage with Slow Configurational but Rapid Conformational Interconversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intricate interconvertible system composed of four chiral species of diphane has been studied. The complex structural changes can be dissected into two pathways: a slow C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configurational interconversion and a rapid P&#8208; to M&#8208;conformational transition. As the latter is much faster than the former, the latter can be further deconvolved into two individual conformational interchanges: (P)&#8208;C3&#8596;(M)&#8208;C3 and (P)&#8208;C1&#8596;(M)&#8208;C1.







Abstract
Featuring diverse structural motions/changes, dynamic molecular systems hold promise for executing complex tasks. However, their structural complexity presents formidable challenge in elucidating their kinetics, especially when multiple structural motions are intercorrelated. We herein introduce a twin&#8208;cavity cage that features interconvertible C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;configurations, with each configuration exhibiting interchangeable P&#8208; and M&#8208;conformations. This molecule is therefore composed of four interconnected chiral species (P)&#8208;C3, (M)&#8208;C3, (P)&#8208;C1, (M)&#8208;C1. We showcase an effective approach to decouple these sophisticated structural changes into two kinetically distinct pathways. Utilizing time&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy at various temperatures, which disregards the transition between mirror&#8208;image conformations, we first determine the rate constant (kc) for the C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configuration interconversion, while time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy at different temperatures quantifies the observed rate constant (kobs) of the ensemble of all the structural changes. As kobs

         <title>Investigation of the Odilorhabdin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Using NRPS Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recently identified natural product NOSO&#8208;95A from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus bacteria, derived from a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), was the first member of the odilorhabdin class of antibiotics. This class exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic activity and inspired the development of the synthetic derivative NOSO&#8208;502, which holds potential as a new clinical drug by breaking antibiotic resistance. While the mode of action of odilorhabdins was broadly investigated, their biosynthesis pathway remained poorly understood. Here we describe the heterologous production of NOSO&#8208;95A in Escherichia coli after refactoring the complete BGC. Since the production titer was low, NRPS engineering was applied to uncover the underlying biosynthetic principles. For this, modules of the odilorhabdin NRPS fused to other synthetases were co&#8208;expressed with candidate hydroxylases encoded in the BGC allowing the characterization of the biosynthesis of three unusual amino acids and leading to the identification of a prodrug&#8208;activation mechanism by deacylation. Our work demonstrates the application of NRPS engineering as a blueprint to mechanistically elucidate large or toxic NRPS and provides the basis to generate novel odilorhabdin analogues with improved properties in the future.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper presents a novel approach for the selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes through direct mechanocatalysis, employing a gold&#8208;coated milling vessel as catalyst and air as the oxidation agent. By adjusting milling frequency, media, and duration, high catalytic efficiencies and selectivities are achieved. Remarkably, yields of up to 99% are obtained for specific substrates, with a turnover number (TON) of 8200 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.77 s&#8208;1, surpassing existing alternatives. Confirmation of the catalytic reaction indeed occurring on the milling tool surface was achieved through X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Oxygen Activation through Deep Oxidation of Co4N by Jahn&#8722;Teller&#8208;active Dopants for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triggering the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is crucial for improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, because it could bypass the scaling relation limitation associated with the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism through the directly formation of oxygen&#8722;oxygen bond. High&#8208;valence transition metal sites are favorable for activating the lattice oxygen, but the deep oxidation of pre&#8208;catalysts suffers from a high thermodynamic barrier. Here, taking advantage of the Jahn&#8722;Teller (J&#8722;T) distortion induced structural instability, we incorporate high&#8208;spin Mn3+ (t2g3eg1) dopant into Co4N. Mn dopants enable a surface structural transformation from Co4N to CoOOH, and finally to CoO2, as observed by various in&#8208;situ spectroscopic investigations. Furthermore, the reconstructed surface on Mn doped Co4N triggers the lattice oxygen activation, as evidenced experimentally by pH&#8208;dependent OER, tetramethylammonium cation adsorption and on&#8208;line electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements of 18O&#8208;labelled catalysts. In general, this work not only offers the introducing J&#8722;T effect approach to regulate the structural transition, but also provides an understanding about the influence of catalyst&#8217;s electronic configuration on determining the reaction route, which may inspire the design of more efficient catalysts with activated lattice oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Backbone Editing for Controlled Degradation of Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemically inert nature of fully saturated hydrocarbon backbones endows vinyl polymers with desirable durability, but it also leads to their significant environmental persistence. Enhancing the sustainability of these materials requires a pivotal yet challenging shift: transforming the inert backbone into one that is degradable. Here, we present a versatile platform for mechanochemically editing the fully saturated backbone of vinyl polymers towards degradable polymer chains by integrating cyclobutene&#8208;fused succinimide (CBS) units along backbone through photo&#8208;iniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) copolymerization. Significantly, the evenly insertion of CBS units does not compromise thermal or chemical stability but rather offers a means to adjust the properties of polymethylacrylate (PMA). Meanwhile, reactive acyclic imide units can be selectively introduced to the backbone through mechanochemical activation (pulse ultrasonication or ball&#8208;milling grinding) when required. Subsequent hydrolysis of the acyclic imide groups enables efficient degradation, yielding telechelic oligomers. This approach holds promise for inspiring the design and modification of more environmentally friendly vinyl polymers through backbone editing.</dc:description>

         <title>Tafbromin selectively targets the TAF1 bromodomain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenotypic assays detect small molecule bioactivity at functionally relevant cellular sites, and inherently cover a variety of targets and mechanisms of action. They can uncover new small molecule&#8208;target pairs and may give rise to novel biological insights. By means of an osteoblast differentiation assay which employs a Hedgehog (Hh) signaling agonist as stimulus and which monitors an endogenous marker for osteoblasts, we identified a pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinoline (PQ) pseudo&#8208;natural product (PNP) class as osteogenesis inhibitors. The most potent PQ, termed Tafbromin, impairs canonical Hh signaling and modulates osteoblast differentiation through binding to the bromodomain 2 of TATA&#8208;box binding protein&#8208;associated factor 1 (TAF1). Tafbromin is the most selective TAF1 bromodomain 2 ligand and promises to be an invaluable tool for the study of biological processes mediated by TAF1(2) bromodomains.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Ampere&#8208;level Current Density on Doping&#8208;engineered Bismuth Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to form formic acid fuel is hindered by the limited activation of CO2 molecules and the lack of universal feasibility across different pH levels. Herein, we report a doping&#8208;engineered bismuth sulfide pre&#8208;catalyst (BiS&#8208;1) that S is partially retained after electrochemical reconstruction into metallic Bi for CO2RR to formate/formic acid with ultrahigh performance across a wide pH range. The best BiS&#8208;1 maintains a Faraday efficiency (FE) of ~95% at 2000 mA cm&#8208;2 in a flow cell under neutral and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, the BiS&#8208;1 catalyst shows unprecedentedly high FE (~95%) with current densities from 100 to 1300 mA cm&#8208;2 under acidic solutions. Notably, the current density can reach 700 mA cm&#8208;2 while maintaining a FE of above 90% in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer and operate stably for 150 h at 200 mA cm&#8208;2. In&#8208;situspectra and density functional theory calculations reveals that the S doping modulates the electronic structure of Bi and effectively promotes the formation of the HCOO* intermediate for formate/formic acid generation. This work develops the efficient and stable electrocatalysts for sustainable formate/formic acid production.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Inhibitor Possessing Isoform Selectivity and In Planta Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent small&#8208;molecule inhibitor of Arabidopsis thaliana 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins has been developed. The inhibitor displayed isoform selectivity through covalent and allosteric inhibitory action. Inhibitor&#8208;driven stomatal closing on Arabidopsis leaves was also investigated. This inhibitor provides new insight into the modulation of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and the application to plant growth regulation.







Abstract
Synthetic modulators of plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3s are promising chemical tools both for understanding the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and controlling plant physiology. Herein, we describe a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. The inhibitor was identified from unexpected products in a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) of an in&#8208;house chemical library. Mass spectroscopy, mutant&#8208;based analyses, fluorescence polarization assays, and thermal shift assays revealed that the inhibitor covalently binds to an allosteric site of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 with isoform selectivity. Moreover, infiltration of the inhibitor to Arabidopsis leaves suppressed the stomatal aperture. The inhibitor should provide new insight into the design of potent and isoform&#8208;selective 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 modulators.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate over Phosphate&#8208;Modified In: Water Activation and Active Site Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification can act as anchoring sites to enrich K+(H2O)n close to the In active sites in the double layer and activate K+(H2O)n to generate H+. Besides, (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification can also modulate the electronic structure of the In active sites, resulting in enhanced CO2 adsorption. Both of which shall facilitate the electrochemical CO2RR to form formate.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a sustainable strategy for producing fuels and chemicals. However, it suffers from sluggish CO2 activation and slow water dissociation. In this work, we construct a (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modified In catalyst that exhibits high activity and selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate. A combination of in situ characterizations and kinetic analyses indicate that (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; has a strong interaction with K+(H2O)n, which effectively accelerates water dissociation to provide protons. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification leads to a higher valence state of In active site, thus promoting CO2 activation and HCOO* formation, while inhibiting competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, the (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modified oxide&#8208;derived In catalyst exhibits excellent formate selectivity across a broad potential window with a formate Faradaic efficiency as high as 92.1&#8201;% at a partial current density of ~200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cathodic potential of &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline electrolyte.

         <title>Noncovalent Interaction Guided Precise Photoluminescence Regulation of Gold Nanoclusters in Both Isolate Species and Aggregate States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an atomically precise cluster as a nanoscale luminophore model, we firstly discover the significantly different emission responses between the intra&#8208;cluster and inter&#8208;cluster interactions, and further demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions including intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;luminophore interactions at molecular level precise can realize bright luminophores in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases.







Abstract
Designing luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states is of great importance in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, the conventional luminophores either emit in isolate species but quench in aggregate state or emit in aggregate state but darken in isolate species. Here we demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions can realize luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states. It is firstly discovered that the intra&#8208;cluster interaction enhances the emission of atomically precise Au25(pMBA)18 (pMBA=4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid), a nanoscale luminophore, while the inter&#8208;cluster interaction quenches the emission. The emission enhancing strategies are then well&#8208;designed by both introducing exogenous substances to block inter&#8208;cluster interaction and surface manipulation of Au25(pMBA)18 at the molecular level to enhance intra&#8208;cluster interaction, opening new possibilities to controllably enhance the luminophore's photoluminescence in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases including aqueous solution, solid state and organic solvents.

However, the conventional luminophores either emit in isolate species but quench in aggregate state or emit in aggregate state but darken in isolate species. Here we demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions can realize luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states. It is firstly discovered that the intra-cluster interaction enhances the emission of atomically precise Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(pMBA)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; (pMBA=4-mercaptobenzoic acid), a nanoscale luminophore, while the inter-cluster interaction quenches the emission. The emission enhancing strategies are then well-designed by both introducing exogenous substances to block inter-cluster interaction and surface manipulation of Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(pMBA)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; at the molecular level to enhance intra-cluster interaction, opening new possibilities to controllably enhance the luminophore's photoluminescence in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases including aqueous solution, solid state and organic solvents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Like Silicone Nanofilaments@Montmorillonite Nanofillers of PEO&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries with Wide Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. The SSLMBs with the CSEs show high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are promising to accelerate commercialization of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). Nonetheless, this is hindered by the CSEs&#8217; limited ion conductivity at room temperature. Here, we propose design, synthesis, and application of the bioinspired neuron&#8208;like nanofillers for PEO&#8208;based CSEs. The neuron&#8208;like superhydrophobic nanofillers are synthesized by controllably grafting silicone nanofilaments onto montmorillonite nanosheets. Compared to various reported fillers, the nanofillers can greatly improve ionic conductivity (4.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, 30&#8201;&#176;C), Li+ transference number (0.63), oxidation stability (5.3&#8197;V) and mechanical properties of the PEO&#8208;based CSEs because of the following facts. The distinctive neuron&#8208;like structure and the resulting synaptic&#8208;like connections establish numerous long&#8208;distance continuous channels over various directions in the PEO&#8208;based CSEs for fast and uniform Li+ transport. Consequently, the assembled SSLMBs with the CSEs and LiFePO4 or NCM811 cathodes display superior cycling stability over a wide temperature range of 50&#8201;&#176;C to 0&#8201;&#176;C. Surprisingly, the pouch batteries with the large&#8208;scale prepared CSEs kept working after being repeatedly bent, folded, cut or even punched in air. We believe that design of neuron&#8208;like nanofillers is a viable approach to produce CSEs with high room temperature ionic conductivity for SSLMBs.

         <title>Back Cover: Solvation Properties of Neutral Gold Species in Supercritical Water Studied By THz Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
THz spectra of aqueous solutions at ambient conditions encode precious information about H&#8208;bonding, but what about aqueous solutions at supercritical conditions? In their Research Article (e202402120) on neutral gold particles in supercritical water Jan Noetzel et&#8197;al. show that a broad continuum absorption comes from the metal particles while an additional sharp THz resonance is due to strongly interacting water.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energy density of aqueous zinc ion batteries is greatly affected by the low energy density, low potential and low power density of the cathode material. In their Research Article (e202403187), Xijin Xu, Huiqiao Li et&#8197;al. report a method to activate and stabilize a highly reversible four&#8208;electron redox reaction between I&#8722; and I+ by introducing Br&#8722; as a mediator, which greatly promotes the capacity and effectively suppresses iodine shuttling for high cycling stability.

The largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected Pt nanoclusters with atomic precision were reported by Lingwen Liao, Jun Yang, and Zhikun Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402565). The as&#8208;obtained Pt23 nanoclusters via a mixture ligand protecting strategy exhibit superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts, without requiring calcination or other treatments. An excellent photothermal conversion efficiency was also revealed, indicating great potential for applications of such materials.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Stereoselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Photo&#8208;Driven Sequential Sigmatropic Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced quadruple sigmatropic rearrangements can occur owing to a continuously decreasing energy of three key intermediates and the final product, as illustrated in the cover image and reported by Lu Liu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202400805). The background is the ancient Chinese transmission devices before Qin Dynasty.

         <title>Dehydration&#8208;Induced Cluster Consolidation in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Sieving Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation renders JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP a shrinkage of the 1D channels in the c&#8208;axis direction, allowing complete exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while maintaining high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit dynamic phase&#8208;transition behavior under external stimuli could have great potential in adsorptive separations. Here we report on a zinc&#8208;based microporous MOF (JNU&#8208;80) and its reversible transformation between two crystalline phases: large pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP) and narrow pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP). Specifically, JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP can undergo a dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation under heat treatment, resulting in JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP with a reduced channel that allows exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers. We further demonstrate the fabrication of MOF&#8208;polymer composite (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP&#8208;block) and its application in the purification of di&#8208;branched isomers from liquid&#8208;phase hexane mixtures (98&#8201;% di&#8208;branched) at room temperature, affording the di&#8208;branched hexane isomers with 99.5&#8201;% purity and close to 90&#8201;% recovery rate over ten cycles. This work illustrates an interesting dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation in MOF structure and the ensuing channel shrinkage for sieving di&#8208;branched hexane isomers, which may have important implications for the development of MOFs with dynamic behavior and their potential applications in non&#8208;thermal driven separation technologies.

         <title>Dual Redox Reaction Sites for Pseudocapacitance Based on Ti and &#8722;P Functional Groups of Ti3C2PBrx MXene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8722;P) has been prepared by replacing &#8722;Br in Ti3C2Br2 with gas&#8208;phase P. Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8211;0.6) powder is directly obtained and the atomic content of P reaches the theoretical atomic percentage content. Compared to MXene Ti3C2Br2 with the &#8722;Br functional groups, the areal capacitance of Ti3C2PBrx with &#8722;P functional groups has increased by about 3.6&#8197;times at scan rates of 20&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate has not decreased after 10000&#8197;cycles. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8722;P and Ti.







Abstract
MXenes have extensive applications due to their different properties determined by intrinsic structures and various functional groups. Exploring different functional groups of MXenes leads to improved performance or potential applications. In this work, we prepared new Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8211;0.6) MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8722;P) through a two&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase reaction. The acquisition of &#8722;P is achieved by replacing bromine functional groups (&#8722;Br) of Ti3C2Br2 in the phosphorus vapor. After &#8722;Br is replaced with &#8722;P, Ti3C2PBrx MXene shows an improved areal capacitance (360&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 20&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared with Ti3C2Br2 MXene (102&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2). At a current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 10000&#8197;cycles, the capacitance retention of Ti3C2PBrx MXene has not decreased. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8722;P and Ti.

         <title>Atomic Ruthenium&#8208;Promoted Cadmium Sulfide for Photocatalytic Production of Amino Acids from Biomass Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalysts loaded on ultrathin CdS nanosheets (Ru1/CdS), which efficiently catalyze biomass&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids to produce amino acids under visible light irradiation. The optimal system predominates the conventional thermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems in terms of conversion, selectivity, yield, and amino acid formation rates.







Abstract
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are widely used as important ingredients for other nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Here, we report the sustainable production of amino acids from biomass&#8208;derived hydroxy acids with high activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation and mild conditions, using atomic ruthenium&#8208;promoted cadmium sulfide (Ru1/CdS). On a metal basis, the optimized Ru1/CdS exhibits a maximal alanine formation rate of 26.0&#8197;molAla&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gRu&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 1.7&#8197;times and more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of its nanoparticle counterpart and the conventional thermocatalytic process, respectively. Integrated spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations attribute the high performance of Ru1/CdS to the facilitated charge separation and O&#8722;H bond dissociation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy group, here of lactic acid. The operando nuclear magnetic resonance further infers a unique &#8220;double activation&#8221; mechanism of both the CH&#8722;OH and CH3&#8722;CH&#8722;OH structures in lactic acid, which significantly accelerates its photocatalytic amination toward alanine.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hexagonal prism&#8208;shaped crystal known as KBCOB, renowned for its exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation response and high transparency in the deep ultraviolet spectrum, is shown on the cover image. At the center of the image, the crystal's chemical structure is depicted. This structure consists of a tri&#8208;layered arrangement of green, multifaceted polyhedral units [B4O5(OH)4]2&#8722; representing the borate's boron&#8208;oxygen framework.

         <title>The Role of the Molecular Encapsulation Effect in Stabilizing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Rich Gel&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes modulates the activity of the active hydrogen atoms by the formation of the molecular encapsulation effect, thereby suppressing the interfacial side reactions. With this strategy, we achieved stable operation of a practical 1.1&#8197;Ah gel&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cell.







Abstract
Gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes with superior mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing abilities and high Li+ transference numbers can be obtained by in situ polymerization of monomers with hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties. However, it is overlooked that the active hydrogen atoms in hydrogen&#8208;bond donors experience displacement reactions with lithium metal in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), leading to corrosion of the lithium metal. Herein, it is discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;rich gel&#8208;state electrolytes modulates the chemical activity of the active hydrogen atoms via the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded intermolecular interactions. The characterizations reveal that the added hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors encapsulate the active hydrogen atoms to suppress the interfacial chemical corrosions of lithium metals, thereby enhancing the chemical stability of the polymer structure and interphase. With the employment of this strategy, a 1.1&#8197;Ah LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li metal pouch cell achieves stable cycling with 96.3&#8201;% capacity retention at 100 cycles. This new approach indicates a feasible path for achieving in situ polymerization of highly stable gel&#8208;state&#8208;based LMBs.

         <title>Insights into the Distinct Behaviors between Bifunctional and Binary Organoborane Catalysts through Terpolymerization of Epoxide, CO2, and Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematically experimental and computational investigation on the catalytic performances of the bifunctional and binary organoborane catalysts are performed to explore the origination of the catalytic differences in terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride, where gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers and tapered diblock terpolymers were afforded respectively.







Abstract
Alkyl borane compounds&#8208;mediated polymerizations have expanded to Lewis pair polymerization, free radical polymerization, ionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization, and polyhomologation. The bifunctional organoborane catalysts that contain the Lewis acid and ammonium or phosphonium salt in one molecule have demonstrated superior catalytic performance for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of epoxides and ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides and CO2 than their two&#8208;component analogues, i.e., the blend of organoborane and ammonium or phosphonium salt. To explore the origin of the differences of the one&#8208;component and two&#8208;component organoborane catalysts, here we conducted a systematic investigation on the catalytic performances of these two kinds of organoborane catalysts via terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride. The resultant terpolymers produced independently by bifunctional and binary organoborane catalyst exhibited distinct microstructures, where a series of gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers with varying polyester content were afforded using the bifunctional catalyst, while tapering diblock terpolymers were obtained using the binary system. The bifunctional catalyst enhances the competitiveness of CO2 insertion than anhydride, which leads to the premature incorporation of CO2 into the polymer chains and ultimately results in the formation of gradient terpolymers. DFT calculations revealed the role of electrostatic interaction and charge distribution caused by intramolecular synergistic effect for bifunctional organoborane catalyst.

         <title>Electrophilic Hydrosilylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenes Derived from Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
14&#8208;Electron Pt(II) germyl complexes bearing small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) catalyze the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrosilylation (anti SiH bond addition) of electron&#8208;rich alkenes derived from enamines, thus producing &#946;&#8208;aminosilanes. On the contrary, using bulkier NHC ligands promotes the competitive silylative dehydrocoupling process. Mechanistic studies point to unprecedented outer&#8208;sphere Pt&#8208;catalyzed transformations.







Abstract
The low&#8208;electron count, air&#8208;stable, platinum complexes [Pt(ItBu&#8217;)(ItBu)][BArF] (C1) (ItBu=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), [Pt(SiPh)3(ItBuiPr)2][BArF] (C2) (ItBuiPr=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;iso&#8208;propylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), [Pt(SiPh)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C3), [Pt(GePh3)(ItBuiPr)2][BArF] (C4), [Pt(GePh)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C5) and [Pt(GeEt)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C6) (ItBuMe=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are efficient catalysts (particularly the germyl derivatives) in both the silylative dehydrocoupling and hydrosilylation of electron rich alkenes derived from enamines. The steric hindrance exerted by the NHC ligand plays an important role in the selectivity of the reaction. Thus, bulky ligands are selective towards the silylative dehydrocoupling process whereas less sterically hindered promote the selective hydrosilylation reaction. The latter is, in addition, regioselective towards the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of both internal and terminal enamines, leading to &#946;&#8208;aminosilanes. Moreover, the syn stereochemistry of the amino and silyl groups implies an anti Si&#8722;H bond addition across the double bond. All these facts point to a mechanistic picture that, according to experimental and computational studies, involves a non&#8208;classical hydrosilylation process through an outer&#8208;sphere mechanism in which a formal nucleophilic addition of the enamine to the silicon atom of a platinum &#963;&#8208;SiH complex is the key step. This is in sharp contrast with the classical Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism prevalent in platinum chemistry.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst as an Advanced Redox Mediator for Anodic Oxidation of Organic Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a single&#8208;atom iron catalyst (Fe&#8208;SA@NC), which exhibits good conversion efficiency in organic electro oxidation as an advanced redox mediator. This study provides valuable insights into the design of catalytic systems for organic tandem reactions from an inorganic chemistry aspect.







Abstract
Homogeneous electrocatalysts can indirect oxidate the high overpotential substrates through single&#8208;electron transfer on the electrode surface, enabling efficient operation of organic electrosynthesis catalytic cycles. However, the problems of this chemistry still exist such as high dosage, difficult recovery, and low catalytic efficiency. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high atom utilization and excellent catalytic activity, hold great promise in addressing the limitations of homogeneous catalysts. In view of this, we have employed Fe&#8208;SA@NC as an advanced redox mediator to try to change this situation. Fe&#8208;SA@NC was synthesized using an encapsulation&#8208;pyrolysis method, and it demonstrated remarkable performance as a redox mediator in a range of reported organic electrosynthesis reactions, and enabling the construction of various C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bonds. Moreover, Fe&#8208;SA@NC demonstrated a great potential in exploring new synthetic method for organic electrosynthesis.

     alt="Single-Atom Iron Catalyst as an Advanced Redox Mediator for Anodic Oxidation of Organic Electrosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We synthesized a single-atom iron catalyst (Fe-SA@NC), which exhibits good conversion efficiency in organic electro oxidation as an advanced redox mediator. This study provides valuable insights into the design of catalytic systems for organic tandem reactions from an inorganic chemistry aspect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homogeneous electrocatalysts can indirect oxidate the high overpotential substrates through single-electron transfer on the electrode surface, enabling efficient operation of organic electrosynthesis catalytic cycles. However, the problems of this chemistry still exist such as high dosage, difficult recovery, and low catalytic efficiency. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high atom utilization and excellent catalytic activity, hold great promise in addressing the limitations of homogeneous catalysts. In view of this, we have employed Fe-SA@NC as an advanced redox mediator to try to change this situation. Fe-SA@NC was synthesized using an encapsulation-pyrolysis method, and it demonstrated remarkable performance as a redox mediator in a range of reported organic electrosynthesis reactions, and enabling the construction of various C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bonds. Moreover, Fe-SA@NC demonstrated a great potential in exploring new synthetic method for organic electrosynthesis. We employed it to develop a new electro-oxidative ring-opening transformation of cyclopropyl amides. In this new reaction system, Fe-SA@NC showed good tolerance to drug molecules with complex structures, as well as enabling flow electrochemical syntheses and gram-scale transformations. This work highlights the great potential of SACs in organic electrosynthesis, thereby opening a new avenue in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Record External Quantum Efficiency of 11.5&#8201;% in Solution&#8208;Processable Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Utilizing Hot Exciton Mechanism</title>

         <dc:description>
An ingenious strategy is for the first time proposed to develop solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue HLCT emitters by attaching rigid imide aliphatic rings onto the HLCT emitting core. With outstanding characteristics of these emitters, the unprecedented OLED performances with a record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 11.5&#8201;% and high colour purity are achieved, showing competitive superiority for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.







Abstract
High performance solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue emitters with a Commission International de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of CIEy&#8804;0.08 are highly desired in ultrahigh&#8208;definition display. Although, deep&#8208;blue materials with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited&#8208;state feature are promising candidates, their rigidity and planar molecular structures limit their application in solution&#8208;processing technique. Herein, four novel deep&#8208;blue solution&#8208;processable HLCT emitters were first proposed by attaching rigid imide aliphatic rings as functional units onto the HLCT emitting core. The functional units not only improve solubility, enhance thermal properties and morphological stability of the emitting core, but also promote photoluminescence efficiency, balance charge carrier transport, and inhibit aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect due to the weak electron&#8208;withdrawing property as well as steric hindrance. The corresponding solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) substantiate an unprecedented maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 11.5&#8201;% with an emission peak at 456&#8197;nm and excellent colour purity (full width at half maximum=56&#8197;nm and CIEy=0.09). These efficiencies represent the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance among the solution&#8208;processable blue OLEDs based on the &#8220;hot exciton&#8221; mechanism. This simple strategy opens up a new avenue for designing highly efficient solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Monodisperse Micron&#8208;Sized Polymer Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;free living self&#8208;assembly method is developed here for the first time on the preparation of monodisperse micron&#8208;sized vesicles from an alternating copolymer. Small nanodisks are formed in solution first, which act as seeds to initiate the subsequent growth into circular nanosheets, curved nanosheets, spherical crowns, and final uniform vesicles.







Abstract
Artificial vesicles are recognized as powerful platforms for a large body of research across the disciplines of chemistry, physics and biology. Despite the great progress, control of the size distribution to make uniform vesicles remains fundamentally difficult due to the highly uncontrollable growth kinetics, especially for micron&#8208;sized vesicles. Here we report a template&#8208;free living self&#8208;assembly method to prepare monodisperse vesicles around 1&#8197;&#956;m from an alternating copolymer. The polymer forms nanodisks (ca. 9&#8197;nm) in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), acting as seeds for subsequent growth. By adding water, the nanodisks gradually grow into larger circular bilayer nanosheets, which bend to crowns and continue to grow into uniform micron&#8208;sized vesicles. The first&#8208;order growth kinetics as well as the small size polydispersity index (&lt;0.1) suggests the living self&#8208;assembly characteristics. This work paves a new way in both living self&#8208;assembly and monodisperse polymer vesicles.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Field Induced Synthesis of Ultrafine&#8208;Sized High&#8208;Entropy Compounds with Excellent Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atom diffusion and phase separation are inhibited in the high&#8208;pressure field to achieve the general formation of ultrafine&#8208;sized high entropy compounds (HECs). Their unique advantages of ultrafine size, carbon incorporation, and high entropy effect enable them to have excellent reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage reaction kinetics and capacities.







Abstract
Emerging high entropy compounds (HECs) have attracted huge attention in electrochemical energy&#8208;related applications. The features of ultrafine size and carbon incorporation show great potential to boost the ion&#8208;storage kinetics of HECs. However, they are rarely reported because high&#8208;temperature calcination tends to result in larger crystallites, phase separation, and carbon reduction. Herein, using the NaCl self&#8208;assembly template method, by introducing a high&#8208;pressure field in the calcination process, the atom diffusion and phase separation are inhibited for the general formation of HECs, and the HEC aggregation is inhibited for obtaining ultrafine size. The general preparation of ultrafine&#8208;sized (&lt;10&#8197;nm) HECs (nitrides, oxides, sulfides, and phosphates) anchored on porous carbon composites is realized. They are demonstrated by combining advanced characterization technologies with theoretical computations. Ultrafine&#8208;sized high entropy sulfides&#8208;MnFeCoCuSnMo/porous carbon (HES&#8208;MnFeCoCuSnMo/PC) as representative anodes exhibit excellent sodium&#8208;ion storage kinetics and capacities (a high rating capacity of 278&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for full cell and a high cycling capacity of 281&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 6000 cycles for half cell) due to the combining advantages of high entropy effect, ultrafine size, and PC incorporation. Our work provides a new opportunity for designing and fabricating ultrafine&#8208;sized HECs.

         <title>A Universal Self&#8208;Propagating Synthesis of Aluminum&#8208;Based Oxyhalide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is developed to realize the scalable synthesis of cost&#8208;effective aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs, which involves a self&#8208;propagating method by the exothermic reaction of the raw materials. This strategy enables the synthesis of various aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs with tunable components and high ionic conductivities (over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) for different cations (Li+, Na+, Ag+).







Abstract
Inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) play a vital role in high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, the current method of SSE preparation usually involves high&#8208;energy mechanical ball milling and/or a high&#8208;temperature annealing process, which is not suitable for practical application. Here, a facile strategy is developed to realize the scalable synthesis of cost&#8208;effective aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs, which involves a self&#8208;propagating method by the exothermic reaction of the raw materials. This strategy enables the synthesis of various aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs with tunable components and high ionic conductivities (over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) for different cations (Li+, Na+, Ag+). It is elucidated that the amorphous matrix, which mainly consists of various oxidized chloroaluminate species that provide numerous sites for smooth ion migration, is actually the key factor for the achieved high conductivities. Benefit from their easy synthesis, low cost, and low weight, the aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs synthesized by our approach could further promote practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Confinement of Sustainable Carbon Dots Results in Long Afterglow Emitters and Photocatalyst for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The forest, a valuable source for the development of sustainable photosensitizers, essentially improves the technological potential of photo&#8208;ATRP and free radical polymerization. In their Research Article (e202402915), Shujun Li, Zhijun Chen, Bernd Strehmel et&#8197;al. demonstrate the performance of a new material, produced by confinement of cellulose&#8208;based carbon dots, that operates as a long afterglow emitter in the second timeframe and as photocatalyst in radical photopolymerization. Their use in a photo&#8208;ATRP cocktail results in block copolymers.

Valuable formamides were &#8220;pull out of the hat&#8221; upon reaction of amines with biomass&#8208;based starting materials such as 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone, glycolaldehyde and glycerolaldehyde by avoiding any waste products using environmentally benign oxygen as oxidant, as reported by Haijun Jiao, Feng Shi, Jabor Rabeah, Angelika Br&#252;ckner et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402241). This reaction may be regarded as being &#8220;green&#8221; and somehow &#8220;magic&#8221;.

         <title>Inside Cover: Temporal&#8208;Focusing Multiphoton Excitation Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy Using Spontaneously Blinking Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy with temporal&#8208;focusing multiphoton excitation achieves wide&#8208;field and axially confined two&#8208;photon excitation of spontaneously blinking fluorophores, as reported by Fan&#8208;Ching Chien et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404942). This approach reduces the photobleaching of out&#8208;of&#8208;focus molecules to increase the utilization rate of the photon budget for exploring the three&#8208;dimensional morphology of fluorophore&#8208;labeled amyloid&#8208;beta fibril bundles in the brain tissues of a transgenic mouse with Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Cover Picture: A Nonlinear Photochromic Reaction Based on Sensitizer&#8208;Free Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation in a Perylene&#8208;Substituted Rhodamine Spirolactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear photochromic reaction of a rhodamine spirolactam derivative easily synthesized from rhodamine B has been achieved in the Research Article (e202404140) by Yuki Nagai, Yoichi Kobayashi et&#8197;al. The nonlinear behavior results from efficient intersystem crossing and thereby triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation without triplet sensitizers. In addition, using triplet sensitizers extends the responsive wavelength from the blue to red region.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Easy Synthetic Access to High&#8208;Melting Sulfurated Copolymers and their Self&#8208;Assembling Diblock Copolymers from Phenylisothiocyanate and Oxetane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;containing polymers with high melting points can be easily obtained from the copolymerization of phenylisothiocyanate and oxetane, as reported by Alex&#8197;J. Plajer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202405047). The resulting polythioimidocarbonate can then serve as the core&#8208;forming block in the crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a diblock copolymer, accessed employing a macro&#8208;chain transfer agent strategy.

         <title>Back Cover: Commercializable Naphthalene Diimide Anolytes for Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrothermal method was developed to synthesize naphthalene diimide anolytes for neutral flow batteries, significantly enhancing their solubility and stability. This cost&#8208;effective approach not only achieves higher capacity and power density but also promotes the commercialization of advanced energy storage technologies by offering a competitive edge over traditional methods, as reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202405427).

This cost-effective approach not only achieves higher capacity and power density but also promotes the commercialization of advanced energy storage technologies by offering a competitive edge over traditional methods, as reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202405427"&gt;e202405427&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>A Merger of Relay Catalysis with Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enables Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Arylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conceptual merger of relay catalysis with dynamic kinetic resolution strategy is reported to enable regio&#8208; and enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H bond arylation of aliphatic alcohols, forming enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols typically with &gt;90:10 enantiomeric ratios (up to 98:2 er) and 36&#8208;74% yields. The starting materials bearing neighbouring stereogenic centres can be converted to either diastereomer of the &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohol products, with &gt;85:15 diastereomeric ratios determined by the catalysts. The reactions occur under mild conditions, ensuring broad compatibility, and involve readily available aryl bromides, an inorganic base, and commercial Ru&#8208; and Pd&#8208;complexes. Mechanistic experiments support the envisioned mechanism of the transformation occurring through a network of regio&#8208; and stereoselective processes operated by a coherent Ru/Pd&#8208;dual catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Approaching Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Voltage&#8208;Responsive Smart Prelithiation Separator with Surface&#8208;Engineered Sacrificial Lithium Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries has heightened concerns regarding metal resource depletion and the environmental impact of spent batteries. Battery recycling has become paramount globally, but conventional techniques, while effective at extracting transition metals like cobalt and nickel from cathodes, often overlook widely used spent LiFePO4 due to its abundant and low&#8208;cost iron content. Direct regeneration, a promising approach for restoring deteriorated cathodes, is hindered by practicality and cost issues despite successful methods like solid&#8208;state sintering. Hence, a smart prelithiation separator based on surface&#8208;engineered sacrificial lithium agents is proposed. Benefiting from the synergistic anionic and cationic redox, the prelithiation separator can intelligently release or intake active lithium via voltage regulation. The staged lithium replenishment strategy was implemented, successfully restoring spent LiFePO4&#8217;s capacity to 177 mAh g&#8722;1 and a doubled life. Simultaneously, the separator can absorb excess active lithium up to approximately 600mAh g&#8722;1 below 2.5 V to prevent over&#8208;lithiation of the cathode This innovative, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective strategy paves the way for the direct regeneration of spent batteries, expanding the possibilities in the realm of lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large&#160;dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in ligand and&#160;coordination&#160;tuned chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations. The&#160;gCPL&#160;value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54,&#160;which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Through photophysical measurements,&#160;single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses&#160;and quantum chemical calculations, changes in the geometric and electronic structures were observed for a series of chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes which enhanced the&#160;gCPL&#160;value.&#160;The emission quantum yield and&#160;photosensitized energy transfer efficiencies of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than that with previous Cs+.&#160;Based on the systematic&#160;modifications and analyses for chiral&#160;tetrakis&#160;Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cationic copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene was prepared and structurally characterized via infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This structure exemplifies a new class of borylenes stabilized by three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron metal&#8208;boron&#8208;metal covalent bonding interaction, displaying exceptional &#963;&#8208;acidity and unparalleled &#960;&#8208;donor capability for CO activation that outperforms all of the known transition metal cations and is comparable or even superior to the documented base&#8208;trapped borylenes.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Large Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal Nanowire Networks by Microfluidic Laminar Flow Synthesis for Formic Acid Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great research interest in two&#8208;dimensional metal nanowire networks (2D MNWNs) due to their large specific surface area and abundance of unsaturated coordination atoms, their controllable synthesis still remains a significant challenge. Herein, a microfluidics laminar flow&#8208;based approach is developed, enabling the facile preparation of large&#8208;scale 2D structures with diverse alloy compositions, such as PtBi, AuBi, PdBi, PtPdBi, and PtAuCu alloys. Remarkably, these 2D MNWNs can reach sizes up to submillimeter scale (~220 &#956;m), which is significantly larger than the evolution from the 1D or 3D counterparts that typically measure only tens of nanometers. The PdBi 2D MNWNs affords the highest specific activity for formic acid (2669.1 mA mg&#8208;1) among current unsupported catalysts, which is 103.5 times higher than Pt&#8208;black, respectively. Furthermore, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) experiments provide comprehensive evidence that PdBi 2D MNWNs catalysts can effectively prevent CO* poisoning, resulting in exceptional activity and stability for the oxidation of formic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Exfoliatable Layered 2D Honeycomb Crystals of Host&#8208;guest Complexes Networked by CH&#8208;&#960; Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies of graphene show that robust chemical bonds such as covalent bonds with trigonal&#8208;planar atoms afford layered atomic 2D crystals possessing unique properties. Although layered molecular crystals are of interest to diversify elements and structures of 2D materials, the structural diversity of molecules as well as weak intermolecular interactions inevitably makes the design to be one&#8208;off and individual. We herein report a versatile method to assemble layered molecular crystals. By developing a D3&#8208;symmetry host at vertices to form a honeycomb layer, a diverse range of layered 2D host&#8208;guest crystals were obtained. Substituents on the host, elements/structures of the guest, stereochemistries of the host and types of intercalants were diversified, which should allow for 6&#215;32&#215;3&#215;2 combinations for structural diversification.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous Sn&#8208;air batteries are attracting a great deal of interest in recent years due to the ultra&#8208;high safety, low cost, dendrite&#8208;free and highly reversible Sn anode. However, the slurry oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics on the air cathodes seriously affect the Sn&#8208;air battery performances. Although various advanced catalysts have been developed, the charge overpotentials (~1000 mV) of these Sn&#8208;air batteries are still not satisfactory. Herein, iron oxide (Fe2O3) modified titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods with heterogeneous structure are firstly synthesized on Ti mesh (Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti), and the obtained Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti is further applied as catalytic electrodes for Sn&#8208;air batteries. The core&#8208;shell heterogeneous structure of Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can effectively facilitate the conversion of electrochemical intermediates and separation of photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes to active oxygen&#8208;related reaction processes. DFT and experimental results also confirm that Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can not only act as the electrocatalysts to improve ORR/OER properties, but also exhibit the superior photo&#8208;catalytic activity to promote charge kinetics. Hence, the Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Sn&#8208;air batteries show ultra&#8208;low overpotential of ~40 mV, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability under light irradiation. This work will shed light on rational photo&#8208;assisted catalytic cathode design for new&#8208;type metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Functional Liquid&#8208;Based Interfaces: From Mechanism to Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional liquid&#8208;based interfaces, with their inhomogeneous regions that emphasize the functionalized liquids, have attracted much interest as a versatile platform for a broad spectrum of applications, from chemical manufacturing to practical uses. These interfaces leverage the physicochemical characteristics of liquids, alongside dynamic behaviors induced by macroscopic wettability and microscopic molecular exchange balance, to allow for tailored properties within their functional structures. In this Minireview, we provide a foundational overview of these functional interfaces, based on the structural investigations and molecular mechanisms of interaction forces that directly modulate functionalities. Then, we discuss design strategies that have been employed in recent applications, and the crucial aspects that require focus. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in functional liquid&#8208;based interfaces and provide a perspective on future research directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational  Design of the Spatial Effect in a Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase Reverses the Regioselectivity of C(sp3)&#8208;H Bond Hydroxylation in Aliphatic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydroxylation of remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in aliphatic amino acids yields crucial precursors for the synthesis of high&#8208;value compounds. However, accurate regulation of the regioselectivity of remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds hydroxylation in aliphatic amino acids continues to be a common challenge in chemosynthesis and biosynthesis. In this study, the Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (BlAH) was mined and found to catalyze hydroxylation at the &#947; and &#948; sites of aliphatic amino acids. Through crystal structure analysis, molecular dynamic simulation and quantum chemical calculations revealed that regioselectivity was regulated by the spatial effect of BlAH. Based on this result, the spatial effect of BlAH was reconstructed to stabilize the transition state at the &#948; site of aliphatic amino acids, thereby successfully reversing the &#947; site regioselectivity to the &#948; site. For example, the regioselectivity of L&#8208;Homoleucine (5a) was reversed from the &#947; site (1:12) to the &#948; site (&gt;99:1). The present study not only expands the toolbox of biocatalysts for the regioselective functionalization of remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds, but also provides a theoretical guidance for the precision&#8208;driven modification of similarly remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Transformation of Amorphous Supramolecular Coating to Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Membrane to Trigger Selective Gas Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a &#8220;solution&#8208;processing&#8208;transformation&#8221; strategy, deploying solvent vapor as scaffolds, to fabricate high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes. This strategy can overcome the mismatch in processing conditions and crystal growth thermodynamics faced during the facile solution processing of the membrane. The procedure includes the vapor&#8208;trigged in&#8208;situ transformation of dense amorphous supramolecules to crystalline HOF&#8208;16, with HOF&#8208;11 as the transient state. The mechanism involves a vapor&#8208;activated dissolution&#8208;precipitation equilibrium shifting and hydrogen bonding&#8208;guided molecule rearrangement, elucidated through combined experimental and theoretical analysis. Upon removal of the molecular scaffolds, the resulting HOF&#8208;16 membranes showcase significant improvement in hydrogen separation performance over their amorphous counterparts and previously reported HOF membranes. The method&#8217;s broad applicability is evidenced by successfully extending it to other substrates and HOF structures. This study provides a fundamental understanding of guest&#8208;induced ordered supramolecular assembly and paves the way for the advanced manufacture of high&#8208;performance HOF membranes for gas separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous FeSnOx&#160;Nanosheets with Hierarchical Vacancies for Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries, noted for their low material costs and high energy density, are emerging as a promising alternative to LIBs in various applications including power grids and standalone renewable energy systems. These batteries are commonly assembled with glass fiber membranes, which face significant challenges like the dissolution of polysulfides, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and the dendrites growth. Here, we develop an amorphous FeSnOx nanosheet with hierarchical vacancies, including abundant oxygen vacancies (Ovs) and nano&#8208;sized perforations, that can be assembled into a multifunctional layer overlaying commercial separators for RT Na&#8208;S batteries. The Ovs offer strong adsorption and abundant catalytic sites for polysulfides, while the defect concentration is finely tuned to elucidate the polysulfides conversion mechanisms. The nano&#8208;sized perforations aid in regulating Na ions transport, resulting in uniform Na deposition. Moreover, the strategic addition of trace amounts of Ti3C2 forms an amorphous/crystalline interface that significantly improves the mechanical properties of the separator and suppresses dendrite growth. As a result, the task&#8208;specific layer achieves ultra&#8208;light (~0.1mg cm&#8208;2), ultra&#8208;thin (~200nm), and ultra&#8208;robust (modulus = 4.9GPa) characteristics. Consequently, the RT Na&#8208;S battery maintained a high capacity of 610.3mAh g&#8208;1 and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% after 400 cycles at 0.5C.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Radical C&#8208;C Coupling from Carboxylic Acids with Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective coupling of two different radicals is a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the process occurring statistically. Generally, the cross&#8208;coupling selectivity is achieved by the persistent radical effect (PRE), resulting in limited radical precursors. In this paper, a highly selective cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl radicals with acyl radicals to construct C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds, or with alkyl radicals to construct C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds have been achieved with the readily available carboxylic acids and their derivatives (NHPI ester) as coupling partners. The success originates from the use of tridentate ligand (L1) to enable radical cross&#8208;coupling process to Ni&#8208;mediated organometallic mechanism. This protocol offers a facile and flexible access to structurally diverse ketones (up to 90% yield), and also a new solution for the challenging double decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) coupling. The broad utility and functional group tolerance are further illustrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural&#8208;occurring carboxylic acids and drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Vapor/Vapor&#8208;Solid Interfacial Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes on Alumina Hollow Fiber for Advanced Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their chemical stability and porous crystalline structure, hold promises as advanced separation membranes. However, fabricating high&#8208;quality COF membranes, particularly on industrial&#8208;preferred hollow fiber substrates, remains challenging. This study introduces a novel vapor/vapor&#8208;solid (V/V&#8208;S) method for growing ultrathin crystalline TpPa&#8208;1 COF membranes on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers (TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina). Through vapor&#8208;phase monomer introduction onto polydopamine&#8208;modified alumina at 170 &#176;C and 1 atm, efficient polymerization and crystallization occur at the confined V&#8208;S interface. This enables one&#8208;step growth within 8 h, producing 100 nm thick COF membranes with strong substrate adhesion. TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina exhibits exceptional stability and performance over 80 h in continuous cross&#8208;flow organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), with methanol permeance of about 200 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1 and dye rejection with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of approximately 700 Da. Moreover, the versatile V/V&#8208;S method synthesizes two additional COF membranes (TpPa2Cl/Alumina and TpHz/Alumina) with different pore sizes and chemical environments. Adjusting the COF membrane thickness between 100&#8208;500 nm is achievable easily by varying the growth cycle numbers. Notably, TpPa2Cl/Alumina demonstrates excellent OSN performance in separating the model active pharmaceutical ingredient glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), highlighting the method&#8217;s potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their chemical stability and porous crystalline structure, hold promises as advanced separation membranes. However, fabricating high-quality COF membranes, particularly on industrial-preferred hollow fiber substrates, remains challenging. This study introduces a novel vapor/vapor-solid (V/V-S) method for growing ultrathin crystalline TpPa-1 COF membranes on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers (TpPa-1/Alumina). Through vapor-phase monomer introduction onto polydopamine-modified alumina at 170 &#176;C and 1 atm, efficient polymerization and crystallization occur at the confined V-S interface. This enables one-step growth within 8 h, producing 100 nm thick COF membranes with strong substrate adhesion. TpPa-1/Alumina exhibits exceptional stability and performance over 80 h in continuous cross-flow organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), with methanol permeance of about 200 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 and dye rejection with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of approximately 700 Da. Moreover, the versatile V/V-S method synthesizes two additional COF membranes (TpPa2Cl/Alumina and TpHz/Alumina) with different pore sizes and chemical environments. Adjusting the COF membrane thickness between 100-500 nm is achievable easily by varying the growth cycle numbers. Notably, TpPa2Cl/Alumina demonstrates excellent OSN performance in separating the model active pharmaceutical ingredient glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), highlighting the method&#8217;s potential for large-scale industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dynamic Activation of Copper/Silicon Interface for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous studies have shown a fact that phase transformation and/or reconstruction are likely to occur and play crucial roles in electrochemical scenarios. Nevertheless, a decisive factor (such as facet, phase etc.) behind the diverse photoelectrochemical activity and selectivity of various copper/silicon photoelectrodes is still largely debated and missing in the community, especially for possibly dynamic behaviors of metal catalyst/semiconductor interface. Herein, through in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, a model system of Cu nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined facets on black p&#8208;type silicon (BSi) is demonstrated to unprecedentedly reveal the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu nanocrystal&#8208;BSi interface, which is validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. The presence of in situ formed silicide can significantly enhance photovoltage and deliver a record&#8208;high onset potential above &#8208;0.4 V versus reversible reference electrode (RHE) for photoelectrochemical CH4 production. Significantly, the adaptive junction at Cu/Si interface is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8208;Cu distance, which efficiently restricts the C&#8208;C coupling pathway but strengthens the bonding with key intermediate of *CHO for CH4 yield, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.</dc:description>

The presence of in situ formed silicide can significantly enhance photovoltage and deliver a record-high onset potential above -0.4 V versus reversible reference electrode (RHE) for photoelectrochemical CH4 production. Significantly, the adaptive junction at Cu/Si interface is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu-Cu distance, which efficiently restricts the C-C coupling pathway but strengthens the bonding with key intermediate of *CHO for CH4 yield, resulting in a remarkable 16-fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Chelating Intermediate for Air&#8208;Processed Phase&#8208;Pure FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamidinium&#8211;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite holds promise as a prime candidate in the realm of perovskite photovoltaics. However, the photo&#8208;active &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase, existing as a metastable state, is observable solely at elevated temperatures and is susceptible to degradation into the &#948;&#8208;phase in ambient air. Therefore, the attainment of phase&#8208;stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 in ambient conditions has become a crucial objective in perovskite research. Here, we proposed an efficient conversion process of PbI2 into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskites in ambient air. This conversion was facilitated by the introduction of chelating molecules, which interacted with PbI2 to form an intermediate phase. Due to the reduced formation barrier resulting from the altered reaction pathway, this stable intermediate phase transitioned directly into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 upon the deposition of the organic cation solution, effectively bypassing the formation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. Consequently, the ambient&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibited an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 25.08%, along with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.19 V. Furthermore, the unencapsulated devices demonstrated remarkable environmental stability. Notably, this innovative approach promises broad applicability across various chelating molecules, opening new avenues for further progress in the ambient air fabrication of FAPbI3 PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Structures of Anchor Sites to Achieve Zero&#8208;Valence Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Advanced Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have recently become highly attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions owing to their remarkably high selectivity. However, compared to their nanoparticle counterparts, atomically dispersed metal atoms in SACs often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. Here, by theoretical calculations, we show that tuning the local electronic structures of metal anchor sites on g&#8208;C3N4 by doping B atoms (BCN) with relatively lower electronegativity allows achieving zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high activity in H2 activation. The precise synthesis of Pd SACs on BCN supports with varied B contents substantiated the theoretical prediction. A zero&#8208;valence Pd1/BCN SAC was achieved on a BCN support with a relatively low B content. It exhibited much higher stability in a H2 reducing environment, and more strikingly, a hydrogenation activity, approximately 10 and 34 times greater than those high&#8208;valence Pd1/g&#8208;C3N4 and Pd1/BCN with a high B content, respectively.</dc:description>

This mild&#160;protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and exceptional control over chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, providing practical access to diverse valuable azidated chiral allylic esters. Mechanistic studies imply that the chiral copper complex is implicated as a bifunctional catalyst in both the photoredox catalyzed azidyl radical generation and enantioselective radical C&#8208;O cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

Constructing Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 supported intermetallic L10&#8722;PtNi NPs via regulating RMSI between Pt and supports as high&#8208;performing ORR catalysts for PEMFCs







Abstract
Developing efficient and anti&#8208;corrosive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of great importance for the applications of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, we report a novel approach to prepare metal oxides supported intermetallic Pt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) via the reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI) as ORR catalysts, using Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 (Ni/ZrO2) supported L10&#8722;PtNi NPs as a proof of concept. Benefiting from the Ni migration during RMSI, the oxygen vacancy concentrations in the support are increased, leading to an electron enrichment of Pt. The optimal L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI catalyst achieves remarkably low mass activity (MA) loss (17.8&#8201;%) after 400,000 accelerated durability test cycles in a half&#8208;cell and exceptional PEMFC performance (MA=0.76&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density=1.52/0.92&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8722;O2/&#8722;air, and 18.4&#8201;% MA decay after 30,000&#8197;cycles), representing the best reported Pt&#8208;based ORR catalysts without carbon supports. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI requires a lower energetic barrier for ORR than L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2 (direct loading), which is ascribed to a decreased Bader charge transfer between Pt and *OH, and the improved stability of L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;Ni/ZrO2&#8722;RMSI compared to L10&#8722;PtNi&#8722;C can be contributed to the increased adhesion energy and Ni vacancy formation energy within the PtNi alloy.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Carbomagnesiation for Atroposelective Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral catalytic system that can facilitate the cleavage of two different unactivated aromatic C&#8722;O bonds in the same molecule with simultaneous chemo&#8208; and enantiocontrol is disclosed through an unusual Ni&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation. This reaction enables the establishment of a novel catalytic atroposelective ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization process. Synthetic elaborations indicates the application potential of this method.







Abstract
There is a pressing need for methods that can connect enantioenriched organic compounds with readily accessible building blocks via asymmetric functionalization of unreactive chemical bonds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Herein, the asymmetric chemoselective cleavage of two unactivated C(Ar)&#8722;O bonds in the same molecule is disclosed for the first time through an unusual nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation. This reaction facilitates the evolution of a novel atroposelective ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization. Utilizing readily available dibenzo bicyclic substrates, diverse valuable axially chiral biaryls are furnished with high efficiencies. Synthetic elaborations showcase the application potential of this method. The features of this method include good atom&#8208;economy, multiple roles of the nucleophile, and a simple catalytic system that enables the precise magnesiation of an &#945;&#8208;C(Ar)&#8722;O bond and arylation of a &#946;&#8208;C(Ar)&#8722;O bond.

         <title>Large Libraries of Structurally Diverse Macrocycles Suitable for Membrane Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles are promising for drug development due to their good binding properties and the potential to cross membranes. A synthetic strategy and chemical building blocks are developed to produce and screen thousands of small, structurally highly diverse peptidic macrocycles. HTS identifies potent thrombin inhibitors with good membrane permeability. The strategy may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.







Abstract
Macrocycles offer an attractive format for drug development due to their good binding properties and potential to cross cell membranes. To efficiently identify macrocyclic ligands for new targets, methods for the synthesis and screening of large combinatorial libraries of small cyclic peptides were developed, many of them using thiol groups for efficient peptide macrocyclization. However, a weakness of these libraries is that invariant thiol&#8208;containing building blocks such as cysteine are used, resulting in a region that does not contribute to library diversity but increases molecule size. Herein, we synthesized a series of structurally diverse thiol&#8208;containing elements and used them for the combinatorial synthesis of a 2,688&#8208;member library of small, structurally diverse peptidic macrocycles with unprecedented skeletal complexity. We then used this library to discover potent thrombin and plasma kallikrein inhibitors, some also demonstrating favorable membrane permeability. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of macrocycle&#8208;target complexes showed that the size and shape of the newly developed thiol elements are key for binding. The strategy and library format presented in this work significantly enhance structural diversity by allowing combinatorial modifications to a previously invariant region of peptide macrocycles, which may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.

         <title>DOTA&#8208;Based Plectin&#8208;1 Targeted Contrast Agent Enables Detection of Pancreatic Cancer in Human Tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the lowest survival rates which is related to the lack of diagnostic tools for early detection. In this study, we developed a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 that significantly improves imaging of PDAC in human tissue and in vivo. These results demonstrate the great potential of the probe to enable early PDAC diagnosis.







Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy with extremely poor patient survival rates. A key reason for the poor prognosis is the lack of effective diagnostic tools to detect the disease at curable, premetastatic stages. Tumor surgical resection is PDAC's first&#8208;line treatment, however distinguishing between cancerous and healthy tissue with current imaging tools remains a challenge. In this work, we report a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 for imaging PDAC with high specificity. To enable heterogeneous functionalization of the DOTA&#8208;core with multiple targeting peptide units and the fluorophore, a novel, fully clickable synthetic route that proceeds in one pot was developed. Extensive validation of the probe set the stage for PDAC detection in mice and human tissue. Altogether, these findings may pave the way for improved clinical understanding and early detection of PDAC progression as well as more accurate resection criteria.

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Transannulation En Route to N&#8722;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers by denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazones with internal alkynes is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N atropisomers were synthesized with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed transannulation reactions triggered by the extrusion of small gaseous molecules have emerged as a powerful strategy for the efficient construction of heterocyclic compounds. However, their use in asymmetric synthesis remains challenging because of the difficulty in controlling stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of N&#8722;N atropisomers by the denitrogenative transannulation of benzotriazones with alkynes. A broad range of N&#8722;N atropisomers was obtained with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity under mild conditions. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction mechanism and enantioselectivity control.

         <title>Polyfluorinated Organic Diammonium Induced Lead Iodide Arrangement for Efficient Two&#8208;Step&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells are developed by incorporating a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt which cann't generate low&#8208;dimensional perovskites into the lead iodide precursor to change the arrangement of the lead iodide crystals. The resulting high&#8208;quality perovskite film with large grain size boost the efficiencies to 24.70&#8201;% and 21.04&#8201;% for cell (0.06&#8197;cm2) and module (100&#8197;cm2), respectively.







Abstract
The inefficient conversion of lead iodide to perovskite has become one of the major challenges in further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells fabricated by the two&#8208;step method. Herein, the discontinuous lead iodide layer realized by introduction of a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt, octafluoro&#8208;([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;diyl)&#8208;dimethanaminium (OFPP) iodide which does not form low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, can enable the satisfactory conversion of lead iodide into perovskite, leading to meliorated crystallinity and enlarged grains in the OFPP modulated perovskite (OFPP&#8208;PVK) film. Combined with the effective defect passivation, the OFPP&#8208;PVK films show enhanced charge mobility and suppressed charge recombination. Accordingly, the OFPP&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exhibit a champion efficiency of 24.76&#8201;% with better device stability. Moreover, a superior efficiency of 21.04&#8201;% was achieved in a large&#8208;area perovskite module (100&#8197;cm2). Our work provides a unique insight into the function of organic diammonium additive in boosting photovoltaic performance.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inefficient conversion of lead iodide to perovskite has become one of the major challenges in further improving the performance of perovskite solar cells fabricated by the two-step method. Herein, the discontinuous lead iodide layer realized by introduction of a polyfluorinated organic diammonium salt, octafluoro-([1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4,4&#8242;-diyl)-dimethanaminium (OFPP) iodide which does not form low-dimensional perovskites, can enable the satisfactory conversion of lead iodide into perovskite, leading to meliorated crystallinity and enlarged grains in the OFPP modulated perovskite (OFPP-PVK) film. Combined with the effective defect passivation, the OFPP-PVK films show enhanced charge mobility and suppressed charge recombination. Accordingly, the OFPP-based perovskite solar cells exhibit a champion efficiency of 24.76&#8201;% with better device stability. Moreover, a superior efficiency of 21.04&#8201;% was achieved in a large-area perovskite module (100&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Our work provides a unique insight into the function of organic diammonium additive in boosting photovoltaic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A MOF@Metal Oxide Heterostructure Induced by Post&#8208;Synthetic Gamma&#8208;Ray Irradiation for Catalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time explore a novel and simple route to construct MOF heterostructures using advanced post&#8208;synthetic radiation technique. Notably, a new HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure was synthesized through a combination of in situ skeleton etching and metal node reduction within parent MOF induced by gamma radiation under ambient conditions. The resulting HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O exhibits remarkable catalytic performance in the reduction of p&#8208;nitrophenol to p&#8208;aminophenol compared to the parent HKUST&#8208;1.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based heterostructures, which exhibit enhanced or unexpected functionality and properties due to synergistic effects, are typically synthesized using post&#8208;synthetic strategies. However, several reported post&#8208;synthetic strategies remain unsatisfactory, considering issues such as damage to the crystallinity of MOFs, presence of impure phases, and high time and energy consumption. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a novel route for constructing MOF based heterostructures using radiation&#8208;induced post&#8208;synthesis, highlighting the merits of convenience, ambient conditions, large&#8208;scale production, and notable time and energy saving. Specifically, a new HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure was successfully synthesized by simply irradiating a methanol solution dispersed of HKUST&#8208;1 with gamma ray under ambient conditions. The copper source of Cu2O was directly derived from in situ radiation etching and reduction of the parent HKUST&#8208;1, without the use of any additional copper reagents. Significantly, the resulting HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure exhibits remarkable catalytic performance, with a catalytic rate constant nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the parent HKUST&#8208;1.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Induced Dynamic Structural Color in a Host&#8208;Guest System for Time&#8208;Dependent Anticounterfeiting and Double&#8208;Lock Encryption</title>

We report a dynamic structural color induced by the difference in the time required for accomplishing the assembly process. This distinctive result opens a door for countless applications in time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and double&#8208;lock encryption.







Abstract
Manipulation of periodic micro/nanostructures in polymer film is of great importance for academics and industrial applications in anticounterfeiting. However, with the increasing demand on information security, materials with time&#8208;dependent features are urgently required, especially the material where the same information can appear more than once on the time scale. Here, one concise strategy to realize time&#8208;dependent anticounterfeiting and &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encryption based on a host&#8208;guest system is proposed, with one photoresponsive azopolymer as the host and one liquid&#8208;crystalline molecule as the guest. The system exhibits a tunable mass transport in pre&#8208;designed periodic micro/nanostructures by tailoring the process of cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans recovery of azo groups and assembly of mesogenic trans&#8208;isomers, resulting in a dynamic structural color in film. Taking advantage of this extraordinary feature, time&#8208;dependent dynamic anticounterfeiting has been achieved. More importantly, the time of each state's appearance in the whole process can be modulated by changing the host&#8208;guest ratio. Combining the manipulatable process of mass transport with the unique decoding method, the stored information in film can be decrypted correctly. This work provides an unprecedented dynamic approach for advanced anticounterfeiting technology with a higher level of security and high&#8208;end applications in information encryption.

         <title>Blocking Interfacial Proton Transport via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We construct a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) for HER&#8208;free zinc anodes by anchoring ionic liquid (BMIM+) cations on Ti3C2Tx (MXene) substrate. The BMIM+ with a high coordination number of water molecules can significantly reduce the interfacial densities of H2O molecules. Therefore, the SAM can disrupt the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and hinder proton transport at the interface, suppressing HER.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, yet suffer from the issues of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and intricate side reactions on the Zn anode surface. The hydrogen (H)&#8208;bond networks play a critical role in interfacial proton transport that may closely relate to HER but are rarely investigated. Herein, we report a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy which is constructed by anchoring ionic liquid cations on Ti3C2Tx substrate for HER&#8208;free Zn anode. Molecule dynamics simulations reveal that the rationally designed SAM with a high coordination number of water molecules (25&#8211;27, 4&#8211;6 for Zn2+) largely reduces the interfacial densities of H2O molecules, therefore breaking the connectivity of H&#8208;bond networks and blocking proton transport on the interface, by which the HER is suppressed. Then, a series of in situ characterizations demonstrate that negligible amounts of H2 gas are collected from the Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene anode. Consequently, the symmetric cell enables a long&#8208;cycling life of 3000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the stable Zn@SAM&#8208;MXene films are successfully used for coin full cells showing high&#8208;capacity retention of over 94&#8201;% after 1000 cycles and large&#8208;area (10&#215;5&#8197;cm2) pouch cells with desired performance.

         <title>Single Crystal and Pentatwinned Gold Nanorods Result in Chiral Nanocrystals with Reverse Handedness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The handedness of chiral gold nanorods synthesized by seeded growth typically follows that of the organic chiral inducer, being right&#8208;handed when templated by S&#8208;BINAMINE micelles or induced by L&#8208;cystine (L&#8208;2cys). Our results demonstrate that a change in the achiral seed, from single crystalline to pentatwinned, can reverse the sign of circular dichroism (CD) measurements, adding a new effect to guide the chirality of gold nanoparticles.







Abstract
Handedness is an essential attribute of chiral nanocrystals, having a major influence on their properties. During chemical growth, the handedness of nanocrystals is usually tuned by selecting the corresponding enantiomer of chiral molecules involved in asymmetric growth, often known as chiral inducers. We report that, even using the same chiral inducer enantiomer, the handedness of chiral gold nanocrystals can be reversed by using Au nanorod seeds with either single crystalline or pentatwinned structure. This effect holds for chiral growth induced both by amino acids and by chiral micelles. Although it was challenging to discern the morphological handedness for L&#8208;cystine&#8208;directed particles, even using electron tomography, both cases showed circular dichroism bands of opposite sign, with nearly mirrored chiroptical signatures for chiral micelle&#8208;directed growth, along with quasi&#8208;helical wrinkles of inverted handedness. These results expand the chiral growth toolbox with an effect that might be exploited to yield a host of interesting morphologies with tunable optical properties.

         <title>Unprecedented POSS&#8208;Linked 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with 2&#8208;Fold Interpenetrated scu or sqc Topology Regulated by Porphyrin Center for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topology of unprecedented POSS&#8208;linked 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been revealed to show dependence on the central ions of porphyrin building block. Central metal ions of Co(II) and Zn(II) in porphyrin building block result in the formation of POSS&#8208;MTFPP&#8208;COFs with scu topology, while metal free and Ni central ions lead to POSS&#8208;MTFPP&#8208;COFs with symmetric sqc topology. The well&#8208;distributed porphyrin units in these COFs endow them with enhanced performance in both photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction and photocatalytic production of artemisinin.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of porphyrin center regulated three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated scu or sqc topology have been investigated. These COFs exhibit unique structural features and properties, making them promising candidates for photocatalytic applications in CO2 reduction and artemisinin synthesis. The porphyrin center serves as an anchor for metal ions, allowing precise control over structures and functions of the frameworks. Furthermore, the metal coordination within the framework imparts desirable catalytic properties, enabling their potential use in photocatalytic reactions. Overall, these porphyrin center regulated metal&#8208;controlled COFs offer exciting opportunities for the development of advanced materials with tailored functionalities.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymers for Efficient and Selective SO2 Capture from CO2&#8208;rich Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capture of a low concentration SO2 is of utmost importance as it is responsible for many health and environmental issues. Herein we unveiled two porous organic polymers encompassing a high content of imidazole pockets to interact preferentially with SO2 vs CO2 which can remove trace amount of SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing streams with almost infinite selectivity and high capacity.







Abstract
The quest for effective technologies to reduce SO2 pollution is crucial due to its adverse effects on the environment and human health. Markedly, removing a ppm level of SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing waste gas is a persistent challenge, and current technologies suffer from low SO2/CO2 selectivity and energy&#8208;intensive regeneration processes. Here using the molecular building blocks approach and theoretical calculation, we constructed two porous organic polymers (POPs) encompassing pocket&#8208;like structures with exposed imidazole groups, promoting preferential interactions with SO2 from CO2&#8208;containing streams. Markedly, the evaluated POPs offer outstanding SO2/CO2 selectivity, high SO2 capacity, and an easy regeneration process, making it one of the best materials for SO2 capture. To gain better structural insights into the notable SO2 selectivity of the POPs, we used dynamic nuclear polarization NMR spectroscopy (DNP) and molecular modelling to probe the interactions between SO2 and POP adsorbents. The newly developed materials are poised to offer an energy&#8208;efficient and environment&#8208;friendly SO2 separation process while we are obliged to use fossil fuels for our energy needs.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Unconventional Phase Alloy Nanobranches for Highly Selective Electrocatalytic Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot method has been developed to synthesize unconventional phase Ir&#8208;based alloy nanostrucrtures. Notably, hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) IrNi nanobranches demonstrate superior catalytic performance towards ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrite over the conventional phase counterpart. Mechanism studies reveal that Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to the highly selective formation of ammonia.







Abstract
The controlled synthesis of metal nanomaterials with unconventional phases is of significant importance to develop high&#8208;performance catalysts for various applications. However, it remains challenging to modulate the atomic arrangements of metal nanomaterials, especially the alloy nanostructures that involve different metals with distinct redox potentials. Here we report the general one&#8208;pot synthesis of IrNi, IrRhNi and IrFeNi alloy nanobranches with unconventional hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase. Notably, the as&#8208;synthesized hcp IrNi nanobranches demonstrate excellent catalytic performance towards electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR), with superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.2&#8201;% and 34.6&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 (75.5&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgIr&#8722;1) at 0 and &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. Ex/in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#8722;Ni interactions within hcp IrNi alloy improve electron transfer to benefit both nitrite activation and active hydrogen generation, leading to a stronger reaction trend of NO2RR by greatly reducing energy barriers of rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Self&#8208;Inclusion Complexation of Electron&#8208;Accepting Guest into Electron&#8208;Donating Cyclic Host by Photoexcitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene bearing a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety exhibited dual locally excited and exciplex emissions from out&#8208;state and in&#8208;state, respectively, in the excited state. The addition of guest molecules suppressed formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state, resulting in observation of the single locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state.







Abstract
Self&#8208;inclusion complexes consisting of host&#8208;guest conjugates are one of the unique supramolecular structures because they form in&#8208;state and out&#8208;state depending on the external stimuli. Despite many reports of the stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;inclusion complex formation, study of the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation has been unexplored. Herein, we report that an electron&#8208;donating host and an electron&#8208;accepting guest conjugate exhibits the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation. Formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state resulted in exciplex emission along with the locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state. Moreover, this structural relaxation by photoexcitation was suppressed not only by temperature, but also by the presence of guest molecules, resulting in changes in the ratio of the dual emission intensities.

         <title>Enantiopure [6]&#8208;Azairidahelicene by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of a Configurationally Labile [4]&#8208;Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes, combining chirality at the metal center and at the helicenic fragment, are readily accessible by an effective dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand. The two isolated enantiomers exhibit perfect mirrored electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) signals.







Abstract
A pair of enantiopure [6]&#8208;azairidahelicenes incorporating chirality at the metal center and on the helicenic ligand were synthesized by dynamic kinetic resolution (dkr) of a configurationally labile [4]&#8208;helicenic ligand (4&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;benzo[g]phenanthrene, L1H) using bis&#8208;cyclometalated chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal only iridium(III) precursors as chiral inductors. The origin of the observed dkr is attributed to the different conformation and stability of diastereomeric reaction intermediates formed during the cyclometalation process. The isolated enantiomers exhibited circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), with |gphos| values of 1.8&#215;10&#8722;3.

         <title>Expedient Access to 18F&#8208;Fluoroheteroarenes via Deaminative Radiofluorination of Aniline&#8208;Derived Pyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
18F&#8208;Fluoroheteroarenes find wide application as radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography) imaging. Here, we present a deaminative radiosynthetic approach via pyridinium tetrafluoroborates that facilitates radiofluorination of 33 structurally diverse heteroarenes in up to 98&#8201;% RCY (radiochemical yield). This method was also amenable to automation and was successfully translated to an automated synthesiser.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose that pyridinium salts derived from abundant (hetero)anilines represent a novel precursor class for nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions with [18F]fluoride. The value of this new 18F&#8208;fluorodeamination is demonstrated with the synthesis of over 30 structurally diverse and complex heteroaryl 18F&#8208;fluorides, several derived from scaffolds that were yet to be labelled with fluorine&#8208;18. The protocol tolerates heteroarenes and functionalities commonly found in drug discovery libraries, and is amenable to scale&#8208;up and automation on a commercial radiosynthesiser.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Secretoglobin 3A2 Covalent Homodimer and Photocaged Monomeric Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 is a small, secreted protein present only in mammals. Despite its unique self&#8208;assembly driven by disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization, current understanding of its physiology relies solely on in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures. SCGB3A2 chemical synthesis using KAHA ligation now enables access to monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues for studying its self&#8208;assembly behavior.







Abstract
Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 belongs to an intriguing family of small, secreted proteins present only in mammals. Although members of the SCGB protein family have distinct amino acid sequences, they share structural similarities. Of particularly interest is the not yet fully understood self&#8208;assembly ability of SCGBs, which arise from covalent disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization. Recently, SCGB3A2 has attracted attention for its singular expression profile in airways. However, the knowledge on SCGB3A2 (patho)physiology derives exclusively from in vivo and complex ex vivo mixtures, which hampers characterization of the mechanisms driving SCGB3A2 structural behavior. Herein, we document the chemical synthesis of SCGB3A2 in multi&#8208;milligram quantities. Key to access both monomeric and homodimeric SCGB3A2 analogues was the use of KAHA ligation and enabled masking of the cysteine residue. The synthetic proteins were used to investigate the SCGB3A2 self&#8208;assembly profile, confirming their high propensity to dimerization even in the absence of the key Cys residue.

         <title>Desulfurdioxidative N&#8208;N Coupling of N&#8208;Arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;Sulfinylanilines: Reaction Development and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes a novel and practical strategy for N&#8722;N bond construction. The strategy involves an unprecedented intermolecular cascade O&#8208;sulfination and desulfurdioxidative N&#8722;N coupling (via stepwise retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition, supported by quantum chemistry calculations) from readily available N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines under metal and oxidant free conditions.







Abstract
A highly efficient and chemoselective approach for the divergent assembling of unsymmetrical hydrazines through an unprecedented intermolecular desulfurdioxidative N&#8722;N coupling is developed. This metal free protocol employs readily accessible N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines to provide highly valuable hydrazine products with good reaction yields and excellent functional group tolerance under simple conditions. Computational studies suggest that the in situ generated O&#8208;sulfenylated arylhydroxylamine intermediate undergoes a retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition via a stepwise diradical mechanism to form the N&#8722;N bond and release SO2.

         <title>Cyclodextrin &#8216;Chaperones&#8217; Enable Quasi&#8208;Ideal Supramolecular Network Formation and Enhanced Photodimerization of Hydrophobic, Red&#8208;shifted Photoswitches in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrines serve as chaperones to solubilize and pre&#8208;order hydrophobic photoswitches with red&#8208;shifted activation wavelength in water, providing unique access to higher reactivity on a molecular scale and quasi&#8208;ideal hydrogel networks without phase segregation on the macroscale.







Abstract
Precision&#8208;engineered light&#8208;triggered hydrogels are important for a diversity of applications. However, fields such as biomaterials require wavelength outside the harsh UV regime to prevent photodamage, typically requiring chromophores with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation that suffer from poor water solubility. Herein, we demonstrate how cyclodextrins can be used as auxiliary agents to not only solubilize such chromophores, but even to preorganize them in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest inclusion complex to facilitate photodimerization. We apply our concept to styrylpyrene&#8208;end&#8208;functionalized star&#8208;shaped polyethylene glycols (sPEGs). We initially unravel details of the host&#8208;guest inclusion complex using spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to give clear evidence of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex formation. Subsequently, we show that the resultant supramolecularly linked hydrogels conform to theories of supramolecular quasi&#8208;ideal model networks, and derive details on their association dynamics using in&#8208;depth rheological measurements and kinetic models. By comparing sPEGs of different arm length, we further elucidate the model network topology and the accessible mechanical property space. The photo&#8208;mediated dimerization proceeds smoothly, allowing to transform the supramolecular model networks into covalent ones. We submit that our strategy opens avenues for executing hydrophobic photochemistry in aqueous environments with enhanced control over reactivity, hydrogel topology or programmable mechanical properties.

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Caged Rhodamine Generating Nitrosoperoxycarbonate for Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and visible light&#8208;triggered ONOOCO2&#8722; donor (NPCD565) was devised. Its photolysis generated a rhodamine dye along with two mild radicals, e.g., NO and CO2&#8901;&#8722;. Their further combination with O2 yields ONOOCO2&#8722;, homolysis of which yields two potent radicals NO2 and CO3&#8901;&#8722;, which were harnessed to induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells. In mouse models, ablation of the primary tumor and suppression of the distant tumor were achieved.







Abstract
Photoimmunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment modality. While potent 1&#8208;e&#8722; oxidative species are known to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), they are also associated with unspecific oxidation and collateral tissue damage. This difficulty may be addressed by post&#8208;generation radical reinforcement. Namely, non&#8208;oxidative radicals are first generated and subsequently activated into powerful oxidative radicals to induce ICD. Here, we developed a photo&#8208;triggered molecular donor (NPCD565) of nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO2&#8722;), the first of its class to our knowledge, and further evaluated its feasibility for immunotherapy. Upon irradiation of NPCD565 by light within a broad spectral region from ultraviolet to red, ONOOCO2&#8722; is released along with a bright rhodamine dye (RD565), whose fluorescence is a reliable and convenient build&#8208;in reporter for the localization, kinetics, and dose of ONOOCO2&#8722; generation. Upon photolysis of NPCD565 in 4T1 cells, damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) indicative of ICD were observed and confirmed to exhibit immunogenicity by induced maturation of dendritic cells. In vivo studies with a bilateral tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model showcased the potent tumor&#8208;killing capability of NPCD565 of the primary tumors and growth suppression of the distant tumors. This work unveils the potent immunogenicity of ONOOCO2&#8722;, and its donor (NPCD565) has broad potential for photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

Upon photolysis of &lt;b&gt;NPCD565&lt;/b&gt; in 4T1 cells, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) indicative of ICD were observed and confirmed to exhibit immunogenicity by induced maturation of dendritic cells. In vivo studies with a bilateral tumor-bearing mouse model showcased the potent tumor-killing capability of &lt;b&gt;NPCD565&lt;/b&gt; of the primary tumors and growth suppression of the distant tumors. This work unveils the potent immunogenicity of ONOOCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and its donor (&lt;b&gt;NPCD565&lt;/b&gt;) has broad potential for photo-immunotherapy of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery for hydrogen storage and production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed&#8208;loop process for H2 storage and production using Zn as an electron carrier to combine a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery to generate H2 and an alkaline electrolyzer to regenerate Zn. The Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using cheap renewable energy and produce H2 on demand more than 600&#8197;times.







Abstract
Reactive metals hydrolysis offers significant advantages for hydrogen storage and production. However, the regeneration of common reactive metals (e.g., Mg, Al, etc.) is energy&#8208;intensive and produces unwanted byproducts such as CO2 and Cl2. Herein, we employ Zn as a reactive mediator that can be easily regenerated by electrolysis of ZnO in an alkaline solution with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;99.9&#8201;%. H2 is produced in the same electrolyte by constructing a Zn&#8208;H2O hydrolysis battery consisting of a Zn anode and a Raney&#8208;Ni cathode to unlock the Zn&#8208;H2O reaction. The entire two&#8208;step water splitting reaction with a net energy efficiency of 70.4&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the Zn&#8208;H2O system can be charged using renewable energy to produce H2 on demand and runs for 600 cycles only sacrificing 3.76&#8201;% energy efficiency. DFT calculations reveal that the desorption of H* on Raney&#8208;Ni (&#8722;0.30&#8197;eV) is closer to zero compared with that on Zn (&#8722;0.87&#8197;eV), indicating a faster desorption of H* at low overpotential. Further, a 24&#8197;Ah electrolyzer is demonstrated to produce H2 with a net energy efficiency of 65.5&#8201;%, which holds promise for its real application.

         <title>Linker Mediated Electronic&#8208;State Manipulation of Conjugated Organic Polymers Enabling Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A viable linker engineering strategy is developed to construct a series of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers wrapped onto CNTs (CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) as pyrolysis&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By altering the electronic properties of organic linkers, the optimal CNTs@bTDA&#8208;CoPc&#8208;CPs confers outstanding performance for the ORR and zinc&#8208;air batteries, representing the high performance among reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts to date.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers with tailorable composition and microarchitecture are propitious for modulating catalytic properties and deciphering inherent structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, we report a facile linker engineering strategy to manipulate the electronic states of metallophthalocyanine conjugated polymers and uncover the vital role of organic linkers in facilitating electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, a set of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers (CoPc&#8208;CPs) wrapped onto carbon nanotubes (denoted CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) are judiciously crafted via in situ assembling square&#8208;planar cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine (CoPc(NH2)4) with different linear aromatic dialdehyde&#8208;based organic linkers in the presence of CNTs. Intriguingly, upon varying the electronic characteristic of organic linkers from terephthalaldehyde (TA) to 2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxaldehyde (TDA) and then to thieno/thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxaldehyde (bTDA), their corresponding CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs exhibit gradually improved electrocatalytic ORR performance. More importantly, theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer from CoPc units to electron&#8208;withdrawing linkers (i.e., TDA and bTDA) drives the delocalization of Co d&#8208;orbital electrons, thereby downshifting the Co d&#8208;band energy level. Accordingly, the active Co centers with more positive valence state exhibit optimized binding energy toward ORR&#8208;relevant intermediates and thus a balanced adsorption/desorption pathway that endows significant enhancement in electrocatalytic ORR. This work demonstrates a molecular&#8208;level engineering route for rationally designing efficient polymer catalysts and gaining insightful understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms.

         <title>Highly Efficient One&#8208;pot Electrosynthesis of Oxime Ethers from NOx over Ultrafine MgO Nanoparticles Derived from Mg&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tandem electrochemical system for converting exhaust NOx into oxime ether is proposed and presents great efficiency over a developed MgO derived from MOF anchoring in nanofiber membrane, which offers great significance of NOx valorization to synthesize organonitrogen drug molecules in a sustainable and mild way.







Abstract
Oxime ethers are attractive compounds in medicinal scaffolds due to the biological and pharmaceutical properties, however, the crucial and widespread step of industrial oxime formation using explosive hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is insecure and troublesome. Herein, we present a convenient method of oxime ether synthesis in a one&#8208;pot tandem electrochemical system using magnesium based metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived magnesium oxide anchoring in self&#8208;supporting carbon nanofiber membrane catalyst (MgO&#8208;SCM), the in situ produced NH2OH from nitrogen oxides electrocatalytic reduction coupled with aldehyde to produce 4&#8208;cyanobenzaldoxime with a selectivity of 93&#8201;% and Faraday efficiency up to 65.1&#8201;%, which further reacted with benzyl bromide to directly give oxime ether precipitate with a purity of 97&#8201;% by convenient filtering separation. The high efficiency was attributed to the ultrafine MgO nanoparticles in MgO&#8208;SCM, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerating the production of NH2OH, which rapidly attacked carbonyl of aldehydes to form oximes, but hardly crossed the hydrogenation barrier of forming amines, thus leading to a high yield of oxime ether when coupling benzyl bromide nucleophilic reaction. This work highlights the importance of kinetic control in complex electrosynthetic organonitrogen system and demonstrates a green and safe alternative method for synthesis of organic nitrogen drug molecules.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Cascade Dearomatization of Indoles via a Photoinduced Pd&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Bisfunctionalization of Butadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a cascade asymmetric dearomatization reaction of indoles via photoinduced Pd&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;biscarbonfunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadienes has been disclosed. This process delivers structurally novel chiral spiroindolenines bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers with high diastereomeric ratios (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er).







Abstract
Photoinduced Pd&#8208;catalyzed bisfunctionalization of butadienes with a readily available organic halide and a nucleophile represents an emerging and attractive method to assemble versatile alkenes bearing various functional groups at the allylic position. However, enantiocontrol and/or diastereocontrol in the C&#8722;C or C&#8722;X bond&#8208;formation step have not been solved due to the open&#8208;shell process. Herein, we present a cascade asymmetric dearomatization reaction of indoles via photoexcited Pd&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;biscarbonfunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;butadienes, wherein asymmetric control on both the nucleophile and electrophile part is achieved for the first time in photoinduced bisfunctionalization of butadienes. This method delivers structurally novel chiral spiroindolenines bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers with high diastereomeric ratios (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er). Experimental and computational studies of the mechanism have confirmed a radical pathway involving excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis. The alignment and non&#8208;covalent interactions between the substrate and the catalyst were found to be essential for stereocontrol.

         <title>Coral&#8208;Inspired Terahertz&#8208;Infrared Bi&#8208;Stealth Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative coral&#8208;structure inspired multi&#8208;scale composite foam has been successfully fabricated, pioneering the development of terahertz&#8208;infrared bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin. This bi&#8208;stealth system exhibits intelligent electromagnetic protection through autonomous perception, adapting to diverse operational environments and task demands with real&#8208;time responsiveness. Concurrently, it achieves infrared stealth with dynamic ambient temperatures.







Abstract
The development of electronic skin with dual stealth functionality is crucial for enabling devices to operate effectively in dynamic electromagnetic environments, thereby facilitating intelligent electromagnetic protection for autonomous perception. However, achieving compatibility between terahertz (THz) and infrared (IR) stealth technologies remains largely unexplored due to their inherent contradictions. Herein, inspired by natural corals, a novel coral&#8208;like multi&#8208;scale composite foam (CMSF) was proposed that ingeniously reconciles these contradictions. The design capitalizes on the conductive network and heat insulation properties of the foam skeleton, the loss effects and low infrared emission of metal particles, and the infrared transparency of magneto&#8208;optical materials. This approach leads to the realization of a THz&#8208;IR bi&#8208;stealth electronic skin concept. The CMSF exhibits a maximum reflection loss of 84.8&#8197;dB in the terahertz band, while its infrared stealth capability ensures environmental adaptability under varying temperatures. Furthermore, the electronic skin exhibits exceptional sensitivity and reliability as a wearable device for perceiving environmental changes. This advanced material, combining multispectral stealth with sensing capabilities, holds immense potential for applications ranging from camouflage technology to smart wearables.

         <title>An Integrative Chemical Recycling Approach for Catalytic Oxidation of Epoxy Resin and in situ Separation of Degraded Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new recycling strategy integrating catalytic oxidation of epoxy resin and in situ separation of degraded products is developed, where the interaction between iron catalyst and reaction solvent makes the degradation under mild condition, while the supramolecular interactions between degraded products and iron catalyst contribute to the separation of mixed degraded products, which provides new ideas for upcycling of mixed plastic wastes.







Abstract
Although many approaches have been proposed to recycling waste epoxy resin (EP), the separation of mixed degraded products remains a challenge due to their similar structures. To address this, we present a catalytic oxidation strategy that enables mild degradation of EP and in situ separation of degraded products through supramolecular interactions. The oxidative degradation relies on FeIV=O radicals with strong oxidizing properties, which are generated from the electron transfer of FeCl2 with reaction reagents. As the FeIV=O radicals attacked the C&#8722;N bonds of EP, EP was broken into fragments rich in active functional groups. Meanwhile, the FeIV=O radicals were reduced to iron ions that can coordinate with the carboxyl groups on the fragments. As a result, the degraded products with different carboxyl content can be effortlessly separated into liquid and solid phase by coordinating with the catalyst. The success of this work lays the foundation for high&#8208;value application of degraded products and provides new design ideas for recycling waste plastics with complex compositions.

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields via Molecular Symmetry Modulation in Supramolecular Photocatalysts for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the power of symmetry breaking, our supramolecular photocatalyst showcases outstanding hydrogen evolution rate and quantum yield. Our study not only positions SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ among the top performers in organic semiconductor photocatalysts but also demonstrates the method's effectiveness in boosting the efficiency of other catalysts, contributing to the advancement of solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion technologies.







Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are attractive photocatalysts, but their quantum yields are limited by poor charge separation and transportation. A promising strategy for efficient charge transfer is to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field by symmetry breaking. Herein, an unsymmetric protonation, N&#8208;heterocyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ was developed. The unsymmetric protonation breaks the initial structural symmetry of DADK, resulting in ca. 50&#8208;fold increase in the molecular dipole, and facilitates efficient charge separation and transfer within SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+. The protonation process also creates numerous active sites for H2O adsorption, and serves as crucial proton relays, significantly improving the photocatalytic efficiency. Remarkably, SA&#8208;DADK&#8208;H+ exhibits an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 278.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 25.1&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm, placing it among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances in organic semiconductor photocatalysts. Furthermore, the versatility of the unsymmetric protonation approach has been successfully applied to four other photocatalysts, enhancing their photocatalytic performance by 39 to 533&#8197;times. These findings highlight the considerable potential of unsymmetric protonation induced symmetry breaking strategy in tailoring supramolecular photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel production.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Formation of C&#8722;N or C=N Bond during Photocatalytic Reductive Coupling Reaction over CdS Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective synthesis of C=N and C&#8722;N bonds was facilely achieved by manipulating the solvents via hydrogen&#8208;bond mediated transfer hydrogenation process over CdS photocatalyst.







Abstract
Reductive amination of carbonyl compounds and nitro compounds represents a straightforward way to attain imines or secondary amines, but it is difficult to control the product selectivity. Herein, we report the selective formation of C&#8722;N or C=N bond readily manipulated through a solvent&#8208;induced hydrogen bond bridge, facilitating the swift photocatalytic reductive coupling process. The reductive&#8208;coupling of nitro compounds with carbonyl compounds using formic acid and sodium formate as the hydrogen donors over CdS nanosheets selectively generates imines with C=N bonds in acetonitrile solvent; while taking methanol as solvent, the C=N bonds are readily hydrogenated to the C&#8722;N bonds via hydrogen&#8208;bonding activation. Experimental and theoretical study reveals that the building of the hydrogen&#8208;bond bridge between the hydroxyl groups in methanol and the N atoms of the C=N motifs in imines facilitates the transfer of hydrogen atoms from CdS surface to the N atoms in imines upon illumination, resulting in the rapid hydrogenation of the C=N bonds to give rise to the secondary amines with C&#8722;N bonds. Our method provides a simple way to control product selectivity by altering the solvents in photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea over Single&#8208;Atom Alloy with Electronic Metal Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urea electrosynthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) is an alternative approach to traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. Herein, we report a CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) with electronic metal support interaction (EMSI), achieving a high urea yield rate of 813.6 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8211;0.94 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 45.2% at &#8211;0.74 V vs. RHE. In&#8208;situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that single&#8208;atom Cu sites modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Bimetallic sites synergistically accelerate C&#8208;N bond formation through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO to form *ONCO as key intermediates. More importantly, electronic metal support interaction between CuAu SAA and CeO2 carrier further modulates electron structure and interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability. This work constructs SAA electrocatalysts with EMSI effect to tailor C&#8208;N coupling at the atomic level, which can provide guidance for the development of C&#8208;N coupling systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Giant Third&#8208;Order Optical Nonlinearity in (MA)2CuX4 through Introducing Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear absorption coefficient and modulation depth stand as pivotal properties of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, while the existing NLO materials exhibit limitations such as low nonlinear absorption coefficients and/or small modulation depths, thereby severely impeding their practical application. Here we unveil that introducing Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion in a Mott&#8208;Hubbard system, (MA)2CuX4 (MA = methylammonium; X = Cl, Br) affords the simultaneous attainment of a giant nonlinear absorption coefficient and substantial modulation depth. The optimized compound, (MA)2CuCl4, demonstrates a nonlinear absorption coefficient of (1.5 &#177; 0.08) &#215; 105 cm GW&#8722;1, a modulation depth of 60%, and a relatively low optical limiting threshold of 1.22 &#215; 10&#8722;5 J cm&#8722;2. These outstanding attributes surpass those of most reported NLO materials. Our investigation reveals that a more pronounced distortion of the [CuX6]4&#8722; octahedron emerges as a crucial factor in augmenting optical nonlinearity. Mechanism study involving structural and spectral characterization along with theoretical calculations indicates a correlation between the compelling performance and the Mott&#8208;Hubbard band structure of the materials, coupled with the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion&#8208;induced d&#8208;d transition. This study not only introduces a promising category of high&#8208;performance NLO materials but also provides novel insights into enhancing the performance of such materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have proven&#160;to be&#160;transformative in the treatment of viral infections and cancer. One branch of structural modification to deliver new nucleoside analogue classes explores replacement of canonical ribose oxygen with a sulfur atom. Whilst biological activity of such analogues has been shown in some cases, widespread exploration of this&#160;compound class&#160;is hitherto hampered by the lack of a straightforward and universal nucleobase diversification strategy. Herein, we present a synergistic platform enabling both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4'&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process, and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This methodology delivers entry across pyrimidine and purine 4'&#8208;thionucleosides, paving a way for wider synthetic and biological exploration.

         <title>Accessing Z&#8208;Enynes via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8208;selective propargylic dehydrogenation is described. Alkynes and allenes are transformed to 1,3&#8208;enynes with moderate Z&#8208;selectivity. Deprotonation is identified as rate&#8208;limiting, and the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect.







Abstract
Alkenes constitute an enabling motif in organic synthesis, as they can be functionalized to form highly substituted molecules. Z&#8208;alkenes are generally challenging to access due to the thermodynamic preference for the formation of E&#8208;alkenes compared to Z&#8208;alkenes. Dehydrogenation methodologies to selectively form Z&#8208;alkenes have not yet been reported. Herein, we report a Z&#8208;selective, propargylic dehydrogenation that provides 1,3&#8208;enynes through the invention of a Co&#8208;catalyzed oxidation system. Observation of a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) revealed that deprotonation of the propargylic position is the rate limiting step. Additionally, isomerization experiments were conducted and confirmed that the observed Z&#8208;selectivity is a kinetic effect. A proposed stereomechanistic model for the Z&#8208;selectivity is included.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Consuming a substantial quantum of energy (~165 TW h), the chlor&#8208;alkali industry garners considerable scholarly and industrial interest, with the anode reaction involving the oxidation of chloride ions being a paramount determinant of reaction rates. While the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) displays commendable catalytic activity and longevity, they rely on precious metals and exhibit a non&#8208;negligible side reaction in sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) production, underscoring the appeal of metal&#8208;free alternatives. However, the molecules and systems currently available are characterized by intricate complexity and are not amenable to large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we have successfully developed an economical and highly efficient molecular catalyst, demonstrating superior performance compared with the former organic molecules in the chloride ion oxidation process (COP) for the production of both chlorine gas (Cl2) and NaClO. The molecule of 2N only needs 92 mV to reach a current density of 1000mA cm&#8208;2, with a small cost of only 0.002 $ g&#8208;1. Furthermore, we propose a novel mechanism underpinned by non&#8208;covalent interactions, serving as the foundation for an innovative approach to the design of efficient anodes for the COP.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Evolution of an Enzyme for the Asymmetric Michael Addition of Cyclic Ketones to Nitroolefins by Enamine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Consistent introduction of novel enzymes is required for developing efficient biocatalysts for challenging biotransformations. Absorbing catalytic modes from organocatalysis may be fruitful for designing new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes with novel functions. Herein we report a newly designed artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue that catalyzes the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins through enamine activation with high efficiency. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro cyclic ketones with two stereocenters were efficiently prepared with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 97% e.e., &gt;20:1 d.r.) and good yield (up to 86%). This work provides an efficient biocatalytic strategy for cyclic ketone functionalization and highlights the usefulness of artificial enzymes for extending biocatalysis to further non&#8208;natural reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Bond Crosslinking Strategy Enabling Resilient and Recyclable Electrolyte Elastomers for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastomeric solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are highly promising to address the solid&#8208;solid&#8208;interface issues of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but compromises have to be made to balance the intrinsic trade&#8208;offs among their conductive, resilient and recyclable properties. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;bond crosslinking strategy for SPEs to realize simultaneously high ionic conductivity, elastic resilience and recyclability. An elastomeric SPE is therefore designed with hemiaminal dynamic covalent networks and Li+&#8208;dissociation co&#8208;polymer chains, where the &#8208;C&#8208;N&#8208; bond maintains the load&#8208;bearing covalent network under stress but is chemically reversible through a non&#8208;spontaneous reaction, the weaker intramolecular hydrogen bond is mechanically reversible to dissipate elastic energy, and the soft chains endow the rapid ion conduction. With this delicate structure, the optimized SPE elastomer achieves high elastic resilience without loading&#8208;unloading hysteresis, outstanding ionic conductivity of 0.2 mS cm&#8208;1 (25 &#176;C) and chemical recyclability. Then, exceptional room&#8208;temperature performances are obtained for repeated Li plating/stripping tests, and stable cycling of LMBs with either LiFePO4 or 4.3 V&#8208;class LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4 cathode. Furthermore, the recycled SPE can be circularly reused in LMBs without significant performance degradation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Elastomeric solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are highly promising to address the solid-solid-interface issues of solid-state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but compromises have to be made to balance the intrinsic trade-offs among their conductive, resilient and recyclable properties. Here, we propose a dual-bond crosslinking strategy for SPEs to realize simultaneously high ionic conductivity, elastic resilience and recyclability. An elastomeric SPE is therefore designed with hemiaminal dynamic covalent networks and Li+-dissociation co-polymer chains, where the -C-N- bond maintains the load-bearing covalent network under stress but is chemically reversible through a non-spontaneous reaction, the weaker intramolecular hydrogen bond is mechanically reversible to dissipate elastic energy, and the soft chains endow the rapid ion conduction. With this delicate structure, the optimized SPE elastomer achieves high elastic resilience without loading-unloading hysteresis, outstanding ionic conductivity of 0.2 mS cm-1 (25 &#176;C) and chemical recyclability. Then, exceptional room-temperature performances are obtained for repeated Li plating/stripping tests, and stable cycling of LMBs with either LiFePO4 or 4.3 V-class LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4 cathode. Furthermore, the recycled SPE can be circularly reused in LMBs without significant performance degradation. Our findings provide an inspiring design principle for SPEs to address the solid-solid-interface and sustainability challenges of solid-state LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Properties of Trioxa[9]circulene and Diepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trioxa[9]circulene and dimethoxydiepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene were synthesized through intramolecular oxidative coupling of dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene, resulting in the formation of a nine&#8208;membered ring. Dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene and dimethoxydiepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene exhibit absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors on the order of 10&#8722;2, and trioxa[9]circulene exhibits remarkable &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in the crystals.







Abstract
This article presents trioxa[9]circulene (3) as a novel member of hetero[n]circulenes. Its synthesis began with the synthesis of dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene (5) and used dimethoxydiepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene (4) as a key intermediate, despite the condensation reaction predominantly yielding a 1,4&#8208;addition byproduct. The structures and properties of 3&#8211;5 were extensively investigated using experimental and computational methods. Analysis of the crystal structures reveal elongation of the internal C&#8722;C bonds in the nine&#8208;membered ring of 3 compared to 4 and 5. Computational studies demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of trioxa[9]circulene's saddle&#8208;shaped polycyclic framework, while the other two compounds are rigid with large racemization barriers. Optically pure forms of 4 and 5 exhibit absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors on the order of 10&#8722;2, with smaller values observed for compound 4. In the crystal structures, molecules of 3 stack to form columns with remarkable &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap, and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions of 4 exhibit short intermolecular C&#8208;to&#8208;C contacts. Consequently, the solution&#8208;processed film of 4 functioned as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor in field effect transistors.

         <title>Interphase Engineering via Solvent Molecule Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated ethers are synthesized with weak&#8208;solvation ability owing to the duple steric effect derived from the designed longer carbon chain and methine group. The electrolyte solvation structure rich in AGGs (97.96&#8201;%) renders modified interphase and remarkable CE of 99.71&#8201;% as well as high CE of 98.56&#8201;% even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. It also renders stable performance of pouch Li&#8208;S battery.







Abstract
Lithium metal battery has been regarded as promising next&#8208;generation battery system aiming for higher energy density. However, the lithium metal anode suffers severe side&#8208;reaction and dendrite issues. Its electrochemical performance is significantly dependant on the electrolyte components and solvation structure. Herein, a series of fluorinated ethers are synthesized with weak&#8208;solvation ability owing to the duple steric effect derived from the designed longer carbon chain and methine group. The electrolyte solvation structure rich in AGGs (97.96&#8201;%) enables remarkable CE of 99.71&#8201;% (25&#8201;&#176;C) as well as high CE of 98.56&#8201;% even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery exhibits excellent performance in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 50&#8201;&#176;C) ascribed to the modified interphase rich in LiF/LiO2. Furthermore, the pouch cell delivers superior energy density of 344.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and maintains 80&#8201;% capacity retention after 50&#8197;cycles. The novel solvent design via molecule chemistry provides alternative strategy to adjust solvation structure and thus favors high&#8208;energy density lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Selective Carbosilylation: Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Multicomponent Reaction of Solid Me3SiZnI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a unique approach for the selective synthesis of stereodefined trisubstituted vinylsilanes via the anti&#8208;selective addition of a novel solid Me3SiZnI to terminal alkynes. An equilibrium exists between the intermediate syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;adducts, where the anti&#8208;selectivity is determined by the larger barrier at the single electron reduction of alkyl halides and the thermodynamic stability of the Ni(III) adduct.







Abstract
The stereodefined and highly substituted vinylsilanes are essential building blocks for constructing complex organic molecules. Transition metal&#8208;mediated silylmetalation of alkynes was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional hydrosilylations; however, a very limited study was carried out to utilize transient vinylmetal species in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Moreover, they produce syn&#8208;adduct, and the anti&#8208;selective cross&#8208;coupling is still unknown and highly desired. Silylzinc reagents are highly functional group tolerant, however, their synthesis from pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts hampers cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Our novel solid silylzinc reagents circumvent these constraints are employed in the anti&#8208;selective synthesis of vinylsilanes via a multi&#8208;component reaction involving Me3SiZnI, terminal alkynes, and activated alkyl halides. An intensive computational and experimental investigation of the mechanism reveals an equilibrium between the intermediate syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;adducts; the greater barrier at the single electron reduction of alkyl halides and the thermodynamic stability of the Ni(III) adduct determine the anti&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions Boost *OOH Intermediate Generation in Cu/In2Se3 for Electrochemical H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong electronic metal&#8211;support interactions between Cu and In2Se3 cause the charge rearrangement, which is conducive to *OOH intermediate generation. The introduction of Cu not only reduces the energy of the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction intermediate but also inhibits the 4&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction, which facilitates the efficient production of H2O2.







Abstract
Two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a promising method for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, high energy barriers for the generation of key *OOH intermediates hinder the process of 2e&#8722; ORR. Herein, we prepared a copper&#8208;supported indium selenide catalyst (Cu/In2Se3) to enhance the selectivity and yield of 2e&#8722; ORR by employing an electronic metal&#8211;support interactions (EMSIs) strategy. EMSIs&#8208;induced charge rearrangement between metallic Cu and In2Se3 is conducive to *OOH intermediate generation, promoting H2O2 production. Theoretical investigations reveal that the inclusion of Cu significantly lowers the energy barrier of the 2e&#8722; ORR intermediate and impedes the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway, thus favoring the formation of H2O2. The concentration of H2O2 produced by Cu/In2Se3 is ~2&#8197;times than In2Se3, and Cu/In2Se3 shows promising applications in antibiotic degradation. This research presents a valuable approach for the future utilization of EMSIs in 2e&#8722; ORR.

Herein, we prepared a copper-supported indium selenide catalyst (Cu/In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to enhance the selectivity and yield of 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR by employing an electronic metal&#8211;support interactions (EMSIs) strategy. EMSIs-induced charge rearrangement between metallic Cu and In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is conducive to *OOH intermediate generation, promoting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Theoretical investigations reveal that the inclusion of Cu significantly lowers the energy barrier of the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR intermediate and impedes the 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR pathway, thus favoring the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by Cu/In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is ~2&#8197;times than In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Cu/In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows promising applications in antibiotic degradation. This research presents a valuable approach for the future utilization of EMSIs in 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photodynamic and Photochemotherapeutic Platinum&#8208;Iridium Charge&#8208;Transfer Conjugate for Anticancer Therapy</title>

Charge transfer between donor Ir(III) and acceptor Pt(IV) introduces synergistic activity for these photodynamic and phototherapeutic centres, 1O2 and radical generation, higher Pt accumulation, and damages cell nuclei and releases chromosomes. X&#8208;ray fluorescence revealed a broad distribution in cells, with Ir localised in small compartments, some as a cleaved fragment.







Abstract
The novel hetero&#8208;dinuclear complex trans,trans,trans&#8208;[PtIV(py)2(N3)2(OH)(&#956;&#8208;OOCCH2CH2CONHCH2&#8208;bpyMe)IrIII(ppy)2]Cl (Pt&#8208;Ir), exhibits charge transfer between the acceptor photochemotherapeutic Pt(IV) (Pt&#8208;OH) and donor photodynamic Ir(III) (Ir&#8208;NH2) fragments. It is stable in the dark, but undergoes photodecomposition more rapidly than the Pt(IV) parent complex (Pt&#8208;OH) to generate Pt(II) species, an azidyl radical and 1O2. The Ir(III)* excited state, formed after irradiation, can oxidise NADH to NAD&#8901; radicals and NAD+. Pt&#8208;Ir is highly photocytotoxic towards cancer cells with a high photocytotoxicity index upon irradiation with blue light (465&#8197;nm, 4.8&#8197;mW/cm2), even with short light&#8208;exposure times (10&#8211;60&#8197;min). In contrast, the mononuclear Pt&#8208;OH and Ir&#8208;NH2 subunits and their simple mixture are much less potent. Cellular Pt accumulation was higher for Pt&#8208;Ir compared to Pt&#8208;OH. Irradiation of Pt&#8208;Ir in cancer cells damages nuclei and releases chromosomes. Synchrotron&#8208;XRF revealed ca. 4&#215; higher levels of intracellular platinum compared to iridium in Pt&#8208;Ir treated cells under dark conditions. Luminescent Pt&#8208;Ir distributes over the whole cell and generates ROS and 1O2 within 1&#8197;h of irradiation. Iridium localises strongly in small compartments, suggestive of complex cleavage and excretion via recycling vesicles (e.g. lysosomes). The combination of PDT and PACT motifs in one molecule, provides Pt&#8208;Ir with a novel strategy for multimodal phototherapy.

         <title>Activable Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator Assembled from &#960;&#8208;Extended Naphthalenediimide for Precision Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>

A nano&#8208;immunomodulator consisting of glutathione activable resiquimod and &#960;&#8208;extended NIR&#8208;absorbing system is engineered for spatiotemporally controlled photothermal immunotherapy. The synergistic immunity and photothermal effect lead to complete tumor ablation against both primary and distal tumors, presenting a generic strategy for engineering nano&#8208;immunomodulator to achieve a precise regulation of photothermal immunotherapy.







Abstract
A nano&#8208;immunomodulator (R&#8208;NPT NP) comprising a tumor microenvironment (TME) activable resiquimod (R848) and a &#960;&#8208;extended NIR&#8208;absorbing naphthophenanthrolinetetraone (NPT) has been engineered for spatiotemporal controlled photothermal immunotherapy. R&#8208;NPT NP demonstrated excellent photostability, while R848 promoted synergistic immunity as a toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, R&#8208;NPT NP released R848 in response to redox metabolite glutathione (GSH), triggering dendritic cell (DC) activation. The photothermal effect endowed by R&#8208;NPT NP can ablate tumors directly and trigger immunogenic cell death to augment immunity after photoirradiation. The synergistic effect of GSH&#8208;liable TLR7/8 agonist and released immunogenic factors leads to a robust evocation of systematic immunity through promoted DC maturation and T cell infiltration. Thus, R&#8208;NPT NP with photoirradiation achieved 99.3&#8201;% and 98.2&#8201;% growth inhibition against primary and distal tumors, respectively.

         <title>Direct Observation of Polaritonic Chemistry by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Fabry&#8208;Perot optical cavities were developed that enable studying Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the London dispersion&#8208;driven conformational equilibrium of a molecular balance is altered when the C&#8722;H stretching vibration is strongly coupled to the cavity. Unexpectedly, VSC does not substantially affect molecular electron density distributions which has profound implications for the possible mechanisms at play in polaritonic chemistry.







Abstract
Polaritonic chemistry is emerging as a powerful approach to modifying the properties and reactivity of molecules and materials. However, probing how the electronics and dynamics of molecular systems change under strong coupling has been challenging due to the narrow range of spectroscopic techniques that can be applied in situ. Here we develop microfluidic optical cavities for vibrational strong coupling (VSC) that are compatible with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using standard liquid NMR tubes. VSC is shown to influence the equilibrium between two conformations of a molecular balance sensitive to London dispersion forces, revealing an apparent change in the equilibrium constant under VSC. In all compounds studied, VSC does not induce detectable changes in chemical shifts, J&#8208;couplings, or spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times. This unexpected finding indicates that VSC does not substantially affect molecular electron density distributions, and in turn has profound implications for the possible mechanisms at play in polaritonic chemistry under VSC and suggests that the emergence of collective behavior is critical.

         <title>Universal crRNA Acylation Strategy for Robust Photo&#8208;Initiated One&#8208;Pot CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a Nucleic Acid Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and accessible acylation strategy for fabricating cloaked crRNA to realize photo&#8208;initiated one&#8208;pot CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a assays regardless of the crRNA sequences has been developed. This innovative acylation strategy can bring great advantages and convenience in photo&#8208;controlled CRISPR technologies, highlighting their potential in genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal regulation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is attractive for precise gene editing and accurate molecular diagnosis. Although many efforts have been made, versatile and efficient strategies to control CRISPR system are still desirable. Here, we proposed a universal and accessible acylation strategy to regulate the CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system by efficient acylation of 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyls (2&#8242;&#8208;OH) on crRNA strand with photolabile agents (PLGs). The introduction of PLGs confers efficient suppression of crRNA function and rapid restoration of CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a reaction upon short light exposure regardless of crRNA sequences. Based on this strategy, we constructed a universal PhotO&#8208;Initiated CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system for Robust One&#8208;pot Testing (POIROT) platform integrated with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), which showed two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional one&#8208;step assay and comparable to the two&#8208;step assay. For clinical sample testing, POIROT achieved high&#8208;efficiency detection performance comparable to the gold&#8208;standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) in sensitivity and specificity, but faster than the qPCR method. Overall, we believe the proposed strategy will promote the development of many other universal photo&#8208;controlled CRISPR technologies for one&#8208;pot assay, and even expand applications in the fields of controllable CRISPR&#8208;based genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.

&lt;p&gt;A universal and accessible acylation strategy for fabricating cloaked crRNA to realize photo-initiated one-pot CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a assays regardless of the crRNA sequences has been developed. This innovative acylation strategy can bring great advantages and convenience in photo-controlled CRISPR technologies, highlighting their potential in genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spatiotemporal regulation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is attractive for precise gene editing and accurate molecular diagnosis. Although many efforts have been made, versatile and efficient strategies to control CRISPR system are still desirable. Here, we proposed a universal and accessible acylation strategy to regulate the CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system by efficient acylation of 2&#8242;-hydroxyls (2&#8242;-OH) on crRNA strand with photolabile agents (PLGs). The introduction of PLGs confers efficient suppression of crRNA function and rapid restoration of CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a reaction upon short light exposure regardless of crRNA sequences. Based on this strategy, we constructed a universal PhotO-Initiated CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system for Robust One-pot Testing (POIROT) platform integrated with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), which showed two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional one-step assay and comparable to the two-step assay. For clinical sample testing, POIROT achieved high-efficiency detection performance comparable to the gold-standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) in sensitivity and specificity, but faster than the qPCR method. Overall, we believe the proposed strategy will promote the development of many other universal photo-controlled CRISPR technologies for one-pot assay, and even expand applications in the fields of controllable CRISPR-based genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steering sp&#8208;Carbon Content in Graphdiynes for Enhanced Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>

The electrocatalytic 2eORR activity of the graphdiyne catalyst toward H2O2 production is successfully adjusted by steering the sp&#8208;carbon content in graphdiyne from 20&#8197;at&#8201;% to 50&#8197;at&#8201;%.







Abstract
Compared to sp2&#8208;hybridized graphene, graphdiynes (GDYs) composed of sp and sp2 carbon are highly promising as efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction into oxygen peroxide because of the high catalytic reactivity of the electron&#8208;rich sp&#8208;carbon atoms. The desired catalytic capacity of GDY, such as catalytic selectivity and efficiency, can theoretically be achieved by strategically steering the sp&#8208;carbon contents or the topological arrangement of the acetylenic linkages and aromatic bonds. Herein, we successfully tuned the electrocatalytic activity of GDYs by regulating the sp&#8208;to&#8208;sp2 carbon ratios with different organic monomer precursors. As the active sp&#8208;carbon atoms possess electron&#8208;sufficient &#960; orbitals, they can donate electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbitals of O2 molecules and initiate subsequent O2 reduction, GDY with the high sp&#8208;carbon content of 50&#8197;at&#8201;% exhibits excellent capability of catalyzing O2 reduction into H2O2. It demonstrates exceptional H2O2 selectivity of over 95.0&#8201;% and impressive performance in practical H2O2 production, Faraday efficiency (FE) exceeding 99.0&#8201;%, and a yield of 83.3&#8197;nmol&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our work holds significant importance in effectively steering the inherent properties of GDYs by purposefully adjusting the sp&#8208;to&#8208;sp2 carbon ratio and highlights their immense potential for research and applications in catalysis and other fields.

         <title>Multipolar Conjugated Polymer Framework Derived Ionic Sieves via Electronic Modulation for Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyano and fluorine dual&#8208;polar&#8208;group decorated multipolar polymer framework namely CNF&#8208;COF has been explored as an efficient and stable ionic sieve via electronic modulation to composite with solid polymer electrolytes for long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) Li batteries at high rate. The CNF&#8208;COF incorporation not only affords rapid selective Li ion conduction, but also enables the LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation for stable Li anodes. Thus, the newly&#8208;developed composite electrolytes with an ultralow CNF&#8208;COF content of 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% endow an ASS Li metal battery with excellent cycling stability over 2000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C and over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C.







Abstract
Here, we build a tunable multipolar conjugated polymer framework platform via pore wall chemistry to probe the role of electronic structure engineering in improving the Li+ conduction by theoretical studies. Guided by theoretical prediction, we develop a new cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked multipolar polymer framework namely CNF&#8208;COF, which can act as efficient ion sieves to modify solid polymer electrolytes to simultaneously tune Li+ migration and stable Li anodes for long&#8208;lifespan all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) Li metal batteries at high rate. The dual&#8208;decoration of cyano and fluorine groups in CNF&#8208;COF favorably regulates electronic structure via multipolar donor&#8208;acceptor electronic effects to afford proper energy band structure and abundant electron&#8208;rich sites for enhanced oxidative stability, facilitated ion&#8208;pair dissociation and suppressed anion movements. Thus, the CNF&#8208;COF incorporation into poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolytes not only renders fast selective Li+ transport but also facilitates the Li dendrite suppression. Specifically, the constructed PEO composite electrolyte with an ultra&#8208;low CNF&#8208;COF content of only 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% is endowed with a wide electrochemical window, a high ionic conductivity of 0.634&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and a large Li+ transference number of 0.81&#8212;remarkably outperforming CNF&#8208;COF&#8208;free counterparts (0.183&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 0.22). As such, the Li symmetric cell delivers stable Li plating/stripping over 1400&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Impressively, by coupling with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes, the assembled ASS Li battery under 60&#8201;&#176;C allows for stable cycling over 2000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C and over 1000&#8197;cycles even at 2&#8197;C with a large capacity retention of ~75&#8201;%, surpassing most reported ASS Li batteries using PEO&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Elucidation of Palmarumycin Spirobisnaphthalene Biosynthesis Reveals a Set of Previously Unrecognized Oxidases and Reductases</title>

         <dc:description>
Palmarumycins are a major type of fungal spirobisnaphthalenes that are biosynthesized by two distantly located biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) jointly. PalA, an unusual, multifunctional P450, catalyzes the dimerization of DHNs to form the unique spiroketal and 2,3&#8208;epoxy groups. PalB installs the 5&#8208;hydoxy group, while PalC functions as a 1&#8208;reductase/dehydrogenase and epoxide reductase. PalD catalyzes the 1&#8208;dehydrogenation to form 1&#8208;keto products.







Abstract
Spirobisnaphthalenes (SBNs) are a class of highly oxygenated, fungal bisnaphthalenes containing a unique spiroketal bridge, that displayed diverse bioactivities. Among the reported SBNs, palmarumycins are the major type, which are precursors for the other type of SBNs structurally. However, the biosynthesis of SBNs is unclear. In this study, we elucidated the biosynthesis of palmarumycins, using gene disruption, heterologous expression, and substrate feeding experiments. The biosynthetic gene cluster for palmarumycins was identified to be distant from the polyketide synthase gene cluster, and included two cytochrome P450s (PalA and PalB), and one short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (PalC) encoding genes as key structural genes. PalA is an unusual, multifunctional P450 that catalyzes the oxidative dimerization of 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene to generate the spiroketal linkage and 2,3&#8208;epoxy group. Chemical synthesis of key intermediate and in vitro biochemical assays proved that the oxidative dimerization proceeded via a binaphthyl ether. PalB installs the C&#8208;5 hydroxy group, widely found in SBNs. PalC catalyzes 1&#8208;keto reduction, the reverse 1&#8208;dehydrogenation, and 2,3&#8208;epoxide reduction. Moreover, an FAD&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase, encoded by palD, which locates outside the cluster, functions as a 1&#8208;dehydrogenase. These results provided the first genetic and biochemical evidence for the biosynthesis of palmarumycin SBNs.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Interlayer Spacings as Perfectly Selective Artificial Proton Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired artificial proton channels that can sieving protons out of ions or water molecules with perfectly selectivity are constructed. The channels use the interlayer spacings of covalent organic framework materials consisting of hydrophilic functional groups to sterically reject all atoms or molecules, while providing hydrogen bonding network for proton hopping.







Abstract
Biological proton channels have perfect selectivity in aqueous environment against almost all ions and molecules, a property that differs itself from other biological channels and a feature that remains challenging to realize for bulk artificial materials. The biological perfect selectivity originates from the fact that the channel has almost no free space for ion or water transport but generates a hydrogen bonded wire in the presence of protons to allow the proton hopping. Inspired by this, we used the interlayer spacings of covalent organic framework materials consisting of hydrophilic functional groups as perfectly selective artificial proton channels. The interlayer spacings are so narrow that no atoms or molecules can diffuse through. However, protons exhibit a diffusivity in the same order of magnitude as that in bulk water. Density functional theory calculations show that water molecules and the COF material form hydrogen bonded wires, allowing the proton hopping. We further demonstrate that the proton transport rate can be tuned by adjusting the acidity of the functional groups.

         <title>Expanding the Hydrophobic Cavity Surface of Azocalix[4]arene to Enable Biotin/Avidin Affinity with Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalix[4]arene (Naph&#8208;SAC4A) has been developed that can achieve a biotin/(strept&#8722;)avidin&#8208;level binding affinity (up to 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1 ) through its expanded hydrophobic surface. Naph&#8208;SAC4A demonstrated the sensitive recognition of rocuronium in serum and a hypoxia&#8208;responsive delivery of doxorubicin with minimum leakage at the cellular level.







Abstract
The development of artificial receptors that combine ultrahigh&#8208;affinity binding and controllable release for active guests holds significant importance in biomedical applications. On one hand, a complex with an exceedingly high binding affinity can resist unwanted dissociation induced by dilution effect and complex interferents within physiological environments. On the other hand, stimulus&#8208;responsive release of the guest is essential for precisely activating its function. In this context, we expanded hydrophobic cavity surface of a hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalix[4]arene, affording Naph&#8208;SAC4A. This modification significantly enhanced its aqueous binding affinity to 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1, akin to the naturally occurring strongest recognition pair, biotin/(strept&#8722;)avidin. Consequently, Naph&#8208;SAC4A emerges as the first artificial receptor to simultaneously integrate ultrahigh recognition affinity and actively controllable release. The markedly enhanced affinity not only improved Naph&#8208;SAC4A&#8242;s sensitivity in detecting rocuronium bromide in serum, but also refined the precision of hypoxia&#8208;responsive doxorubicin delivery at the cellular level, demonstrating its immense potential for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Tandem Catalysts Enabling Efficient C&#8722;N Coupling toward the Electrosynthesis of Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem catalyst of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) exhibited excellent activity in the electrosynthesis of urea, in which the two types of active sites independently stabilized the key intermediates of *CONH2 in urea formation via tandem catalysis.







Abstract
The development of a methodology for synthesizing value&#8208;added urea (CO(NH2)2) via a renewable electricity&#8208;driven C&#8722;N coupling reaction under mild conditions is highly anticipated. However, the complex catalytic active sites that act on the carbon and nitrogen species make the reaction mechanism unclear, resulting in a low efficiency of C&#8722;N coupling from the co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;). Herein, we propose a novel tandem catalyst of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co), in which the Mo sites serve to facilitate nitrate reduction to the *NH2 intermediate, while the Co sites enhance CO2 reduction to carbonic oxide (CO), thus synergistically promoting C&#8722;N coupling. The synthesized Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) catalyst exhibited a noteworthy urea yield rate of 844.11&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, alongside a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 33.90&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By combining in situ spectroscopic techniques with density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that efficient C&#8722;N coupling is attributed to a tandem system in which the *NH2 and *CO intermediates produced by the Mo and Co active sites of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) stabilize the formation of the *CONH2 intermediate. This study provides an effective avenue for the design and synthesis of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic urea synthesis.

         <title>Strong Interactions between Au Nanoparticles and BiVO4 Photoanode Boosts Hole Extraction for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions between Au nanoparticles and BiVO4 supports are achieved under reductive treatment for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The electron&#8208;rich Au&#948;&#8722; could extract photogenerated holes and accelerate the charge separation. The encapsulation of VOx on Au surface enhances the *OH adsorption and the *OOH generation to promote the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is widely proposed as a key factor in tuning catalytic performances. Herein, the classical SMSI between Au nanoparticles (NPs) and BiVO4 (BVO) supports (Au/BVO&#8208;SMSI) is discovered and used innovatively for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Owing to the SMSI, the electrons transfer from V4+ to Au NPs, leading to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Au species (Au&#948;&#8722;) and strong electronic interaction (i.e., Au&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Ov&#8208;V4+), which readily contributes to extract photogenerated holes and promote charge separation. Benefitted from the SMSI effect, the as&#8208;prepared Au/BVO&#8208;SMSI photoanode exhibits a superior photocurrent density of 6.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode after the deposition of FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalysts. This work provides a pioneering view for extending SMSI effect to bimetal oxide supports for PEC water splitting, and guides the interfacial electronic and geometric structure modulation of photoanodes consisting of metal NPs and reducible oxides for improved solar energy conversion efficiency.

A kind of redox molecular junction sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework with multiple active sites have been prepared and can be successfully applied for light&#8208;assisted CO2 energy storage.







Abstract

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig Cyclization of Triene&#8208;Yne Systems: New Access towards Azulenothiophenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Through a 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of novel triene&#8208;yne systems, interesting azuleno[b]thiophenes and azuleno[c]thiophenes were synthesized and characterized. UV/Vis spectra, CVs and DFT calculations were performed.







Abstract
We report the direct synthesis of new azulene derivatives through gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reactions. A five&#8208;membered ring as backbone in the applied triene&#8208;yne substrates turned out to be crucial to induce the 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization mode necessary to trigger azulene formation. The obtained targets are of high interest due to their potential applications in different fields, like organic materials, medicine or cosmetics. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammetry were measured, based on these the electronic properties were determined. Short two or three step sequences towards the applied starting materials make this approach synthetically highly attractive.

         <title>Structure and Internal Dynamics of Short RNA Duplexes Determined by a Combination of Pulsed EPR Methods and MD Simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combined orientation&#8208;selective PELDOR and 19F Mims ENDOR to characterize the structural ensemble of RNA duplexes and their internal motions. In a quantitative comparison to MD simulations of RNA with and without spin labels, we found that state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art force fields with explicit parameterization of the spin label can describe the conformational ensemble present in our experiments.







Abstract
We used EPR spectroscopy to characterize the structure of RNA duplexes and their internal twist, stretch and bending motions. We prepared eight 20&#8208;base&#8208;pair&#8208;long RNA duplexes containing the rigid spin&#8208;label &#199;m, a cytidine analogue, at two positions and acquired orientation&#8208;selective PELDOR/DEER data. By using different frequency bands (X&#8208;, Q&#8208;, G&#8208;band), detailed information about the distance and orientation of the labels was obtained and provided insights into the global conformational dynamics of the RNA duplex. We used 19F Mims ENDOR experiments on three singly &#199;m&#8208; and singly fluorine&#8208;labeled RNA duplexes to determine the exact position of the &#199;m spin label in the helix. In a quantitative comparison to MD simulations of RNA with and without &#199;m spin labels, we found that state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art force fields with explicit parameterization of the spin label were able to describe the conformational ensemble present in our experiments. The MD simulations further confirmed that the &#199;m spin labels are excellent mimics of cytidine inducing only small local changes in the RNA structure. &#199;m spin labels are thus ideally suited for high&#8208;precision EPR experiments to probe the structure and, in conjunction with MD simulations, motions of RNA.

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Ultraselective and Highly Permeable Fully Aromatic Polyamide Nanofiltration Membranes for Antibiotic Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noncoplanar polyaromatic amine, 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;methanetetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) (MTLB), was used as a molecular building block for fabricating thin&#8208;film composite membranes via interfacial polymerization. The resulting membrane exhibited a high salt/antibiotic selectivity and water permeance. The excellent antibiotic desalination performance can be maintained in industrial&#8208;scale spiral&#8208;wound module.







Abstract
Membranes are important in the pharmaceutical industry for the separation of antibiotics and salts. However, its widespread adoption has been hindered by limited control of the membrane microstructure (pore architecture and free&#8208;volume elements), separation threshold, scalability, and operational stability. In this study, 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;methanetetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) (MTLB) as prepared as a molecular building block for fabricating thin&#8208;film composite membranes (TFCMs) via interfacial polymerization. The relatively large molecular size and rigid molecular structure of MTLB, along with its non&#8208;coplanar and distorted conformation, produced thin and defect&#8208;free selective layers (~27&#8197;nm) with ideal microporosities for antibiotic desalination. These structural advantages yielded an unprecedented high performance with a water permeance of 45.2&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1 and efficient antibiotic desalination (NaCl/adriamycin selectivity of 422). We demonstrated the feasibility of the industrial scaling of the membrane into a spiral&#8208;wound module (with an effective area of 2.0&#8197;m2). This module exhibited long&#8208;term stability and performance that surpassed those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes used for antibiotic desalination. This study provides a scientific reference for the development of high&#8208;performance TFCMs for water purification and desalination in the pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Helicene Aromaticity Deviates from the Clar Rule&#8212;On the Electronic Dissimilarity of Large Isomeric Fibonacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long isomeric fibonacenes&#8212;a phenacene, a helicene and a croissant&#8208;shaped isomer&#8212;are found to show strikingly different absorption and emission spectra, despite their equivalent Kekul&#233; structures. Complementary computations based either on magnetic or electronic criteria for aromaticity indicate that in long helicenes, the Clar and Kekul&#233; rules of preferred sextet localization do not hold.







Abstract
This combined experimental and theoretical study illustrates the profound consequences of non&#8208;planarity on the electronic properties of polycyclic arenes. Three isomeric [10]fibonacene tetraesters were synthesized through a robust and regiocontrolled Perkin/Mallory approach: a nearly planar [10]phenacene derivative, a moderately twisted [10]semicircle derivative, and a 3D non&#8208;planar [10]helicene derivative. The photophysical properties of the 3D [10]helicene isomer were found to be dramatically different from the comparable ones of the [10]phenacene and [10]semicircle isomers. The aromatic properties of the [10]phenacene and [10]semicircle isomers conform well with their predictive Kekul&#233; and Clar analyses, but the [10]helicene isomer deviates from these general topological rules, which appears to be a general phenomenon for [n]fibonacenes with n&#8805;9.

&lt;p&gt;Long isomeric fibonacenes&#8212;a phenacene, a helicene and a croissant-shaped isomer&#8212;are found to show strikingly different absorption and emission spectra, despite their equivalent Kekul&#233; structures. Complementary computations based either on magnetic or electronic criteria for aromaticity indicate that in long helicenes, the Clar and Kekul&#233; rules of preferred sextet localization do not hold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combined experimental and theoretical study illustrates the profound consequences of non-planarity on the electronic properties of polycyclic arenes. Three isomeric [10]fibonacene tetraesters were synthesized through a robust and regiocontrolled Perkin/Mallory approach: a nearly planar [10]phenacene derivative, a moderately twisted [10]semicircle derivative, and a 3D non-planar [10]helicene derivative. The photophysical properties of the 3D [10]helicene isomer were found to be dramatically different from the comparable ones of the [10]phenacene and [10]semicircle isomers. The aromatic properties of the [10]phenacene and [10]semicircle isomers conform well with their predictive Kekul&#233; and Clar analyses, but the [10]helicene isomer deviates from these general topological rules, which appears to be a general phenomenon for [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]fibonacenes with n&#8805;9.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Active Site Structure on the Conversion of Methane to Methanol in Cu&#8208;Exchanged Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modify activation conditions to stabilize different Cu&#8208;oxo and Cu&#8208;hydroxyl dimers in the zeolite SSZ&#8208;13. Subsequently we combine theory and experiment to investigate how the Cu site structure impacts the conversion of methane to methanol. Our results indicate that site stoichiometry controls methanol production in a stepwise conversion process.







Abstract
In the past, Cu&#8208;oxo or &#8208;hydroxy clusters hosted in zeolites have been suggested to enable the selective conversion of methane to methanol, but the impact of the active site's stoichiometry and structure on methanol production is still poorly understood. Herein, we apply theoretical modeling in conjunction with experiments to study the impact of these two factors on partial methane oxidation in the Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolite SSZ&#8208;13. Phase diagrams developed from first&#8208;principles suggest that Cu&#8208;hydroxy or Cu&#8208;oxo dimers are stabilized when O2 or N2O are used to activate the catalyst, respectively. We confirm these predictions experimentally and determine that in a stepwise conversion process, Cu&#8208;oxo dimers can convert twice as much methane to methanol compared to Cu&#8208;hydroxyl dimers. Our theoretical models rationalize how Cu&#8208;di&#8208;oxo dimers can convert up to two methane molecules to methanol, while Cu&#8208;di&#8208;hydroxyl dimers can convert only one methane molecule to methanol per catalytic cycle. These findings imply that in Cu clusters, at least one oxo group or two hydroxyl groups are needed to convert one methane molecule to methanol per cycle. This simple structure&#8211;activity relationship allows to intuitively understand the potential of small oxygenated or hydroxylated transition metal clusters to convert methane to methanol.

         <title>Implanting Colloidal Nanoparticles into Single&#8208;Crystalline Zeolites for Catalytic Dehydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic zeolite with Fe3O4 colloidal nanoparticles nucleus and single&#8208;crystalline ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites shell have been fabricated by a stepwise crystallization strategy. The resulting Fe3O4@HZSM&#8208;5 catalyst shows a high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for the dehydration of ethonal in a magnetically stabilized bed (MSB) reactor.







Abstract
The encapsulation of functional colloidal nanoparticles (100&#8197;nm) into single&#8208;crystalline ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites, aiming to create uniform core&#8211;shell structures, is a highly sought&#8208;after yet formidable objective due to significant lattice mismatch and distinct crystallization properties. In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of a core&#8211;shell structured single&#8208;crystal zeolite encompassing an Fe3O4 colloidal core via a novel confinement stepwise crystallization methodology. By engineering a confined nanocavity, anchoring nucleation sites, and executing stepwise crystallization, we have successfully encapsulated colloidal nanoparticles (CN) within single&#8208;crystal zeolites. These grafted sites, alongside the controlled crystallization process, compel the zeolite seed to nucleate and expand along the Fe3O4 colloidal nanoparticle surface, within a meticulously defined volume (1.5&#215;107&#8804;V&#8804;1.3&#215;108&#8197;nm3). Our strategy exhibits versatility and adaptability to an array of zeolites, including but not restricted to ZSM&#8208;5, NaA, ZSM&#8208;11, and TS&#8208;1 with polycrystalline zeolite shell. We highlight the uniformly structured magnetic&#8208;nucleus single&#8208;crystalline zeolite, which displays pronounced superparamagnetism (14&#8197;emu/g) and robust acidity (~0.83&#8197;mmol/g). This innovative material has been effectively utilized in a magnetically stabilized bed (MSB) reactor for the dehydration of ethanol, delivering an exceptional conversion rate (98&#8201;%), supreme ethylene selectivity (98&#8201;%), and superior catalytic endurance (in excess of 100&#8197;hours).

         <title>Chloro&#8208;Functionalized Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage and Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ether&#8208;based electrolyte functionalized with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (chloro&#8208;substitution) enabled the formation of a dual halides&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), thereby enhancing the cycling stability (6000&#8197;cycles), high voltage (4.3&#8197;V) performance, and wide temperature operation (&#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C to 45&#8201;&#176;C) of potassium ion batteries.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolyte is beneficial to obtaining good low&#8208;temperature performance and high ionic conductivity in potassium ion batteries. However, the dilute ether&#8208;based electrolytes usually result in ion&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation of graphite, poor cycling stability, and hard to withstand high voltage cathodes above 4.0&#8197;V. To address the aforementioned issues, an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (chloro&#8208;substitution) was introduced to regulate the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and enhance the oxidative stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes. The dilute (~0.91&#8197;M) chloro&#8208;functionalized ether&#8208;based electrolyte not only facilitates the formation of homogeneous dual halides&#8208;based SEI, but also effectively suppress aluminum corrosion at high voltage. Using this functionalized electrolyte, the K||graphite cell exhibits a stability of 700&#8197;cycles, the K||Prussian blue (PB) cell (4.3&#8197;V) delivers a stability of 500&#8197;cycles, and the PB||graphite full&#8208;cell reveals a long stability of 6000&#8197;cycles with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98&#8201;%. Additionally, the PB||graphite full&#8208;cell can operate under a wide temperature range from &#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C to 45&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights the positive impact of electrolyte functionalization on the electrochemical performance, providing a bright future of ether&#8208;based electrolytes application for long&#8208;lasting, wide&#8208;temperature, and high Coulombic efficiency PIBs and beyond.

         <title>Light Induced Proton Coupled Charge Transfer Triggers Counterion Directional Translocation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>

The light&#8208;triggered translocation of ClO4&#8722; anion from cationic to neutral&#8208;binding site along BPym&#8208;OH dye is visualized by emission. The combination of time&#8208;resolved fluorescence and molecular dynamic simulation allows its description in time and energy domains. This reaction generates dramatically red&#8208;shifted fluorescence extending to near&#8208;IR that appears at ~83&#8197;ps, resulting from electrochromic modulation of coupled proton&#8208;electron transfer.







Abstract
We demonstrate directed translocation of ClO4&#8722; anions from cationic to neutral binding site along the synthetized BPym&#8208;OH dye molecule that exhibits coupled excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) reaction (PCCT). The results of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy together with computer simulation and modeling show that in low polar toluene the excited&#8208;state redistribution of electronic charge enhanced by ESIPT generates the driving force, which is much stronger than by CT reaction itself and provides more informative gigantic shifts of fluorescence spectra signaling on ultrafast ion motion. The associated with ion translocation red&#8208;shifted fluorescence band (at 750&#8197;nm, extending to near&#8208;IR region) appears at the time ~83&#8197;ps as a result of electrochromic modulation of PCCT reaction. It occurs at substantial delay to PCCT that displayed fluorescence band at 640&#8197;nm and risetime of &lt;200&#8197;fs. Thus, it becomes possible to visualize the manifestations of light&#8208;triggered ion translocation and of its driving force by fluorescence techniques and to separate them in time and energy domains.

&lt;/sup&gt; anion from cationic to neutral-binding site along &lt;b&gt;BPym-OH&lt;/b&gt; dye is visualized by emission. The combination of time-resolved fluorescence and molecular dynamic simulation allows its description in time and energy domains. This reaction generates dramatically red-shifted fluorescence extending to near-IR that appears at ~83&#8197;ps, resulting from electrochromic modulation of coupled proton-electron transfer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate directed translocation of ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions from cationic to neutral binding site along the synthetized &lt;b&gt;BPym-OH&lt;/b&gt; dye molecule that exhibits coupled excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer (ESIPT) and charge-transfer (CT) reaction (PCCT). The results of steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy together with computer simulation and modeling show that in low polar toluene the excited-state redistribution of electronic charge enhanced by ESIPT generates the driving force, which is much stronger than by CT reaction itself and provides more informative gigantic shifts of fluorescence spectra signaling on ultrafast ion motion. The associated with ion translocation red-shifted fluorescence band (at 750&#8197;nm, extending to near-IR region) appears at the time ~83&#8197;ps as a result of electrochromic modulation of PCCT reaction. It occurs at substantial delay to PCCT that displayed fluorescence band at 640&#8197;nm and risetime of &amp;lt;200&#8197;fs. Thus, it becomes possible to visualize the manifestations of light-triggered ion translocation and of its driving force by fluorescence techniques and to separate them in time and energy domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Butadiene Purification in a Sulfonate&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework through Synergistic Separation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfonate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework ZU&#8208;609 realizes 1,3&#8208;butadiene purification from complex C4 mixtures via synergistic size&#8208;exclusion and thermodynamic mechanisms, and polymer&#8208;grade C4H6 (99.5&#8201;%) is obtained via a single adsorption&#8208;desorption cycle under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Porous materials that could recognize specific molecules from complex mixtures are of great potential in improving the current energy&#8208;intensive multistep separation processes. However, due to the highly similar structures and properties of the mixtures, the design of desired porous materials remains challenging. Herein, a sulfonate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework ZU&#8208;609 with suitable pore size and pore chemistry is designed for 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6) purification from complex C4 mixtures. The sulfonate anions decorated in the channel achieve selective recognition of C4H6 from other C4 olefins with subtle polarity differences through C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8722;S interactions, affording recorded C4H6/trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 selectivity (4.4). Meanwhile, the shrunken mouth of the channel with a suitable pore size (4.6&#8197;&#197;) exhibits exclusion effect to the larger molecules cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8, iso&#8208;C4H8, n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10. Benefiting from the moderate C4 olefins binding affinity exhibited by sulfonate anions, the adsorbed C4H6 could be easily regenerated near ambient conditions. Polymer&#8208;grade 1,3&#8208;butadiene (99.5&#8201;%) is firstly obtained from 7&#8208;component C4 mixtures via one adsorption&#8208;desorption cycle. The work demonstrates the great potential of synergistic recognition of size&#8208;sieving and thermodynamically equilibrium in dealing with complex mixtures.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Formation of Silver Nanoclusters and Their Transformation to the Same Product</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene protected silver nanoclusters (Ag54 and Ag33) with different stabilities were isolated from identical reactants under different temperatures. Upon stimulation with bpbenz (bpbenz=1,4&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene), the kinetically metastable Ag54 and the thermodynamically stable Ag33 can yield the same product of Ag31via the breakage&#8208;reorganization and ligand exchange transformation mechanism, respectively.







Abstract
Herein, two atomically precise silver nanoclusters, Ag54 and Ag33, directed by inner anion templates (CrO42&#8722; and/or Cl&#8722;), are initially isolated as a mixed phase from identical reactants across a wide temperature range (20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C). Interestingly, fine&#8208;tuning the reaction temperature can realize pure phase synthesis of the two nanoclusters; that is, a metastable Ag54 is kinetically formed at a low temperature (20&#8201;&#176;C), whereas such a system is steered towards a thermodynamically stable Ag33 at a relatively high temperature (80&#8201;&#176;C). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry illustrates that the stability of Ag33 is superior to that of Ag54, which is further supported by density functional theory calculations. Importantly, the difference in structural stability can influence the pathway of 1,4&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene induced transformation reaction starting from Ag54 and Ag33. The former undergoes a dramatic breakage&#8208;reorganization process to form an Ag31 dimer (Ag31), while the same product can be also achieved from the latter following a noninvasive ligand exchange process. Both the Ag54 and Ag33 have the potential for further remote laser ignition applications. This work not only demonstrates how temperature controls the isolation of a specific phase, but also sheds light on the structural transformation pathway of nanoclusters with different stability.

         <title>Monolithic Interphase Enables Fast Kinetics for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries at Subzero Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs a monolithic and amorphous electrode/electrolyte interphase at low temperature which is thin, stable, and contains more organic components, facilitating fast Na+ kinetics, enabling sodium&#8208;ion batteries to achieve long&#8208;term cycling performance and great rate capability at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
In spite of the competitive performance at room temperature, the development of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) is still hindered by sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics and unstable electrode/electrolyte interphase under subzero environments. Herein, a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte, consisting of 0.5M NaPF6 dissolving in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether solvent, is proposed for SIBs working at low temperature. Such an electrolyte generates a thin, amorphous, and homogeneous cathode/electrolyte interphase at low temperature. The interphase is monolithic and rich in organic components, reducing the limitation of Na+ migration through inorganic crystals, thereby facilitating the interfacial Na+ dynamics at low temperature. Furthermore, it effectively blocks the unfavorable side reactions between active materials and electrolytes, improving the structural stability. Consequently, Na0.7Li0.03Mg0.03Ni0.27Mn0.6Ti0.07O2//Na and hard carbon//Na cells deliver a high capacity retention of 90.8&#8201;% after 900 cycles at 1C, a capacity over 310&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, showing long&#8208;term cycling stability and great rate capability at low temperature.

         <dc:description>
We present the first solid solution series of the new class of nitridomagnesophosphates with excellent luminescence properties in the cyan spectral range, tunable by Ba/Sr ratio. Extensive investigations have made it possible to attribute the luminescence to the doping of one crystallographic site. DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the influence of Mg in the P/N network for the first time.







Abstract
Tetrahedron&#8208;based nitrides offer a wide range of properties and applications. Highly condensed nitridophosphates are examples of nitrides that exhibit fascinating luminescence properties when doped with Eu2+, making them appealing for industrial applications. Here, we present the first nitridomagnesophosphate solid solution series Ba3&#8722;xSrx[Mg2P10N20]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;3), synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique (3&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8201;&#176;C). Starting from the binary nitrides P3N5 and Mg3N2 and the respective alkaline earth azides, we incorporate Mg into the P/N framework to increase the degree of condensation &#954; to 0.6, the highest observed value for alkaline earth nitridophosphates. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and solid&#8208;state NMR. DFT calculations were performed on the title compounds and other related highly condensed nitridophosphates to investigate the influence of Mg in the P/N network. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples of the solid solution series show a tunable narrow&#8208;band emission from cyan to green (492&#8211;515&#8197;nm), which is attributed to the preferred doping of a single crystallographic site. Experimental confirmation of this assumption was provided by overdoping experiments and STEM&#8208;HAADF studies on the series as well on the stoichiometric compound Ba2Eu[Mg2P10N20] with additional atomic resolution energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping.

         <title>Control of Polarity in Kagome&#8208;NiAs Bismuthides</title>

         <dc:description>
Ordered octahedral site vacancies and filling of trigonal bipyramidal interstitial sites by transition metals stabilizes a 2&#215;2&#215;1 P63/mmc superstructure of NiAs with kagome nets in Ni0.7Pd0.2Bi, Ni0.6Pt0.4Bi, and Mn0.99Pd0.01Bi. Further ordering of the interstitial sites via composition generates a net polarization in Ni0.9Bi and Ni0.79Pd0.08Bi with polar Fmm2 symmetry. The control of polarity is reflected in electronic transport properties.







Abstract
A 2&#215;2&#215;1 superstructure of the P63/mmc NiAs structure is reported in which kagome nets are stabilized in the octahedral transition metal layers of the compounds Ni0.7Pd0.2Bi, Ni0.6Pt0.4Bi, and Mn0.99Pd0.01Bi. The ordered vacancies that yield the true hexagonal kagome motif lead to filling of trigonal bipyramidal interstitial sites with the transition metal in this family of &#8220;kagome&#8208;NiAs&#8221; type materials. Further ordering of vacancies within these interstitial layers can be compositionally driven to simultaneously yield kagome&#8208;connected layers and a net polarization along the c axes in Ni0.9Bi and Ni0.79Pd0.08Bi, which adopt Fmm2 symmetry. The polar and non&#8208;polar materials exhibit different electronic transport behaviour, reflecting the tuneability of both structure and properties within the NiAs&#8208;type bismuthide materials family.

         <title>An Electrocatalytic Cascade Reaction for the Synthesis of Ketones Using CO2 as a CO Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an electrocatalytic cascade method for synthesizing ketones using CO2 as a CO surrogate. By employing a synergistic combination of two earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts, high yields are achieved in a simple setup, demonstrating the potential for sustainable and efficient carbonylation reactions.







Abstract
The construction of carbonyl compounds via carbonylation reactions using safe CO sources remains a long&#8208;standing challenge to synthetic chemists. Herein, we propose a catalyst cascade Scheme in which CO2 is used as a CO surrogate in the carbonylation of benzyl chlorides. Our approach is based on the cooperation between two coexisting catalytic cycles: the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electroreduction cycle promoted by [Fe(TPP)Cl] (TPP=meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin) and an electrochemical carbonylation cycle catalyzed by [Ni(bpy)Br2] (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine). As a proof of concept, this protocol allows for the synthesis of symmetric ketones from good to excellent yields in an undivided cell with non&#8208;sacrificial electrodes. The reaction can be directly scaled up to gram&#8208;scale and operates effectively at a CO2 concentration of 10&#8201;%, demonstrating its robustness. Our mechanistic studies based on cyclic voltammetry, IR spectroelectrochemistry and Density Functional Theory calculations suggest a synergistic effect between the two catalysts. The CO produced from CO2 reduction is key in the formation of the [Ni(bpy)(CO)2], which is proposed as the catalytic intermediate responsible for the C&#8722;C bond formation in the carbonylation steps.

         <dc:description>
A pair of acid/base responsive cages that can be interconverted without affecting the coordination environment have been self&#8208;assembled from 1,5&#8208;enedione/pyrylium based ligands, leading to a three&#8208;state supramolecular switch that can be controlled through strong acid/bases. A guest&#8208;binding&#8208;induced strain&#8208;triggered cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation was found, in addition to chemical stimuli (acid/base, NH3) responsive cage transformations.







Abstract
Controlling supramolecular systems between different functional forms by utilizing acids/bases as stimuli is a formidable challenge, especially where labile coordination bonds are involved. A pair of acid/base responsive, interconvertible 1,5&#8208;enedione/pyrylium based Pd2L4&#8208;type cages are prepared that exhibit differential guest binding abilities towards disulfonates of varied sizes. A three&#8208;state switch has been achieved, where (i) a weakly coordinating base induced cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation in the first step, (ii) a strongly coordinating base triggered cage disassembly as the second step, and (iii) the third step shows acid(strong) promoted generation of initial cage, thereby completing the cycle. To our surprise, binding of a specific disulfonate guest facilitated cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations by inducing strain on the cage assembly thereby opening the labile pyrylium rings of the cage. Through a competitive guest binding study, we demonstrated the superior guest binding capability of the octacationic pyrylium&#8208;based cage over a similar&#8208;sized tetracationic cage. These results provide a reliable approach to reversibly modulate the guest binding properties of acid/base&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembled coordination cages.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;organic cages with acrylamide side chains were incorporated in N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;based nanogels by precipitation polymerization. Due to the presence of cage crosslinks, the resulting nanogels can be used as specific sorbents for chloride ions.







Abstract
A dinuclear metal&#8208;organic cage with four acrylate side chains was prepared by self&#8208;assembly. Precipitation polymerization of the cage with N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide yielded a thermoresponsive nanogel. The host properties of the cage were retained within the gel matrix, endowing the nanogel with the capability to serve as a sorbent for chloride ions in water. Moreover, a heteroleptic cage with the drug abiraterone as co&#8208;ligand was integrated into a nanogel. The addition of chloride ions induced a structural rearrangement of the metal&#8208;ligand assembly, resulting in the gradual release of abiraterone.

         <title>Zigzag Hopping Site Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks Coating for Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of anhydride&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (i.e., PI&#8208;DP&#8208;COF and PI&#8208;DT&#8208;COF) with specifically designed zigzag hopping sites and zincophilic anhydride groups that can serve as desired platforms to investigate the related Zn2+ hopping/transfer, dendrite&#8208;inhibition, and plating/stripping behaviours as well as the interfacial interaction.







Abstract
Precise design and tuning of Zn hopping/transfer sites with deeper understanding of the dendrite&#8208;formation mechanism is vital in artificial anode protective coating for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, we probe into the role of anode&#8208;coating interfaces by designing a series of anhydride&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (i.e., PI&#8208;DP&#8208;COF and PI&#8208;DT&#8208;COF) with specifically designed zigzag hopping sites and zincophilic anhydride groups that can serve as desired platforms to investigate the related Zn2+ hopping/transfer behaviours as well as the interfacial interaction. Combining theoretical calculations with experiments, the ABC stacking models of these COFs endow the structures with specific zigzag sites along the 1D channel that can accelerate Zn2+ transfer kinetics, lower surface&#8208;energy, homogenize ion&#8208;distribution or electric&#8208;filed. Attributed to these superiorities, thus&#8208;obtained optimal PI&#8208;DT&#8208;COF cells offer excellent cycling lifespan in both symmetric&#8208;cell (2000&#8197;cycles at 60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and full&#8208;cell (1600&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), outperforming almost all the reported porous crystalline materials.

         <title>Accumulation, Characterization and Reactivity of Chiral Ammonium&#8208;Carboxonium Dications in Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral ammonium&#8208;oxocarbenium dications are accumulated in superacid through a tandem diastereoselective proton&#8208;transfer/intramolecular cyclization. Their reactivity in the diastereoselective remote functionalization of non&#8208;activated alkene is explored.







Abstract
The accumulation of chiral ammonium&#8208;oxocarbenium dications in superacid is evidenced by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and confirmed by DFT calculations. Its potential for the diastereoselective remote hydrofunctionalization of non&#8208;activated alkene is also explored.

         <title>Aqueous Coordination&#8208;Insertion Copolymerization for Producing High Molecular Weight Polar Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water, a poison in traditional olefin polymerization processes using Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts, enables coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549&#8197;kDa) using single&#8208;component and neutral nickel catalysts under mild conditions.







Abstract
Hydrocarbons, when used as the medium for transition metal catalyzed organic reactions and olefin (co&#8208;)polymerization, are ubiquitous. Environmentally friendly water is highly attractive and long&#8208;sought, but is greatly challenging as coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization reaction medium of olefin and polar monomers. Unfavorable interactions from both water and polar monomer usually lead to either catalyst deactivation or the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. Herein, we develop well&#8208;behaved neutral phosphinophenolato nickel catalysts, which enable aqueous copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549&#8197;kDa, 0.13&#8211;1.29&#8197;mol&#8201;%) in a single&#8208;component fashion under mild conditions for the first time. These copolymerization reactions occur better in water than in hydrocarbons such as toluene. The dual characteristics of high molecular weight and the incorporation of a small amount of functional group result in improved surface properties while retain the desirable intrinsic properties of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE).

         <title>A Light&#8208;Triggered J&#8208;Aggregation&#8208;Regulated Therapy Conversion: from Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy to Long&#8208;Lasting Chemodynamic Therapy for Effective Tumor Ablation</title>

         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;triggered J&#8208;aggregates system is developed for a converting cancer therapy with enhanced therapeutic outcomes. The photodegradation of cyanine leads to the destruction of J&#8208;aggregation, facilitating the conversion from photodynamic/photothermal therapy to long&#8208;lasting chemodynamic therapy. This work presents a safe and effective strategy for prolonging the therapeutic efficacy of ROS&#8208;based therapy.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have become an effective tool for tumor treatment. The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) takes advantage of various ROS and enhances therapeutic effects. However, the activation of CDT usually occurs before PDT, which hinders the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and reduces the treatment efficiency. Herein, we present a light&#8208;triggered nano&#8208;system based on molecular aggregation regulation for converting cancer therapy from PDT/photothermal therapy (PTT) to a long&#8208;lasting CDT. The ordered J&#8208;aggregation enhances the photodynamic properties of the cyanine moiety while simultaneously suppressing the chemodynamic capabilities of the copper&#8208;porphyrin moiety. Upon light irradiation, Cu&#8208;PCy JNPs demonstrate strong photodynamic and photothermal effects. Meanwhile, light triggers a rapid degradation of the cyanine backbone, leading to the destruction of the J&#8208;aggregation. As a result, a long&#8208;lasting CDT is sequentially activated, and the sustained generation of &#8901;OH is observed for up to 48&#8197;hours, causing potent cellular oxidative stress and apoptosis. Due to their excellent tumor accumulation, Cu&#8208;PCy JNPs exhibit effective in vivo tumor ablation through the converting therapy. This work provides a new approach for effectively prolonging the chemodynamic activity in ROS&#8208;based cancer therapy.

A fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linked gel polymer electrolyte (FP&#8208;GPE) has been designed and fabricated for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The FP&#8208;GPE&#8208;based batteries display excellent electrochemical performance and high safety simultaneously even at practical conditions. Moreover, the first reported solid&#8208;state 18650 cylindrical LMBs have been successfully fabricated and demonstrate exceptional safety under mechanical abuse.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) has been hindered by limited cycle&#8208;life and safety concerns. To solve these problems, we develop a novel fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linker for gel polymer electrolyte in high&#8208;voltage LMBs, achieving superior electrochemical performance and high safety simultaneously. The fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linked gel polymer electrolyte (FP&#8208;GPE) by in&#8208;situ polymerization method not only demonstrates high oxidation stability but also exhibits excellent compatibility with lithium metal anode. LMBs utilizing FP&#8208;GPE realize stable cycling even at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V (vs Li/Li+) with various high&#8208;voltage cathode materials. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2|FP&#8208;GPE|Li battery exhibits an ultralong cycle&#8208;life of 1200 cycles with an impressive capacity retention of 80.1&#8201;%. Furthermore, the FP&#8208;GPE&#8208;based batteries display excellent electrochemical performance even at practical conditions, such as high cathode mass loading (20.84&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), ultrathin Li (20&#8197;&#956;m), and a wide temperature range of &#8722;25 to 80&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the first reported solid&#8208;state 18650 cylindrical LMBs have been successfully fabricated and demonstrate exceptional safety under mechanical abuse. Additionally, the industry&#8208;level 18650 cylindrical LiMn2O4|FP&#8208;GPE|Li4Ti5O12 cells demonstrate a remarkable cycle&#8208;life of 1400 cycles. Therefore, the impressive electrochemical performance and high safety in practical batteries demonstrate a substantial potential of well&#8208;designed FP&#8208;GPE for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Phenol Derivatives over Bismuth&#8208;Based Porous Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous bismuth&#8208;based metal halide perovskites with tunable band gap compositions are prepared and explored as photocatalysts for solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative phenol C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O coupling reactions. The porous morphology, appropriate band&#8208;edge alignment and Lewis acid sites of CsBi2Br9 are found to play a crucial role in stabilizing the phenolic intermediates, thereby boosting the reaction kinetics.







Abstract
The selective oxidative coupling of phenol derivatives, involving carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) and carbon&#8208;oxygen (C&#8722;O) bond formation, has emerged as a critical approach in the synthesis of natural products. However, achieving precise control over the selectivity in coupling reactions of unsubstituted phenols utilizing solar light as the driving force remains a big challenge. In this study, we report a series of porous Cs3Bi2X9 (X=Cl, Br, I) photocatalysts with tailored band gaps and compositions engineered for efficient solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative phenol coupling. Notably, p&#8208;Cs3Bi2Br9 exhibited about 73&#8201;% selectivity for C&#8722;C coupling, displaying a high formation rate of 47.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under solar radiation. Furthermore, this approach enables control of the site&#8208;selectivity for phenol derivatives on Cs3Bi2X9, enhancing C&#8722;C coupling. The distinctive porous structure and appropriate band&#8208;edge positions of Cs3Bi2Br9 facilitated efficient charge separation, and surface interaction/activation of phenolic hydroxyl groups, resulting in the kinetically preferred formation of C&#8722;C over C&#8722;O bond. Mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway, supported by comprehensive control experiments, unveiled the crucial role of interfacial charge transfers and Lewis acid Bi sites in stabilizing phenolic intermediates, thereby directing the regioselectivity of diradical couplings and resulting in the formation of unsymmetrical biphenols.

         <title>Mercury&#8208;Group&#8197;13 Metal Covalent Bonds: A Systematic Comparison of Aluminyl, Gallyl and Indyl Metallo&#8208;ligands</title>

Aided by the syntheses of potassium indyl reagents, access is possible for the first time to a complete series of metal&#8208;trielyl complexes featuring the same xanthene&#8208;derived NON&#8208;framework. Analysis of mercury compounds of the type (boryl)HgE(NON) (E=Al, Ga, In) by structural, spectroscopic and theoretical methods shows that the aluminyl metallo&#8208;ligand [(NON)Al]&#8722; is the most potent &#963;&#8208;donor.







Abstract
Bimetallic compounds containing direct metal&#8208;group&#8197;13 element bonds have been shown to display unprecedented patterns of cooperative reactivity towards small molecules, which can be influenced by the identity of the group&#8197;13 element. In this context, we present here a systematic appraisal of group&#8197;13 metallo&#8208;ligands of the type [(NON)E]&#8722; (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) for E=Al, Ga and In, through a comparison of structural and spectroscopic parameters associated with the trans L or X ligands in linear d10 complexes of the types LM{E(NON)} and XM&#8242;{E(NON)}. These studies are facilitated by convenient syntheses (from the In(I) precursor, InCp) of the potassium indyl species [{K(NON)In}&#8901;KCp]n (1) and [(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)2K2Cp] [(NON)In] (1&#8242;), and lead to the first structural characterisation of Ag&#8722;In and Hg&#8722;E (E=Al, In) covalent bonds. The resulting structural, spectroscopic and quantum chemical probes of Ag/Hg complexes are consistent with markedly stronger &#963;&#8208;donor capabilities of the aluminyl ligand, [(NON)Al]&#8722;, over its gallium and indium counterparts.

         <title>Pyridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Pyridyl&#8208;Imine Structures for Boosting Photocatalytic H2O2 Production via One&#8208;Step 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work reports a pyridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) functionalized with pyridyl&#8208;imine structures to boost photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. The unique pyridyl&#8208;imine structures can effectively suppress the two&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process on imine&#8208;nitrogen sites, facilitating a more efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; pathway for H2O2 production.







Abstract
Bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising contenders for the photocatalytic generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the presence of imine nitrogen alters the mode of H2O2 generation from an efficient one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) route to a two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction pathway. In this work, we introduce 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine units into imine&#8208;based COF skeletons, creating a pyridyl&#8208;imine structure with two adjacent nitrogen atoms between the pyridine ring and imine linkage. This unique bipyridine&#8208;like architecture can effectively suppress the two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR process at the single imine&#8208;nitrogen site, facilitating a more efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; pathway. Consequently, the optimized pyridyl&#8208;imine COF (PyIm&#8208;COF) exhibits a remarkable H2O2 production rate of up to 5850&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly double that of pristine bipyridine COFs. This work provides valuable insight into the rational design of functionalized COFs for enhanced H2O2 production in photocatalysis.

However, the presence of imine nitrogen alters the mode of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation from an efficient one-step two-electron (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) route to a two-step 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction pathway. In this work, we introduce 3,3&#8242;-bipyridine units into imine-based COF skeletons, creating a pyridyl-imine structure with two adjacent nitrogen atoms between the pyridine ring and imine linkage. This unique bipyridine-like architecture can effectively suppress the two-step 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR process at the single imine-nitrogen site, facilitating a more efficient one-step 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; pathway. Consequently, the optimized pyridyl-imine COF (PyIm-COF) exhibits a remarkable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of up to 5850&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, nearly double that of pristine bipyridine COFs. This work provides valuable insight into the rational design of functionalized COFs for enhanced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Observation of Solvent&#8208;Mediated Cyclic Intermediates during the Alkene Epoxidation/Hydration over a Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aprotic acetone&#8208;mediated five&#8208;membered&#8208;ring intermediate as the active site for the epoxidation reaction over a Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 system is observed for the first time by using in situ and 2D MAS NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. The critical role of this intermediate in cyclohexene epoxidation is revealed.







Abstract
Solvent effects in catalytic reactions have received widespread attention as they can promote reaction rates and product selectivities by orders of magnitude. It is well accepted that the stable five&#8208;membered cyclic intermediates formed between the solvent molecules and Ti species are crucial to the alkene epoxidation in a heterogeneous Ti(IV)&#8722;H2O2 system. However, the direct spectroscopic evidence of these intermediates is still missing and the corresponding reaction pathway for the alkene epoxidation remains unclear. By combining in situ 13C MAS NMR, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 1H&#8722;13C heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, the five&#8208;membered ring structures, where the protic solvents (ROH), and aprotic solvent (acetone), coordinate and stabilize the active Ti species, are identified for the first time over Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 system. Moreover, the role of these cyclic intermediates in the alkene epoxidation/hydration conversion is clarified. These results provide new insights into the solvent effect in liquid&#8208;phase epoxidation/hydration reactions over Ti(IV)&#8722;H2O2 system.

         <title>Validating &#916;&#916;G Selectivity Descriptor for Electrosynthesis of H2O2 from Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While descriptor&#8208;based analysis has effectively delineated activity trends, addressing selectivity trends has proven to be a challenging hurdle in the quest to develop innovative catalysts for electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide via 2e&#8208;ORR. This contribution validates the efficacy of a novel selectivity descriptor, &#916;&#916;G, using an extensive library of binary alloys. We demonstrate &#916;&#916;G as the ultimate selectivity descriptor for 2e&#8208;ORR.







Abstract
Understanding selectivity trends is a crucial hurdle in the developing innovative catalysts for generating hydrogen peroxide through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR). The identification of selectivity patterns has been made more accessible through the introduction of a newly developed selectivity descriptor derived from thermodynamics, denoted as &#916;&#916;G introduced in Chem Catal. 2023, 3(3), 100568. To validate the suitability of this parameter as a descriptor for 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity, we utilize an extensive library of 155&#8197;binary alloys. We validate that &#916;&#916;G reliably depicts the selectivity trends in binary alloys reported for their high activity in the 2e&#8208;ORR. This analysis also enables the identification of nine selective 2e&#8208;ORR catalysts underscoring the efficacy of &#916;&#916;G as 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity descriptor. This work highlights the significance of concurrently considering both selectivity and activity trends. This holistic approach is crucial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding in the identification of high&#8208;performance catalyst materials for optimal efficiency in various applications.

         <title>CO Intermediate&#8208;Assisted Dynamic Cu Sintering During Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>

A novel pathway involving the evolution of Cu&#8722;(CO)x moieties driven by the synergistic adsorption of CO and H was identified for dynamic Cu sintering in Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts under CO2 reduction conditions.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to multicarbon products has been widely recognized for Cu&#8208;based catalysts. However, the structural changes in Cu&#8208;based catalysts during the eCO2RR pose challenges to achieving an in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship, thereby limiting catalyst development. Herein, we employ constant&#8208;potential density functional theory calculations to investigate the sintering process of Cu single atoms of Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts into clusters under eCO2RR conditions. Systematic constant&#8208;potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the leaching of Cu&#8722;(CO)x moieties and subsequent agglomeration into clusters can be facilitated by synergistic adsorption of H and eCO2RR intermediates (e.g., CO). Increasing the Cu2+ concentration or the applied potential can efficiently suppress Cu sintering. Both microkinetic simulations and experimental results further confirm that sintered Cu clusters play a crucial role in generating C2 products. These findings provide significant insights into the dynamic evolution of Cu&#8208;based catalysts and the origin of their activity toward C2 products during the eCO2RR.

         <title>Unveiling Low Temperature Assembly of Dense Fe&#8208;N4 Active Sites via Hydrogenation in Advanced Oxygen Reduction Catalysts</title>

&#8220;Innovative low&#8208;temp synthesis of single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts prevents Fe nanoparticles sintering, ensuring dense Fe&#8208;N4 site formation, and leads to improved ORR activity and fuel cell efficiency, with potential for diverse high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom materials.&#8221;







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C is a prominent material with exceptional reactivity in areas of sustainable energy and catalysis research. It is challenging to obtain the dense Fe&#8208;N4 site without the Fe nanoparticles (NPs) sintering during the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C synthesis via high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Thus, a novel approach is devised for the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C synthesis at low temperatures. Taking FeCl2 as Fe source, a hydrogen environment can facilitate oxygen removal and dichlorination processes in the synthesis, efficiently favouring Fe&#8208;N4 site formation without Fe NPs clustering at as low as 360&#8201;&#176;C. We shed light on the reaction mechanism about hydrogen promoting Fe&#8208;N4 formation in the synthesis. By adjusting the temperature and duration, the Fe&#8208;N4 structural evolution and site density can be precisely tuned to directly influence the catalytic behaviour of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C material. The FeNC&#8208;H2&#8208;360 catalyst demonstrates a remarkable Fe dispersion (8.3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and superior acid ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a peak power density of 1.21&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in fuel cell. This method also generally facilitates the synthesis of various high&#8208;performance M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials (M=Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Zn, Ru) with elevated single&#8208;atom loadings.

This method also generally facilitates the synthesis of various high-performance M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials (M=Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Zn, Ru) with elevated single-atom loadings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modification of Polysulfide Surfaces with Low&#8208;Power Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light touch: A photosensitive copolymer made from elemental sulfur and low&#8208;cost dienes such as cyclopentadiene could be rapidly modified with low&#8208;power lasers operating in the visible and infrared wavelengths. Erasable information coding and direct laser lithography were demonstrated.







Abstract
The modification of polymer surfaces using laser light is important for many applications in the nano&#8208;, bio&#8208; and chemical sciences. Such capabilities have supported advances in biomedical devices, electronics, information storage, microfluidics, and other applications. In most cases, these modifications require high power lasers that are expensive and require specialized equipment and facilities to minimize risk of hazardous radiation. Additionally, polymer systems that can be easily modified by lasers are often complex and costly to prepare. In this report, these challenges are addressed with the discovery of low&#8208;cost sulfur copolymers that can be rapidly modified with lasers emitting low&#8208;power infrared and visible light. The featured copolymers are made from elemental sulfur and either cyclopentadiene or dicyclopentadiene. Using a suite of lasers with discreet wavelengths (532, 638 and 786&#8197;nm) and powers, a variety of surface modifications could be made on the polymers such as controlled swelling or etching via ablation. The facile synthesis and laser modification of these polymer systems were exploited in applications such as direct laser lithography and erasable information storage.

         <title>Unlocking Spin Gates of Transition Metal Oxides via Strain Stimuli to Augment Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unlocked birdcage symbolizes the material opening its spin gates, with the liberated bird representing charges. By unlocking the spin gates, the movement of charges becomes smooth and unrestricted, corresponding to the enhanced dynamics and stability of transition metal oxides during energy storage processes.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are key in electrochemical energy storage, offering cost&#8208;effectiveness and a broad potential window. However, their full potential is limited by poor understanding of their slow reaction kinetics and stability issues. This study diverges from conventional complex nano&#8208;structuring, concentrating instead on spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions to enhance the reaction dynamics and stability of TMOs during energy storage processes. We successfully reconfigured the orbital degeneracy and spin&#8208;dependent electronic occupancy by disrupting the symmetry of magnetic cobalt (Co) sites through straightforward strain stimuli. The key to this approach lies in the unfilled Co 3d shell, which serves as a spin&#8208;dependent regulator for carrier transfer and orbital interactions within the reaction. We observed that the opening of these &#8242;spin gates&#8242; occurs during a transition from a symmetric low&#8208;spin state to an asymmetric high&#8208;spin state, resulting in enhanced reaction kinetics and maintained structural stability. Specifically, the spin&#8208;rearranged Al&#8722;Co3O4 exhibited a specific capacitance of 1371&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is 38&#8201;% higher than that of unaltered Co3O4. These results not only shed light on the spin effects in magnetic TMOs but also establish a new paradigm for designing electrochemical energy storage materials with improved efficiency.

         <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching in a Porous Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photoswitches, i.e., 6&#8208;nitro&#8208;spiropyran and o&#8208;fluoroazobenzene are shown to operate in a wavelength&#8208;orthogonal manner both in solution and when integrated into a porous material scaffold. Selective isomerization of each photoswitch can be triggered by a specific wavelength of light giving rise to four independently accessible states of the porous material, thus providing a basis for the dynamic multifunctional materials.







Abstract
The development of photoresponsive systems with non&#8208;invasive orthogonal control by distinct wavelengths of light is still in its infancy. In particular, the design of photochemically triggered&#8208;orthogonal systems integrated into solid materials that enable multiple dynamic control over their properties remains a longstanding challenge. Here, we report the orthogonal and reversible control of two types of photoswitches in an integrated solid porous framework, that is, visible&#8208;light responsive o&#8208;fluoroazobenzene and nitro&#8208;spiropyran motifs. The properties of the constructed material can be selectively controlled by different wavelengths of light thus generating four distinct states providing a basis for dynamic multifunctional materials. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy demonstrated the selective transformation of the azobenzene switch in the bulk, which in turn modulates N2 and CO2 adsorption.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Titanium on Mesoporous Nitrogen, Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Photo&#8208;thermal Catalytic CO2 Cycloaddition by a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Ti&#8722;CNO catalysts are synthesized for photothermal catalytic cycloaddition of styrene oxide and CO2 to styrene carbonate, achieving an excellent catalytic performance (98.3&#8201;% in 6&#8197;h, 10&#8197;cycles). The addition of Ti single atoms creates abundant mesoporous structure, enhances photothermal effect and Lewis acidic/basic sites, which facilitate the activation of styrene oxide and CO2 to form styrene oxide.+ and CO2.&#8722;, respectively.







Abstract
Developing efficient and earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for CO2 fixation to high value&#8208;added chemicals is meaningful but challenging. Styrene carbonate has great market value, but the cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide is difficult due to the high steric hindrance and weak electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the phenyl group. To utilize clean energy (such as optical energy) directly and effectively for CO2 value&#8208;added process, we introduce earth&#8208;abundant Ti single&#8208;atom into the mesoporous nitrogen, oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (Ti&#8722;CNO) by a two&#8208;step method. The Ti&#8722;CNO exhibits excellent photothermal catalytic activities and stability for cycloaddition of CO2 and styrene oxide to styrene carbonate. Under light irradiation and ambient pressure, an optimal Ti&#8722;CNO produces styrene carbonate with a yield of 98.3&#8201;%, much higher than CN (27.1&#8201;%). In addition, it shows remarkable stability during 10 consecutive cycles. Its enhanced catalytic performance stems from the enhanced photothermal effect and improved Lewis acidic/basic sites exposed by the abundant mesopores. The experiments and theoretical simulations demonstrate the styrene oxide&#8901;+ and CO2&#8901;&#8722; radicals generated at the Lewis acidic (Ti&#948;+) and basic sites of Ti&#8722;CNO under light irradiation, respectively. This work furnishes a strategy for synthesizing advanced single&#8208;atom catalysts for photo&#8208;thermal synergistic CO2 fixation to high value products via a cycloaddition pathway.

         <title>The Importance of Sintering&#8208;Induced Grain Boundaries in Copper Catalysis to Improve Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling</title>

Syngas conversion reaction induces the in situ generation of copper grain boundaries which leads to the formation of long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. The synergy of grain boundaries and their vicinal low&#8208;index facets leads to the CO insertion where non&#8208;dissociative adsorbed CO on low&#8208;index facets migrates to grain boundaries and inserts into the metal&#8208;alkyl bond for the chain growth.







Abstract
Syngas conversion serves as a gas&#8208;to&#8208;liquid technology to produce liquid fuels and valuable chemicals from coal, natural gas, or biomass. During syngas conversion, sintering is known to deactivate the catalyst owing to the loss of active surface area. However, the growth of nanoparticles might induce the formation of new active sites such as grain boundaries (GBs) which perform differently from the original nanoparticles. Herein, we reported a unique Cu&#8208;based catalyst, Cu nanoparticles with in situ generated GBs confined in zeolite Y (denoted as activated Cu/Y), which exhibited a high selectivity for C5+ hydrocarbons (65.3&#8197;C%) during syngas conversion. Such high selectivity for long&#8208;chain products distinguished activated Cu/Y from typical copper&#8208;based catalysts which mainly catalyze methanol synthesis. This unique performance was attributed to the GBs, while the zeolite assisted the stabilization through spatial confinement. Specifically, the GBs enabled H&#8208;assisted dissociation of CO and subsequent hydrogenation into CHx*. CHx* species not only serve as the initiator but also directly polymerize on Cu GBs, known as the carbide mechanism. Meanwhile, the synergy of GBs and their vicinal low&#8208;index facets led to the CO insertion where non&#8208;dissociative adsorbed CO on low&#8208;index facets migrated to GBs and inserted into the metal&#8208;alkyl bond for the chain growth.

         <title>Metalla&#8208;Carbaporphyrinoids Consisting of an Acyclic N&#8208;Confused Tetrapyrrole Analogue Served as Stable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Dyes</title>

Breaking the tetrapyrrolic &#960;&#8208;skeleton and implementing N&#8208;confusion modification offer a distinctive ligand platform for metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species. Through d&#8208;&#960; orbital interaction, the resultant open&#8208;ring Pd/Pt complexes demonstrate near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II absorption capability and high photothermal conversion efficiency.







Abstract
We present herein the synthesis of novel pseudo&#8208;metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species (1M: M=Pd and Pt) achieved through the inner coordination of palladium(II) and platinum(II) with an acyclic N&#8208;confused tetrapyrrin analogue. Despite their tetrapyrrole frameworks being small, akin to well&#8208;known porphyrins, these species exhibit an unusually narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, resulting in an unprecedentedly low&#8208;energy absorption in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed unique d&#960;&#8208;p&#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structures involving the metal d&#960;&#8208;ligand p&#960; hybridized molecular orbitals of 1M. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy confirmed distinct electronic structures. Remarkably, the complexes feature an open&#8208;metal coordination site in the peripheral NN dipyrrin site, forming hetero&#8208;metal complexes (1Pd&#8208;BF2 and 1Pt&#8208;BF2) through boron difluoride complexation. The resulting hetero metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species displayed further redshifted NIR&#8208;II absorption, highly efficient photothermal conversion efficiencies (&#951;; 62&#8211;65&#8201;%), and exceptional photostability. Despite the challenges associated with the theoretical and experimental assessment of d&#960;&#8208;p&#960;&#8208;conjugated metalla&#8208;aromaticity in relatively larger (more than 18&#960; electrons) polycyclic ring systems, these organometallic planar tetrapyrrole systems could serve as potential molecular platforms for aromaticity&#8208;relevant NIR&#8208;II dyes.

         <title>Structural Insights Into the Terpene Cyclization Domains of Two Fungal Sesterterpene Synthases and Enzymatic Engineering for Sesterterpene Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structures of the terpene cyclization (TC) domains of two fungal sesterterpene synthases (NfSS and PbSS) were determined. Modeling of carbocationic intermediates, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and isotope labeling provided detailed insights into their catalytic mechanisms. Structure&#8208;based engineering of NfSS and PbSS resulted in the formation of 20 sesterterpenes including 13 new compounds.







Abstract
Little is known about the structures and catalytic mechanisms of sesterterpene synthases (StTSs), which greatly hinders the structure&#8208;based engineering of StTSs for structural diversity expansion of sesterterpenes. We here report on the crystal structures of the terpene cyclization (TC) domains of two fungal StTSs: sesterfisherol synthase (NfSS) and sesterbrasiliatriene synthase (PbSS). Both TC structures contain benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BTAC), pyrophosphate (PPi), and magnesium ions (Mg2+), clearly defining the catalytic active sites. A combination of theory and experiments including carbocationic intermediates modeling, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and isotope labeling provided detailed insights into the structural basis for their catalytic mechanisms. Structure&#8208;based engineering of NfSS and PbSS resulted in the formation of 20 sesterterpenes including 13 new compounds and four pairs of epimers with different configurations at C18. These results expand the structural diversity of sesterterpenes and provide important insights for future synthetic biology research.

         <title>CYP3A Mediates an Unusual C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond Cleavage via Ipso&#8208;Addition of Oxygen in Drug Metabolism</title>

         <dc:description>
Mammalian cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing enzymes rarely cleave C&#8722;C bonds. Here we report the mechanisms of two unusual CYP3A&#8208;mediated cleavages of non&#8208;polar, unstrained C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in the metabolism of tyrosine kinase inhibitor pexidartinib. One bond is cleaved by CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition of activated oxygen, and the other occurs by a pseudo&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol reaction after hydroxylation of a C(sp3) site.







Abstract
Mammalian cytochrome P450 drug&#8208;metabolizing enzymes rarely cleave carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds and the mechanisms of such cleavages are largely unknown. We identified two unusual cleavages of non&#8208;polar, unstrained C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in the FDA&#8208;approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor pexidartinib that are mediated by CYP3A4/5, the major human phase I drug metabolizing enzymes. Using a synthetic ketone, we rule out the Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation mechanism that is commonly invoked to address P450&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavages. Our studies in 18O2 and H218O enriched systems reveal two unusual distinct mechanisms of C&#8722;C bond cleavage: one bond is cleaved by CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition of oxygen to a C(sp2) site of N&#8208;protected pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amines, and the other occurs by a pseudo&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol reaction after hydroxylation of a C(sp3) site. This is the first report of CYP3A&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavage in drug metabolism via ipso&#8208;addition of oxygen mediated mechanism. CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition is also implicated in the regioselective C&#8722;C cleavages of several pexidartinib analogs. The regiospecificity of CYP3A&#8208;catalyzed oxygen ipso&#8208;addition under environmentally friendly conditions may be attractive and inspire biomimetic or P450&#8208;engineering methods to address the challenging task of C&#8722;C bond cleavages.

         <title>Finding Natural, Dense, and Stable Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Wurtzite Crystal Surfaces for Small&#8208;Molecule Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) are found on the stable wurtzite crystal surfaces. All the surface atoms serving as Lewis acid/base sites contribute to the surface density of SFLPs reaching up to the highest value to date. The approaching orbital orientations of SFLPs are the origin of the outstanding performance for the activation of small molecules, thereby demonstrating great potential in heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) open up new opportunities for substituting noble metals in the activation and conversion of stable molecules. However, the applications of SFLPs on a larger scale are impeded by the complex construction process, low surface density, and sensitivity to the reaction environment. Herein, wurtzite&#8208;structured crystals such as GaN, ZnO, and AlP are found for developing natural, dense, and stable SFLPs. It is revealed that the SFLPs can naturally exist on the (100) and (110) surfaces of wurtzite&#8208;structured crystals. All the surface cations and anions serve as the Lewis acid and Lewis base in SFLPs, respectively, contributing to the surface density of SFLPs as high as 7.26&#215;1014&#8197;cm&#8722;2. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the SFLPs can keep stable under high temperatures and the reaction atmospheres of CO and H2O. Moreover, outstanding performance for activating the given small molecules is achieved on these natural SFLPs, which originates from the optimal orbital overlap between SFLPs and small molecules. Overall, these findings not only provide a simple method to obtain dense and stable SFLPs but also unfold the nature of SFLPs toward the facile activation of small molecules.

         <title>Anion&#8211;Cation Competition Chemistry for Comprehensive High&#8208;Performance Prussian Blue Analogs Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
After high&#8208;voltage CV scanning, the higher (de)intercalation voltage and lower diffusion activation energy for both Cl&#8722; and K+ boost the comprehensive improvement of the discharge voltage, capacity, rate and cyclic performance. The comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs.







Abstract
The extensively studied Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) in various batteries are limited by their low discharge capacity, or subpar rate etc., which are solely reliant on the cation (de)intercalation mechanism. In contrast to the currently predominant focus on cations, we report the overlooked anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry (Cl&#8722;, K+, Zn2+) stimulated by high&#8208;voltage scanning. With our designed anion&#8208;cation combinations, the KFeMnHCF cathode battery delivers comprehensively superior discharge performance, including voltage plateau &gt;2.0&#8197;V (vs. Zn/Zn2+), capacity &gt;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, rate capability with capacity maintenance above 96&#8201;% from 0.6 to 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and cyclic stability exceeding 3000&#8197;cycles. We further verify that such comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs. Our work would pave a new and efficient road towards the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance PBAs cathode batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;performance Pyroelectric Property Accompanied by Spin Crossover in a Single Crystal of Fe(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;crossover Fe(II) complex demonstrating high&#8208;performance pyroelectricity across a remarkably wide temperature range just above room temperature was reported. Detailed structural analyses revealed that pyroelectric response can be ascribed to a giant thermal expansion of polar axis accompanied by a gradual low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin transition of metal centers.







Abstract
Pyroelectric materials hold significant potential for energy harvesting, sensing, and imaging applications. However, achieving high&#8208;performance pyroelectricity across a wide temperature range near room temperature remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a single crystal of Fe(II) spin&#8208;crossover compound shows remarkable pyroelectric properties accompanied by a thermally controlled spin transition. In this material, the uniaxial alignment of polar molecules results in a polarization of the lattice. As the molecular geometry is modulated during a gradual spin transition, the polar axis experiences a colossal thermal expansion with a coefficient of 796&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;K&#8722;1. Consequently, the material's polarization undergoes significant modulation as a secondary pyroelectric effect. The considerable shift in polarization (pyroelectric coefficient, p=3.7&#8211;22&#8197;nC&#8201;K&#8722;1cm&#8722;2), coupled with a low dielectric constant (&#1013;&#8242;=4.4&#8211;5.4) over a remarkably wide temperature range of 298 to 400&#8197;K, suggests this material is a high&#8208;performance pyroelectric. The demonstration of pyroelectricity combined with magnetic switching in this study will inspire further investigations in the field of molecular electronics and magnetism.

         <title>Adaptive and Robust Vitrimers Fabricated by Synergy of Traditional and Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We couple boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8722;N) dative bonds and B&#8722;O covalent bonds to generate a new class of vitrimers, boron&#8208;nitrogen vitrimers (BNVs), to endow them with dynamic features at usage temperatures. Compared with boron&#8208;ester vitrimers (BEVs) without B&#8722;N dative bonds, the BNVs showcase enhanced mechanical performance.







Abstract
Vitrimers offer a unique combination of mechanical performance, reprocessability, and recyclability that makes them highly promising for a wide range of applications. However, achieving dynamic behavior in vitrimeric materials at their intended usage temperatures, thus combining reprocessability with adaptivity through associative dynamic covalent bonds, represents an attractive but formidable objective. Herein, we couple boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8722;N) dative bonds and B&#8722;O covalent bonds to generate a new class of vitrimers, boron&#8208;nitrogen vitrimers (BNVs), to endow them with dynamic features at usage temperatures. Compared with boron&#8208;ester vitrimers (BEVs) without B&#8722;N dative bonds, the BNVs with B&#8722;N dative bonds showcase enhanced mechanical performance. The excellent mechanical properties come from the synergistic effect of the dative B&#8722;N supramolecular polymer and covalent boron&#8208;ester networks. Moreover, benefiting from the associative exchange of B&#8722;O dynamic covalent bonds above their topological freezing temperature (Tv), the resultant BNVs also possess the processability. This study leveraged the structural characteristics of a boron&#8208;based vitrimer to achieve material reinforcement and toughness enhancement, simultaneously providing novel design concepts for the construction of new vitrimeric materials.

A 9&#8208;membered ring is incorporated into a saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;skeleton: In their Research Article (e202402756), Qian Miao et&#8197;al. report the synthesis of trioxa[9]circulene through intramolecular oxidative coupling of dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene. In the crystals, molecules of trioxa[9]circulene stack in a column with remarkable &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap, resembling the stacking pattern of saddle&#8208;shaped potato chips. Dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene exhibits high absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors on the order of 10&#8722;2.

A one&#8208;pot electrocatalytic cell featuring a nickel foam electrode as the cathode and a non&#8208;sacrificial carbon electrode as the anode is depicted on the cover. In their Research Article (e202403674), Julio Lloret&#8208;Fillol et&#8197;al. describe a synergistic cascade catalysis strategy. This method employs two earth&#8208;abundant metallocatalysts&#8212;iron tetraphenylporphyrin and nickel bipyridine&#8212;to efficiently synthesize symmetric ketones from CO2 and alkyl chlorides with high yields.

A cyclically operated three&#8208;state supramolecular switching phenomenon is demonstrated by Dillip&#8197;Kumar Chand et&#8197;al. (Molecular Architecture Laboratory, IIT Madras) in their Research Article (e202403711). The states A and B represented by guest&#8208;bound Pd2L4&#8208;type coordination cages are interconvertible upon addition of suitable base/acid. These two states are displayed on the cover against the background of Kashmir Tulip garden. Cationic pyrylium units crafted in a coordination cage are mapped with the polycyclic pyrylium pigments of tulips.

         <title>Molecular Ratchets and Kinetic Asymmetry: Giving Chemistry Direction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ratcheting is the mechanism by which stochastic molecular dynamics, and other random exchange processes in chemistry, can be directionally biased and driven away from equilibrium. In this Review we discuss the recognition, invention and development of molecular ratchets and kinetic asymmetry, which underpins it. We explain the design principles for different types of ratchet and energy sources, and outline some current challenges and opportunities for the future.







Abstract
Over the last two decades ratchet mechanisms have transformed the understanding and design of stochastic molecular systems&#8212;biological, chemical and physical&#8212;in a move away from the mechanical macroscopic analogies that dominated thinking regarding molecular dynamics in the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g. pistons, springs, etc), to the more scale&#8208;relevant concepts that underpin out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium research in the molecular sciences today. Ratcheting has established molecular nanotechnology as a research frontier for energy transduction and metabolism, and has enabled the reverse engineering of biomolecular machinery, delivering insights into how molecules &#8216;walk&#8217; and track&#8208;based synthesisers operate, how the acceleration of chemical reactions enables energy to be transduced by catalysts (both motor proteins and synthetic catalysts), and how dynamic systems can be driven away from equilibrium through catalysis. The recognition of molecular ratchet mechanisms in biology, and their invention in synthetic systems, is proving significant in areas as diverse as supramolecular chemistry, systems chemistry, dynamic covalent chemistry, DNA nanotechnology, polymer and materials science, molecular biology, heterogeneous catalysis, endergonic synthesis, the origin of life, and many other branches of chemical science. Put simply, ratchet mechanisms give chemistry direction. Kinetic asymmetry, the key feature of ratcheting, is the dynamic counterpart of structural asymmetry (i.e. chirality). Given the ubiquity of ratchet mechanisms in endergonic chemical processes in biology, and their significance for behaviour and function from systems to synthesis, it is surely just as fundamentally important. This Review charts the recognition, invention and development of molecular ratchets, focussing particularly on the role for which they were originally envisaged in chemistry, as design elements for molecular machinery. Different kinetically asymmetric systems are compared, and the consequences of their dynamic behaviour discussed. These archetypal examples demonstrate how chemical systems can be driven inexorably away from equilibrium, rather than relax towards it.

         <title>Rational Design of Local Reaction Environment for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 into Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond engineering the catalyst, rational design of the local reaction environment near the catalyst surface, including local pH, the choice of the species of cations and anions as well as local reactant/intermediate concentrations, also acts as an effective approach for further improving the catalytic performance of CO2 reduction to valuable multicarbon products.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products provides an attractive route for storing intermittent renewable electricity as fuels and feedstocks with high energy densities. Although substantial progress has been made in selective electrosynthesis of C2+ products via engineering the catalyst, rational design of the local reaction environment in the vicinity of catalyst surface also acts as an effective approach for further enhancing the performance. Here, we discuss recent advances and pertinent challenges in the modulation of local reaction environment, encompassing local pH, the choice of the species and concentrations of cations and anions as well as local reactant/intermediate concentrations, for achieving high C2+ selectivity. In addition, mechanistic understanding in the effects of the local reaction environment is also discussed. Particularly, the important progress extracted from in situ and operando spectroscopy techniques provides insights into how local reaction environment affects C&#8722;C coupling and key intermediates formation that lead to reaction pathways toward a desired C2+ product. The possible future direction in understanding and engineering the local reaction environment is also provided.

         <title>Photoinduced Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H Phosphonylation of Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective phosphonylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bond distal to the amide group was achieved at room temperature under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, photocatalyzed conditions.







Abstract
The present study reports an unprecedented protocol for the phosphonylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. By utilizing 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% 4DPAIPN (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(diphenylamino)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) as the catalyst, satisfactory yields of &#947;&#8208;phosphonylated amides are obtained through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reaction between N&#8208;((4&#8208;cyanobenzoyl)oxy)alkanamides and 9&#8208;fluorenyl o&#8208;phenylene phosphite at room temperature. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility.

         <title>Structure Revision of a Widespread Marine Sulfonolipid Class Based on Isolation and Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planar structure of a newly reported group of bacterial sulfur&#8208;containing aminolipids was revised and their absolute configuration determined by a combination of analytical techniques, isolation, degradation experiments, and total synthesis. The revised structures, termed cysteinolides, diverge from previous homotaurine&#8208;based proposals, revealing a composition of a cysteinolic acid containing head group acylated with various (&#945;&#8208;hydroxy)carboxylic acids.







Abstract
The cosmopolitan marine Roseobacter clade is of global biogeochemical importance. Members of this clade produce sulfur&#8208;containing amino lipids (SALs) involved in biofilm formation and marine surface colonization processes. Despite their physiological relevance and abundance, SALs have only been explored through genomic mining approaches and lipidomic studies based on mass spectrometry, which left the relative and absolute structures of SALs unresolved, hindering progress in biochemical and functional investigations. Herein, we report the structural revision of a new group of SALs, which we named cysteinolides, using a combination of analytical techniques, isolation and degradation experiments and total synthetic efforts. Contrary to the previously proposed homotaurine&#8208;based structures, cysteinolides are composed of an N,O&#8208;acylated cysteinolic acid&#8208;containing head group carrying various different (&#945;&#8208;hydroxy)carboxylic acids. We also performed the first validated targeted&#8208;network based analysis, which allowed us to map the distribution and structural diversity of cysteinolides across bacterial lineages. Beyond offering structural insight, our research provides SAL standards and validated analytical data. This information holds significance for forthcoming investigations into bacterial sulfonolipid metabolism and biogeochemical nutrient cycling within marine environments.

         <title>Diversified Synthesis of Chiral Fluorinated Cyclobutane Derivatives Enabled by Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric hydroboration of cyclobutenes using Rh catalysis is reported, providing gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Upon in situ B,F&#8208;elimination (Pd is required for R=aryl), monofluorinated cyclobutenes are obtained through formal hydrodefluorination. Versatile downstream transformations make this method a platform for the diversified synthesis of chiral fluorinated cyclobutanes.







Abstract
The diversified synthesis of chiral fluorinated cyclobutane derivatives has remained a difficult task in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present an approach for asymmetric hydroboration and formal hydrodefluorination of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclobutenes through rhodium catalysis, providing chiral gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes and monofluorinated cyclobutenes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, respectively. The key to the success of the two transformations relies on an efficient, mild and highly selective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration with HBPin (pinacolborane), in which the subsequent addition of a base, and a catalytic amount of palladium in some cases, results in the formation of formal hydrodefluorination products with the four&#8208;membered ring retained. The obtained chiral gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes are versatile building blocks that provide a platform for the synthesis of enantioenriched fluorinated cyclobutane derivatives to a great diversity.

         <title>Catalytic Access to Diastereometrically Pure Four&#8208; and Five&#8208;Membered Silyl&#8208;Heterocycles Using Transborylation</title>

         <dc:description>
Silyl&#8208;heterocycles offer a unique handle to expand and explore chemical space, reactivity, and functionality. These are limited by the lack of catalytic methods for the preparation of diverse and functionalized silyl&#8208;heterocycles. Herein the borane&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 1,1&#8208;carboboration of silyl&#8208;alkynes has been developed for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrosilolyl and silylcyclobut&#8208;2&#8208;enyl boronic esters.







Abstract
Silyl&#8208;heterocycles offer a unique handle to expand and explore chemical space, reactivity, and functionality. The shortage of catalytic methods for the preparation of diverse and functionalized silyl&#8208;heterocycles however limits widespread exploration and exploitation. Herein the borane&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 1,1&#8208;carboboration of silyl&#8208;alkynes has been developed for the synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrosilolyl and silylcyclobut&#8208;2&#8208;enyl boronic esters. Successful, catalytic carboboration has been achieved on a variety of functionally diverse silyl&#8208;alkynes, using a borane catalyst and transborylation&#8208;enabled turnover. Mechanistic studies, including 13C&#8208;labelling, computational studies, and single&#8208;turnover experiments, suggest a reaction pathway proceeding by 1,2&#8208;hydroboration, 1,1&#8208;carboboration, and transborylation to release the alkenyl boronic ester product and regenerate the borane catalyst.

         <title>Enantioselective Tsuji&#8208;Trost &#945;&#8208;Fluoroallylation of Amino Acid Esters with Gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust palladium/nickel/chiral aldehyde synergistic relay system was developed for the enantioselective ring&#8208;opening functionalization of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes with N&#8208;unprotected amino acid esters, enabling the efficient assembly of &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters bearing a linear 2&#8208;fluoroallylic motif in a highly enantioselective manner.







Abstract
A novel enantioselective Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type cross coupling reaction between gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes and N&#8208;unprotected amino acid esters enabled by synergistic Pd/Ni/chiral aldehyde catalysis is presented herein. This transformation streamlined the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS) of optically active &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters bearing a linear 2&#8208;fluoroallylic motif, which served as an appealing platform for the construction of other valuable enantioenriched compounds. The key intermediates were confirmed by HRMS detection, while DFT calculations revealed that the excellent enantioselectivity was attributed to the stabilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions between the Pd(II)&#8208;&#960;&#8208;fluoroallyl species and the Ni(II)&#8208;Schiff base complex.

         <title>Hydrogen Source Tuned Regiodivergent Asymmetric Hydroalkylations of 2&#8208;Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes with Aldehydes by Cobalt&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic methods to access different regio&#8208; and enantiomers by switching the least reaction parameters are attractive yet challenging. Herein, a Co&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective reductive hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes have been achieved, allowing for regio&#8208;switchable 1,2&#8208;hydroalkylation and 4,3&#8208;hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes to furnish different homoallylic alcohol architectures from identical starting materials.







Abstract
Catalytic methods allowing for the reliable prediction and control of diverse regioselectivity along with the control of enantioselectivity to access different regio&#8208; and enantiomers by switching the least reaction parameters are one of the most attractive ways in organic synthesis, which provide access to diverse enantioenriched architectures from identical starting materials. Herein, a Co&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective reductive hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes has been achieved, furnishing different enantioenriched homoallylic alcohol architectures in good levels of enantioselectivity. The reaction features the switch of regioselectivity tuned by the selection of proton source. The use of an acid as proton source provided asymmetric 1,2&#8208;hydroalkylation products under reductive conditions, yet asymmetric 4,3&#8208;hydroalkylation products were obtained with silane as hydride source. This catalytic protocol allows for the access of homoallylic alcohols with two continuous saturated carbon centers in good levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Supertwisted Chiral Gyroid Mesophase in Chiral Rod&#8208;Like Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecules that cannot self&#8208;assemble in either layers or cylinders often form complex in&#8208;between &#8220;bicontinuous&#8221; structures made up of interpenetrating networks. The most widespread is the achiral &#8220;gyroid&#8221; phase, containing two antichiral networks. Here it is shown that the introduction of an asymmetric unit into the rod&#8208;like molecular core can rewind the segments of one of the nets, &#8220;supertwisting&#8221; them in reverse and making the famous gyroid chiral.







Abstract
Among the intriguing bicontinuous self&#8208;assembled structures, the gyroid cubic is the most ubiquitous. It is found in block and star polymers, surfactants with or without solvent, in thermotropic liquid crystals with end&#8208; or side&#8208;chains, and in biosystems providing structural color and modelling cell mitosis. It contains two interpenetrating networks of opposite chirality and is thus achiral if, as usual, the content of the two nets is the same. However, we now find that this is not the case for strongly chiral compounds. While achiral molecules follow the opposite twists of nets 1 and 2, molecules with a chiral center in their rod&#8208;like core fail to follow the 70&#176; twist between junctions in net 2 and instead wind against it by &#8722;110&#176; to still match the junction orientation. The metastable chiral gyroid is a high&#8208;entropy high&#8208;heat&#8208;capacity mesophase. The homochirality of its nets makes the CD signal of the thienofluorenone compounds close to that in the stable I23 phase with 3&#8197;isochiral nets.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectric Fibers from Metal&#8208;Backboned Polymers for Body&#8208;Temperature Wearable Power Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nickel&#8208;backboned polymer/carbon nanotube thermoelectric composite fiber is fabricated through a shear&#8208;induced orientation method. It shows simultaneous increases in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, with a power factor of 719.48&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 as high as 3.5&#8197;times of the bare carbon nanotube fiber, opening a new avenue for the development of metal&#8208;backboned polymers in power supply.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;backboned polymers (MBPs), with a unique backbone consisting of bonded metal atoms, are promising for optic, electric, magnetic, and thermoelectric fields. However, the application of MBP remains relatively understudied.

&lt;p&gt;A novel nickel-backboned polymer/carbon nanotube thermoelectric composite fiber is fabricated through a shear-induced orientation method. It shows simultaneous increases in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, with a power factor of 719.48&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; as high as 3.5&#8197;times of the bare carbon nanotube fiber, opening a new avenue for the development of metal-backboned polymers in power supply.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-backboned polymers (MBPs), with a unique backbone consisting of bonded metal atoms, are promising for optic, electric, magnetic, and thermoelectric fields. However, the application of MBP remains relatively understudied. Here, we develop a shear-induced orientation method to construct a flexible nickel-backboned polymer/carbon nanotube (NBP/CNT) thermoelectric composite fiber. It demonstrated a power factor of 719.48&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;&#8901;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is ca. 3.5&#8197;times as high as the bare CNT fiber. Remarkably, with the regulation of carrier mobility and carrier concentration of NBP, the composite fiber further showed simultaneous increases in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient in comparison to the bare CNT fiber. The NBP/CNT fiber can be integrated into fabrics to harvest thermal energy of human body to generate an output voltage of 3.09&#8197;mV at a temperature difference of 8&#8197;K.

         <title>Two&#8208;Orders&#8208;of&#8208;Magnitude Enhancement of Photoinitiation Activity via a Simple Surface Engineering of Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high cleavage probability of the surface S&#8722;C bonds in gold and silver nanoclusters and the structure&#8211;activity relations of the generated radicals are revealed through experiments and DFT calculations. Based on this understanding, we design several alkyl thiolated gold nanoclusters and achieve a two&#8208;to&#8208;three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of the photoinitiation activity.







Abstract
Development of high&#8208;performance photoinitiator is the key to enhance the printing speed, structure resolution and product quality in 3D laser printing. Here, to improve the printing efficiency of 3D laser nanoprinting, we investigate the underlying photochemistry of gold and silver nanocluster initiators under multiphoton laser excitation. Experimental results and DFT calculations reveal the high cleavage probability of the surface S&#8722;C bonds in gold and silver nanoclusters which generate multiple radicals. Based on this understanding, we design several alkyl&#8208;thiolated gold nanoclusters and achieve a more than two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of photoinitiation activity, as well as a significant improvement in printing resolution and fabrication window. Overall, this work for the first time unveils the detailed radical formation pathways of gold and silver nanoclusters under multiphoton activation and substantially improves their photoinitiation sensitivity via surface engineering, which pushes the limit of the printing efficiency of 3D laser lithography.

         <title>Benchmarking the Intrinsic Activity of Transition Metal Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction with Advanced Nanoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We innovatively adopted an electrodeposition&#8208;annealing method, synthesizing transition metal oxides (TMOs) single&#8208;particle nanoelectrode with well&#8208;defined structure and composition. Not only did we accurately measure their electrocatalytic activity, but we also specially designed a structure with a conductive core wrapped in a semiconductor (SEMI) shell, to support the actual evaluation of perovskite&#8208;type SEMI catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).







Abstract
The intrinsic activity assessment of transition metal oxides (TMOs) as key electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has not been standardized due to uncertainties regarding their structure and composition, difficulties in accurately measuring their electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and deficiencies in mass&#8208;transfer (MT) rates in conventional measurements. To address these issues, we utilized an electrodeposition&#8208;thermal annealing method to precisely synthesize single&#8208;particle TMOs with well&#8208;defined structure and composition. Concurrently, we engineered low roughness, spherical surfaces for individual particles, enabling precise measurement of their ECSA. Furthermore, by constructing a conductor&#8208;core semiconductor&#8208;shell structure, we evaluated the inherent OER activity of perovskite&#8208;type semiconductor materials, broadening the scope beyond just conductive TMOs. Finally, using single&#8208;particle nanoelectrode technique, we systematically measured individual TMO particles of various sizes for OER, overcoming MT limitations seen in conventional approaches. These improvements have led us to propose a precise and reliable approach to evaluating the intrinsic activity of TMOs, not only validating the accuracy of theoretical calculations but also revealing a strong correlation of OER activity on the melting point of TMOs. This discovery holds significant importance for future high&#8208;throughput material research and applications, offering valuable insights in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Micro&#8208;Architected Copper based on an Ion&#8208;Exchangeable Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and straightforward strategy has been developed to create intricate and dense micro&#8208;architected copper structures using an ion&#8208;exchangeable hydrogel. The resulting copper geometries showcase a minimum feature size of around 40&#8197;&#956;m, coupled with a notable twin density, electrical conductivity, and hardness. This methodology presents an effective pathway for the fabrication of micro&#8208;architected 3D metal structures.







Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) of copper through laser&#8208;based processes poses challenges, primarily attributed to the high thermal conductivity and low laser absorptivity of copper powder or wire as the feedstock. Although the use of copper salts in vat photopolymerization&#8208;based AM techniques has garnered recent attention, achieving micro&#8208;architected copper with high conductivity and density has remained elusive. In this study, we present a facile and efficient process to create complex 3D micro&#8208;architected copper structures with superior electrical conductivity and hardness. The process entails the formulation of an ion&#8208;exchangeable photoresin, followed by the utilization of digital light processing (DLP) printing to sculpt 3D hydrogel scaffolds, which were transformed into Cu2+&#8208;chelated polymer frameworks (Cu&#8208;CPFs) with a high loading of Cu2+ ions through ion exchange, followed by debinding and sintering, results in the transformation of Cu&#8208;CPFs into miniaturized copper architectures. This methodology represents an efficient pathway for the creation of intricate micro&#8208;architected 3D metal structures.

         <title>One&#8208;step Synthesis of Organic Terminal 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene Nanosheets by Etching of Ti3AlC2 in an Organic Lewis Acid Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High purity Ti3C2Tx (T=&#8722;CF3SO3) nanosheets were directly obtained via an etching route using an organic Lewis acid solvent that was completely free of HF. The obtained Ti3C2Tx terminated with &#8722;CF3SO3 had large nanosheets with an average size of approximately 4&#8197;&#956;m, the largest size reached 15&#8197;&#956;m, and the CF3SO3&#8722; surface chemistry could generally improve the stability of the suspension.







Abstract
The surface and interface chemistry are critical for controlling the properties of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes). Numerous efforts have been devoted to the functionalization of MXenes with small inorganic ligands; however, few etching methods have been reported on the direct bonding of organic groups to MXene surfaces. In this work, we demonstrated an efficient and rapid strategy for the direct synthesis of 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with organic terminal groups in an organic Lewis acid (trifluoromethanesulfonic acid) solvent, without introducing additional intercalations. The dissolution of aluminum and the subsequent in situ introduction of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid resulted in the extraction of Ti3C2Tx MXene (T=CF3SO3&#8722;) (denoted as CF3SO3H&#8722;Ti3C2Tx) flakes with sizes reaching 15&#8197;&#956;m and high productivity (over 70&#8201;%) of monolayers or few layers. More importantly, the large CF3SO3H&#8722;Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets had high colloidal stability, making them promising as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Bayesian Inference for Model Analyses of Supramolecular Complexes: A Case Study with Nanocarbon Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 23, June 3, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large bowl&#8208;shaped nanocarbon molecule with 126&#8197;&#960; electrons was synthesized, and a ball&#8208;in&#8208;bowl complex was obtained by capturing C70 at the concave site. A method for elucidating the stoichiometries in solution&#8208;phase equilibria was devised by developing a procedure to estimate the Occam factors for Bayesian inference.







Abstract
A 126&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron nanobowl molecule, phenine tridehydrosumanene, was synthesized in 12&#8197;steps through the development of a polygon cyclization strategy that assembled the polygonal precursors by Ni&#8208;mediated macrocyclization. The bowl&#8208;shaped structure accommodated C70 as a guest at the concave site, and the ball&#8208;in&#8208;bowl structure was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The host&#8211;guest equilibrium in solution was studied with titration experiments using isothermal calorimetry, which provided an interesting test case for studying the host&#8211;guest stoichiometry. Bayesian inference was introduced for stoichiometric analyses of the equilibrium, and a procedure to estimate the volume of prior probability in the parameter space was developed. The Bayesian procedure functioned as Occam's razor and provided quantitative support for a specific stoichiometry. The method was examined with five host&#8211;guest examples comprising nanocarbon hosts, which suggested the versatility of Bayesian inference for studies of supramolecular complexes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has gained significant attention in drug discovery due to their potential to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Here, we present a mild and scalable Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with ynamides, yielding a diverse array of polysubstituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes in good to excellent yields. These products offer valuable starting materials for the construction of novel functionalized bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves a nucleophilic addition of ynamides to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, followed by an intramolecular cyclization of in situ generated enolate and keteniminium ion. We expect that these findings will encourage utilization of complex bioisosteres and foster further investigation into BCB&#8208;based cycloaddition chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Management of Triplet States in Modified Mononuclear Ruthenium(II) Complexes for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the interplay between relaxation and charge/energy transfer processes in the excited states of photocatalysts is crucial for the performance of artificial photosynthesis. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer triplet states (3MLCT*) of ruthenium(II) complexes are broadly implemented for photocatalysis, but an effective means of managing the triplets for enhanced photocatalysis has been lacking. Herein, We proposed a strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime by decorating a ruthenium(II) phosphine complex (RuP&#8208;1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Systematic studies demonstrate that in RuP&#8208;4 decorated with anthracene, sub&#8208;picosecond electron transfer from anthracene to 3MLCT* leads to a charge&#8208;separated state that can mediate the formation of the intra&#8208;ligand triplet state (3IL) of anthracene, resulting in an exceptionally long excited&#8208;state up to several milliseconds. This triplet management strategy enables impressive photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO with a turnover number (TON) of 404, an optimized quantum yield of 43% and 100% selectivity, which is the highest reported performance for mononuclear photocatalysts without additional photosensitizers. RuP&#8208;4 also catalyzes photochemical hydrogen generation under argon. This work opens up an avenue for regulating the excited&#8208;state charge/energy flow for the development of long&#8208;lived 3IL multi&#8208;functional mononuclear photocatalysts to boost artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Light&#8208;powered single&#8208;stranded DNA molecular motor with colour&#8208;selective single&#8208;step control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To&#8208;down control of small motion is possible through top&#8208;down controlled molecular motors in replacement of larger actuators like MEMS or NEMS (micro&#8208; or nano&#8208;electromechanical systems) in the current precision technology. Improving top&#8208;down control of molecular motors to every single step is desirable for this purpose, and also for synchronization of motor actions for amplified effects. Here we report a designed single&#8208;stranded DNA molecular motor powered by alternated ultraviolet and visible light for processive track&#8208;walking, with the two light colours each locking the motor in a full directional step to allow saturated driving but no overstepping. This novel nano&#8208;optomechanical driving mechanism pushes the top&#8208;down control of molecular motors down to every single step, thus providing a key technical capability to advance the molecular motor&#8208;based precision technology and also motor synchronization for amplified effects.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organophosphorescence Probe with Ultralong Lifetime and Intrinsic Tissue Selectivity for Specific Tumor Imaging and Guided Tumor Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic phosphorescent materials are excellent candidates for use in tumor imaging. However, a systematic comparison of the effects of the intensity, lifetime, and wavelength of phosphorescent emissions on bioimaging performance has not yet been undertaken. This study addresses these gaps and reveals that longer lifetimes effectively increase the signal intensity, whereas longer wavelengths enhance the penetration depth. Conversely, a strong emission intensity with a short lifetime does not necessarily yield robust imaging signals. Building upon these findings, an organo&#8208;phosphorescent material with a lifetime of 0.94 s was designed for tumor imaging. Remarkably, the phosphorescent signals of various organic nanoparticles are nearly extinguished in blood&#8208;rich organs because of the quenching effect of iron ions. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that iron ions universally quench the phosphorescence of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials, which is an inherent property of such substances. Leveraging this property, both the normal liver and hepatitis tissues exhibit negligible phosphorescent signals, whereas liver tumors display intense phosphorescence. Therefore, phosphorescent materials, unlike chemiluminescent or fluorescent materials, can exploit this unique inherent property to selectively distinguish liver tumor tissues from normal tissues without additional modifications or treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>[2.2]Benzoindenophane&#8208;Based Chiral Indenyl Ligands: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Asymmetric C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of chiral indenyl ligands for asymmetric C&#8211;H activation is a longstanding challenge, and extremely few successes have been achieved. In this paper, we describe a class of readily accessible, facilely tunable and user&#8208;friendly chiral indenyl ligands featuring a [2.2]benzoindenophane skeleton via a divergent synthesis strategy. The corresponding chiral indenyl rhodium catalysts were successfully applied in the asymmetric C&#8211;H activation reaction of O&#8208;Boc hydroxybenzamide with alkenes to give various chiral dihydroisoquinolone products (up to 97% yield, up to 98% ee). Moreover, the asymmetric C&#8211;H activation reaction of carboxylic acids with alkynes was also successfully accomplished, providing a range of axially chiral isocoumarins (up to 99% yield, up to 94% ee). Notably, this represents the first example of enantioselective transition metal catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H activation/oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with internal alkynes to construct isocoumarins. Given many attractive features of this class of indenyl ligands, such as convenient synthesis, high tunability and exclusive face&#8208;selectivity of coordination, its applications in more catalytic asymmetric C&#8211;H activation and in other asymmetric catalysis are foreseen.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity and Steric Parameters from 2D to 3D Bulky Pyridines : Increasing Steric Demand at Nitrogen with Chiral Azatriptycenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sterically hindered pyridines embedded in a three&#8208;dimensional triptycene framework have been synthesized, and their resolution by chiral HPLC enabled access to unprecedented enantiopure pyridines exceeding the known steric limits. The design principles for new axially chiral pyridine derivatives are then described. To rationalize their associations with Lewis acids and transition metals, a comprehensive determination of the steric and electronic parameters for this new class of pyridines was performed. This led to the general parameterization of the steric parameters (percent buried volume %VBur, Tolman cone angle &#952;, and He8_steric descriptor) for a large set of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional pyridine derivatives. These parameters are shown to describe quantitatively their interactions with carbon&#8208; and boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids and were used to predict the &#916;G&#176; of association with the prototypical B(C6F5)3 Lewis acid widely used in frustrated Lewis pair catalysis. This first parameterization of pyridine sterics is a fundamental basis for the future development of predictive reactivity models and for guiding new applications of bulky and chiral pyridines in organocatalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs, and transition&#8208;metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Locked Fluorescent Probes Activated by Aminopeptidase N and the Tumor Redox Environment for High&#8208;Precision Imaging of Tumor Boundaries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clear delineation of tumor margins is essential for accurate resection and decreased recurrence rate in the clinic. Fluorescence imaging is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional visual inspection by surgeons for intraoperative imaging. However, traditional probes lack accuracy in tumor diagnosis, making it difficult to depict tumor boundaries accurately. Herein, we proposed an offensive and defensive integration (ODI) strategy based on the &#8220;attack systems (invasive peptidase) and defense systems (reductive microenvironment)&#8221; of multi&#8208;dimensional tumor characteristics to design activatable fluorescent probes for imaging tumor boundaries precisely. Screened out from a series of ODI strategy&#8208;based probes, ANQ performed better than traditional probes based on tumor unilateral correlation by distinguishing between tumor cells and normal cells and minimizing false&#8208;positive signals from living metabolic organs. To further improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio in vivo, derivatized FANQ, was prepared and successfully applied to distinguish orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from adjacent tissues in mice models and clinical samples. This work highlights an innovative strategy to develop activatable probes for rapid diagnosis of tumors and high&#8208;precision imaging of tumor boundaries, providing more efficient tools for future clinical applications in intraoperative assisted resection.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Mechanistic Depiction of Photoinduced CO2 Reduction Catalysis on a Urea&#8208;Modified Iron Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of functional artificial photosynthetic devices relies on the understanding of mechanistic aspects involved in specialized photocatalysts. Modified iron porphyrins have long been explored as efficient catalysts for the light&#8208;induced reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) towards solar fuels. In spite of the advancements in homogeneous catalysis, the development of the next generation of catalysts requires a complete understanding of the fundamental photoinduced processes taking place prior to and after activation of the substrate by the catalyst. In this work, we employ a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanosecond optical transient absorption spectroscopic setup with a double excitation capability to induce charge accumulation and trigger the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO). Our biomimetic system is composed of a urea&#8208;modified iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin (UrFeIII) catalyst, the prototypical [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) used as a photosensitizer, and sodium ascorbate as an electron donor. Under inert atmosphere, we show that two electrons can be successively accumulated on the catalyst as the fates of the photogenerated UrFeII and UrFeI reduced species are tracked. In the presence of CO2, the catalytic cycle is kick&#8208;started providing further evidence on CO2 activation by the UrFe catalyst in its formal FeI oxidation state.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ammonia (NH3) is industrially produced from dinitrogen (N2) and dihydrogen (H2) by the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, although H2&#160;is prepared from fossil fuels, and the reaction requires harsh conditions.&#160;&#160;On the other hand, microorganisms have fixed nitrogen under ambient reaction conditions.&#160;&#160;Recently, well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalyst to convert N2&#160;into NH3&#160;by reactions with chemical reductants and proton sources under ambient reaction conditions.&#160;&#160;Among them, involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer is found to be very effective for high catalytic activity.&#160;&#160;Furthermore, direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conversions of N2&#160;into NH3&#160;have been recently achieved.&#160;&#160;In addition to catalytic formation of NH3, selective catalytic conversion of N2&#160;into hydrazine (NH2NH2) and catalytic silylation of N2&#160;into silylamines have been reported.&#160;&#160;Catalytic C&#8211;N bond formation has been more recently established to afford cyanate anion (NCO&#8211;) under ambient reaction conditions.&#160;&#160;Further development of direct conversion of N2&#160;into nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds as well as&#160;green ammonia synthesis leading to the use of ammonia as an energy carrier is expected.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Low&#8208;Valent Zirconium Catalysis for Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accessing versatile C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bond through cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two distinct etheric C&#8208;O bonds is crucial in organic synthesis but remains barely explored. Herein, we report an innovative photoinduced low&#8208;valent zirconocene catalysis enabling the reductive coupling of ethers with high activity and cross&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic investigation suggests that photo&#8208;excitation of low&#8208;valent zirconocene facilitates the C(sp3)&#8208;O bond scission of benzylic ethers, leading to the benzylic radical intermediate via a single electron reduction pathway. The subsequent recombination of this benzylic radical to Zr center followed by carbomagnesiation generates benzylic Grignard reagents for down&#8208;stream coupling with aliphatic ethers through a SN2&#8208;like mechanism. In application, a wide range of ethers readily in&#8208;situ derived from aldehydes and ketones becomes feasible with high functional group compatibility as well as excellent cross&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Design for Discrete Sulfur@Polymer Nanoreactor with Tandem Connection as Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Apart from electrode material modification, architecture design and optimization are important approaches for improving lithium&#8211;sulfur battery performance. Herein, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining nanosulfur (NS) in conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete independent nanoreactor units bonded onto carbon nanotubes (noted as CNT/NS@PEDOT). The unique spatial confinement and concentration gradients of sulfur@PEDOT nanoreactors (SP&#8208;NRs) can promote reaction kinetics while facilitating rapid polysulfide transformation and minimizing dissolution and diffusion losses. Meanwhile, overall ultrahigh energy input and output are achieved through tandem connection with carbon nanotubes, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs. As a result, it delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1246 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and 918 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, the low capacity decay rate per lap of 0.011% is achieved at a current density of 1 C after 1000 cycles. This research emphasizes the innovative structural design to provide a fresh trajectory for the further advancement of high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Single Particle Anisotropy in Real&#8208;Time for Photoelectrochemistry Processes at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The key to rationally and rapidly designing high&#8208;performance materials is the monitoring and comprehension of dynamic processes within individual particles in real&#8208;time, particularly to gain insight into the anisotropy of nanoparticles. The intrinsic property of nanoparticles typically varies from one crystal facet to the next under realistic working conditions. Here, we introduce the operando collision electrochemistry to resolve the single silver nanoprisms (Ag NPs) anisotropy in photoelectrochemistry. We directly identify the effect of anisotropy on the plasmonic&#8208;assisted electrochemistry at the single NP/electrolyte interface. The statistical collision frequency shows that heterogeneous diffusion coefficient among crystal facets facilitates Ag NPs to undergo direction&#8208;dependent mass transfer toward the gold ultramicroelectrode. Subsequently, the current amplitudes of transient events indicate that anisotropy enables variations in dynamic interfacial electron transfer behaviors during photothermal processes. The results presented here demonstrate that the measurement precision of collision electrochemistry can be extended to the sub&#8208;nanoparticle level, highlighting the potential for high&#8208;throughput material screening with comprehensive kinetics information at the nanoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolable T&#8208;Shaped Planar Silyl Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silyl anions have garnered significant attention due to their synthetic abilities. However, previously reported silyl anions have been limited to either trigonal&#8208;pyramidal or trigonal&#8208;planar geometries, which confine them primarily as nucleophiles in substitution reactions. Herein, we report the isolation of the unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt 2 by employment of a geometrically constrained triamido pincer ligand. Theoretical calculations disclosed that the silicon centre in 2 possesses both a lone pair of electrons and an empty 3pz orbital. In addition to nucleophilic substitution reactions with Ph3PAuCl and W(CO)6, 2 readily undergoes oxidative additions with CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylisonitrile at room temperature. Furthermore, under mild conditions, compound 2 cleaves Csp2&#8722;H, Csp3&#8722;H, and H&#8722;H bonds in 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene, an intramolecular iPr group, and dihydrogen, representing the first examples of C&#8211;H and H&#8211;H activations mediated by a silyl anion, respectively. This work unveils new reactivity of silyl anions owing to the non&#8208;classical geometry and electronic structure.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are an attractive electrochemical energy storage solution for their budget and safe properties. However, dendrites and uncontrolled side reactions in anodes detract the cycle life and energy density of the batteries.Grain boundaries in metals are generally considered as the source of the above problems but we present a diverse result. This study introduces an ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries on zinc electrodes through femtosecond laser bombardment to enhance stability of zinc metal/electrolyte interface.The ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries promotes the homogenization of zinc growth potential, to achieve uniform nucleation and growth, thereby suppressing dendrite formation. Additionally, the abundant active sites mitigate the side reactions during the electrochemical process. Consequently, the 15&#8208;&#956;m&#8208;Fs&#8208;Zn||MnO2 pouch cell achieves an energy density of 249.4 Wh kg&#8211;1 and &#160;operates for over 60 cycles at a depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge of 23%. The recognition of the favorable influence exerted by UP&#8208;GBs paves a new way for other metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphonoalamides Reveal the Biosynthetic Origin of Phosphonoalanine Natural Products and a Convergent Pathway for Their Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonate natural products, with their potent inhibitory activity, have found widespread use across multiple industries. Their success has inspired development of genome mining approaches that continue to reveal previously unknown bioactive scaffolds and biosynthetic insights. However, a greater understanding of phosphonate metabolism is required to enable prediction of compounds and their bioactivities from sequence information alone.&#160; Here, we expand our knowledge of this natural product class by reporting the complete biosynthesis of the phosphonoalamides, antimicrobial tripeptides with a conserved N&#8208;terminal l&#8208;phosphonoalanine (PnAla) residue produced by Streptomyces. The phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of PnAla biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. We elucidate the biochemistry underlying the transamination of phosphonopyruvate to PnAla, a new early branchpoint in phosphonate biosynthesis catalyzed by an aminotransferase with evolved specificity for phosphonate metabolism. Peptide formation is catalyzed by two ATP&#8208;grasp ligases, the first of which produces dipeptides, and a second which ligates dipeptides to PnAla to produce phosphonoalamides. Substrate specificity profiling revealed a dramatic expansion of dipeptide and tripeptide products, while finding PnaC to be the most promiscuous dipeptide ligase reported thus far. Our findings highlight previously unknown transformations in natural product biosynthesis, promising enzyme biocatalysts, and unveil insights into the diversity of phosphonopeptide natural products.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) materials hold promise for circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diode (CP&#8208;OLED) and 3D display. Herein, we present two pairs of tetraborated intrinsically axial CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF materials, R/S&#8208;BDBF&#8208;BOH and R/S&#8208;BDBT&#8208;BOH, with conjugation&#8208;extended bidibenzo[b,d]furan and bidibenzo[b,d]thiophene as chiral sources, which effectively participate in the distribution of frontier molecular orbitals. Due to the heavy&#8208;atom effect, sulfur atoms are introduced to accelerate the reverse intersystem crossing process and increase efficiency of molecules. R/S&#8208;BDBF&#8208;BOH and R/S&#8208;BDBT&#8208;BOH manifest ultra&#8208;pure blue emission peaking at 458/459 nm with full width at half maximum of 27 nm (0.16 eV), photoluminescence quantum yields of 90%/91% and dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) of 6.8 &#215; 10&#8208;4/8.5 &#215; 10&#8208;4, respectively. Correspondingly, the CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibit good performances with external quantum efficiency of 30.1% and |gEL| factors of 1.2 &#215; 10&#8208;3.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Engineering of Myoglobin by Cofactor Substitution to Enhance Cyclopropanation Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of metal cofactor ligands is essential for controlling the reactivity of metalloenzymes. We investigated a carbene transfer reaction catalyzed by myoglobins containing iron porphyrin cofactors with one and two trifluoromethyl groups at peripheral sites (FePorCF3&#160;and FePor(CF3)2, respectively), native heme and iron porphycene (FePc). These four myoglobins show a wide range of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox potentials in the protein of +147 mV, +87 mV, +42 mV and &#8211;198 mV vs NHE, respectively. Myoglobin reconstituted with&#160;FePor(CF3)2&#160;has a more positive potential which enhances the reactivity of a carbene intermediate with alkenes and demonstrates superior cyclopropanation of inert alkenes such as aliphatic and internal alkenes. In contrast, engineered myoglobin reconstituted with FePc has a more negative redox potential, which accelerates the formation of the intermediate but has low reactivity for inert alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that myoglobin with&#160;FePor(CF3)2&#160;generates an undetectable active intermediate with a radical character. In contrast, this reaction catalyzed by myoglobin with FePc includes a detectable iron&#8211;carbene species with electrophilic character. This finding highlights the importance of redox&#8208;focused design of the iron porphyrinoid cofactor in hemoproteins to tune the reactivity of the carbene transfer reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Intertwining Factors Underlying the Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two closely related yet distinctly different cationic clusters,&#160;[Dy52Ni44(HEIDA)36(OH)138(OAc)24(H2O)30]10+&#160;(1) and [Dy112Ni76(HEIDA)44(EIDA)24(IDA)4(OH)268(OAc)48(H2O)44]4+&#160;(2)&#160;(HEIDA = N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetate), each featuring a multi&#8208;shell core of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained. Depending on the specific conditions used for the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+&#160;and Ni2+, the product can be crystallized out as one particular type of cluster or as a mixture of 1&#160;and 2. How the reaction process was affected by the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base&#160;and/or&#160;by the reaction temperature and duration&#160;was investigated. It has been found that a reaction at a high temperature and/or for an extended period favors the formation of the compact and thermodynamically more stable 1, while a brief reaction with a large amount of the base is good to the kinetic product 2. By tuning these intertwining conditions, the reaction can be regulated toward a particular product.</dc:description>

         <title>Trigonal Planar [PN3]4&#8211; Anion in the Nitridophosphate Oxide Ba3[PN3]O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitridophosphates, with their primary structural motif of isolated or condensed PN4 tetrahedra, meet many requirements for high performance materials. Their properties are associated with their structural diversity, which is mainly limited by this specific building block. Herein, we present the alkaline earth metal nitridophosphate oxide Ba3[PN3]O featuring a trigonal planar [PN3]4&#8211; anion. Ba3[PN3]O was obtained using a hot isostatic press by medium&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis (MP/HT) at 200&#160;MPa and 880&#160;&#176;C. The crystal structure was solved and refined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data in space group R&#8208;3c (no.167) and confirmed by SEM&#8208;EDX, magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR, vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, IR) and low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations (LCC). MP/HT synthesis reveals great potential by extending the structural chemistry of P to include trigonal planar [PN3]4&#8211; motifs.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilizing &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon: Repositioning hydrogen&#8208;bonded synthons and assemblies via halogen bonding to &#960;&#8208;systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules bearing carboxylic acid, amide, and hydroxyl groups are ubiquitous in crystal engineering, where robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded synthons centred on these functionalities enable reliable crystal structure design. We now show that halogen bonding to the carbon &#960;&#8208;system of such molecules, traditionally ignored in crystal engineering, permits the recognition and directional assembly of the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded structural subunits, leaving the archetypal hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring, ladder, and chain homosynthons intact, but repositioned in space. When applied to heteromolecular synthons, this enables rearranging more complex hydrogen&#8208;bonded motifs and the evolution of binary cocrystals into ternary ones through &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon&#8208;based recognition sites, demonstrating a rational approach to build higher&#8208;order solid&#8208;state supramolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative 1,2&#8208;Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic olefin hydroamination reactions are some of the most atom&#8208;economical transformations that bridge readily available starting materials&#8211;olefins and high&#8208;value&#8208;added amines. Despite significant advances in this field over the last two decades, the formal hydroamination of nonactivated aromatic compounds remains an unsolved challenge. Herein, we report the extension of olefin hydroamination to aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems by using arenophile&#8208;mediated dearomatization and Cu&#8208;catalysis to perform 1,2&#8208;hydroamination on nonactivated arenes. This strategy was applied to a variety of substituted arenes and heteroarenes to provide general access to structurally complex amines. We conducted DFT calculations to inform mechanistic understanding and rationalize unexpected selectivity trends. Furthermore, we developed a practical, scalable desymmetrization to deliver enantioenriched dearomatized products and enable downstream synthetic applications. We ultimately used this dearomative strategy to efficiently synthesize a collection of densely functionalized small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase&#8208;Supported Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Analysis of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteoglycans (PGs), consisting of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked with the core protein through a tetrasaccharide linkage region, play roles in many important biological events. The chemical synthesis of PG glycopeptides is extremely challenging. In this work, the enzymes required for synthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS) PG (CSPG) have been expressed and the suitable sequence of enzymatic reactions has been established. To expedite CSPG synthesis, the peptide acceptor was immobilized on solid phase and the glycan units were directly installed enzymatically onto the peptide. Subsequent enzymatic chain elongation and sulfation led to the successful synthesis of CSPG glycopeptides. The CS dodecasaccharide glycopeptide was the longest homogeneous CS glycopeptide synthesized to date. The enzymatic synthesis was much more efficient than the chemical synthesis of the corresponding CS glycopeptides, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80%. The structures of the CS glycopeptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis and NMR studies. In addition, the interactions between the CS glycopeptides and cathepsin G were studied. The sulfation of glycan chain was found to be important for binding with cathepsin G. This efficient chemoenzymatic strategy opens new avenues to investigate the structures and functions of PGs.</dc:description>
