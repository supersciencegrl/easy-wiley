         <title>Interfacial Water Tuning by Intermolecular Spacing for Stable CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products is a promising approach for utilization of renewable energy, in which the interfacial water quantity is critical for both the C2+ product selectivity and the stability of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalytic sites. Functionalization of long&#8208;chain alkyl molecules on a catalyst surface can help to increase its stability, while it also tends to block the transport of water, thus inhibiting the C2+ product formation. Herein, we demonstrate the fine tuning of interfacial water by surface assembly of toluene on Cu nanosheets, allowing for sustained and enriched CO2 supply but retarded water transfer to catalytic surface. Compared to bare Cu with fast cathodic corrosion and long&#8208;chain alkyl&#8208;modified Cu with main CO product, the toluene assembly on Cu nanosheet surface enabled a high Faradaic efficiency of 78% for C2+ and a partial current density of 1.66 A&#183;cm&#8208;2. The toluene&#8208;modified Cu catalyst further exhibited highly stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion of 400 h in a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly electrolyzer, suggesting the attractive feature for both efficient C2+ selectivity and excellent stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Metallonitrene Formation by N2 Elimination from Azide Diradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond ultraviolet&#8208;pump/mid&#8208;infrared&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveals that singlet and triplet azide&#8208;anion diradical ligands facilitate the efficient formation of a metallonitrene from a diamagnetic azido precursor.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal nitrides/nitrenes are highly promising reagents for catalytic nitrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer reactivity. They are typically prepared in situ upon optically induced N2 elimination from azido precursors. A full exploitation of their catalytic potential, however, requires in&#8208;depth knowledge of the primary photo&#8208;induced processes and the structural/electronic factors mediating the N2 loss with birth of the terminal metal&#8208;nitrogen core. Using femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, we elucidate here the primary molecular&#8208;level mechanisms responsible for the formation of a unique platinum(II) nitrene with a triplet ground state from a closed&#8208;shell platinum(II) azide precursor. The spectroscopic data in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide compelling evidence that product formation requires the initial occupation of a singlet excited state with an anionic azide diradical ligand that is bound to a low&#8208;spin d8&#8208;configured PtII ion. Subsequent intersystem crossing generates the Pt&#8208;bound triplet azide diradical, which smoothly evolves into the triplet nitrene via N2 loss in a near barrierless adiabatic dissociation. Our data highlight the importance of the productive, N2&#8208;releasing state possessing azide &#960;&#960;* character as a design principle for accessing efficient N&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer catalysts.

         <title>Giant Mid&#8208;Infrared Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response in a Densely&#8208;Stacked Van Der Waals Transition&#8208;Metal Oxychloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;sole functional module&#8221; strategy that assembles dense structures comprising well&#8208;aligned nonlinear optical&#8208;efficient modules is proposed. This has led to the discovery of a densely&#8208;stacked van der Waals transition&#8208;metal oxychloride with a giant mid&#8208;infrared second&#8208;harmonic generation response.







Abstract
Second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental optical property of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. Thus far, it has proved difficult to engineer large SHG responses, particularly in the mid&#8208;infrared region, owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the arrangement and density of functional NLO&#8208;active units. Herein, a new assembly strategy employing functional modules only, and aimed at maximizing the density and optimizing the spatial arrangement of highly efficient functional modules, has been applied to the preparation of NLO crystals, affording the van der Waals crystal MoO2Cl2. This exhibits the strongest powder SHG response (2.1&#215;KTiOPO4 (KTP) @ 2100&#8197;nm) for a transition&#8208;metal oxyhalide, a wide optical transparency window, and a sufficient birefringence. MoO2Cl2 is the first SHG&#8208;active transition&#8208;metal oxyhalide effective in the infrared region. Theoretical studies and crystal structure analysis suggest that the densely packed, optimally&#8208;aligned [MoO4Cl2] modules within the two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals layers are responsible for the giant SHG response.

         <title>Trimethylsilyl Chloride Aids in Solubilization of Oxidative Addition Intermediates from Zinc Metal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) is commonly used to &#8220;activate&#8221; metal(0) powders toward oxidative addition of organohalides, but knowledge of its mechanism remains limited by the inability to characterize chemical intermediates under reaction conditions. Here, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) overcomes these prior limitations and shows that TMSCl aids in solubilization of the organozinc intermediate from zinc(0) metal after oxidative addition, a previously unknown mechanistic role. This mechanistic role is in contrast to previously known roles for TMSCl before the oxidative addition step. To achieve this understanding, FLIM, a tool traditionally used in biology, is developed to characterize intermediates during a chemical reaction&#8212;thus revealing mechanistic steps that are unobservable without fluorescence lifetime data. These findings impact organometallic reagent synthesis and catalysis by providing a previously uncharacterized mechanistic role for a widely used activating agent, an understanding of which is suitable for revising activation models and for developing strategies to activate currently unreactive metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing for the Detection of MicroRNAs:&#160;Towards Liquid Biopsy on a Chip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) testing is revolutionizing the healthcare sector improving patient care in daily hospital practice and allowing reaching even remote geographical areas. In the frame of cancer management, the design and validation of PoC enabling the non&#8208;invasive, rapid detection of cancer markers is urgently required to implement liquid biopsy in clinical practice. Therefore, focusing on stable blood&#8208;based markers with high&#8208;specificity, such as microRNAs, is of crucial importance. In this work, we highlight the potential impact of circulating microRNAs detection on cancer management and the development of PoC testing devices, especially for low&#8208;income countries. A detailed discussion about the challenges that should be faced to promote the technological transfer and clinical use of these tools has been added, to provide the readers with a complete overview of potentialities and current limitations.</dc:description>

         <title>Delocalized Isoelectronic Heterostructured FeCoOxSy Catalysts with Tunable Electron Density for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Li&#8208;S batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High interconversion energy barriers, depressive reaction kinetics of sulfur species, and sluggish Li+ transport inhibit the wide development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. Herein, differing from random mixture of selected catalysts, the composite catalyst with outer delocalized isoelectronic heterostructure (DIHC) is proposed and optimized, enhancing the catalytic efficiency for decreasing related energy barriers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;content, the FeCoOxSy composites with different degrees of sulfurization are fabricated by regulating atoms ratio between O and S. The relationship of catalytic efficiency and principal mechanism in DIHCs are deeply understood from electrochemical experiments to in&#8208;situ/operando spectral spectroscopies i.e., Raman, XRD and UV&#8208;Vis. Consequently, the polysulfide conversion and Li2S precipitation/dissolution experiments strongly demonstrate the volcano&#8208;like catalytic efficiency of various DIHCs. Furthermore, the FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell delivers the high performance (1413 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1). Under the low electrolyte/sulfur ratio, the high loading cell stabilizes the areal capacity of 6.67 mAh cm&#8208;2 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1. Impressively, even resting for about 17 days for possible polysulfide shuttling, the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell stabilizes the same capacity, showing the practical application of the DIHCs in improving catalytic efficiency and reaching high electrochemical performance.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High interconversion energy barriers, depressive reaction kinetics of sulfur species, and sluggish Li+ transport inhibit the wide development of high-energy-density lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, differing from random mixture of selected catalysts, the composite catalyst with outer delocalized isoelectronic heterostructure (DIHC) is proposed and optimized, enhancing the catalytic efficiency for decreasing related energy barriers. As a proof-of-content, the FeCoOxSy composites with different degrees of sulfurization are fabricated by regulating atoms ratio between O and S. The relationship of catalytic efficiency and principal mechanism in DIHCs are deeply understood from electrochemical experiments to in-situ/operando spectral spectroscopies i.e., Raman, XRD and UV-Vis. Consequently, the polysulfide conversion and Li2S precipitation/dissolution experiments strongly demonstrate the volcano-like catalytic efficiency of various DIHCs. Furthermore, the FeCoOxSy-decorated cell delivers the high performance (1413 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1). Under the low electrolyte/sulfur ratio, the high loading cell stabilizes the areal capacity of 6.67 mAh cm-2 at 0.2 A g-1. Impressively, even resting for about 17 days for possible polysulfide shuttling, the high-mass-loading FeCoOxSy-decorated cell stabilizes the same capacity, showing the practical application of the DIHCs in improving catalytic efficiency and reaching high electrochemical performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Detection of Unfolded Cellular Proteins Using Nanochannel Array with Probe&#8208;Functionalized Outer&#8208;Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanochannel technology has emerged as a powerful tool for label&#8208;free and highly sensitive detection of protein folding/unfolding status. However, utilizing the inner wall of nanochannel array may cause multiple events even for proteins with the same conformation, posing challenges for accurate identification. Herein, we present a platform to detect unfolded proteins through electrical and optical signals using nanochannel array with outer&#8208;surface probes. The detection principle relies on the specific binding between the maleimide groups in outer&#8208;surface probes and the protein cysteine thiols that induce changes in the ionic current and fluorescence intensity responses of the nanochannel array. By taking advantage of this mechanism, the platform has the ability to differentiate folded and unfolded state of proteins based on the exposure of a single cysteine thiol group. The integration of these two signals enhances the reliability and sensitivity of the identification of unfolded protein states and enables the distinction between normal cells and Huntington's disease mutant cells. This study provides an effective approach for the precise analysis of proteins with distinct conformations and holds promise for facilitating the diagnoses of protein conformation&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Linear and Cyclic Poly(diphenylacetylene)s by Molybdenum and Tungsten Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two improved methods for synthesis of poly(diphenylacetylene)s having functional groups have been developed. Molybdenum(V) catalysis with the MoCl5&#8208;PhSnnBu3 system provides linear poly(diphenylacetylene)s by migratory insertion polymerization while low&#8208;valent tungsten catalysis with the WCl4&#8208;Ph4Sn&#8208;PPh3 system provides cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s by ring expansion polymerization.







Abstract
Improved methods for the synthesis of linear and cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s by polymerization of the corresponding diphenylacetylenes using MoCl5&#8208; and WCl4&#8208;based catalytic systems have been developed. MoCl5 induces migratory insertion polymerization of diphenylacetylenes in the presence of arylation reagents such as Ph4Sn and ArSnnBu3 to produce cis&#8208;stereoregular linear poly(diphenylacetyelene)s with high molecular weights (number&#8208;average molar mass (Mn)=30,000&#8211;3,200,000) in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%). On the other hand, WCl4 induces ring expansion polymerization of diphenylacetylenes in the presence of Ph4Sn or reducing reagents to produce cis&#8208;stereoregular cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s with high molecular weights (Mn=20,000&#8211;250,000) in moderate to good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). Both catalytic systems are applicable to the polymerization of various diphenylacetylenes having polar functional groups such as esters that are not efficiently polymerized by conventional methods using WCl6&#8208;Ph4Sn and TaCl5&#8208;nBu4Sn systems.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Cation Solvation Structure for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile molecular engineering strategy for regulating the solvation shell of metal cations has been reported, aiming to achieve a balanced H2O activation behavior. By enriching the interface with aprotic organic molecules, the density of H2O is decreased, and a second&#8208;sphere effect is delivered to stabilize the adsorbed H2O molecule, leading to highly selective CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Balancing the activation of H2O is crucial for highly selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), as the protonation steps of CO2RR require fast H2O dissociation kinetics, while suppressing hydrogen evolution (HER) demands slow H2O reduction. We herein proposed one molecular engineering strategy to regulate the H2O activation using aprotic organic small molecules with high Gutmann donor number as a solvation shell regulator. These organic molecules occupy the first solvation shell of K+ and accumulate in the electrical double layer, decreasing the H2O density at the interface and the relative content of proton suppliers (free and coordinated H2O), suppressing the HER. The adsorbed H2O was stabilized via the second sphere effect and its dissociation was promoted by weakening the O&#8722;H bond, which accelerates the subsequent *CO2 protonation kinetics and reduces the energy barrier. In the model electrolyte containing 5&#8197;M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive (KCl&#8208;DMSO&#8208;5), the highest CO selectivity over Ag foil increased to 99.2&#8201;%, with FECO higher than 90.0&#8201;% within &#8722;0.75 to &#8722;1.15&#8197;V (vs. RHE). This molecular engineering strategy for cation solvation shell can be extended to other metal electrodes, such as Zn and Sn, and organic molecules like N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide.

         <title>Extremely Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Lewis&#8208;Paired CN Groups for Organic p&#8208;Dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of various CN&#8208;functionalized conjugated molecules and Lewis acids has led to the synthesis of&#160;unprecedentedly strong organic p&#8208;dopants (LUMO level down to &#8722;5.93&#8197;eV) exhibiting excellent doping stability (over 40&#8197;h at 120&#8201;&#176;C). Lewis pairing leads to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the CN groups increasing almost twofold and the dopant size enlarging significantly.







Abstract
P&#8208;type chemical doping (p&#8208;doping) is a key technique to modulate the optical, electrical, and electronic properties of organic semiconductors. However, typical functional groups in organic p&#8208;dopants have insufficient electron&#8208;withdrawing strength, and the inevitable diffusion of dopants in host matrices degrades doping stabilities. Herein, we utilize extremely electron&#8208;withdrawing Lewis&#8208;paired CN groups as a new class of building blocks for designing unprecedentedly strong organic p&#8208;dopants with excellent doping stability. Various Lewis acids are paired with CN&#8208;functionalized conjugated molecules in the solution state, which strengthens the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of CN groups almost twofold. The large dopants afford outstanding doping stability against continuous heating and long&#8208;term atmospheric exposure, which is promising for practical applications in devices. Given the broad applicability of this simple combinatorial approach, it may impact many fields of (opto)electronics.

&lt;p&gt;The use of various CN-functionalized conjugated molecules and Lewis acids has led to the synthesis of&#160;unprecedentedly strong organic p-dopants (LUMO level down to &#8722;5.93&#8197;eV) exhibiting excellent doping stability (over 40&#8197;h at 120&#8201;&#176;C). Lewis pairing leads to the electron-withdrawing properties of the CN groups increasing almost twofold and the dopant size enlarging significantly.

         <title>Anomalous Charge Transfer from Organic Ligands to Metal Halides in Zero&#8208;Dimensional [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5 Enabled by Pressure&#8208;Induced Lone Pair&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge transfer from organic ligands to metal halides in zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrids [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5 is achieved through pressure modulation. It leads to high excitonic emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. In situ experimental and theoretical methods show that the pressure&#8208;induced electronic coupling between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of Sb3+ and the &#960; electrons of benzene acts as an unexpected &#8220;bridge&#8221; for the charge transfer.







Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional (low&#8208;D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have emerged as fascinating candidates for optoelectronics due to their integrated properties from both organic and inorganic components. However, for most of low&#8208;D OMHHs, especially the zero&#8208;D (0D) compounds, the inferior electronic coupling between organic ligands and inorganic metal halides prevents efficient charge transfer at the hybrid interfaces and thus limits their further tunability of optical and electronic properties. Here, using pressure to regulate the interfacial interactions, efficient charge transfer from organic ligands to metal halides is achieved, which leads to a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) at around 6.0&#8197;GPa in a 0D OMHH, [(C6H5)4P]2SbCl5. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the pressure&#8208;induced electronic coupling between the lone&#8208;pair electrons of Sb3+ and the &#960; electrons of benzene ring (lp&#8208;&#960; interaction) serves as an unexpected &#8220;bridge&#8221; for the charge transfer. Our work opens a versatile strategy for the new materials design by manipulating the lp&#8208;&#960; interactions in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid systems.

         <title>Tetrazole Diversification of Amino Acids and Peptides via Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Cycloaddition with Aryldiazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic platform that could transform proteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids into a plethora of unprecedented tetrazole&#8208;decorated amino acid derivatives is developed via a silver&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cycloaddition reaction with aryldiazonium salts.







Abstract
Selective structural modification of amino acids and peptides is a central strategy in organic chemistry, chemical biology but also in pharmacology and material science. In this context, the formation of tetrazole rings, known to possess significant therapeutic properties, would expand the chemical space of unnatural amino acids but has received less attention. In this study, we demonstrated that the classic unimolecular Wolff rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;amino acid&#8208;derived diazoketones could be replaced by a faster intermolecular cycloaddition reaction with aryldiazonium salts under identical practical conditions. This strategy provides an efficient synthetic platform that could transform proteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids into a plethora of unprecedented tetrazole&#8208;decorated amino acid derivatives with preservation of the stereocenters. Density functional theory studies shed some light on the reaction mechanism and provided information regarding the origins of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Furthermore, this diazo&#8208;cycloaddition protocol was applied to construct tetrazole&#8208;modified peptidomimetics and drug&#8208;like amino acid derivatives.

         <title>Elongated Bacterial Pili as a Versatile Alignment Medium for NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for the measurement of residual dipolar couplings by NMR spectroscopy is presented. The medium is based on filamentous type 1 pili from E. coli and shown to withstand a wide range of challenging experimental conditions. Being compatible with biological macromolecules and small molecules alike, its high versatility suggests broad applicability in molecular structure determination by NMR.







Abstract
In NMR spectroscopy, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) have emerged as one of the most exquisite probes of biological structure and dynamics. The measurement of RDCs relies on the partial alignment of the molecule of interest, for example by using a liquid crystal as a solvent. Here, we establish bacterial type 1 pili as an alternative liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for the measurement of RDCs. To achieve alignment at pilus concentrations that allow for efficient NMR sample preparation, we elongated wild&#8208;type pili by recombinant overproduction of the main structural pilus subunit. Building on the extraordinary stability of type 1 pili against spontaneous dissociation and unfolding, we show that the medium is compatible with challenging experimental conditions such as high temperature, the presence of detergents, organic solvents or very acidic pH, setting it apart from most established alignment media. Using human ubiquitin, HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and camphor as spectroscopic probes, we demonstrate the applicability of the medium for the determination of RDCs of proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. Our results show that type 1 pili represent a very useful alternative to existing alignment media and may readily assist the characterization of molecular structure and dynamics by NMR.

         <title>Secretion&#8208;Catalyzed Assembly of Protein Biomaterials on a Bacterial Membrane Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>

Bacillus subtilis can be programmed to autonomously assemble recombinant silk peptides on its own membrane, and then release them as fibers into the extracellular milieu. The process, called secretion&#8208;catalyzed assembly, enables coupled synthesis, assembly, and processing of biomaterials by microbes.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;based biomaterials have played a key role in tissue engineering, and additional exciting applications as self&#8208;healing materials and sustainable polymers are emerging. Over the past few decades, recombinant expression and production of various fibrous proteins from microbes have been demonstrated; however, the resulting proteins typically must then be purified and processed by humans to form usable fibers and materials. Here, we show that the Gram&#8208;positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis can be programmed to secrete silk through its translocon via an orthogonal signal peptide/peptidase pair. Surprisingly, we discover that this translocation mechanism drives the silk proteins to assemble into fibers spontaneously on the cell surface, in a process we call secretion&#8208;catalyzed assembly (SCA). Secreted silk fibers form self&#8208;healing hydrogels with minimal processing. Alternatively, the fibers retained on the membrane provide a facile route to create engineered living materials from Bacillus cells. This work provides a blueprint to achieve autonomous assembly of protein biomaterials in useful morphologies directly from microbial factories.

         <title>Asymmetric (4+n) Cycloadditions of Indolyldimethanols for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Indole&#8208;Fused Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric (4+2) and (4+3) cycloadditions of 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols enable the construction of enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused rings in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. This approach led to the first enantioselective construction of challenging tetrahydroindolocarbazole scaffolds, which show promising anticancer activity. Theoretical calculations offer an in&#8208;depth understanding of this class of indolylmethanols.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric construction of chiral indole&#8208;fused rings has become an important issue in the chemical community because of the significance of such scaffolds. In this work, we have accomplished the first catalytic asymmetric (4+2) and (4+3) cycloadditions of 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols by using indoles and 2&#8208;naphthols as suitable reaction partners under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acids, constructing enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused six&#8208;membered and seven&#8208;membered rings in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In addition, this approach is used to realize the first enantioselective construction of challenging tetrahydroindolocarbazole scaffolds, which are found to show promising anticancer activity. More importantly, theoretical calculations of the reaction pathways and activation mode offer an in&#8208;depth understanding of this class of indolylmethanols. This work not only settles the challenges in realizing catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of indolyldimethanols but also provides a powerful strategy for the construction of enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused rings.

         <title>Platinum and Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Ceria as Dual&#8208;Active Sites for Efficient Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;active sites comprising Pt clusters and frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) on porous CeO2 nanorods provide an interface&#8208;independent pathway to boost the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction at low temperatures. The FLP sites enable strong adsorption of CO2 for efficient activation, but weak adsorption of CO that suppresses CH4 formation.







Abstract
The low&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction faces the following obstacles: low activity and unsatisfactory selectivity. Herein, the dual&#8208;active sites of platinum (Pt) clusters and frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) on porous CeO2 nanorods (Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2) provide an interface&#8208;independent pathway to boost high performance RWGS reaction at low temperatures. Mechanistic investigations illustrate that Pt clusters can effectively activate and dissociate H2. The FLP sites, instead of the metal and support interfaces, not only enhance the strong adsorption and activation of CO2, but also significantly weaken CO adsorption on FLP to facilitate CO release and suppress the CH4 formation. With the help of hydrogen spillover from Pt to PN&#8722;CeO2, the Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2 catalysts achieved a CO yield of 29.6&#8201;%, which is very close to the thermodynamic equilibrium yield of CO (29.8&#8201;%) at 350&#8201;&#176;C. Meanwhile, the Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2 catalysts delivered a large turnover frequency of 8720&#8197;h&#8722;1. Moreover, Ptcluster/PN&#8722;CeO2 operated stably and continuously for at least 840&#8197;h. This finding provides a promising path toward optimizing the RWGS reaction.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective 1,4&#8208;Oxyamination of Conjugated gem&#8208;Difluorodienes via Coupling with Carboxylic Acids and Dioxazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodienes afforded 1,4&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives in excellent 1,4&#8208;regioselectivity and enantioselectivity. The reaction proceeded via rhodium(III) catalysis through an &#951;3&#8208;allyl intermediate.







Abstract
The incorporation of fluorine atoms in organics improves their bioactivity and lipophilicity. Catalytic functionalization of gem&#8208;difluorodienes represents one of the most straightforward approaches to access fluorinated alkenes. In contrast to the regular 1,3&#8208;dienes that undergo diverse asymmetric di/hydrofunctionalizations, the regio&#8208; and enantioselective oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodienes remains untouched. Herein, we report asymmetric 1,4&#8208;oxyamination of gem&#8208;difluorodiene by chiral rhodium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling with readily available carboxylic acid and dioxazolone, affording gem&#8208;difluorinated 1,4&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives. Our asymmetric protocol exhibits high 1,4&#8208;regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Stoichiometric experiments provide evidences for the &#960;&#8208;allylrhodium pathway. Related oxyamination was also realized when trifluoroethanol was used as an oxygen nucleophile.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked [2]Rotaxane Aerogels with Tunable Morphologies and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of mechanical bonds in modulating the intrinsic characteristics of aerogels, such as porous microstructures and mechanical performances, has been demonstrated with mechanically interlocked aerogels. Such networks facilitate the development of smart materials with complex functionalities.







Abstract
Mechanical bonds have been utilized as promising motifs to construct mechanically interlocked aerogels (MIAs) with mechanical adaptivity and multifunctionality. However, fabricating such aerogels with not only precise chemical structures but also dynamic features remains challenging. Herein, we present MIAs carrying dense [2]rotaxane units, which bestow both the stability and flexibility of the aerogel network. Owing to the stable chemical structure of a [2]rotaxane, MIAs possessing a precise and full&#8208;scale mechanically interlocked network could be fabricated with the aid of diverse solvents. In addition, the dynamic nature of the [2]rotaxane resulted in morphologies and mechanical performances of the MIAs that can be dramatically modulated under chemical stimuli. We hope that the structure&#8211;property relationship in MIAs will facilitate the development of mechanically interlocked materials and provide novel opportunities toward constructing smart materials with multifunctionalities.

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Difluorocarbene Transfer via Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles via palladium catalysis has been developed. This reaction overcomes the intrinsic limitations of electrophilic difluorocarbene and allows difluoromethylation of various aryl bromides and aryl triflates. Experimental mechanistic studies revealed that a palladium(0/II) pathway is responsible for this reductive reaction.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles has been developed, representing a new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction. The approach uses low&#8208;cost and bulk industrial chemical chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H) as the difluorocarbene precursor. It produces a variety of difluoromethylated (hetero)arenes from widely available aryl halides/triflates and proton sources, featuring high functional group tolerance and synthetic convenience without preparing organometallic reagents. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that an unexpected Pd0/II catalytic cycle is involved in this reductive reaction, wherein the oxidative addition of palladium(0) difluorocarbene ([Pd0(Ln)]=CF2) with aryl electrophile to generate the key intermediate aryldifluoromethylpalladium [ArCF2Pd(Ln)X], followed by reaction with hydroquinone, is responsible for the reductive difluorocarbene transfer.

Experimental mechanistic studies revealed that a palladium(0/II) pathway is responsible for this reductive reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A palladium-catalyzed reductive difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles has been developed, representing a new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction. The approach uses low-cost and bulk industrial chemical chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) as the difluorocarbene precursor. It produces a variety of difluoromethylated (hetero)arenes from widely available aryl halides/triflates and proton sources, featuring high functional group tolerance and synthetic convenience without preparing organometallic reagents. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that an unexpected Pd&lt;sup&gt;0/II&lt;/sup&gt; catalytic cycle is involved in this reductive reaction, wherein the oxidative addition of palladium(0) difluorocarbene ([Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)]=CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with aryl electrophile to generate the key intermediate aryldifluoromethylpalladium [ArCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pd(L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)X], followed by reaction with hydroquinone, is responsible for the reductive difluorocarbene transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intracellular Molecules Induced Extracellular Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly for Efficient and Effective In Situ Cell Purification</title>

Unavoidable leaky protein expression limits in situ cell purification of synthetic mRNA switches. Harnessing the power of controlled self&#8208;assembly, we use synthetic mRNA switch to convey intracellular biomarker information into enzyme&#8208;controlled toxic assemblies only on the surface of undesired cells, promising high purity and high retention of target cells.







Abstract
Synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) switches are powerful tools for in situ cell purification, especially for cells derived from stem cells. However, the retention effectiveness of the target cells is limited by the leaky expression of toxic protein. The elimination efficiency of non&#8208;target cells is also constrained due to the lack of signal amplification. In this study, we designed a novel approach that uses synthetic mRNA switch to convey intracellular marker molecule information into spatially controlled extracellular toxic assembly formation. The approach bypasses the use of toxic protein to ensure high target cell recovery effectiveness. Meanwhile, the marker molecule information is amplified at multiple levels to ensure high non&#8208;target cell elimination effectiveness. Our approach can be tailored to meet various in situ cell purification needs, promising high&#8208;quality in situ cell purification for a wide range of biomedical applications.

         <title>Modular Alcohol Click Chemistry Enables Facile Synthesis of Recyclable Polymers with Tunable Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile method to synthesize a series of recyclable plastics has been developed. It involves the step polyaddition of diols, diacrylates, and COS and arises from the discovery of a new, modular, and efficient click reaction involving alcohol.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers derived from sustainable feedstocks presents enormous challenges. Here, we develop a novel, modular, and efficient click reaction for connecting primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohols with activated alkenes via a bridge molecule of carbonyl sulfide (COS). The click reaction is successfully applied to synthesize a series of recyclable polymers by the step polyaddition of diols, diacrylates, and COS. Diols and diacrylates are common chemicals and can be produced from biorenewable sources, and COS is released as the industrial waste. In addition to sustainable monomers, the approach is atom&#8208;economical, wide in scope, metal&#8208;free, and performed under mild conditions, affording unprecedented polymers with nearly quantitative yields. The produced polymers also possess predesigned and widely tunable structure owing to the versatility of our method and the broad variety of monomers. The in&#8208;chain thiocarbonate and ester polar groups can play as breakpoints, allowing these polymers to be easily recycled. Overall, the polymers have broad prospects for green materials given their facile synthesis, readily available feedstocks, desirable performance, and chemical recyclability.

         <title>Migration and Precipitation of Platinum in Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the complementary techniques of X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, Pt ion migration was identified as an important factor to explain the decay in performance of anion&#8208;exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells. The picture shows 3D reconstruction micro&#8208;CT images of the cross&#8208;section MEAs with Sustainion AEM and Pt/C cathode electrode after (a) 5&#8197;h and (b) 70&#8197;h of operation at 0.15&#8197;A/cm2.







Abstract
Despite the recent progress in increasing the power generation of Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), their durability is still far lower than that of Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Using the complementary techniques of X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;computed tomography (CT), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) spectroscopy, we have identified Pt ion migration as an important factor to explain the decay in performance of AEMFCs. In alkaline media Pt+2 ions are easily formed which then either undergo dissolution into the carbon support or migrate to the membrane. In contrast to PEMFCs, where hydrogen cross over reduces the ions forming a vertical &#8220;Pt line&#8221; within the membrane, the ions in the AEM are trapped by charged groups within the membrane, leading to disintegration of the membrane and failure. Diffusion of the metal components is still observed when the Pt/C of the cathode is substituted with a FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst, but in this case the Fe and Co ions are not trapped within the membrane, but rather migrate into the anode, thereby increasing the stability of the membrane.

         <title>Unlocking Reversible Silicon Redox for High&#8208;Performing Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible Si redox has been unlocked in Cl&#8208;based batteries through rational electrolyte dilution and anode passivation, which demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and high practicability. It enables us to revisit the overlooked Cl&#8208;based batteries and to harness them for sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy storage.







Abstract
Chlorine (Cl)&#8208;based batteries such as Li/Cl2 batteries are recognized as promising candidates for energy storage with low cost and high performance. However, the current use of Li metal anodes in Cl&#8208;based batteries has raised serious concerns regarding safety, cost, and production complexity. More importantly, the well&#8208;documented parasitic reactions between Li metal and Cl&#8208;based electrolytes require a large excess of Li metal, which inevitably sacrifices the electrochemical performance of the full cell. Therefore, it is crucial but challenging to establish new anode chemistry, particularly with electrochemical reversibility, for Cl&#8208;based batteries. Here we show, for the first time, reversible Si redox in Cl&#8208;based batteries through efficient electrolyte dilution and anode/electrolyte interface passivation using 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane and cyclized polyacrylonitrile as key mediators. Our Si anode chemistry enables significantly increased cycling stability and shelf lives compared with conventional Li metal anodes. It also avoids the use of a large excess of anode materials, thus enabling the first rechargeable Cl2 full battery with remarkable energy and power densities of 809&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 4,277&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, respectively. The Si anode chemistry affords fast kinetics with remarkable rate capability and low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, indicating its great potential in practical applications.

         <title>Integrating Achiral and Chiral Organic Ligands in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Metal Halides to Boost Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

We propose an efficient strategy to achieve simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield and large dissymmetry factor (glum) in chiral 0D hybrid metal halides by integrating achiral and chiral ligands. A pair of (R/S&#8208;MBA)2(Gua)4(In0.99Sb0.01Cl6)2 H2O (MBA=&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylammonium, Gua=guanidine) HMHs with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and large glum values (~0.01) are constructed.







Abstract
Chiral zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid metal halides (0D HMHs) could combine excellent optical properties and chirality, making them promising for circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral 0D HMHs with efficient CPL have been rarely reported. Here, we propose an efficient strategy to achieve simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and large dissymmetry factor (glum), by integrating achiral and chiral ligands into 0D HMHs. Specifically, three pairs of chiral 0D hybrid indium&#8208;antimony chlorides are synthesized by combing achiral guanidine with three types of chiral methylbenzylammonium&#8208;based derivatives as the organic cations. These chiral 0D HMHs exhibit near&#8208;unity PLQY and large glum values up to around &#177;1&#215;10&#8722;2. The achiral guanidine ligand is not only essential to crystallize these hybrid indium&#8208;antimony chlorides to achieve near&#8208;unity PLQYs, but also greatly enhances the chirality induction from organic ligands to inorganic units in these 0D HMHs. Furthermore, the choice of different chiral ligands can modify the strength of hydrogen bonding interactions in these 0D HMHs, to maximize their glum values. Overall, this study provides a robust way to realize efficient CPL in chiral HMHs, expanding their applications in chiroptical fields.

         <title>Total Structure, Electronic Structure and Catalytic Hydrogenation Activity of Metal&#8208;Deficient Chiral Polyhydride Cu57 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral metal&#8208;deficient Cu57 hydride&#8208;rich nanocluster was prepared by a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy. Its total structure and electronic structure were established by combined experimental and DFT results. Its optical and catalytic hydrogenation properties were studied.







Abstract
Accurate identifying and in&#8208;depth understanding of the defect sites in a working nanomaterial could hinge on establishing specific defect&#8208;activity relationships. Yet, atomically precise coinage&#8208;metal nanoclusters (NCs) possessing surface vacancy defects are scarce primarily owing to challenges in the synthesis and isolation of such defective NCs. Herein we report a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy to synthesizing an intrinsically chiral and metal&#8208;deficient copper hydride&#8208;rich NC [Cu57H20(PET)36(TPP)4]+ (Cu57H20). Its total structure (including hydrides) and electronic structure are well established by combined experimental and computational results. Crystal structure reveals Cu57H20 features a cube&#8208;like Cu8 kernel embedded in a corner&#8208;missing metal&#8208;ligand shell of Cu49(PET)36(TPP)4. Single Cu vacancy defect site occurs at one corner of the shell, evocative of mono&#8208;lacunary polyoxometalates. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the above&#8208;mentioned point vacancy causes one surface hydride exposed as an interfacial capping &#956;3&#8208;H&#8722;, which is accessible in chemical reaction, as proved by deuterated experiment. Moreover, Cu57H20 shows catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of nitroarene. The success of this work opens the way for the research on well&#8208;defined chiral metal&#8208;deficient Cu and other metal NCs, including exploring their application in asymmetrical catalysis.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Reaction&#8208;Mediated Tumor&#8208;Selective Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 System for Dual&#8208;Targeted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor&#8208;targeted CRISPR/Cas delivery strategy was developed to switch on antitumor immunity via bioorthogonal reaction. Selectively labeling tumor sites and the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway was achieved first, turning &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221;. The targeted accumulation of the CRISPR/Cas system within tumors via click chemistry then further enhanced cancer immunotherapy, substantially boosting antitumor effectiveness.







Abstract
CRISPR system&#8208;assisted immunotherapy is an attractive option in cancer therapy. However, its efficacy is still less than expected due to the limitations in delivering the CRISPR system to target cancer cells. Here, we report a new CRISPR/Cas9 tumor&#8208;targeting delivery strategy based on bioorthogonal reactions for dual&#8208;targeted cancer immunotherapy. First, selective in vivo metabolic labeling of cancer and activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway was achieved simultaneously through tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;biodegradable hollow manganese dioxide (H&#8208;MnO2) nano&#8208;platform. Subsequently, CRISPR/Cas9 system&#8208;loaded liposome was accumulated within the modified tumor tissue through in vivo click chemistry, resulting in the loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase N2 (PTPN2) and further sensitizing tumors to immunotherapy. Overall, our strategy provides a modular platform for precise gene editing in vivo and exhibits potent antitumor response by boosting innate and adaptive antitumor immunity.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Mn2+&#8722;NO and NO&#8722;NO Distance Measurements Reveal That Catalytic Asymmetry Regulates Alternating Access in an ABC Transporter

         <dc:description>
Several ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporters possess asymmetric nucleotide&#8208;binding sites (NBSs). Here, we elucidated its functional relevance using concomitant NO&#8722;NO, Mn2+&#8722;NO, and Mn2+&#8722;Mn2+ distance measurements for the ABC exporter TmrAB in a time&#8208;resolved manner. Our results shows that ATP hydrolysis at the active consensus NBS accelerates the reverse transition, and the impaired degenerate NBS might regulate the overall kinetics of this process.







Abstract
ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporters shuttle diverse substrates across biological membranes. Transport is often achieved through a transition between an inward&#8208;facing (IF) and an outward&#8208;facing (OF) conformation of the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Asymmetric nucleotide&#8208;binding sites (NBSs) are present among several ABC subfamilies and their functional role remains elusive. Here we addressed this question using concomitant NO&#8722;NO, Mn2+&#8722;NO, and Mn2+&#8722;Mn2+ pulsed electron&#8211;electron double&#8208;resonance spectroscopy of TmrAB in a time&#8208;resolved manner. This type&#8208;IV ABC transporter undergoes a reversible transition in the presence of ATP with a significantly faster forward transition. The impaired degenerate NBS stably binds Mn2+&#8722;ATP, and Mn2+ is preferentially released at the active consensus NBS. ATP hydrolysis at the consensus NBS considerably accelerates the reverse transition. Both NBSs fully open during each conformational cycle and the degenerate NBS may regulate the kinetics of this process.

Novel cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 cluster electrocatalysts were prepared through a mild and facile synthetic method, affording excellent 2 e&#8722; ORR activity for efficient and selective H2O2 synthesis.







Abstract
Co&#8208;based material catalysts have shown attractive application prospects in the 2 e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, for the industrial synthesis of H2O2, there is still lack of Co&#8208;based catalysts with high production yield rate. Here, novel cyclodextrin&#8208;supported Co(OH)2 cluster catalysts were prepared via a mild and facile method. The catalyst exhibited remarkable H2O2 selectivity (94.2&#8201;% ~ 98.2&#8201;%), good stability (99&#8201;% activity retention after 35&#8197;h), and ultra&#8208;high H2O2 production yield rate (5.58&#8197;mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the H&#8208;type electrolytic cell), demonstrating its promising industrial application potential. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the cyclodextrin&#8208;mediated Co(OH)2 electronic structure optimizes the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and significantly enhances the activation energy barrier for dissociation, leading to the high reactivity and selectivity for the 2 e&#8722; ORR. This work offers a valuable and practical strategy to design Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.

         <title>Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Electronegative Channels as Cationic Highways for Sustainable Lithium Metal Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electronegative 1D channels are presented as a cationic highway membrane strategy for sustainable Li metal battery anodes. Introduction of triazine rings and fluorinated groups into the COF skeletons played a viable role in enhancing salt dissociation and guiding uniform Li+ flux within the channels. The resulting COF membrane exhibited reliable Li plating/stripping cyclability and stable capacity retention in the Li/LiFePO4 full cell.







Abstract
Despite the enormous interest in Li metal as an ideal anode material, the uncontrollable Li dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase have plagued its practical application. These limitations can be attributed to the sluggish and uneven Li+ migration towards Li metal surface. Here, we report olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electronegative channels for facilitating selective Li+ transport. The triazine rings and fluorinated groups of the COFs are introduced as electron&#8208;rich sites capable of enhancing salt dissociation and guiding uniform Li+ flux within the channels, resulting in a high Li+ transference number (0.85) and high ionic conductivity (1.78&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The COFs are mixed with a polymeric binder to form mixed matrix membranes. These membranes enable reliable Li plating/stripping cyclability over 700&#8197;h in Li/Li symmetric cells and stable capacity retention in Li/LiFePO4 cells, demonstrating its potential as a viable cationic highway for accelerating Li+ conduction.

         <title>Regulating Degradation Pathways of Polymers by Radical&#8208;Triggered Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have proposed the radical&#8208;triggered luminescence to monitor the radical behaviours during polymer degradation. It was disclosed that the pure polymers showed a single sigmoidal dynamic curve from ROO&#8901; emissions, leading to the exponential proliferation for the degradation evolution. Alternatively, the degradation pathways of polymers were regulated into a double sigmoidal curve by anti&#8208;degradation LDHs.







Abstract
Understanding the radical behaviours during polymer degradation is beneficial to unveil and regulate the degradation pathways of polymers to achieve a sustainable polymer development. However, it is a long&#8208;standing challenge to study radical behaviours owing to the ultra&#8208;short lifetime of the transient radicals generated during the polymer degradation. In this contribution, we have proposed the radical&#8208;triggered luminescence to monitor the radical behaviours during polymer degradation without/with the addition of inorganic additives. It was disclosed that the pure polymers showed a single sigmoidal dynamic curve from peroxy radicals (ROO&#8901;) emissions, leading to the exponential proliferation for the degradation evolution. Alternatively, the degradation pathways with the addition of additives, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with positively charged Al centers, could be modulated into a double sigmoidal dynamics, involving the main product of alkoxy radicals (RO&#8901;) with the activation energy of 40.2&#8197;kJ/mol and a small amount of ROO&#8901; with 76.3&#8197;kJ/mol, respectively. Accordingly, the polymers with the additive&#8208;regulated pathways could exhibit prominently anti&#8208;degradation behaviours. This work is beneficial for the deep understanding of the radical mechanisms during polymer degradation, and for the rational design of anti&#8208;degradation polymers.

         <title>Remote C&#8722;H Olefination of Heterocyclic Biaryls Enabled by Reversibly Bound Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalizations of 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;phenylpyridine biaryls at sterically disfavored ortho positions were realized by developing two new catalytic templates.







Abstract
Remote C&#8722;H functionalization of heterocyclic biaryls will be of great importance in synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Through adjusting the geometric relationship of the directing atom and target C&#8722;H bonds, two new catalytic templates have been developed to enable the functionalization of the more hindered ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of heterobiaryls bearing directing heteroatom at the meta&#8208; or para&#8208;positions, affording unprecedented site&#8208;selectivity. The use of template chaperone also overcomes product inhibition and renders the directing templates catalytic. The utility of this protocol was demonstrated by olefination of heterocyclic biaryls with various substituents, overriding conventional steric and electronic effects. These ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H olefinated heterobiaryls are sterically hindered and can often be challenging to prepare through aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reactions.

         <title>A Modular Approach for the Synthesis of Natural and Artificial Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust chem&#8208;stamp approach consisting of two steps, one&#8208;carbon extension of aldehydes to alkenyl boronates and the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of these alkenyl boronates with 2,3&#8208;allenols, has been developed for the construction of key isoprene units in terpenoids. This approach enables the modular concise synthesis of terpenoids and the creation of artificial terpenoids with control over the number of isoprene units, the side chain, and two terminal groups.







Abstract
Many terpenoids with isoprene unit(s) demonstrating critical biological activities have been isolated and characterized. In this study, we have developed a robust chem&#8208;stamp strategy for the construction of the key isoprene unit, which consists of two steps: one&#8208;carbon extension of aldehydes to the alkenyl boronates by the boron&#8208;Wittig reaction and the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenyl boronates with 2,3&#8208;allenols to yield enals. This chem&#8208;stamp could readily be applied repeatedly and separately, enabling the modular concise synthesis of many natural and pharmaceutically active terpenoids, including retinal, &#946;&#8208;carotene, vitamin A, tretinoin, fenretinide, acitretin, ALRT1550, nigerapyrone C, peretinoin, and lycopene. Owing to the diversified availability of the starting materials, aldehydes and 2,3&#8208;allenols, creation of new non&#8208;natural terpenoids has been realized from four dimensions: the number of isoprene units, the side chain, and the two terminal groups.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystalline Poly (Triazine Imide) Nanosheets for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>

Single&#8208;crystalline poly (Triazine Imide)/Li+Cl&#8722; nanosheets with more exposed active sites and efficient charge transfer present a record apparent quantum efficiency of 25&#8201;% for photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
Poly (triazine imide) (PTI/Li+Cl&#8722;), one of the crystalline versions of polymeric carbon nitrides, holds great promise for photocatalytic overall water splitting. In principle, the photocatalytic activity of PTI/Li+Cl&#8722; is closely related to the morphology, which could be reasonably tailored by the modulation of the polycondensation process. Herein, we demonstrate that the hexagonal prisms of PTI/Li+Cl&#8722; could be converted to hexagonal nanosheets by adjusting the binary eutectic salts from LiCl/KCl or NaCl/LiCl to ternary LiCl/KCl/NaCl. Results reveal that the extension of in&#8208;plane conjugation is preferred, when the polymerisation was performed in the presence of ternary eutectic salts. The hexagonal nanosheets bears longer lifetimes of charge carriers than that of hexagonal prisms due to lower intensity of structure defects and shorter hopping distance of charge carriers along the stacking direction of triazine nanosheets. The optimized hexagonal nanosheets exhibits a record apparent quantum yield value of 25&#8201;% (&#955;=365&#8197;nm) for solar hydrogen production by one&#8208;step excitation overall water splitting.

         <title>From Tethered to Freestanding Stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions through Fragment Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linked fragments for molecular glue development for the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) are described. Two classes of fragments were co&#8208;crystallized and subsequently linked, resulting in a noncovalent hybrid molecule that was further optimized, guided by 20 crystal structures, resulting in a selective 25&#8208;fold stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; PPIs.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule stabilization of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) is a promising strategy in chemical biology and drug discovery. However, the systematic discovery of PPI stabilizers remains a largely unmet challenge. Herein we report a fragment&#8208;linking approach targeting the interface of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and a peptide derived from the estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) protein. Two classes of fragments&#8212;a covalent and a noncovalent fragment&#8212;were co&#8208;crystallized and subsequently linked, resulting in a noncovalent hybrid molecule in which the original fragment interactions were largely conserved. Supported by 20 crystal structures, this initial hybrid molecule was further optimized, resulting in selective, 25&#8208;fold stabilization of the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER&#945; interaction. The high&#8208;resolution structures of both the single fragments, their co&#8208;crystal structures and those of the linked fragments document a feasible strategy to develop orthosteric PPI stabilizers by linking to an initial tethered fragment.

         <title>Nano Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) with Anti&#8208;Hook Effect for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ peptide self&#8208;assembly into a nano proteolysis targeting chimeras (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) system was reported with &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221; to realize dose&#8208;dependent and long&#8208;acting protein degradation in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is an emerging pharmacological modality with innovated post&#8208;translational protein degradation capabilities. However, off&#8208;target induced unintended tissue effects and intrinsic &#8220;hook effect&#8221; hinder PROTAC biotechnology to be maturely developed. Herein, an intracellular fabricated nano proteolysis targeting chimeras (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) modality with a center&#8208;spoke degradation network for achieving efficient dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation in tumor is reported. The PROTAC precursors are triggered by higher GSH concentrations inside tumor cells, which subsequently in situ self&#8208;assemble into Nano&#8208;PROTACs through intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions. The fibrous Nano&#8208;PROTACs can form effective polynary complexes and E3 ligases degradation network with multi&#8208;binding sites, achieving dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation with &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221;. The generality and efficacy of Nano&#8208;PROTACs are validated by degrading variable protein of interest (POI) such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and androgen receptor (AR) in a wide&#8208;range dose&#8208;dependent manner with a 95&#8201;% degradation rate and long&#8208;lasting potency up to 72&#8197;h in vitro. Significantly, Nano&#8208;PROTACs achieve in vivo dose&#8208;dependent protein degradation up to 79&#8201;% and tumor growth inhibition in A549 and LNCap xenograft mice models, respectively. Taking advantages of in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy, the Nano&#8208;PROTACs provide a generalizable platform to promote precise clinical translational application of PROTAC.

         <title>A Semisynthetic Bioluminescence Sensor for Ratiometric Imaging of Metal Ions In Vivo Using DNAzymes Conjugated to An Engineered Nano&#8208;Luciferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fusion protein of Nano&#8208;luciferase and HaloTag was engineered to construct a DNAzyme sensor for metal ion detection in vivo, utilizing bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET).







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based probes have gained significant attention as versatile tools for biochemical analysis, benefiting from their programmability and biocompatibility. However, most existing DNA&#8208;based probes rely on fluorescence as the signal output, which can be problematic due to issues like autofluorescence and scattering when applied in complex biological materials such as living cells or tissues. Herein, we report the development of bioluminescent nucleic acid (bioLUNA) sensors that offer laser excitation&#8208;independent and ratiometric imaging of the target in vivo. The system is based on computational modelling and mutagenesis investigations of a genetic fusion between circular permutated Nano&#8208;luciferase (NLuc) and HaloTag, enabling the conjugation of the protein with a DNAzyme. In the presence of Zn2+, the DNAzyme sensor releases the fluorophore&#8208;labelled strand, leading to a reduction in bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) between the luciferase and fluorophore. Consequently, this process induces ratiometric changes in the bioluminescent signal. We demonstrated that this bioLUNA sensor enabled imaging of both exogenous Zn2+ in vivo and endogenous Zn2+ efflux in normal epithelial prostate and prostate tumors. This work expands the DNAzyme sensors to using bioluminescence and thus has enriched the toolbox of nucleic acid sensors for a broad range of biomedical applications.

Reduction of a bulky magnesium(II) diamide with 5&#8201;% w/w K/KI under an N2 atmosphere has given a complex between magnesium and doubly reduced dinitrogen, N22&#8722;. The reaction has been calculated to proceed via an anionic magnesium(I) radical, and the final product shown to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reactions with CO, H2 and C2H4.







Abstract
The activation of dinitrogen (N2) by transition metals is central to the highly energy intensive, heterogeneous Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Considerable progress has been made towards more sustainable homogeneous activations of N2 with d&#8208; and f&#8208;block metals, though little success has been had with main group metals. Here we report that the reduction of a bulky magnesium(II) amide [(TCHPNON)Mg] (TCHPNON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene) with 5&#8201;% w/w K/KI yields the magnesium&#8208;N2 complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)]. DFT calculations and experimental data show that the dinitrogen unit in the complex has been reduced to the N22&#8722; dianion, via a transient anionic magnesium(I) radical. The compound readily reductively activates CO, H2 and C2H4, in reactions in which it acts as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical.

         <title>Correlating Metal Redox Potentials to Co(III)K(I) Catalyst Performances in Carbon Dioxide and Propene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dioxide and propene oxide ring opening copolymerization is a leading carbon dioxide utilization technology. Future catalyst development needs better understanding of how to maximize both activity and selectivity. Here, a series of catalysts show a correlation between both their activity and selectivity values with the cobalt reduction potential, providing a useful &#8216;predictive&#8217; tool for catalyst performances.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide copolymerization is a front&#8208;runner CO2 utilization strategy but its viability depends on improving the catalysis. So far, catalyst structure&#8208;performance correlations have not been straightforward, limiting the ability to predict how to improve both catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, a simple measure of a catalyst ground&#8208;state parameter, metal reduction potential, directly correlates with both polymerization activity and selectivity. It is applied to compare performances of 6 new heterodinuclear Co(III)K(I) catalysts for propene oxide (PO)/CO2 ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) producing poly(propene carbonate) (PPC). The best catalyst shows an excellent turnover frequency of 389&#8197;h&#8722;1 and high PPC selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;% (50&#8201;&#176;C, 20&#8197;bar, 0.025&#8197;mol% catalyst). As demonstration of its utility, neither DFT calculations nor ligand Hammett parameter analyses are viable predictors. It is proposed that the cobalt redox potential informs upon the active site electron density with a more electron rich cobalt centre showing better performances. The method may be widely applicable and is recommended to guide future catalyst discovery for other (co)polymerizations and carbon dioxide utilizations.

         <title>A Strategy for Controlling the Polymerizations of Thiyl Radical Propagation by RAFT Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy that could enable the polymerizations of thiyl radical propagation to be controlled by existing RDRP methods has been reported. The key to this strategy is the propagating thiyl radicals could undergo desulfurization with isocyanides to generate stabilized alkyl radicals, thereby allowing for controlling the polymerization via RAFT agents, leading to the formation of main&#8208;chain polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures.







Abstract
The ability to extend the polymerizations of thiyl radical propagation to be regulated by existing controlled methods would be highly desirable, yet remained very challenging to achieve because the thiyl radicals still cannot be reversibly controlled by these methods. In this article, we reported a novel strategy that could enable the radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of macrocyclic allylic sulfides, wherein propagating specie is thiyl radical, to be controlled by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents. The key to the success of this strategy is the propagating thiyl radical can undergo desulfurization with isocyanide and generate a stabilized alkyl radical for reversible control. Systematic optimization of the reaction conditions allowed good control over the polymerization, leading to the formation of polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures, exemplified by the radical block copolymerization of macrocyclic allylic sulfides and vinyl monomers and the incorporation of sequence&#8208;defined segments into the polymer backbone. This work represents a significant step toward directly enabling the polymerizations of heteroatom&#8208;centered radical propagation to be regulated by existing reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques.

         <title>Pore Modulation of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of HOFs with unique pore structures have been designed by precise pore modulation engineering through the introduction of structure directing agents. One example is HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 with a one&#8208;dimensional pearl&#8208;chain channel that balances size control, adsorption capacity, and functional sites for efficient storage and separation of propylene.







Abstract
Developing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) that combine functional sites, size control, and storage capability for targeting gas molecule capture is a novel and challenging venture. However, there is a lack of effective strategies to tune the hydrogen&#8208;bonded network to achieve high&#8208;performance HOFs. Here, a series of HOFs termed as HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;M (M=1, 2, and 3) with different pore structures are obtained by introducing structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs) into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP). These HOFs have distinct space configurations with pore channels ranging from discrete to continuous multi&#8208;dimensional. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals a rare diversity of hydrogen&#8208;bonding models dominated by SDAs. HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2, which forms a strong layered hydrogen&#8208;bonding network with ammonium (NH4+) through multiple carboxyl groups, has a suitable 1D &#8220;pearl&#8208;chain&#8221; channel for the selective capture of propylene (C3H6). At 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, the C3H6 storage density of HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 reaches 0.6&#8197;kg&#8201;L&#8722;1, representing one of the best C3H6 storage materials, while offering a propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) selectivity of 12.2. Theoretical calculations and in situ SCXRD provide a detailed analysis of the binding strength of C3H6 at different locations in the pearl&#8208;chain channel. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirm that HOF&#8208;ZSTU&#8208;2 can effectively separate C3H6 from multi&#8208;mixtures.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Selective C(sp2)&#8722;F Bond Alkylation of Industrially Relevant Hydrofluoroolefin HFO&#8208;1234yf</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond alkylation of the inexpensive industrial chemical HFO&#8208;1234yf with alkylzinc reagents has been developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the less electron&#8208;rich pyridine&#8208;oxazoline or bipyridine&#8208;based ligands feature comparable or even higher rates of C&#8722;F bond oxidative addition than the electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligands in the presence of lithium bromide.







Abstract
The selective transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;F bond functionalization of inexpensive industrial fluorochemicals represents one of the most attractive approaches to valuable fluorinated compounds. However, the selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond carbofunctionalization of refrigerant hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) remains challenging. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed selective C(sp2)&#8722;F bond alkylation of HFO&#8208;1234yf with alkylzinc reagents. The resulting 2&#8208;trifluoromethylalkenes can serve as a versatile synthon for diversified transformations, including the anti&#8208;Markovnikov type hydroalkylation and the synthesis of bioactive molecule analogues. Mechanistic studies reveal that lithium salt is essential to promote the oxidative addition of Ni0(Ln) to the C&#8722;F bond; the less electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;based ligands, such as bipyridine and pyridine&#8208;oxazoline, feature comparable or even higher oxidative addition rates than the electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligands; the strong &#963;&#8208;donating phosphine ligands, such as PMe3, are detrimental to transmetallation, but the less electron&#8208;rich and bulky N&#8208;based ligands, such as pyridine&#8208;oxazoline, facilitate transmetallation and reductive elimination to form the final product.

&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed selective C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;F bond alkylation of the inexpensive industrial chemical HFO-1234yf with alkylzinc reagents has been developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the less electron-rich pyridine-oxazoline or bipyridine-based ligands feature comparable or even higher rates of C&#8722;F bond oxidative addition than the electron-rich phosphine ligands in the presence of lithium bromide.

         <title>Cooperative and Orthogonal Switching in the Solid State Enabled by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Confinement Leading to a Thermo&#8208;Photochromic Platform</title>

         <dc:description>
Like two color&#8208;changing chameleons coming face to face, integration of two distinct stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties within the same platform results in their synergistic behavior. Perturbation of the chameleons&#8217; environment upon a different external stimulus breaks the synergy, promoting their orthogonal behavior, a concept highlighted for a novel hierarchical photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework.







Abstract
Cooperative behavior and orthogonal responses of two classes of coordinatively integrated photochromic molecules towards distinct external stimuli were demonstrated on the first example of a photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive hierarchical platform. Synergetic and orthogonal responses to temperature and excitation wavelength are achieved by confining the stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties within a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), leading to the preparation of a novel photo&#8208;thermo&#8208;responsive spiropyran&#8208;diarylethene based material. Synergistic behavior of two photoswitches enables the study of stimuli&#8208;responsive resonance energy transfer as well as control of the photoinduced charge transfer processes, milestones required to advance optoelectronics development. Spectroscopic studies in combination with theoretical modeling revealed a nonlinear effect on the material electronic structure arising from the coordinative integration of photoresponsive molecules with distinct photoisomerization mechanisms. Thus, the reported work covers multivariable facets of not only fundamental aspects of photoswitch cooperativity, but also provides a pathway to modulate photophysics and electronics of multidimensional functional materials exhibiting thermo&#8208;photochromism.

         <title>Designing F/P Hybrid Polymer as Ultrastable Cationic Shielding Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the on&#8208;demand development of phosphonium fluoropolymers as the electrostatic shielding interlayer to stabilize Li metal anodes, where the periodic arrangement of F/P units not only adaptively homogenized electric field distribution to induce dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, but also restrained undesirable coating decomposition to provide persistent protection for long&#8208;term battery cycling.







Abstract
Dendrite growth on electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase has severely limited applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we developed an ionic alternating polymer with fluorocarbons and phosphonium cations in repeating units to regulate Li deposition for the first time. The combined functionalities in the F/P hybrid polymer exhibit remarkable characteristics as a protective layer on top of Li anode, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical stability, ion flux redistributing capability and adaptive chain mobility. Based on characterizations and simulations, this cationic interlayer could effectively furnish long&#8208;standing electrostatic shielding for anodes, allowing restrained coating decomposition and homogenized electric field distribution to induce dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, and enabling full cells with enhanced rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance. Given the importance of LMBs, this work will promote polymer design to stabilize anodes with superior electrochemical behavior.

         <title>An Endogenous Prompting Mechanism for Sulfur Conversions Via Coupling with Polysulfides in Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional sulfur conversion reactions suffer from severe shuttle effects as well as sluggish redox kinetics. Here, we achieved an endogenous facilitation mechanism for sulfur conversion which constructed a fast &#8220;internal cycle&#8221; of the promotors to promote the slow &#8220;external cycle&#8221; of sulfur conversions by coupling lithium polysulfides with functional molecules. By regulating the intermediates solubility and mediating the reaction kinetics, organophosphorus polysulfides as endogenous promotors can simultaneously eliminate the shuttle effect and improve the sulfur electrode process.







Abstract
The sluggish kinetics process and shuttling of soluble intermediates present in complex conversion between sulfur and lithium sulfide severely limit the practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Herein, by introducing a designated functional organic molecule to couple with polysulfide intermediators, an endogenous prompting mechanism of sulfur conversions has thus been created leading to an alternative sulfur&#8208;electrode process, in another words, to build a fast &#8220;internal cycle&#8221; of promotors that can promote the slow &#8220;external cycle&#8221; of sulfur conversions. The coupling&#8208;intermediators between the functional organic molecule and polysulfides, organophosphorus polysulfides, to be the &#8220;promotors&#8221; for sulfur conversions, are not only insoluble in the electrolyte but also with higher redox&#8208;activity. So the sulfur&#8208;electrode process kinetics is greatly improved and the shuttle effect is eliminated simultaneously by this strategy. Meanwhile, with the endogenous prompting mechanism, the morphology of the final discharge product can be modified into a uniform covering film, which is more conducive to its decomposition when charging. Benefiting from the effective mediation of reaction kinetics and control of intermediates solubility, the lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries can act out excellent rate performance and cycling stability.

         <title>Supramolecular Block Copolymers from Tricarboxamides. Biasing Co&#8208;assembly by the Incorporation of Pyridine Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;assembly of the pyridine&#8208;based tricarboxamides 2&#8211;4 with tricarboxamide 1 is investigated. Whilst the formation of the supramolecular co&#8208;polymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;2 is not possible, co&#8208;polymers poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3 and poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;4 are formed. The latter has been investigated by mass&#8208;balance model that revealed an alternating blocky microstructure.







Abstract
The synthesis of a series of triangular&#8208;shaped tricarboxamides endowed with three picoline or nicotine units (compounds 2 and 3, respectively) or just one nicotine unit (compound 4) is reported, and their self&#8208;assembling features investigated. The pyridine rings make compounds 2&#8211;4 electronically complementary with our previously reported oligo(phenylene ethynylene)tricarboxamides (OPE&#8208;TA) 1 to form supramolecular copolymers. C3&#8208;symmetric tricarboxamide 2 forms highly stable intramolecular five&#8208;membered pseudocycles that impede its supramolecular polymerization into poly&#8208;2 and the co&#8208;assembly with 1 to yield copolymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;2. On the other hand, C3&#8208;symmetric tricarboxamide 3 readily forms poly&#8208;3 with great stability but unable to form helical supramolecular polymers despite the presence of the peripheral chiral side chains. The copolymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3 can only be obtained by a previous complete disassembly of the constitutive homopolymers in CHCl3. Helical poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;3 arises in a process involving the transfer of the helicity from racemic poly&#8208;1 to poly&#8208;3, and the amplification of asymmetry from chiral poly&#8208;3 to poly&#8208;1. Importantly, C2v&#8208;symmetric 4, endowed with only one nicotinamide moiety and three chiral side chains, self&#8208;assembles into a P&#8208;type helical supramolecular polymer (poly&#8208;4) in a thermodynamically controlled cooperative process. The combination of poly&#8208;1 and poly&#8208;4 generates chiral supramolecular copolymer poly&#8208;1&#8208;co&#8208;4, whose blocky microstructure has been investigated by applying the previously reported supramolecular copolymerization model.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a series of triangular-shaped tricarboxamides endowed with three picoline or nicotine units (compounds &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, respectively) or just one nicotine unit (compound &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) is reported, and their self-assembling features investigated. The pyridine rings make compounds &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; electronically complementary with our previously reported oligo(phenylene ethynylene)tricarboxamides (OPE-TA) &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to form supramolecular copolymers. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric tricarboxamide &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; forms highly stable intramolecular five-membered pseudocycles that impede its supramolecular polymerization into &lt;b&gt;poly-2&lt;/b&gt; and the co-assembly with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to yield copolymer &lt;b&gt;poly-1-co-2&lt;/b&gt;. On the other hand, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric tricarboxamide &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; readily forms &lt;b&gt;poly-3&lt;/b&gt; with great stability but unable to form helical supramolecular polymers despite the presence of the peripheral chiral side chains. The copolymer &lt;b&gt;poly-1-co-3&lt;/b&gt; can only be obtained by a previous complete disassembly of the constitutive homopolymers in CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Helical &lt;b&gt;poly-1-co-3&lt;/b&gt; arises in a process involving the transfer of the helicity from racemic &lt;b&gt;poly-1&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;poly-3&lt;/b&gt;, and the amplification of asymmetry from chiral &lt;b&gt;poly-3&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;poly-1&lt;/b&gt;. Importantly, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, endowed with only one nicotinamide moiety and three chiral side chains, self-assembles into a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-type helical supramolecular polymer (&lt;b&gt;poly-4&lt;/b&gt;) in a thermodynamically controlled cooperative process. The combination of &lt;b&gt;poly-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;poly-4&lt;/b&gt; generates chiral supramolecular copolymer &lt;b&gt;poly-1-co-4&lt;/b&gt;, whose blocky microstructure has been investigated by applying the previously reported supramolecular copolymerization model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Manufacturing of Supramolecular Liquid&#8208;Crystal Elastomers by Stress&#8208;Induced Alignment and Hydrogen Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular soft actuators have been developed that are based on hydrogen&#8208;bond crosslinked liquid&#8208;crystal elastomers (LCEs). The LCEs can be manufactured in the form of fibers and 2D/3D objects that are capable of performing stable and reversible thermal actuation under mechanical stretch or melt extrusion, opening the way for the one&#8208;step and custom manufacturing of soft actuators.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystal elastomers (LCEs) capable of performing large and reversible deformation in response to an external stimulus are an important class of soft actuators. However, their manufacturing process typically involves a multistep approach that requires harsh conditions. For the very first time, LCEs with customized geometries that can be manufactured by a rapid one&#8208;step approach at room temperature are developed. The LCEs are hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) crosslinked main chain polymers comprising flexible short side chains. Applying a stretching/shear force to the LCE can simultaneously induce mesogen alignment and H&#8208;bond exchange, allowing for the formation of well&#8208;aligned LCE networks stabilized by H&#8208;bonds. Based on this working principle, soft actuators in fibers and 2D/3D objects can be manufactured by mechanical stretching or melt extrusion within a short time (e.g. &lt;1&#8197;min). These actuators can perform reversible macroscopic motions with large, controlled deformations up to 38&#8201;%. The dynamic nature of H&#8208;bonds also provides the actuators with reprocessability and reprogrammability. Thus, this work opens the way for the one&#8208;step and custom manufacturing of soft actuators.

         <title>Polymers with Intrinsic Microporosity as Solid Ion Conductors for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolytes based on polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) are proposed as ideal solid electrolytes for lithium batteries. Benefiting from rational material selection and structure design, solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries deliver high discharge specific capacity (11307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and prolonged cycling life (247&#8197;cycles). The solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries can operate steadily for over 100&#8197;cycles after a series of abuse tests (bending and twisting).







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity and superior stability are considered to be a key technology for the safe operation of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, current SSEs are incapable of meeting the requirements for practical solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here we report a general strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance SSEs by engineering polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs). Taking advantage of the interconnected ion pathways generated from the ionizable groups, high ionic conductivity (1.06&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) is achieved for the PIMs&#8208;based SSEs. The mechanically strong (50.0&#8197;MPa) and non&#8208;flammable SSEs combine the two superiorities of outstanding Li+ conductivity and electrochemical stability, which can restrain the dendrite growth and prevent Li symmetric batteries from short&#8208;circuiting even after more than 2200&#8197;h cycling. Benefiting from the rational design of SSEs, PIMs&#8208;based SSEs Li&#8208;metal batteries can achieve good cycling performance and superior feasibility in a series of withstand abuse tests including bending, cutting, and penetration. Moreover, the PIMs&#8208;based SSEs endow high specific capacity (11307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (247&#8197;cycles) for solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. The PIMs&#8208;based SSEs present a powerful strategy for enabling safe operation of high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Proton/Mg2+ Co&#8208;Insertion Chemistry in Aqueous Mg&#8208;Ion Batteries: From the Interface to the Inner</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton co&#8208;insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion. At the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, hydrated Mg2+ has poor insertion kinetics and thus accumulates on the surface of VO2(B) to hydrolyze, triggering the formation of Mg&#8208;rich SEI and production of protons. In the tunnels, co&#8208;inserted/lattice H2O molecules block the Mg2+ diffusion while facilitate proton diffusion.







Abstract
Co&#8208;insertion of protons happens widely and enables divalent&#8208;ion aqueous batteries to achieve high performances. However, detailed investigations and comprehensive understandings of proton co&#8208;insertion are scarce. Herein, we demonstrate that proton co&#8208;insertion into tunnel materials is determined jointly by interface derivation and inner diffusion: at the interface, hdrated Mg2+ has poor insertion kinetics, and therefore accumulates and hydrolyzes to produce protons; in the tunnels, co&#8208;inserted/lattice H2O molecules block the Mg2+ diffusion while facilitate the proton diffusion. When monoclinic vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) anode is tested in Mg(CH3COO)2 aqueous solution, the formation of Mg&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase on the VO2(B) electrode and co&#8208;insertion of derived protons are probed; in the tunnels, the diffusion energy barrier of Mg2++H2O is 2.7&#8197;eV, while that of the protons is 0.37&#8197;eV. Thus, protons dominate the subsequent insertion and inner diffusion. As a consequence, the VO2(B) achieves a high capacity of 257.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, a high rate retention of 59.1&#8201;% from 1 to 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and stable cyclability of 3000 times with a capacity retention of 81.5&#8201;%. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the proton co&#8208;insertion and may promote the development of rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Coordination Defect&#8208;Induced Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Polyoxo&#8208;metalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Catalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination defect&#8208;induced strategy gives frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) sites in a polyoxometalate (POM) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), where the Lewis acid (LA) sites are linker&#8208;defective metal nodes and the Lewis base (LB) sites are derived from surface oxygen atoms of the POM.

Precise control of the structure and spatial distance of Lewis acid (LA) and Lewis base (LB) sites in a porous system to construct efficient solid frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst is vital for industrial application but remains challenging. Herein, we constructed FLP sites in a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) by introducing coordination&#8208;defect metal nodes (LA) and surface&#8208;basic POM with abundant oxygen (LB). The well&#8208;defined and unique spatial conformation of the defective POM&#8208;based MOF ensure that the distance between LA and LB is at ~4.3&#8197;&#197;, a suitable distance to activate H2. This FLP catalyst can heterolytically dissociate H2 into active H&#948;&#8722;, thus exhibiting high activity in hydrogenation, which is 55 and 2.7&#8197;times as high as that of defect&#8208;free POM&#8208;based MOF and defective MOF without POM, respectively. This work provides a new avenue toward precise design multi&#8208;site catalyst to achieve specific activation of target substrate for synergistic catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;A coordination defect-induced strategy gives frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) sites in a polyoxometalate (POM) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), where the Lewis acid (LA) sites are linker-defective metal nodes and the Lewis base (LB) sites are derived from surface oxygen atoms of the POM. This FLP catalyst achieved heterolytic dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into highly active H&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, thus exhibiting excellent activity in acetylene hydrogenation.

         <title>Insights into the Correlation of Cross&#8208;linking Modes with Mechanical Properties for Dynamic Polymeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on comprehensive comparison on mechanical properties between dually cross&#8208;linked network and individual covalent or supramolecular cross&#8208;linked network, we reveal that the dual cross&#8208;linking mode can combine the advantages of covalent cross&#8208;links and supramolecular cross&#8208;links, exhibiting not only quick deformation recovery, outstanding breaking stress and puncture resistance, but also excellent toughness and energy dissipation ability.







Abstract
Simultaneously introducing covalent and supramolecular cross&#8208;links into one system to construct dually cross&#8208;linked networks, has been proved an effective approach to prepare high&#8208;performance materials. However, so far, features and advantages of dually cross&#8208;linked networks compared with those possessing individual covalent or supramolecular cross&#8208;linking points are rarely investigated. Herein, on the basis of comparison between supramolecular polymer network (SPN), covalent polymer network (CPN) and dually cross&#8208;linked polymer network (DPN), we reveal that the dual cross&#8208;linking strategy can endow the DPN with integrated advantages of CPN and SPN. Benefiting from the energy dissipative ability along with the dissociation of host&#8211;guest complexes, the DPN shows excellent toughness and ductility similar to the SPN. Meanwhile, the elasticity of covalent cross&#8208;links in the DPN could rise the structural stability to a level comparable to the CPN, exhibiting quick deformation recovery capacity. Moreover, the DPN has the strongest breaking stress and puncture resistance among the three, proving the unique property advantages of dual cross&#8208;linking method. These findings gained from our study further deepen the understanding of dynamic polymeric networks and facilitate the preparation of high&#8208;performance elastomeric materials.

         <title>Balancing the Crystallinity and Film Formation of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes through In Situ Modulation for Efficient Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The balance between crystallinity and film&#8208;formation of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is demonstrated for the first time using a facile in situ modulation strategy. Through competitive complexation with a ligand, acetic acid systematically reduces the crystallinity and optimizes the film formation of the MOF membrane, influencing its gas separation properties.







Abstract
Polycrystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layers hold great promise as molecular sieve membranes for efficient gas separation. Nevertheless, the high crystallinity tends to cause inter&#8208;crystalline defects/cracks in the nearby crystals, which makes crystalline porous materials face a great challenge in the fabrication of defect&#8208;free membranes. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate the balance between crystallinity and film formation of MOF membrane through a facile in situ modulation strategy. Monocarboxylic acid was introduced as a modulator to regulate the crystallinity via competitive complexation and thus concomitantly control the film&#8208;forming state during membrane growth. Through adjusting the ratio of modulator acid/linker acid, an appropriate balance between this structural &#8220;trade&#8208;off&#8221; was achieved. The resulting MOF membrane with moderate crystallinity and coherent morphology exhibits molecular sieving for H2/CO2 separation with selectivity up to 82.5.

         <title>Accelerated Surface Reconstruction through Regulating the Solid&#8208;Liquid Interface by Oxyanions in Perovskite Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To promote the spontaneous chemical reaction process of LaNiO3&#8722;&#948;, the oxyanions were added into electrolytes to regulate the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The oxyanions adsorb onto the solid&#8211;liquid interface, disrupting the dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed OH&#8722; ions and the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction. It could be an effective way to accelerate surface reconstruction process.







Abstract
A comprehensive understanding of surface reconstruction was critical to developing high performance lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based perovskite electrocatalysts. Traditionally, the primary determining factor of the surface reconstruction process was believed to be the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Hence, most previous studies focused on optimizing composition to reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy, which in turn facilitated the surface reconstruction process. Here, for the first time, we found that adding oxyanions (SO42&#8722;, CO32&#8722;, NO3&#8722;) into the electrolyte could effectively regulate the solid&#8211;liquid interface, significantly accelerating the surface reconstruction process and enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. Further studies indicated that the added oxyanions would adsorb onto the solid&#8211;liquid interface layer, disrupting the dynamic equilibrium between the adsorbed OH&#8722; ions and the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction process. As such, the OH&#8722; ions generated during surface reconstruction process could be more readily released into the electrolyte, thereby leading to an acceleration of the surface reconstruction. Thus, it was expected that our finding would provide a new layer of understanding to the surface reconstruction process in LOM&#8208;based perovskite electrocatalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;divergent Bissilylation of Alkynoates: Scope, Mechanism, and Origin of Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed divergent bissilylation of alkynoates using disilane reagent TMDQ (see TOC graphic) is presented. Reversed regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity was obtained through addition of Lewis acids. MAD (methylaluminum bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxide) impacted electronically&#8208;favored migratory insertion through steric effect while the addition of BCF (tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane) allowed reductive elimination as the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed bissilylation reactions of alkynes with disilane reagents have become one of the most straightforward and efficient protocols to rapidly produce structurally diverse alkenyl silicon derivatives. In these reactions, the utilization of unsymmetrical disilane reagents provided the possibilities for reactivity enhancement as well as the synthetic merits in contrast to symmetrical disilane reagents. However, a major yet challenging objective is achieving precise control over the selectivity including the regioselectivity and the cis/trans&#8208;selectivity. Herein we realized the first divergent bissilylation of alkynoates with our developed air&#8208;stable disilane reagent 8&#8208;(2&#8208;substituted&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetramethyldisilanyl)quinoline (TMDQ) by means of synergistic Pd/Lewis acid catalytic system. The catalytic system precisely dictates the selectivity, resulting in the divergent synthesis of 1,2&#8208;bissilyl alkenes. The power of these 1,2&#8208;bissilyl alkenes serving as the key synthetic intermediates has been clearly demonstrated by rapid construction of diverse motifs and densely functionalized biologically active compounds. In addition, the origins of the switchable selectivities were well elucidated by experimental and computational studies on the reaction mechanism and were mainly attributed to different ligand steric effects, the use of the specific disilane reagent TMDQ and the different coordination modes of different Lewis acid with alkynoates.

Herein we realized the first divergent bissilylation of alkynoates with our developed air-stable disilane reagent 8-(2-substituted-1,1,2,2-tetramethyldisilanyl)quinoline (TMDQ) by means of synergistic Pd/Lewis acid catalytic system. The catalytic system precisely dictates the selectivity, resulting in the divergent synthesis of 1,2-bissilyl alkenes. The power of these 1,2-bissilyl alkenes serving as the key synthetic intermediates has been clearly demonstrated by rapid construction of diverse motifs and densely functionalized biologically active compounds. In addition, the origins of the switchable selectivities were well elucidated by experimental and computational studies on the reaction mechanism and were mainly attributed to different ligand steric effects, the use of the specific disilane reagent TMDQ and the different coordination modes of different Lewis acid with alkynoates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One/Two&#8208;Photon&#8208;Excited ESIPT&#8208;Attributed Coordination Polymers with Wide Temperature Range and Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>

One/two&#8208;photon&#8208;excited long persistent luminescence (LPL) was obtained in an ESIPT&#8208;attributed CdII coordination polymer (LIFM&#8208;106) with wide temperature range (100&#8211;380&#8197;K) and color tunability. Comparative study manifests the rational ligand modification and J&#8208;aggregation in LIFM&#8208;106 enhances the competitiveness of monomer LPL to counter&#8208;balance the excimer emission.







Abstract
The multiple metastable excited states provided by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) molecules are beneficial to bring temperature&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL). Meanwhile, ESIPT molecules are intrinsically suitable to be modulated as D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure to obtain both one/two&#8208;photon excitation and LPL emission simultaneously. Herein, we report the rational design of a dynamic CdII coordination polymer (LIFM&#8208;106) from ESIPT ligand to achieve the above goals. By comparing LIFM&#8208;106 with the counterparts, we established a temperature&#8208;regulated competitive relationship between singlet excimer and triplet LPL emission. The optimization of ligand aggregation mode effectively boost the competitiveness of the latter. In result, LIFM&#8208;106 shows outstanding one/two&#8208;photon excited LPL performance with wide temperature range (100&#8211;380&#8197;K) and tunable color (green to red). The multichannel radiation process was further elucidated by transient absorption and theoretical calculations, benefiting for the application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Control over Reversible Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticle Folding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimanes allow the synthesis of water&#8208;soluble single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) and enable the effective unfolding with mild visible light from a compact structure into a linear chain. The unfolding of the fluorescent nanoparticles is reversible and occurs in aqueous systems, making it promising for controlling and tracing the SCNPs in biological environments.







Abstract
We introduce a class of single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) that respond to visible light (&#955;max=415&#8197;nm) with complete unfolding from their compact structure into linear chain analogues. The initial folding is achieved by a simple esterification reaction of the polymer backbone constituted of acrylic acid and polyethylene glycol carrying monomer units, introducing bimane moieties, which allow for the photochemical unfolding, reversing the ester&#8208;bond formation. The compaction and the light driven unfolding proceed cleanly and are readily followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), monitoring the change in the hydrodynamic radius (RH). Importantly, the folding reaction and the light&#8208;induced unfolding are reversible, supported by the high conversion of the photo cleavage. As the unfolding reaction occurs in aqueous systems, the system holds promise for controlling the unfolding of SCNPs in biological environments.

         <title>Xylene Synthesis Through Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation and Toluene Methylation Over a Composite ZnZrO Zeolite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective xylene synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation was achieved by regulating the interaction between two active components of a composite catalyst through a toluene&#8208;containing coupling reaction. The relationship between ZnZrO and the zeolite involved in the promotion effect was explored with detailed characterization.







Abstract
Selective synthesis of specific value&#8208;added aromatics from CO2 hydrogenation is of paramount interest for mitigating energy and climate problems caused by CO2 emission. Herein, we report a highly active composite catalyst of ZnZrO and HZSM&#8208;5 (ZZO/Z5&#8208;SG) for xylene synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation via a coupling reaction in the presence of toluene, achieving a xylene selectivity of 86.5&#8201;% with CO2 conversion of 10.5&#8201;%. A remarkably high space time yield of xylene could reach 215&#8197;mg&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, surpassing most reported catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The enhanced performance of ZZO/Z5&#8208;SG could be due to high dispersion and abundant oxygen vacancies of the ZZO component for CO2 adsorption, more feasible hydrogen activation and transfer due to the close interaction between the two components, and enhanced stability of the formate intermediate. The consumption of methoxy and methanol from the deep hydrogenation of formate by introduced toluene also propels an oriented conversion of CO2.

         <title>Highly Efficient Biomass Upgrading by a Ni&#8722;Cu Electrocatalyst Featuring Passivation of Water Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bimetallic Ni&#8722;Cu electrode for the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with an industrial&#8208;scale current density of up to 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been successfully developed. Superior stability and activity of the prepared electrode enable the gram&#8208;scale production of FDCA with a very high overall yield, purity, and Faradaic efficiency.







Abstract
Electricity&#8208;driven organo&#8208;oxidations have shown an increasing potential recently. However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the primary competitive reaction, especially under high current densities, which leads to low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the product and catalyst detachment from the electrode. Here, we report a bimetallic Ni&#8722;Cu electrocatalyst supported on Ni foam (Ni&#8722;Cu/NF) to passivate the OER process while the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is significantly enhanced. A current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can be achieved at 1.50&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, and both FE and yield keep close to 100&#8201;% over a wide range of potentials. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that Cu doping impedes the OH* deprotonation to O* and hereby OER process is greatly passivated. Those instructive results provide a new approach to realizing highly efficient biomass upgrading by regulating the OER activity.

         <title>A Nuclearity&#8208;Dependent Enantiodivergent Epoxide Opening via Enthalpy&#8208;Controlled Mononuclear and Entropy&#8208;Controlled Dinuclear (Salen)Titanium Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A nuclearity&#8208;dependent enantiodivergent epoxide opening reaction has been developed based on a mononuclear (salen)TiIII complex and its self&#8208;assembled oxygen&#8208;bridged dinuclear counterparts within the same stereogenic ligand scaffold. Mechanistic studies reveal that the nuclearity&#8208;distinct catalysts regulate the enthalpy and entropy controlling modes in the enantiodifferentiation process to achieve profound chirality inversion.







Abstract
A nuclearity&#8208;dependent enantiodivergent epoxide opening reaction has been developed, in which both antipodes of chiral alcohol products are selectively accessed by mononuclear (salen)TiIII complex and its self&#8208;assembled oxygen&#8208;bridged dinuclear counterparts within the same stereogenic ligand scaffold. Kinetic studies based on the Eyring equation revealed an enthalpy&#8208;controlled enantio&#8208;differentiation mode in mononuclear catalysis, whereas an entropy&#8208;controlled one in dinuclear catalysis. DFT calculations outline the origin of the enantiocontrol of the mononuclear catalysis and indicate the actual catalyst species in the dinuclear catalytic system. The mechanistic insights may shed a light on a strategy for stereoswichable asymmetric catalysis utilizing nuclearity&#8208;distinct transition&#8208;metal complexes.

         <title>Topological Design of Unprecedented Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Featuring Multiple Anion Functionalities and Hierarchical Porosity for Benchmark Acetylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>

An unprecedented robust metal organic framework ZNU&#8208;9 with a new wly topology and featuring multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity was reported for simultaneous efficient C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 separation with both high capacity and high selectivity.







Abstract
Separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) or ethylene (C2H4) is industrially important but still challenging so far. Herein, we developed two novel robust metal organic frameworks AlFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;8) with znv topology and SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPBDA (ZNU&#8208;9) with wly topology for efficient capture of C2H2 from CO2 and C2H4. Both ZNU&#8208;8 and ZNU&#8208;9 feature multiple anion functionalities and hierarchical porosity. Notably, ZNU&#8208;9 with more anionic binding sites and three distinct cages displays both an extremely large C2H2 capacity (7.94&#8197;mmol/g) and a high C2H2/CO2 (10.3) or C2H2/C2H4 (11.6) selectivity. The calculated capacity of C2H2 per anion (4.94&#8197;mol/mol at 1&#8197;bar) is the highest among all the anion pillared metal organic frameworks. Theoretical calculation indicated that the strong cooperative hydrogen bonds exist between acetylene and the pillared SiF62&#8722; anions in the confined cavity, which is further confirmed by in situ IR spectra. The practical separation performance was explicitly demonstrated by dynamic breakthrough experiments with equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixtures and 1/99&#8197;C2H2/C2H4 mixtures under various conditions with excellent recyclability and benchmark productivity of pure C2H2 (5.13&#8197;mmol/g) or C2H4 (48.57&#8197;mmol/g).

         <title>Semi&#8208;Metallic Superionic Layers Suppressing Voltage Fading of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Towards Superior&#8208;Stable Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;rich layer oxide (LRLO) cathodes with semi&#8208;metallic superionic layers are prepared via a simple one&#8208;step modification. The inner semi&#8208;metallic LiMn2O4&#8208;like structure (LMO), has spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons that can bond with oxygen, preventing oxygen release. The outer fast&#8208;ion conductor Li0.8Nb0.96Ni0.2O3 (LNO) acts as a fast&#8208;ion conductor facilitating Li+ migration and alleviating metal dissolution.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LRLOs) with greater specific capacity density are constrained by voltage attenuation and inferior rate performance because of irreversible oxygen release, metal dissolving and poor lithium&#8208;ion transport capacity. Herein, a simple surface modification is designed to solve the performance degradation and structural collapse of LRLOs. Combining experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a semi&#8208;metallic LiMn2O4&#8208;like structure (LMO) with spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons, is introduced to the surface of the cathode restrains the activated surficial lattice oxygen ions by its stable oxygen vacancies. Additionally, Ni doping results in a fast&#8208;ion conductor Li0.8Nb0.96Ni0.2O3 structure (LNO) with lowered lithium ions diffusion barrier, which is tightly conjugating to substrate and synergistically reinforces the Li diffusion path through the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Moreover, Mn dissolution is successfully relieved due to the decrease in Mn concentration in the coating layers. As a result, the modified material (LRLO@LMO@LNO) exhibits an ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 120.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 10&#8197;C with a very small discharge voltage attenuation of 313&#8197;mV after 600&#8197;cycles (0.52&#8197;mV per cycle) at 1&#8197;C. Undoubtedly, this method discloses a simple and effective approach to promote the practical utilization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density.

Recently, Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. reported a crystal structure of a ternary complex of the non&#8208;heme iron endoperoxidase FtmOx1 (PDB entry&#8197;7ETK) and concluded that it provides evidence supporting the FtmOx1 catalysis CarC&#8208;like mechanistic model. However, this work did not accurately describe key mechanistic features and differences of the Carc&#8208;like and COX&#8208;like models, and their data do not support their conclusions.







Abstract
In their recent Angewandte Chemie publication (doi: 10.1002/anie.202112063), Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. reported the crystal structure of a ternary complex of the non&#8208;heme iron endoperoxidase FtmOx1 (PDB entry&#8197;7ETK). The biochemical data assessed in this study were from a retracted study (doi: 10.1038/nature15519) by Zhang, Liu, Zhang et&#8197;al.; no additional biochemical data were included, yet there was no discussion on the source of the biochemical data in the report by Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. Based on this new crystal structure and subsequent QM/MM&#8208;MD calculations, Cen, Wang, Zhou et&#8197;al. concluded that their work provided evidence supporting the CarC&#8208;like mechanistic model for FtmOx1 catalysis. However, the authors did not accurately describe either the CarC&#8208;like model or the COX&#8208;like model, and they did not address the differences between them. Further, and contrary to their interpretations in the manuscript, the authors&#8217; data are consistent with the COX&#8208;like model once the details of the CarC&#8208;like and COX&#8208;like models have been carefully analyzed.

         <title>Reply to Correspondence on &#8220;Structural Insight into the Catalytic Mechanism of the Endoperoxide Synthase FtmOx1&#8242;&#8242;</title>

The 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme enzyme FtmOx1 can catalyze the endoperoxidation of fumitremorgin B, producing verruculogen. The side product of deisoprenylation becomes the major product when the analogue 13&#8208;oxo&#8208;fumitremorgin B is used as the substrate. Fumitremorgin B and 13&#8208;oxo&#8208;fumitremorgin B show similar substrate&#8208;binding patterns with FtmOx1 but different enzymatic conversions.







Abstract
The high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the ternary complex FtmOx1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2OG&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;fumitremorgin B and the catalytic mechanism were recently reported by us (DOI 10.1002/anie.202112063). In their Correspondence, Zhang, Costello, Liu et&#8197;al. criticize our work in several aspects. Herein, we address these questions one by one. These structural clarifications and new computational results further support the CarC&#8208;like mechanistic model.

&lt;p&gt;The 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent non-heme enzyme FtmOx1 can catalyze the endoperoxidation of fumitremorgin B, producing verruculogen. The side product of deisoprenylation becomes the major product when the analogue 13-oxo-fumitremorgin B is used as the substrate. Fumitremorgin B and 13-oxo-fumitremorgin B show similar substrate-binding patterns with FtmOx1 but different enzymatic conversions.

         <title>Back Cover: Elongated Bacterial Pili as a Versatile Alignment Medium for NMR Spectroscopy (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 37/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for recording residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) by NMR spectroscopy is reported by Lo&#239;c Salmon, Christoph Giese and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202305120). The medium relies on filamentous type 1 pili from E. coli, is compatible with harsh experimental conditions and allows RDC measurements for proteins, nucleic acids and small organic molecules.

A general tetrazole diversification platform of amino acids is presented by Ilan Marek, Fa&#8208;Guang Zhang, Jun&#8208;An Ma, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202304740). This method transformed proteinogenic &#945;&#8208;amino acids into a plethora of tetrazole&#8208;decorated amino acid derivatives via silver&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cycloaddition with aryldiazonium salts. The background of the cover image shows the key tetrazole structure surrounded by selected amino acid&#8208;derived tetrazoles and some starting amino acids.

Molecular doping is a key technique to modulate optical, electrical, and electronic properties of organic semiconductors. However, typical functional groups in organic p&#8208;dopants have insufficient electron&#8208;withdrawing strength, and inevitable dopant diffusion in host matrices degrades doping stabilities. In their Research Article (e202304245), Jaeyoung Jang and co&#8208;workers develop extremely electron&#8208;withdrawing Lewis&#8208;paired CN groups as a new class of building blocks for designing strong organic p&#8208;dopants with excellent doping stability.

         <title>About Perfluoropolyhedranes, Their Electron&#8208;Accepting Ability and Questionable Supramolecular Hosting Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry infers perfection and perennity, order, and harmony. Synthesizing perfluoropolyhedranes, a serious challenge, greatly enhances polyhedrane electron affinity, providing a unique opportunity for hosting an extra electron inside a molecular frame. The expectations for an easy entry to supramolecular chemistry hinted by such &#8220;cage&#8221; or &#8220;box&#8221; structures are, however, illusive.







Abstract
Polyhedral molecules are appealing for their eye&#8208;catching architecture and distinctive chemistry. Perfluorination of such, often greatly strained, compounds is a momentous challenge. It drastically changes the electron distribution, structure and properties. Notably, small high&#8208;symmetry perfluoropolyhedranes feature a centrally located, star&#8208;shaped low&#8208;energy unoccupied molecular orbital that can host an extra electron within the polyhedral frame, thus producing a radical anion, without loss of symmetry. This predicted electron&#8208;hosting capacity was definitively established for perfluorocubane, the first perfluorinated Platonic polyhedrane to be isolated pure. Hosting atoms, molecules, or ions in such &#8220;cage&#8221; structures is, however, all but forthright, if not illusionary, offering no easy access to supramolecular constructs. While adamantane and cubane have fostered numerous applications in materials science, medicine, and biology, specific uses for their perfluorinated counterparts remain to be established. Some aspects of highly fluorinated carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes and graphite, are briefly mentioned for context.

         <title>Orderly Self&#8208;Assembly of Organic Fluorophores for Sensing and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In past decades, the orderly self&#8208;assembly of functionalized fluorophores has gained much attention. Such fluorophores can form nanoaggregates by self&#8208;assembly, which prolong their residence time in vivo, achieving high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios and accurate bioimaging. In this review, we summarize progress and challenges of self&#8208;assembled fluorophores, focusing on their development history, self&#8208;assembly mechanism and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging utilizing traditional organic fluorophores is extensively applied in both cellular and in vivo studies. However, it faces significant obstacles, such as low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) and spurious positive/negative signals, primarily due to the facile diffusion of these fluorophores. To cope with this challenge, orderly self&#8208;assembled functionalized organic fluorophores have gained significant attention in the past decades. These fluorophores can create nanoaggregates via a well&#8208;ordered self&#8208;assembly process, thus prolonging their residency time within cells and in vivo settings. The development of self&#8208;assembled&#8208;based fluorophores is an emerging field, and as such, in this review, we present a summary of the progress and challenges of self&#8208;assembly fluorophores, focusing on their development history, self&#8208;assembly mechanisms, and biomedical applications. We hope that the insights provided herein will assist scientists in further developing functionalized organic fluorophores for in situ imaging, sensing, and therapy.

         <title>Beyond Solvothermal: Alternative Synthetic Methods for Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a comprehensive overview of the recent synthetic advancements of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with emphasis on the energy input required. These emerging strategies encompass microwave&#8208;assisted, sonochemical, mechanochemical, photochemical, plasma&#8208;promoted, electric field&#8208;induced, and electron beam&#8208;mediated synthesis. We also delve into the merits and limitations of these methods in comparison to the solvothermal approach.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous organic materials that hold a wealth of potential applications across various fields. The development of COFs, however, is significantly impeded by the dearth of efficient synthetic methods. The traditional solvothermal approach, while prevalent, is fraught with challenges such as complicated processes, excessive energy consumption, long reaction times, and limited scalability, rendering it unsuitable for practical applications. The quest for simpler, quicker, more energy&#8208;efficient, and environmentally benign synthetic strategies is thus paramount for bridging the gap between academic COF chemistry and industrial application. This Review provides an overview of the recent advances in alternative COF synthetic methods, with a particular emphasis on energy input. We discuss representative examples of COF synthesis facilitated by microwave, ultrasound, mechanic force, light, plasma, electric field, and electron beam. Perspectives on the advantages and limitations of these methods against the traditional solvothermal approach are highlighted.

         <title>40 Years of Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 40&#8197;years development of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes for rechargeable batteries has been reviewed. Critical insights are given from both underlying mechanistic and practical engineering aspects while we traverse the history on the rational design of low&#8208;temperature electrolyte systems.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium batteries are one of the most appropriate energy storage systems in our electrified society, as virtually all portable electronic devices and electric vehicles today rely on the chemical energy stored in them. However, sub&#8208;zero Celsius operation, especially below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, remains a huge challenge for lithium batteries and greatly limits their application in extreme environments. Slow Li+ diffusion and charge transfer kinetics have been identified as two main origins of the poor performance of RLBs under low&#8208;temperature conditions, both strongly associated with the liquid electrolyte that governs bulk and interfacial ion transport. In this review, we first analyze the low&#8208;temperature kinetic behavior and failure mechanism of lithium batteries from an electrolyte standpoint. We next trace the history of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes in the past 40&#8197;years (1983&#8211;2022), followed by a comprehensive summary of the research progress as well as introducing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization and computational methods for revealing their underlying mechanisms. Finally, we provide some perspectives on future research of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes with particular emphasis on mechanism analysis and practical application.

Finally, we provide some perspectives on future research of low-temperature electrolytes with particular emphasis on mechanism analysis and practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regioselective Formal &#946;&#8208;Allylation of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Cooperative Nickel and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective formal Tsuji&#8211;Trost &#946;&#8208;allylation of various carbonyl compounds with different allylic electrophiles is reported. Reactions proceed through initial silyl enol ether formation and subsequent cooperative photoredox/nickel catalysis.







Abstract
The Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction between carbonyl compounds and allylic precursors has been widely used in the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. As the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond is far more acidic than the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond, carbonyl compounds undergo highly regioselective allylation at the &#945;&#8208;position and their &#946;&#8208;allylation is therefore highly challenging. This innate &#945;&#8208;reactivity conversely hampers diversity, especially if the corresponding &#946;&#8208;allylation product is targeted. Herein, we present a formal intermolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;C bond formation reaction of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with different allyl electrophiles through cooperative nickel and photoredox catalysis. &#946;&#8208;Selectivity is achieved via initial transformation of the aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding silyl enol ethers. The overall transformation features mild conditions, excellent regioselectivity, wide functional group tolerance and high reaction efficiency. The introduced facile and regioselective &#946;&#8208;allylation of carbonyl compounds proceeding through cooperative catalysis allows the preparation of valuable building blocks that are difficult to access from aldehydes and ketones using existing methodology.

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Transistor Based on Hydrophobic Polymer Tuned by Ionic Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic gel interfacial layer is applied to improve the ionic transport of the hydrophobic conjugated polymers in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). With this approach, hydrophobic conjugated polymers could be used directly, while the types and ratios of gel matrix and ionic liquids in the ionic gels could be tuned to achieve optimal OECT properties for improved performance.







Abstract
Hydrophobic conjugated polymers have poor ionic transport property, so hydrophilic side chains are often grafted for their application as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). However, this modification lowers their charge transport ability. Here, an ionic gel interfacial layer is applied to improve the ionic transport while retaining the charge transport ability of the polymers. By using the ionic gels comprising gel matrix and ionic liquids as the interfacial layers, the hydrophobic polymer achieves the OECT feature with high transconductance, low threshold voltage, high current on/off ratio, short switching time, and high operational stability. The working mechanism is also revealed. Moreover, the OECT performance can be tuned by varying the types and ratios of ionic gels. With the proposed ionic gel strategy, OECTs can be effectively realized with hydrophobic conjugated polymers.

         <title>Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx Cocatalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting by Poly (Triazine Imide) Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly (triazine imide) modified with Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx as H2 and O2 evolution cocatalysts, respectively, largely improves the charge separation efficiency and restrains the undesired backward reaction, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency of 20.2&#8201;% for photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
In situ photo&#8208;deposition of both Pt and CoOx cocatalysts on the facets of poly (triazine imide) (PTI) crystals has been developed for photocatalytic overall water splitting. However, the undesired backward reaction (i.e., water formation) on the noble Pt surface is a spontaneously down&#8208;hill process, which restricts their efficiency to run the overall water splitting reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that the efficiency for photocatalytic overall water splitting could be largely promoted by the decoration of Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOx as H2 and O2 evolution cocatalysts, respectively. Results reveal that the dual cocatalysts greatly extract charges from bulk to surface, while the Rh/Cr2O3 cocatalyst dramatically restrains the backward reaction, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 20.2&#8201;% for the photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8722;N Biaryl Atropisomers through Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation with Acrylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H alkylation reaction is described. A series of structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole and pyrrole&#8208;pyrrole N&#8722;N atropisomers were obtained in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). This reaction features perfect atom economy, wide substrate scope, and multifunctionalized products allowing diverse transformations.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers is an emerging area but remains underexplored. The development of efficient synthesis of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers is in great demand. Herein, the construction of N&#8722;N biaryl atropisomers through iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H alkylation is reported for the first time. In the presence of readily available Ir precursor and Xyl&#8208;BINAP, a variety of axially chiral molecules based on indole&#8208;pyrrole skeleton were obtained in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, N&#8722;N bispyrrole atropisomers could also be synthesized in excellent yields and enantioselectivity. This method features perfect atom economy, wide substrate scope, and multifunctionalized products allowing diverse transformations.

         <title>Topochemical Syntheses of Polyarylopeptides Involving Large Molecular Motions: Frustrated Monomer Packing Leads to the Formation of Polymer Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of aryl rings in the backbone of polymer chains is one of the key strategies to improve the chain rigidity and hence the properties. In peptide chemistry the technique gave birth to a new class of molecular systems called arylopeptides. Here we discuss the synthesis of polyarylopeptides, peptide polymers with periodic aryl units, from amino acid&#8208;based monomers via topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization.







Abstract
We report the topochemical syntheses of three polyarylopeptides, wherein triazolylphenyl group is integrated into the backbone of peptide chains. We synthesized three different monomers having azide and arylacetylene as end&#8208;groups from glycine, L&#8208;alanine and L&#8208;valine. We crystallized these monomers and the crystal structures of two of them were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Due to the steric constraints, both of these monomers crystallized with two molecules, viz. conformers A and B, in the asymmetric unit. Consistently, in both cases, the A&#8208;conformers are antiparallelly &#960;&#8208;stacked and B&#8208;conformers are parallelly slip&#8208;stacked, exploiting weak interactions. Though the arrangements of molecules in the pristine crystals were unsuitable for topochemical reaction, upon heating, they undergo large motion inside the crystal lattice to reach a transient reactive orientation and thereby the self&#8208;sorted conformer stacks react to give a blend of triazole&#8208;linked polyarylopeptides having two different linkages.

     alt="Topochemical Syntheses of Polyarylopeptides Involving Large Molecular Motions: Frustrated Monomer Packing Leads to the Formation of Polymer Blends"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction of aryl rings in the backbone of polymer chains is one of the key strategies to improve the chain rigidity and hence the properties. In peptide chemistry the technique gave birth to a new class of molecular systems called arylopeptides. Here we discuss the synthesis of polyarylopeptides, peptide polymers with periodic aryl units, from amino acid-based monomers via topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition polymerization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the topochemical syntheses of three polyarylopeptides, wherein triazolylphenyl group is integrated into the backbone of peptide chains. We synthesized three different monomers having azide and arylacetylene as end-groups from glycine, L-alanine and L-valine. We crystallized these monomers and the crystal structures of two of them were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffractometry. Due to the steric constraints, both of these monomers crystallized with two molecules, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;. conformers &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;, in the asymmetric unit. Consistently, in both cases, the &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;-conformers are antiparallelly &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;&#960;&lt;/span&gt;-stacked and &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;-conformers are parallelly slip-stacked, exploiting weak interactions. Though the arrangements of molecules in the pristine crystals were unsuitable for topochemical reaction, upon heating, they undergo large motion inside the crystal lattice to reach a transient reactive orientation and thereby the self-sorted conformer stacks react to give a blend of triazole-linked polyarylopeptides having two different linkages. Due to the large molecular motion inside crystals, the product phase loses its crystallinity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Plasmonic Interaction in Peptide&#8208;tethered Photopolymerizable Diacetylenes Doped with Chiral Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;tethered diacetylene monomers exhibit efficient topochemical photopolymerization and allow control over the chiroptical properties of the resulting chiral polydiacetylenes. Achiral and chiral gold nanoparticles were incorporated in the chiral polymers and the stereoselective plasmonic interactions investigated, with the ultimate goal of designing next&#8208;generation organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials with large chiroptic effects.







Abstract
Designing polymeric systems with ultra&#8208;high optical activity is instrumental in the pursuit of smart artificial chiroptical materials, including the fundamental understanding of structure/property relations. Herein, we report a diacetylene (DA) moiety flanked by chiral D&#8208; and L&#8208;FF dipeptide methyl esters that exhibits efficient topochemical photopolymerization in the solid phase to furnish polydiacetylene (PDA) with desired control over the chiroptical properties. The doping of the achiral gold nanoparticles provides plasmonic interaction with the PDAs to render asymmetric shape to the circular dichroism bands. With the judicious design of the chiral amino acid ligand appended to the AuNPs, we demonstrate the first example of selective chiral amplification mediated by stereo&#8208;structural matching of the polymer&#8208;plasmonic AuNP hybrid pairs. Such ordered self&#8208;assembly aided by topochemical polymerization in peptide&#8208;tethered PDA provides a smart strategy to produce soft responsive materials for applications in chiral photonics.

         <title>Insights into the Diffusion Behaviors of Water over Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Catalysts During the Conversion of Syngas to High&#8208;Quality Gasoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst composed of hydrophobic FeNa@Si&#8208;c and HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite converts syngas to gasoline with high selectivity. The diffusion of water molecules through a hydrophilic catalyst is bidirectional, while the diffusion through a hydrophobic catalyst is unidirectional, thereby allowing control of syngas&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline side reactions related to water.







Abstract
Although considerable efforts towards directly converting syngas to liquid fuels through Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis have been made, developing catalysts with low CO2 selectivity for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality gasoline remains a big challenge. Herein, we designed a bifunctional catalyst composed of hydrophobic FeNa@Si&#8208;c and HZSM&#8208;5 zeolite, which exhibited a low CO2 selectivity of 14.3&#8201;% at 49.8&#8201;% CO conversion, with a high selectivity of 62.5&#8201;% for gasoline in total products. Molecular dynamic simulations and model experiments revealed that the diffusion of water molecules through hydrophilic catalyst was bidirectional, while the diffusion through hydrophobic catalyst was unidirectional, which were crucial to tune the water&#8208;gas shift reaction and control CO2 formation. This work provides a new fundamental understanding about the function of hydrophobic modification of catalysts in syngas conversion.

         <title>A Broad Light&#8208;Harvesting Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte Enables Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation in a Bacterial Biohybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new strategy to enable light&#8208;driven nitrogen fixation in non&#8208;photosynthetic bacteria by integrating the novel conjugated oligoelectrolyte COE&#8208;IC into A. vinelandii. Upon excitation of light, COE&#8208;IC generates electron equivalents at the abiotic&#8208;biotic interface. These photoelectrons are then transferred to nitrogenase, which drives the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia.







Abstract
We report a rationally designed membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE), namely COE&#8208;IC, which endows aerobic N2&#8208;fixing bacteria Azotobacter vinelandii with a light&#8208;harvesting ability that enables photosynthetic ammonia production. COE&#8208;IC possesses an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) type conjugated core, which promotes visible light absorption with a high molar extinction coefficient. Furthermore, COE&#8208;IC spontaneously associates with A. vinelandii to form a biohybrid in which the COE is intercalated within the lipid bilayer membrane. In the presence of L&#8208;ascorbate as a sacrificial electron donor, the resulting COE&#8208;IC/A. vinelandii biohybrid showed a 2.4&#8208;fold increase in light&#8208;driven ammonia production, as compared to the control. Photoinduced enhancement of bacterial biomass and production of L&#8208;amino acids is also observed. Introduction of isotopically enriched 15N2 atmosphere led to the enrichment of 15N&#8208;containing intracellular metabolites, consistent with the products being generated from atmospheric N2.

         <title>Isostructural Nanocluster Manipulation Reveals Pivotal Role of One Surface Atom in Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom modifications are typically accompanied by appreciable changes to the overall particle's structure. Herein, we demonstrate surface single&#8208;atom manipulation based on [Cu58H20PET36(PPh3)4]2+ (Cu58; PET: phenylethanethiolate; PPh3: triphenylphosphine), leading to the isostructural analogue [Cu57H20PET36(PPh3)4]+ (Cu57). Remarkably, this single surface atom drastically alters the catalytic reactivity of the nanoclusters.







Abstract
Elucidating single&#8208;atom effects on the fundamental properties of nanoparticles is challenging because single&#8208;atom modifications are typically accompanied by appreciable changes to the overall particle's structure. Herein, we report the synthesis of a [Cu58H20PET36(PPh3)4]2+ (Cu58; PET: phenylethanethiolate; PPh3: triphenylphosphine) nanocluster&#8212;an atomically precise nanoparticle&#8212;that can be transformed into the surface&#8208;defective analog [Cu57H20PET36(PPh3)4]+ (Cu57). Both nanoclusters are virtually identical, with five concentric metal shells, save for one missing surface copper atom in Cu57. Remarkably, the loss of this single surface atom drastically alters the reactivity of the nanocluster. In contrast to Cu58, Cu57 shows promising activity for click chemistry, particularly photoinduced [3+2] azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AAC), which is attributed to the active catalytic site in Cu57 after the removal of one surface copper atom. Our study not only presents a unique system for uncovering the effect of a single&#8208;surface atom modification on nanoparticle properties but also showcases single&#8208;atom surface modification as a powerful means for designing nanoparticle catalysts.

&lt;/b&gt;). Both nanoclusters are virtually identical, with five concentric metal shells, save for one missing surface copper atom in &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;. Remarkably, the loss of this single surface atom drastically alters the reactivity of the nanocluster. In contrast to &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;58&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; shows promising activity for click chemistry, particularly photoinduced [3+2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition (AAC), which is attributed to the active catalytic site in &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; after the removal of one surface copper atom. Our study not only presents a unique system for uncovering the effect of a single-surface atom modification on nanoparticle properties but also showcases single-atom surface modification as a powerful means for designing nanoparticle catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Homo&#8208;Mannich Reaction Strategy Enables Collective Access to Ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homo&#8208;Mannich reaction of cyclopropanol with an iminium ion, generated by an asymmetric allylic dearomatization of indole, has been developed to construct a tricyclic hydrocarbazole core. This approach enables a collective asymmetric synthesis of ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus alkaloids having either a five&#8208;, six&#8208;, or seven&#8208;membered E ring.







Abstract
We report here a homo&#8208;Mannich reaction of cyclopropanol with an iminium ion, generated by an asymmetric allylic dearomatization of indole, to construct a tricyclic hydrocarbazole core, which is shared by a variety of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids across families. Through this approach, an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center as well as an allyl and a ketone group were installed. Using this functionalized hydrocarbazole as the structural platform, D ring and E rings of different sizes (i.e., five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered) were successively or simultaneously assembled, leading to a collective asymmetric synthesis of seven alkaloids belonging to the ibophyllidine, Aspidosperma, Kopsia, and Melodinus alkaloid families.

         <title>Chiral Adaptive Induction of an Achiral Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Organic Framework by Dipeptides in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected chiral adaptive induction of an achiral CB[8]&#8208;based supramolecular organic framework (SOF) was explored, exhibiting the opposite CD and CPL spectra in the presence of L&#8208;TrpTrp and L&#8208;PhePhe, respectively. Furthermore, this SOF demonstrates the sequence&#8208;selective chiral induction for sequences&#8208;opposite Trp&#8208;/Phe&#8208;containing dipeptides, allowing for the discrimination and differentiation of these dipeptide sequences.







Abstract
Chiral induction by natural biomolecules can reveal the indispensable role of chiral structures in life and can be used to develop the chirality&#8208;sensing biomolecular recognition. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of an achiral supramolecular organic framework (SOF&#8208;1) constructed from cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and hexaphenylbenzene (HPB) derivative (1) in water. Due to the propeller&#8208;like rotational chiral conformation of HPB units and the specific recognition properties of CB[8], SOF&#8208;1 demonstrates chiral adaptive induction in water when interacting with the N&#8208;terminal Trp&#8208;/Phe&#8208;containing dipeptides including L&#8208;TrpX and L&#8208;PheX (X is an amino acid residue), respectively, exhibiting contrasting circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra. Consequently, SOF&#8208;1 has been developed as a supramolecular host and chiroptical sensor capable of recognizing and distinguishing the sequence&#8208;opposite Trp&#8208;/Phe&#8208;containing dipeptide pairs including L&#8208;TrpX/L&#8208;XTrp and L&#8208;PheX/L&#8208;XPhe based on the sequence&#8208;selective CD responses.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Atom Tunneling in a Homochiral Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How would a chiral environment impact the dynamics of hydrogen atoms? Using rotational spectroscopy in combination with the solutions of a simple one&#8208;dimensional Schr&#246;dinger equation approach, we revealed the intriguing distinctions of hydrogen atom dynamics between homochiral and heterochiral dimers of trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediol.







Abstract
The role&#8208;exchanging concerted torsional motion of two hydrogen atoms in the homochiral dimer of trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediol was characterized through a combination of broadband rotational spectroscopy and theoretical modeling. The results reveal that the concerted tunneling motion of the hydrogen atoms leads to the inversion of the sign of the dipole moment components along the a and b principal axes, due to the interchange motion that cooperatively breaks and reforms one intermolecular hydrogen bond. This motion is also coupled with two acceptor switching motions. The energy difference between the two ground vibrational states arising from this tunneling motion was determined to be 29.003(2) MHz. The corresponding wavefunctions suggest that the two hydrogen atoms are evenly delocalized on two equivalent potential wells, which differs from the heterochiral case where the hydrogen atoms are confined in separate wells, as the permutation&#8208;inversion symmetry breaks down. This intriguing contrast in hydrogen&#8208;atom behavior between homochiral and heterochiral environments could further illuminate our understanding of the role of chirality in intermolecular interactions and dynamics.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Responsive Ferrocene&#8208;Based Capsule Displaying Unusual Encapsulation&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative assembly of bent amphiphiles with two ferrocene units leads to a ferrocene&#8208;based capsule in water. Besides redox&#8208;responsive disassembly/assembly properties, the new capsule displays unusual host&#8208;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions upon encapsulation of electron&#8208;accepting molecules in the multi&#8208;ferrocene cavity. The CT interactions are facilely dissociated by a redox&#8208;triggered stimulus.







Abstract
A ferrocene&#8208;based capsule is spontaneously and quantitatively formed in water by the assembly of bent amphiphiles carrying two ferrocene units. The disassembly and assembly of the new organometallic capsule, with a well&#8208;defined and highly condensed ferrocene core, are demonstrated by chemical redox stimuli in a fully reversible fashion under ambient conditions. In contrast to previously reported multiferrocene assemblies, only the present capsule efficiently encapsulates typical organic/inorganic dyes as well as electron&#8208;accepting molecules in water. As a result, unusual host&#8208;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, displaying relatively wide absorption bands in the visible to near&#8208;infrared region (&#955;=650&#8211;1350&#8197;nm), are observed upon the encapsulation of acceptors (i.e., chloranil and TCNQ). The resultant encapsulation&#8208;induced CT interactions can be released by a redox stimulus through the disassembly of the capsule.

         <title>Achieving Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence in Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Phase Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long persistent luminescence (LPL) of 2D Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase perovskites based on the self&#8208;assembled 2D interlayer galleries structure is investigated. Through doping engineering, the LPL decay time is increased, the emission color is adjustable, and the thermal stability of PL is enhanced dramatically. Furthermore, we highlight the promising applications of Cs2CdCl4 perovskite systems in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;halide perovskites have been enriched over recent years to offer remarkable features from diverse chemical structures and environmental stability endowed with exciting functionalities in photoelectric detectors and phosphorescence systems. However, the low conversion efficiency of singlet to triplet in 2D hybrid halide perovskites reduces phosphorescence lifetimes. In this study, the long persistent luminescence of 2D all&#8208;inorganic perovskites with a self&#8208;assembled 2D interlayer galleries structure is investigated. The results show that the decay time of the long persistent luminescence increases from 450&#8197;s to 600&#8197;s, and the luminescence color changes from cyan to orange, and the thermal stability of photoluminescence enhances dramatically after replacing Cd2+ by appropriate Mn2+ ions in 2D Cs2CdCl4 Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase perovskites. Furthermore, diversified anti&#8208;counterfeiting modes are fabricated to highlight the promising applications of Cs2CdCl4 perovskite systems with tunable persistent luminescence in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Therefore, our studies provide a novel model for realizing tunable long persistent luminescence of perovskite with 2D self&#8208;assembled layered structure for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life, High&#8208;Rate Rechargeable Lithium Batteries Based on Soluble Bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) Disulfide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) disulfide (Pym2S2) has proven to be a high rate cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. The superdelocalization of pyrimidyl groups is reducing the S&#8722;S bond dissociation energy, which depletes the intrinsic energy barrier of dissociated electron transfer. The lithium half cell achieves 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C. In addition, the cell shows a capacity retention of 78.0&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles at 30&#8197;C.







Abstract
Organosulfides are promising candidates as cathode materials for the development of electric vehicles and energy storage systems due to their low&#8208;cost and high capacity properties. However, they generally suffer from slow kinetics because of the large rearrangement of S&#8722;S bonds and structural degradation upon cycling in batteries. In this paper, we reveal that soluble bis(2&#8208;pyrimidyl) disulfide (Pym2S2) can be a high&#8208;rate cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries. Benefiting from the superdelocalization of pyrimidyl group, the extra electrons prefer to be localized on the &#960;* (pyrimidyl group) than &#963;* (S&#8722;S bond) molecular orbitals initially, generating the anion&#8208;like intermedia of [Pym2S2]2&#8722; and thus decreasing the dissociation energy of the S&#8722;S bond. It makes the intrinsic energy barrier of dissociative electron transfer depleted, therefore the lithium half cell exhibits 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C. This study provides a distinct pathway for the design of high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life organic cathode materials.

         <dc:description>
The first report on electrochemical AuI/AuIII catalysis for 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of C&#8722;C multiple bonds has been presented. This external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free approach utilizes the anodic oxidation of vinyl&#8208;AuI to vinyl&#8208;AuIII complexes to achieve oxy&#8208;alkynylation of allenoates to access alkyne&#8208;substituted butenolides in an undivided cell.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first report of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of C&#8722;C multiple bonds using electrochemical gold redox catalysis. By adopting the electrochemical strategy, the inherent &#960;&#8208;activation and cross&#8208;coupling reactivity of gold catalysis are harnessed to develop the oxy&#8208;alkynylation of allenoates under external&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Detailed mechanistic investigations such as 31P NMR, control experiments, mass studies, and cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis have been performed to support the proposed reaction mechanism.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Difluoromethylation&#8208;Alkynylation of Olefins by Solving the Dilemma between Acidities and Reduction Potentials of Difluoromethylating Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear relationship between reduction potential differences (&#916;E) and substituent constants (&#963;) of aryl difluoromethyl sulfones provides a powerful strategy to solve the dilemma of acidities and reduction potentials of difluoromethylating agents. The strategy enabled achieving enantioselective difluoromethylation&#8208;alkynylation reactions of olefins with difluoromethyl 4&#8208;chlorophenyl sulfone.







Abstract
Molecules containing a difluoromethyl group or a propargylic stereocenter are widely used in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and 1,2&#8208;functionalization of olefins is an important method for introducing the two groups into molecules simultaneously. The construction of the propargylic stereocenter with terminal alkynes usually requires bases. However, difluoromethylating agents with high reduction potentials often decompose in the presence of bases because of their acidities, and those with low reduction potentials are stable but difficult to undergo the desired single electron transfer (SET) reduction. Using the linear relationship between reduction potential differences (&#916;E) and Hammett substituent constants (&#963;) of difluoromethyl aryl sulfones, we solved the dilemma between acidities and reduction potentials of difluoromethylating agents. Herein, we report the first enantioselective difluoromethylation&#8208;alkynylation of olefins with difluoromethyl 4&#8208;chlorophenyl sulfone with high enantioselectivity (&gt;90&#8201;% ee). We also extended this asymmetric fluoroalkylation&#8208;alkynylation reaction with other fluoroalkyl sulfones, which enabled efficient installation of trifluoromethyl, difluoroalkyl, difluorobenzyl, (benzenesulfonyl)&#8208;difluoromethyl and monofluoromethyl groups into products.

         <title>Dual&#8208;emissive Iridium(III) Complexes as Phosphorescent Probes with Orthogonal Responses to Analyte Binding and Oxygen Quenching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported dual&#8208;emissive iridium(III) complexes bearing a di(2&#8208;picolyl)&#8208;amine (DPA) unit, which exhibited green and red dual phosphorescence in aqueous solutions. The complexes exhibited static and dynamic phosphorescence quenching in response to copper(II) ions and oxygen, respectively, at different wavelengths, achieving colorimetric emission response in solutions and multichannel response in live cell imaging.







Abstract
Phosphorescent probes often show sensitive response toward analytes at a specific wavelength. However, oxygen quenching usually occurs at the same wavelength and thus hinders the accurate detection of analytes. In this study, we have developed dual&#8208;emissive iridium(III) complexes that exhibit phosphorescence responses to copper(II) ions at a wavelength distinct from that where oxygen quenching occurs. The complexes displayed colorimetric phosphorescence response in aqueous solutions under different copper(II) and oxygen conditions. In cellular imaging, variation in oxygen concentration over a large range from 5&#8201;% to 80&#8201;% can modulate the intensity and lifetime of green phosphorescence without affecting the response of red phosphorescence toward intracellular copper(II) ions.

     alt="Dual-emissive Iridium(III) Complexes as Phosphorescent Probes with Orthogonal Responses to Analyte Binding and Oxygen Quenching"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reported dual-emissive iridium(III) complexes bearing a di(2-picolyl)-amine (DPA) unit, which exhibited green and red dual phosphorescence in aqueous solutions. The complexes exhibited static and dynamic phosphorescence quenching in response to copper(II) ions and oxygen, respectively, at different wavelengths, achieving colorimetric emission response in solutions and multichannel response in live cell imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphorescent probes often show sensitive response toward analytes at a specific wavelength. However, oxygen quenching usually occurs at the same wavelength and thus hinders the accurate detection of analytes. In this study, we have developed dual-emissive iridium(III) complexes that exhibit phosphorescence responses to copper(II) ions at a wavelength distinct from that where oxygen quenching occurs. The complexes displayed colorimetric phosphorescence response in aqueous solutions under different copper(II) and oxygen conditions. In cellular imaging, variation in oxygen concentration over a large range from 5&#8201;% to 80&#8201;% can modulate the intensity and lifetime of green phosphorescence without affecting the response of red phosphorescence toward intracellular copper(II) ions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tribochemically Controlled Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Enabled by Contact Electrification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound or ball milling of piezoelectric particles to control atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) requires high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;frequency mechanical stimuli. Tribochemically controlled ATRP (tribo&#8208;ATRP) using titanium oxide particles and CuBr2/tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine enables a contact&#8208;electrification catalysis (ca. 10&#8197;Hz) and gives access to a variety of polymers with predetermined molecular weights, low dispersity, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.







Abstract
Traditional mechanochemically controlled reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) utilizes ultrasound or ball milling to regenerate activators, which induce side reactions because of the high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;frequency stimuli. Here, we propose a facile approach for tribochemically controlled atom transfer radical polymerization (tribo&#8208;ATRP) that relies on contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC) between titanium oxide (TiO2) particles and CuBr2/tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethylamine (TPMA), without any high&#8208;energy input. Under the friction induced by stirring, the TiO2 particles are electrified, continuously reducing CuBr2/TPMA into CuBr/TPMA, thereby conversing alkyl halides into active radicals to start ATRP. In addition, the effect of friction on the reaction was elucidated by theoretical simulation. The results indicated that increasing the frequency could reduce the energy barrier for the electron transfer from TiO2 particles to CuBr2/TPMA. In this study, the design of tribo&#8208;ATRP was successfully achieved, enabling CEC (ca. 10&#8197;Hz) access to a variety of polymers with predetermined molecular weights, low dispersity, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.

         <title>Reactivity Umpolung of Tertiary Amide Enabled by Catalytic Reductive Stannylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 37, September 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide carbonyl group usually serves as the electrophile, which can react with various nucleophiles. The current work shows a process to achieve the umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide carbonyl group. By leveraging this strategy, tertiary amide can react with a wide range of electrophiles to produce complex amines.







Abstract
Reactivity umpolung is an important concept in organic chemistry. Established reactivity umpolung mainly focuses on the aldehyde and umpolung of amide carbonyl group is not known. In this report, we describe a process to obtain the umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide. This process hinges on the efficient reductive stannylation catalyzed by Ir/silane and facile Sn&#8722;Li exchange. By leveraging this umpolung reactivity, drug Fluoxetine was derivatized to 12 different analogues via reacting with various electrophiles and four biologically active molecules were prepared concisely. This unlocked umpolung reactivity of tertiary amide is expected to find applications to synthesize complex amines from amides.

         <title>Proton Shuttling by Polyaniline of High Br&#248;nsted Basicity for Improved Electrocatalytic Ethylene Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid organic/inorganic composites with the organic phase tailored to modulatelocal chemical environment at the Cu surface arise as an enchanting category of catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A fundamental understanding on how the organics of different functionality, polarity, and hydrophobicity affect the reaction path is, however, still lacking to guide rational catalyst design. Herein, polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) manifesting different Br&#248;nsted basicity are compared for their regulatory roles on the CO2RR pathways regarding *CO coverage, proton source and interfacial polarity. Concerted efforts from in situ IR, Raman and operando modelling unveil that at the PPy/Cu interface with limited *CO coverage, hydridic *H produced by the Volmer step favors the carbon hydrogenation of *CO to form *CHO through a Tafel process; Whereas at the PANI/Cu interface with concentrated CO2 and high *CO coverage, protonic H+ shuttled through the benzenoid &#8722;NH&#8722; protonates the oxygen of *CO, yielding *COH for asymmetric coupling with nearby *CO to form *OCCOH under favored energetics. As a result of the tailored chemical environment, the restructured PANI/Cu composite demonstrates a high partial current density of 0.41 A cm&#8208;2 at a maximal Faraday efficiency of 67.5% for ethylene production, ranking among states of the art.</dc:description>

Herein, polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) manifesting different Br&#248;nsted basicity are compared for their regulatory roles on the CO2RR pathways regarding *CO coverage, proton source and interfacial polarity. Concerted efforts from in situ IR, Raman and operando modelling unveil that at the PPy/Cu interface with limited *CO coverage, hydridic *H produced by the Volmer step favors the carbon hydrogenation of *CO to form *CHO through a Tafel process; Whereas at the PANI/Cu interface with concentrated CO2 and high *CO coverage, protonic H+ shuttled through the benzenoid &#8722;NH&#8722; protonates the oxygen of *CO, yielding *COH for asymmetric coupling with nearby *CO to form *OCCOH under favored energetics. As a result of the tailored chemical environment, the restructured PANI/Cu composite demonstrates a high partial current density of 0.41 A cm-2 at a maximal Faraday efficiency of 67.5% for ethylene production, ranking among states of the art.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defect Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Accelerated Structural Transformation for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been increasingly applied in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the surface of MOFs usually undergoes structural transformation to form  metal  oxyhydroxides to serve as catalytically active sites. However, the controllable regulation of the reconstruction process of MOFs remains as a great challenge. Here we report a defect engineering strategy to facilitate the structural transformation of MOFs to metal oxyhydroxides during OER with enhanced activity. Defective MOFs (denoted as NiFc'xFc1&#8722;x) with abundant unsaturated metal sites are constructed by mixing ligands of 1,1'&#8208;ferrocene dicarboxylic acid (Fc') and defective ferrocene carboxylic acid (Fc). NiFc'xFc1&#8722;xseries are more prone to be transformed to metal oxyhydroxides compared with the non&#8208;defective MOFs (NiFc'). Moreover, the as&#8208;formed metal oxyhydroxides derived from defective MOFs contain more oxygen vacancies. NiFc'Fc grown on nickel foam exhibits excellent OER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 213 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2, superior to that of undefective NiFc'. Experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that the abundant oxygen vacancies in the derived metal oxyhydroxides facilitate the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates on active centers, thus significantly improving the OER activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Sono&#8208;immunotherapy holds great potential for deep tumor inhibition; however, smart sono&#8208;therapeutic agents to simultaneously eliminate &#8216;domestic&#8217; tumor cells and regulate the &#8216;community&#8217; tumor immune microenvironment have rarely been developed. Herein, we report a spatiotemporally controllable semiconducting iron&#8208;chelated nano&#8208;metallomodulator (SINM) for hypersensitive sono&#8208;metallo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer. SINM consists of a semiconducting polymer (SP) backbone chelating iron ions (Fe3+) with thiophene&#8208;based Schiff base structure, and a hydrophilic side chain. Upon accumulation in tumor after systemic administration, SINM specifically arouses ferroptosis and M1 macrophage polarization due to its response toward the tumor redox environment; meanwhile, the chelation of Fe3+ enhances the sono&#8208;sensitizing effect of SPs, leading to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species for immunogenic cell death. Such combined sonodynamic metallo&#8208;immunotherapy of SINM efficiently ablates deep tumor and spatiotemporally regulates immunophenotypes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic growth of macroscopically structured supramolecular hydrogels through orchestrated reaction&#8208;diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Living organisms are capable of dynamically changing their structures for adaptive functions through sophisticated reaction&#8208;diffusion process. Here we show how active supramolecular hydrogels with programmable lifetime and macroscopic structures can be created relying on a simple reaction&#8208;diffusion strategy. Two hydrogel precursors (poly(acrylic acid) PAA/CaCl2 and Na2CO3) diffuse from different locations and generate amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) nanoparticles at the diffusional fronts, leading to formation of hydrogel structures driven by electrostatic interaction between PAA and ACC nanoparticles. Interestingly, the formed hydrogels are capable of autonomously disintegrating over time because of a delayed influx of electrostatic interaction inhibitors (NaCl). The hydrogel growth process is well explained by a reaction&#8208;diffusion model which offers a theoretical means to program the dynamic growth of structured hydrogels. Furthermore, we demonstrate a conceptual access to dynamic information storage in soft materials using the developed reaction&#8208;diffusion strategy. This work may serve as a starting point for the development of life&#8208;like materials with adaptive structures and functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Precision Graphene Nanoribbon Heterojunctions by Chain&#8208;Growth Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated the controlled synthesis of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) heterojunctions for the first time from block polyphenylene precursor that was achieved by chain&#8208;growth polymerization. This synthetic strategy opens a door for the rational synthesis of unexplored GNR heterojunctions with diverse topologies and emerging physicochemical properties.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. In particular, GNR heterojunctions have received considerable attention due to their exotic topological electronic phases at the heterointerface. However, strategies for their precision synthesis remain at a nascent stage. Here, we report a novel chain&#8208;growth polymerization strategy that allows for constructing GNR heterojunction with N=9 armchair and chevron GNRs segments (9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR). The synthesis involves a controlled Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization (SCTP) between 2&#8208;(6&#8242;&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;ditetradecyl&#8208;[1,1&#8242;:2&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;yl) boronic ester (M1) and 2&#8208;(7&#8208;bromo&#8208;9,12&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;tetradecylphenyl)&#8208;triphenylene&#8208;2&#8208;yl) boronic ester (M2), followed by the Scholl reaction of the obtained block copolymer (poly&#8208;M1/M2) with controlled Mn (18&#8197;kDa) and narrow &#272; (1.45). NMR and SEC analysis of poly&#8208;M1/M2 confirm the successful block copolymerization. The solution&#8208;mediated cyclodehydrogenation of poly&#8208;M1/M2 toward 9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR is unambiguously validated by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV/Vis spectroscopies. Moreover, we also demonstrate the on&#8208;surface formation of pristine 9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR from the unsubstituted copolymer precursor, which is unambiguously characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

         <title>An Asymmetric Hydrogenation/N&#8208;Alkylation Sequence for a Step&#8208;Economical Route to Indolizidines and Quinolizidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines and subsequent N&#8208;alkylation lead to indolizidines and quinolizidines. The presence of Cl&#8722; results in retention of the absolute configuration of the initially formed alcohol. Noncovalent interactions, H&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and electrostatic interactions also play important roles in regulating the stereoselectivity of the reaction process.







Abstract
The direct catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines for the synthesis of piperidines remains a challenge. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines with subsequent N&#8208;alkylation using a traceless Br&#248;nsted acid activation strategy. Catalyzed by an iridium&#8208;BINAP complex, the substrates undergo ketone reduction, cyclization and pyridine hydrogenation in sequence to form indolizidines and quinolizidines. The absolute configuration of the stereocenter of the alcohol is retained and influences the formation of the second stereocenter. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies reveal that the chloride anion and certain noncovalent interactions govern the stereoselectivity of the cascade reaction throughout the catalytic process.

         <title>The Role of Chemically Innocent Polyanions in Active, Chemically Fueled Complex Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In chemically fueled complex coacervates, the binding affinity of a peptide building block towards a polyanion can be tuned by a chemical reaction cycle. Beyond the kinetics of the reaction cycle, the interaction of the precursor peptide with the polyanion can influence the droplet lifetime significantly. Strong interactions between the peptide and the polyelectrolytes lead to delayed dissolution of the active droplets but can be controlled further.







Abstract
Complex coacervation describes the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of oppositely charged polymers. Active coacervates are droplets in which one of the electrolyte's affinity is regulated by chemical reactions. These droplets are particularly interesting because they are tightly regulated by reaction kinetics. For example, they serve as a model for membraneless organelles that are also often regulated by biochemical transformations such as post&#8208;translational modifications. They are also a great protocell model or could be used to synthesize life&#8211;they spontaneously emerge in response to reagents, compete, and decay when all nutrients have been consumed. However, the role of the unreactive building blocks, e.g., the polymeric compounds, is poorly understood. Here, we show the important role of the chemically innocent, unreactive polyanion of our chemically fueled coacervation droplets. We show that the polyanion drastically influences the resulting droplets&#8242; life cycle without influencing the chemical reaction cycle&#8211;either they are very dynamic or have a delayed dissolution. Additionally, we derive a mechanistic understanding of our observations and show how additives and rational polymer design help to create the desired coacervate emulsion life cycles.

         <title>Multiblock Copolymers Based on Highly Crystalline Polyethylene and Soft Poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) Segments: Towards Polyolefin Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Block copolymers of highly crystalline polyethylene and soft ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) were prepared in a single reactor by coordinative chain transfer polymerization. Triblock and multiblock copolymers self&#8208;organized into lamellar structures and displayed excellent mechanical properties leading to a new class of polyolefin thermoplastic elastomers.







Abstract
Block copolymers based on polyethylene (PE) and ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) were obtained by successive controlled coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) of a mixture of ethylene and butadiene (80/20) and pure ethylene. EBR&#8208;b&#8208;PE diblock copolymers were synthesized using the {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 complex in combination with n&#8208;butyl,n&#8208;octyl magnesium (BOMAG) used as both the alkylating and chain transfer agent (CTA). Triblock and multiblock copolymers featuring highly semi&#8208;crystalline PE hard segments and soft EBR segments were further obtained by the development of a bimetallic CTA, the pentanediyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;di(magnesium bromide) (PDMB). These new block copolymers undergo crystallization&#8208;driven organization into lamellar structures and exhibit a variety of mechanical properties, including excellent extensibility and elastic recovery in the case of triblock and multiblock copolymers.

         <title>Synthetic Heparanase Inhibitors Can Prevent Herpes Simplex Viral Spread</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of heparan sulfate (HS) oligossacharides was synthesized by a modular synthetic approach and evaluated as human heparanase (Hpse) inhibitors. Treatment of herpes simplex&#8208;1 virus (HSV&#8208;1) infected corneal epithelial cells with synthetic HS oligosaccharide inhibitors prevented shedding of cell&#8208;surface HS, thereby impeding viral release and spread to other cells.







Abstract
Herpes simplex virus (HSV&#8208;1) employs heparan sulfate (HS) as receptor for cell attachment and entry. During late&#8208;stage infection, the virus induces the upregulation of human heparanase (Hpse) to remove cell surface HS allowing viral spread. We hypothesized that inhibition of Hpse will prevent viral release thereby representing a new therapeutic strategy for HSV&#8208;1. A range of HS&#8208;oligosaccharides was prepared to examine the importance of chain length and 2&#8208;O&#8208;sulfation of iduronic moieties for Hpse inhibition. It was found that hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides potently inhibited the enzyme and that 2&#8208;O&#8208;sulfation of iduronic acid is tolerated. Computational studies provided a rationale for the observed structure&#8211;activity relationship. Treatment of human corneal epithelial cells (HCEs) infected with HSV&#8208;1 with the hexa&#8208; and octasaccharide blocked viral induced shedding of HS which significantly reduced spread of virions. The compounds also inhibited migration and proliferation of immortalized HCEs thereby providing additional therapeutic properties.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization of a High&#8208;Spin Aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;Triangulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;triangulene was synthesized using on&#8208;surface synthesis strategies and its structure imaged with bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy. A cationic ground state with high spin was deduced by detection of a weak zero&#8208;bias spectral resonance, which splits with magnetic fields, attributed to the Kondo effect. The precise spin state and charge stabilization on a gold surface was corroborated by combining advanced theoretical models.







Abstract
Triangulenes are a class of open&#8208;shell triangular graphene flakes with total spin increasing with their size. In the last years, on&#8208;surface&#8208;synthesis strategies have permitted fabricating and engineering triangulenes of various sizes and structures with atomic precision. However, direct proof of the increasing total spin with their size remains elusive. In this work, we report the combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis of a large nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene (aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;triangulene) on a Au(111) surface, and the detection of its high&#8208;spin ground state. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy images uncovered radical states distributed along the zigzag edges, which were detected as weak zero&#8208;bias resonances in scanning tunneling spectra. These spectral features reveal the partial Kondo screening of a high&#8208;spin state. Through a combination of several simulation tools, we find that the observed distribution of radical states is explained by a quintet ground state (S=2), instead of the quartet state (S=3/2) expected for the neutral species. This confirms that electron transfer to the metal substrate raises the spin of the ground state. We further provide a qualitative description of the change of (anti)aromaticity introduced by N&#8208;substitution, and its role in the charge stabilization on a surface, resulting in an S=2 aza&#8208;triangulene on Au(111).

         <title>Enhanced Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation by Interfacial Phase Transition and Photothermal Effect in Multiply Heterostructured Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S Nanohybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the low formation energy of Co3S4/Cu2S interface (&#8722;7.61&#8197;eV), the integration of Co9S8 and Cu2S tends to induce the interface phase transition of Co9S8, leading to multiple heterogeneous Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S nanohybrids, with reduced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) energy barrier, increased charge carrier density and notable photothermal effect, thereby contributing to remarkable electrocatalytic OER and overall water splitting performances.







Abstract
The rational design of advanced nanohybrids (NHs) with optimized interface electronic environment and rapid reaction kinetics is pivotal to electrocatalytic schedule. Herein, we developed a multiple heterogeneous Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S nanoparticle in which Co3S4 germinates between Co9S8 and Cu2S. Using high&#8208;angle annular&#8208;dark&#8208;field imaging and theoretical calculation, it was found that the integration of Co9S8 and Cu2S tends to trigger the interface phase transition of Co9S8, leading to Co3S4 interlayer due to the low formation energy of Co3S4/Cu2S (&#8722;7.61&#8197;eV) than Co9S8/Cu2S (&#8722;5.86&#8197;eV). Such phase transition not only lowers the energy barrier of oxygen evolution reaction (OER, from 0.335&#8197;eV to 0.297&#8197;eV), but also increases charge carrier density (from 7.76&#215;1014 to 2.09&#215;1015&#8197;cm&#8722;3), and creates more active sites. Compared to Co9S8 and Cu2S, the Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S NHs also demonstrate notable photothermal effect that can heat the catalyst locally, offset the endothermic enthalpy change of OER, and promote carrier migrate, reaction intermediates adsorption/deprotonation to improve reaction kinetics. Profiting from these favorable factors, the Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S catalyst only requires an OER overpotential of 181&#8197;mV and overall water splitting cell voltage of 1.43&#8197;V to driven 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared light, outperforming those without light irradiation and many reported Co&#8208;based catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Due to the low formation energy of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S interface (&#8722;7.61&#8197;eV), the integration of Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S tends to induce the interface phase transition of Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to multiple heterogeneous Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nanohybrids, with reduced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) energy barrier, increased charge carrier density and notable photothermal effect, thereby contributing to remarkable electrocatalytic OER and overall water splitting performances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rational design of advanced nanohybrids (NHs) with optimized interface electronic environment and rapid reaction kinetics is pivotal to electrocatalytic schedule. Herein, we developed a multiple heterogeneous Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nanoparticle in which Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; germinates between Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Using high-angle annular-dark-field imaging and theoretical calculation, it was found that the integration of Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S tends to trigger the interface phase transition of Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; interlayer due to the low formation energy of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (&#8722;7.61&#8197;eV) than Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (&#8722;5.86&#8197;eV). Such phase transition not only lowers the energy barrier of oxygen evolution reaction (OER, from 0.335&#8197;eV to 0.297&#8197;eV), but also increases charge carrier density (from 7.76&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; to 2.09&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and creates more active sites. Compared to Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, the Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S NHs also demonstrate notable photothermal effect that can heat the catalyst locally, offset the endothermic enthalpy change of OER, and promote carrier migrate, reaction intermediates adsorption/deprotonation to improve reaction kinetics. Profiting from these favorable factors, the Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S catalyst only requires an OER overpotential of 181&#8197;mV and overall water splitting cell voltage of 1.43&#8197;V to driven 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under the irradiation of near-infrared light, outperforming those without light irradiation and many reported Co-based catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversely Trapping Isolated Atoms in High Oxidation State for Accelerating the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable atom&#8208;trapping strategy is developed to extract isolated Mo atom from the a&#8208;MoOx@CoSe2 pre&#8208;catalyst into CoOOH through an ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;reconstruction process during the OER process. The single Mo&#8208;atom decoration shifts the oxidation cycle of Co sites towards a more energetically favored rate&#8208;limiting process, resulting in outstanding OER activity.







Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to the energy conversion and storage devices. However, the structural complexity of heterogeneous electrocatalysts makes it a great challenge to elucidate the dynamic structural evolution and OER mechanisms. Here, we develop a controllable atom&#8208;trapping strategy to extract isolated Mo atom from the amorphous MoOx&#8208;decorated CoSe2 (a&#8208;MoOx@CoSe2) pre&#8208;catalyst into Co&#8208;based oxyhydroxide (Mo&#8208;CoOOH) through an ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;reconstruction process during the OER process. This conceptual advance has been validated by operando characterizations, which reveals that the initially rapid Mo leaching can expedite the dynamic reconstruction of pre&#8208;catalyst, and simultaneously trap Mo species in high oxidation state into the lattice of in situ generated CoOOH support. Impressively, the OER kinetics of CoOOH has been greatly accelerated after the reverse decoration of Mo species, in which the Mo&#8208;CoOOH affords a markedly decreased overpotential of 297&#8197;mV at the current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Co species have been greatly activated via the effective electron coupling with Mo species in high oxidation state. These findings open new avenues toward directly synthesizing atomically dispersed electrocatalysts for high&#8208;efficiency water splitting.

         <title>Durable Multiblock Poly(biphenyl alkylene) Anion Exchange Membranes with Microphase Separation for Hydrogen Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiblock poly(biphenyl ammonium&#8208;b&#8208;biphenyl phenyl) was successfully synthesized, which displayed excellent OH&#8722; conductivity of 162.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 along with a low swelling rate of 26.3&#8201;% (80&#8201;&#176;C). Importantly, the related anion exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells possessed a peak power density of 2.41&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the AEM water electrolysis achieved a current density of 6.25&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V along with outstanding in situ durability for 3250&#8197;h.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolysis (AEMWE) show great application potential in the field of hydrogen energy conversion technology. However, scalable anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with desirable properties are still lacking, which greatly hampers the commercialization of this technology. Herein, we propose a series of novel multiblock AEMs based on ether&#8208;free poly(biphenyl ammonium&#8208;b&#8208;biphenyl phenyl)s (PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPPs) that are suitable for use in high performance AEMFC and AEMWE systems because of their well&#8208;formed microphase separation structures. The developed AEMs achieved outstanding OH&#8722; conductivity (162.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C) with a low swelling ratio, good alkaline stability, and excellent mechanical durability (tensile strength &gt;31&#8197;MPa and elongation at break &gt;147&#8201;% after treatment in 2&#8197;M NaOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 3750&#8197;h). A PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPP&#8208;based AEMFC demonstrated a remarkable peak power density of 2.41&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and in situ durability for 330&#8197;h under 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 70&#8201;&#176;C. An AEMWE device showed a promising performance (6.25&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V, 80&#8201;&#176;C) and outstanding in situ durability for 3250&#8197;h with a low voltage decay rate (&lt;28&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1). The newly developed PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPP AEMs thus show great application prospects for energy conversion devices.

         <title>Repurposing Iron&#8208; and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Oxygenases to Catalyze Olefin Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that the 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate coordination triad commonly deployed in Fe/2OG&#8208;dependent enzymes can be used as a general ligand system to support sequential hydrogen atom transfer and oxygenation at a mononuclear iron center. This new type of reactivity not observed in nature delivered Mukaiyama hydration products of various styrene derivatives.







Abstract
Mononuclear nonheme iron(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (Fe/2OG)&#8208;dependent oxygenases and halogenases are known to catalyze a diverse set of oxidative reactions, including hydroxylation, halogenation, epoxidation, and desaturation in primary metabolism and natural product maturation. However, their use in abiotic transformations has mainly been limited to C&#8722;H oxidation. Herein, we show that various enzymes of this family, when reconstituted with Fe(II) or Fe(III), can catalyze Mukaiyama hydration&#8212;a redox neutral transformation. Distinct from the native reactions of the Fe/2OG enzymes, wherein oxygen atom transfer (OAT) catalyzed by an iron&#8208;oxo species is involved, this nonnative transformation proceeds through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathway in a 2OG&#8208;independent manner. Additionally, in contrast to conventional inorganic catalysts, wherein a dinuclear iron species is responsible for HAT, the Fe/2OG enzymes exploit a mononuclear iron center to support this reaction. Collectively, our work demonstrates that Fe/2OG enzymes have utility in catalysis beyond the current scope of catalytic oxidation.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Cosmosporasides Reveals the Assembly Line for Fungal Hybrid Terpenoid Saccharides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly line for the fungal hybrid terpenoid saccharide cosmosporaside C (1) has been elucidated. By conducting genome mining from Fusarium orthoceras, a cos cluster was identified. A UbiA family intramembrane prenyltransferase (UbiA&#8208;type PT), a cytochrome P450, an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;hydrolase, an acetyltransferase, a dimethylallyl transferase (DMAT&#8208;type PT), and a glycosyltransferase work in synergy to synthesize 1 using primary central metabolites.







Abstract
Fungal hybrid terpenoid saccharides constitute a new and growing family of natural products with significant biomedical and agricultural activities. One representative family is the cosmosporasides, which feature oxidized terpenoid units and saccharide moieties; however, the assembly line of these building blocks has been elusive. Herein, a cos cluster from Fusarium orthoceras was discovered for the synthesis of cosmosporaside C (1) by genome mining. A UbiA family intramembrane prenyltransferase (UbiA&#8208;type PT), a multifunctional cytochrome P450, an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;hydrolase, an acetyltransferase, a dimethylallyl transferase (DMAT&#8208;type PT) and a glycosyltransferase function cooperatively in the assembly of the scaffold of 1 using primary central metabolites. The absolute configuration at C4, C6 and C7 of 1 was also established. Our work clarifies the unexpected functions of UbiA&#8208;type and DMAT&#8208;type PTs and provides an example for understanding the synthetic logic of hybrid terpenoid saccharides in fungi.

         <title>Highly Selective Electrocatalytic Olefin Hydrogenation in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic hydrogenation of purely aliphatic and functionalized olefins was achieved by using graphdiyne&#8208;based copper oxide quantum dots as cathodic electrodes and water as the hydrogen source, with high activity and selectivity in aqueous solution at high current density under ambient temperature and pressure.







Abstract
Selective hydrogenation of olefins with water as the hydrogen source at ambient conditions is still a big challenge in the field of catalysis. Herein, the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of purely aliphatic and functionalized olefins was achieved by using graphdiyne based copper oxide quantum dots (CuxO/GDY) as cathodic electrodes and water as the hydrogen source, with high activity and selectivity in aqueous solution at high current density under ambient temperature and pressure. In particular, the sp&#8208;/sp2&#8208;hybridized graphdiyne catalyst allows the selective hydrogenation of cis&#8208;trans isomeric olefins. The chemical and electronic structure of the GDY results in the incomplete charge transfer between GDY and Cu atoms to optimize the adsorption/desorption of the reaction intermediates and results in high reaction selectivity and activity for hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Photoswitching of Diphosphene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although diphosphene transition metal complexes are known to undergo E to Z isomerization upon irradiation with UV light, their potential for photoswitching has remained poorly explored. In this study, we present diphosphene complexes capable of reversible photoisomerizations through haptotropic rearrangements. The compounds [(2&#8208;&#954;2P,&#954;6C)Mo(CO)2][OTf] (3a[OTf]), [(2&#8208;&#954;2P,&#954;6C)Fe(CO)][OTf] (3b[OTf]), and [(2&#8208;&#954;2P)Fe(CO)4][OTf] (4[OTf]) were prepared using the triflate salt [(LC)P=P(Dipp)]OTf (2[OTf) as a precursor (LC = 4,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisiopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisiopropylphenyl, OTf = triflate). Upon exposure to blue or UV light (&#955; = 400 nm, 470 nm), the initially red&#8208;colored &#414;2&#8208;diphosphene complexes 3a,b[OTf] readily undergo isomerization to form blue&#8208;colored &#414;1&#8208;complexes [(2&#8208;&#954;1P,&#954;6C)M(CO)n][OTf] (5a,b[OTf]; a: M = Mo, n = 2; b: M = Fe, n = 1). This haptotropic rearrangement is reversible, and the (&#954;2P,&#954;6C)&#8208;coordination mode gradually reverts back upon dissolution in coordinating solvents or more rapidly upon exposure to yellow or red irradiation (&#955; = 590 nm, 630 nm). The electronic reasons for the reversible visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoswitching observed for 3a,b[OTf] are elucidated by DFT calculations. These calculations indicate that the photochromic isomerization originates from the S1 excited state and proceeds through a conical intersection.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Protein Adhesives through Lanthanide&#8208;enhanced Structure Folding and Stack Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generating strong adhesion by engineered proteins has the potential for high technical applications. Current studies of adhesive proteins are primarily limited to marine organisms, e.g., mussel adhesive proteins. Here, we present a modular engineering strategy to generate a type of exotic protein adhesives with super strong adhesion behaviors. In the protein complexes, the lanmodulin (LanM) underwent &#945;&#8208;helical conformational transition induced by lanthanides, thereby enhancing the stacking density and molecular interactions of adhesive protein. The resulting adhesives exhibited outstanding lap&#8208;shear strength of ~31.7 MPa, surpassing many supramolecular and polymer adhesives. The extreme temperature (&#8208;196 to 200&#176;C) resistance capacity and underwater adhesion performance can significantly broaden their practical application scenarios. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments further demonstrated the persistent adhesion performance for surgical sealing and healing applications.</dc:description>

Native hydrogenases use Earth&#8208;abundant metals, but these cannot be applied for organic synthesis due, in part, to their substrate specificity. Herein, we report the design and development of manganese transfer hydrogenases based on the biotin&#8208;streptavidin technology. By incorporating bio&#8208;mimetic Mn(I) complexes into the binding cavity of streptavidin, and through chemo&#8208;genetic optimization, we have obtained artificial enzymes that hydrogenate ketones with nearly quantitative yield and up to 98% enantiomeric excess (ee). These enzymes exhibit broad substrate scope and high functional&#8208;group tolerance. According to QM/MM calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallography, the S112Y mutation, combined with the appropriate chemical structure of the Mn cofactor plays a critical role in the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the artificial metalloenzyme (ArMs). Our work highlights the potential of ArMs incorporating base&#8208;meal cofactors for enantioselective organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Retrosynthetic Analysis Applied to Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis of Four Rh(II)&#8208;Based Complexes as Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clip&#8208;off Chemistry is a synthetic strategy that our group previously developed to obtain new molecules and materials through selective cleavage of bonds. Herein, we report recent work to expand Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by introducing into it a retrosynthetic analysis step that, based on virtual extension of the products through cleavable bonds, enables one to define the required precursor materials. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we have validated our new approach by synthesising and characterising four aldehyde&#8208;functionalised Rh(II)&#8208;based complexes: a homoleptic cluster; a cis&#8208;disubstituted paddlewheel cluster; a macrocycle; and a crown.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium/Norbornene&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Vicinal Di&#8208;Carbo&#8208;Functionalization of Indoles: Reaction Development and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods that can simultaneously install multiple different functional groups to heteroarenes via C&#8722;H functionalizations are valuable for complex molecule synthesis, which, however, remain challenging to realize. Here we report the development of vicinal di&#8208;carbo&#8208;functionalization of indoles in a site&#8208; and regioselective manner, enabled by the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis. The reaction is initiated by the Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C3&#8208;metalation and specifically promoted by the C1&#8208;substituted NBEs. The mild, scalable, and robust reaction conditions allow for a good substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. The resulting C2&#8208;arylated C3&#8208;alkenylated indoles can be converted to diverse synthetically useful scaffolds. The combined experimental and computational mechanistic study reveals the unique role of the C1&#8208;substituted NBE in accelerating the turnover&#8208;limiting oxidative addition step.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Rational design and engineering of high&#8208;performance molecular sieve membranes towards C2H4/C2H6 and flue gas separations remain a grand challenge to date. In this study, through combining pore micro&#8208;environment engineering with meso&#8208;structure manipulation, highly c&#8208;oriented sub&#8208;100 nm&#8208;thick Cu@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 membrane was successfully prepared. Coordinatively unsaturated Cu ions immobilized in the NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 framework enabled high&#8208;affinity &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions with C2H4, resulting in an C2H4/C2H6 selectivity approaching 13.6, which was 9.4 times higher than that of pristine NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 membrane; moreover, benefiting from &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions between CO2 and Cu(I) sites, our membrane displayed superior CO2/N2 selectivity of 43.2 with CO2 permeance of 696 GPU, which far surpassed the benchmark of other pure MOF membranes. The above multi&#8208;scale structure optimization strategy is anticipated to present opportunities for significantly enhancing the separation performance of diverse molecular sieve membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional MFI&#8208;type Zeolite Flow Battery Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium flow battery (VFB) is one of the most reliable stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage technologies, and a membrane with high vanadium resistance and proton conductivity is essential for manufacturing high&#8208;performance VFBs. In this study, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane was fabricated from zeolite nanosheet modules, which displayed excellent vanadium resistance (0.07 mmol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) and proton conductivity (0.16 S cm&#8208;1), yielding a coulombic efficiency of 93.9%, a voltage efficiency of 87.6%, and an energy efficiency of 82.3% at 40 mA cm&#8208;2. The self&#8208;discharge period of a VFB equipped with 2D MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane increased up to 116.2 h, which was significantly longer than that of the commercial perfluorinated sulfonate membrane (45.9 h). Furthermore, the corresponding battery performance remained stable over 1000 cycles (&gt; 1500 h) at 80 mA cm&#8208;2. These findings demonstrate that 2D MFI&#8208;type membranes are promising ion&#8208;conductive membranes applicable for stationary electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Methylation Approach to Salt&#8208;Concentrated Hydrogel Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Life Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogel electrolytes hold great promise in developing flexible and safe batteries, but the presence of free solvent water makes battery chemistries constrained by H2 evolution and electrode dissolution. Although maximizing salt concentration is recognized as an effective strategy to reduce water activity, the protic polymer matrices in classical hydrogels are occupied with hydrogen&#8208;bonding and barely involved in the salt dissolution, which sets limitations on realizing stable salt&#8208;concentrated environments before polymer&#8208;salt phase separation occurs. Inspired by the role of protein methylation in regulating intracellular phase separation, here we transform the &#8220;inert&#8221; protic polymer skeletons into aprotic ones through methylation modification to weaken the hydrogen&#8208;bonding, which releases free hydrogen bond acceptors as Lewis base sites to participate in cation solvation and thus assist salt dissolution. An unconventionally salt&#8208;concentrated hydrogel electrolyte reaching a salt fraction up to 44 mol% while retaining a high Na+/H2O molar ratio of 1.0 is achieved without phase separation. Almost all water molecules are confined in the solvation shell of Na+ with depressed activity and mobility, which addresses water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions that limit the practical rechargeability of aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The assembled Na3V2(PO4)3//NaTi2(PO4)3 cell maintains 82.8% capacity after 580 cycles, which is the longest cycle life reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthesis and Microanalysis in Thin Layer: An Electrochemical Pipette for Rapid Electrolysis and Mechanistic Study of Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemistry represents unique approaches for the promotion and mechanistic study of chemical reactions and has garnered increasing attention in different areas of chemistry. This expansion necessitates the enhancement of the traditional electrochemical cells that are intrinsically constrained by mass transport limitations. Herein, we present an approach for designing an electrochemical cell by limiting the reaction chamber to a thin layer of solution, comparable to the thickness of the diffusion layer. This thin layer electrode (TLE) provides a modular platform to bypass the constraints of traditional electrolysis cells and perform electrolysis reactions in the timescale of electroanalytical techniques. The utility of the TLE for electrosynthetic applications benchmarked using NHPI&#8208;mediated electrochemical C&#8208;H functionalization. The application of microscale electrolysis for the study of drug metabolites was showcased by elucidating the oxidation pathways of the paracetamol drug. Moreover, hosting a microelectrode in the TLE, was shown to enable real&#8208;time probing of the profiles of redox&#8208;active components of these rapid electrosynthesis reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilizing the Hofmeister Effect to Induce Hydrogelation of Nonionic Supramolecular Polymers into a Therapeutic Depot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonionic hydrogels are of particular interest for long&#8208;term therapeutic implantation due to their minimal immunogenicity relative to their charged counterparts. However, in&#8208;situ formation of nonionic supramolecular hydrogels under physiological conditions has been a challenging task. In this context, we report on our discovery of salt&#8208;triggered hydrogelation of nonionic supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed by self&#8208;assembling prodrug hydrogelators (SAPHs) through the Hofmeister effect. The designed SAPHs consist of two SN&#8208;38 units, which is an active metabolite of the anticancer drug irinotecan, and a short peptide grafted with two or four oligoethylene glycol (OEG) segments. Upon self&#8208;assembly in water, the resultant nonionic SPs can be triggered to gel upon addition of phosphate salts. Our 1H&#8208;NMR studies revealed that the added phosphates led to a change in the chemical shift of the methylene protons, suggestive of a disruption of the water&#8208;ether hydrogen bonds and consequent reorganization of the hydration shell surrounding the SPs. This deshielding effect, commensurate with the amount of salt added, likely promoted associative interactions among the SAPH filaments to percolate into a 3D network. The formed hydrogels exhibited a sustained release profile of SN&#8208;38 hydrogelator that acted potently against cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetoresistance in Organic Spin Valves Based on Acid&#8208;Exfoliated 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a burgeoning class of crystalline porous materials, have made significant progress in their application to optoelectronic devices such as field&#8208;effect transistors, memristors, and photodetectors. However, the insoluble features of microcrystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF powders limit development of their thin film devices. Additionally, the exploration of spin transport properties in this category of &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton materials remains vacant thus far. Herein, an imine&#8208;linked 2D Py&#8208;Np COF nanocrystalline powder was synthesized by Schiff base condensation of 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehyde. Then, we prepared a large&#8208;scale free&#8208;standing Py&#8208;Np COF film via a top&#8208;down strategy of chemically assisted acid exfoliation. Moreover, high&#8208;quality COF films acted as active layers were transferred onto ferromagnetic La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) electrodes for the first attempt to fabricate organic spin valves (OSVs) based on 2D COF materials. This COF&#8208;based OSV device with a configuration of LSMO/Py&#8208;Np COF/Co/Au demonstrated a remarkable magnetoresistance (MR) value up to &#8208;26.5% at 30 K. Meanwhile, the MR behavior of the COF&#8208;based OSVs exhibited a highly temperature dependence and operational stability. This work highlights the enormous application prospects of 2D COFs in organic spintronics and provides a promising approach for developing electronic and spintronic devices based on acid&#8208;exfoliated COF thin films.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Bacteria Labeled with Iridium(III) Photosensitizers for Enhanced Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite metal&#8208;based photosensitizers showing great potential in photodynamic therapy for tumor treatment, the application of the photosensitizers is intrinsically limited by their poor cancer&#8208;targeting properties. Herein, we reported a metal&#8208;based photosensitizer&#8208;bacteria hybrid, Ir&#8208;HEcN, via covalent labeling of an iridium(III) photosensitizer to the surface of genetically engineered bacteria. Due to its intrinsic self&#8208;propelled motility and hypoxia tropism, Ir&#8208;HEcN selectively targets and penetrates deeply into tumor tissues. Importantly, Ir&#8208;HEcN is capable of inducing pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death of tumor cells under irradiation, thereby remarkably evoking anti&#8208;tumor innate and adaptive immune responses in vivo and leading to the regression of solid tumors via combinational photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, Ir&#8208;HEcN is the first metal complex decorated bacteria for enhanced photodynamic immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Site Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Regulating Peroxymonosulfate Activation to Generate Singlet Oxygen with 100% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an excellent reactive oxygen species (ROSs) for the selective conversion of organic matter, especially in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). However, due to the huge dilemma in synthesizing single&#8208;site type catalysts, the control and regulation of 1O2 generation in AOPs is still challenging and the underlying mechanism remains largely obscure. Here, taking advantage of the well&#8208;defined and flexibly tunable sites of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), we report the first achievement in precisely regulating ROSs generation in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs by site engineering of COFs. Remarkably, COFs with bipyridine units (BPY&#8208;COFs) facilitate PMS activation via a nonradical pathway with 100% 1O2, whereas biphenyl&#8208;based COFs (BPD&#8208;COFs) with almost identical structures activate PMS to produce radicals (&#8226;OH and SO4&#8226;&#8208;). The BPY&#8208;COFs/PMS system delivers boosted performance for selective degradation of target pollutants from water, which is ca. 9.4 times that of its BPD&#8208;COFs counterpart, surpassing most reported PMS&#8208;based AOPs systems. Mechanism analysis indicated that highly electronegative pyridine&#8208;N atoms on BPY&#8208;COFs provide extra sites to adsorb the terminal H atom of PMS, resulting in simultaneous adsorption of O and H atoms of PMS on one pyridine ring, which facilitates the cleavage of its S&#8208;O bond to generate 1O2.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Solid&#8211;Solid Conversion of Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries by Weakly Solvating Ether Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite carbonate electrolytes exhibiting good stability to sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN), their chemical incompatibility with lithium (Li) metal anode leads to poor electrochemical performance of Li||SPAN full cells. While the SPAN employs conventional ether electrolytes that suffer from the shuttle effect, leading to rapid capacity fading. Here, we tailor a dilute electrolyte based on a low solvating power ether solvent that is both compatible with SPAN and Li metal. Unlike conventional ether electrolytes, the weakly solvating ether electrolyte enables SPAN to undergo reversibly &#8220;solid&#8208;solid&#8221; conversion. It features an anion&#8208;rich solvation structure that allows for the formation of a robust cathode electrolyte interphase on the SPAN, effectively blocking the dissolution of polysulfides into the bulk electrolyte and avoiding the shuttle effect. What's more, the unique electrolyte chemistry endowed Li ions with fast electroplating kinetics and induced high reversibility Li deposition/stripping process from 25 &#176;C to &#8722;40 &#176;C. Based on tailored electrolyte, Li||SPAN full cells matched with high loading SPAN cathodes (~3.6 mAh cm&#8208;2) and 50 &#956;m Li foil can operate stably over a wide range of temperatures. Additionally, Li||SPAN pouch cell under lean electrolyte and 5% excess Li conditions can continuously operate stably for over a month.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Electrophile C&#8208;PIII Coupling of Chlorophosphines with Organic Halides: Photoinduced PIII and Aminoalkyl Radical Generation Enabled by Pnictogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pnictogen bonding (PnB) has gained recognition as an appealing strategy for constructing novel architectures and unlocking new properties. Within the synthetic community, the development of a straightforward and much simpler protocol for cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8208;PIII coupling remains an ongoing challenge with organic halides. In this study, we present a simple strategy for photoinduced PnB&#8208;enabled cross&#8208;electrophile C&#8208;PIII couplings using readily available chlorophosphines and organic halides via merging single electron transfer (SET) and halogen atom transfer (XAT) processes. In this photo&#8208;mediated transformation, the PnB formed between chlorophosphines and alkyl amines facilitates the photogeneration of PIII radicals and &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals through SET. Subsequently, the resulting &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals activate C&#8208;X bonds via XAT, leading to the formation of carbon radicals. This methodology offers operational simplicity and compatibility with both aliphatic and aromatic chlorophosphines and organic halides.</dc:description>

Within the synthetic community, the development of a straightforward and much simpler protocol for cross-electrophile C-PIII coupling remains an ongoing challenge with organic halides. In this study, we present a simple strategy for photoinduced PnB-enabled cross-electrophile C-PIII couplings using readily available chlorophosphines and organic halides via merging single electron transfer (SET) and halogen atom transfer (XAT) processes. In this photo-mediated transformation, the PnB formed between chlorophosphines and alkyl amines facilitates the photogeneration of PIII radicals and &#945;-aminoalkyl radicals through SET. Subsequently, the resulting &#945;-aminoalkyl radicals activate C-X bonds via XAT, leading to the formation of carbon radicals. This methodology offers operational simplicity and compatibility with both aliphatic and aromatic chlorophosphines and organic halides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nondoped Blue AIEgen&#8208;based OLED with EQE Approaching 10.3%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) are attractive for the construction of non&#8208;doped blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owning to their high emission efficiency in the film state. However, the large internal inversion rate (kIC(Tn)) between high&#8208;lying triplet levels (Tn) and Tn&#8208;1 causes a huge loss of triplet excitons, resulting in dissatisfied device performance of these AIEgens&#8208;based non&#8208;doped OLEDs. Herein, we designed and synthesized a blue luminogen of DMPPP&#8208;AC by fusing an AIEgen of TPB&#8208;AC and a DMPPP, which feature hot exciton and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) up&#8208;conversion process, respectively. DMPPP&#8208;AC successfully inherits the AIE feature and excellent horizontal dipole orientation of TPB&#8208;AC. Furthermore, it owes smaller kIC(Tn) than TPB&#8208;AC. When DMPPP&#8208;AC was applied in OLED as non&#8208;doped emitting layer, an outstanding external quantum efficiency of 10.3% with an exceptional brightness of 69311 cd m&#8208;2 were achieved. The transient electroluminescent measurements and steady&#8208;state dynamic analysis confirm that both TTA and hot exciton processes contribute to such excellent device performance. This work provides a new insight into the design of efficient organic fluorophores by managing high&#8208;lying triplet excitons.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Electrocatalytic Activity and Stability by Single Iridium Atoms on Iron&#8208;based Layered Double Hydroxides for Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Full understanding to the origin of the catalytic performance of a supported nanocatalyst from the points of view of both the active component and support is significant for the achievement of high performance. Herein, based on a model electrocatalyst of single&#8208;iridium&#8208;atom&#8208;doped iron (Fe)&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (LDH) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we reveal the first completed origin of the catalytic performance of such supported nanocatalysts. Specially, besides the activity enhancement of Ir sites by LDH support, the stability of surface Fe sites is enhanced by doped Ir sites: DFT calculation shows that the Ir sites can reduce the activity and enhance the stability of the nearby Fe sites; while further finite element simulations indicate, the stability enhancement of distant Fe sites could be attributed to the much low concentration of OER reactant (hydroxyl ions, OH&#8208;) around them induced by the much fast consumption of OH&#8208; on highly active Ir sites. These new findings about the interaction between the main active components and supports are applicable in principle to other heterogeneous nanocatalysts and provide a completed understanding to the catalytic performance of heterogeneous nanocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Co&#8208;Reduction of N2 and CO2 with CeO2 Catalyst for Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) into urea by photocatalytic reaction under mild conditions is considered to be a more environmentally friendly and promising alternative strategies. However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of inert gas on photocatalysts has become the main challenge that hinder the advancement of this technique. Herein, we have successfully established mesoporous CeO2&#8208;x nanorods with adjustable oxygen vacancy concentration by heat treatment in Ar/H2 (90%:10%) atmosphere, enhancing the targeted adsorption and activation of N2 and CO2 by introducing oxygen vacancies. Particularly, CeO2&#8208;500 (CeO2 nanorods heated treatment at 500 &#176;C) revealed high photocatalytic activity toward the C&#8208;N coupling reaction for urea synthesis with a remarkable urea yield rate of 15.5 &#956;g/h. Besides, both aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;TEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy were used to research the atomic surface structure of CeO2&#8208;500 at high resolution and to monitor the key intermediate precursors generated. The reaction mechanism of photocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling was studied in detail by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) with specific experiments. We hope this work provides important inspiration and guiding significance towards highly efficient photocatalytic synthesis of urea.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a regiodivergent and enantioselective allyl addition to ketones with allenylsilanes through copper catalysis. With the combination of CuOAc, a Josiphos&#8208;type bidentate phosphine ligand and PhSiH3, allyl addition to a variety of ketones furnishes branched products in excellent enantioselectivities. The regioselectivity is completely reversed by employing the P&#8208;stereogenic ligand BenzP*, affording the linear products with excellent enantioselectivities and good Z&#8208;selectivities. The linear Z&#8208;product could be converted to E&#8208;product via a catalytic geometric isomerization of the Z&#8208;alkene group. The silyl group in the products could provide a handle for downstream elaboration.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Proton&#8208;coupled Electron Transfer via Fe&#8208;P Atomic Pair for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO catalytic activity, but poor kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps still limit the overall performance toward the industrial scale. Here, we constructed a Fe&#8208;P atom paired catalyst onto nitrogen doped graphitic layer (Fe1/PNG) to accelerate PCET step. Fe1/PNG delivers an industrial CO current of 1 A with FECO over 90% at 2.5 V in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly, overperforming the CO current of Fe1/NG by more than 300%. We also decrypted the synergistic effects of the P atom in the Fe&#8208;P atom pair using operando techniques and density functional theory, revealing that the P atom provides additional adsorption sites for accelerating water dissociation, boosting the hydrogenation of CO2, and enhancing the activity of CO2 reduction. This atom&#8208;pair catalytic strategy can modulate multiple reactants and intermediates to break through the inherent limitations of single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Ligand Exchange Dynamics on Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for Reversible Sorting and Hybridization of Miktoarm Star Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise synthesis of miktoarm star polymers (MSPs) remains one of the great challenges in synthetic chemistry due to the difficulty in locating appropriate structural templates and polymer grafting/growing strategies with high selectivity and efficiency. Herein, ~ 2 nm metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs), constructed from the coordination of isophthalic acid (IPA) and Cu2+, are applied as templates for the precise synthesis of 24&#8208;arm MSPs for their unique logarithmic ligand exchange dynamics. Six different polymers are prepared with IPA as an end group and they further coordinated with Cu2+ to afford corresponding 24&#8208;arm star homo&#8208;polymers, respectively. MSPs can be obtained by mixing targeted homo&#8208;arm star polymers in solutions upon thermal annealing. The compositions of MSPs can be facilely and precisely tuned via the recipe of the inputted star polymer mixtures. Interestingly, the obtained MSPs can be sorted into homo&#8208;arm star polymers through a typical solvent extraction protocol. The hybridization and sorting process can be reversibly conducted via the cycle of thermal annealing and solvent treatment. The complex coordination framework not only opens new avenues for the facile and precise synthesis of MSPs and MOPs with hybrid functionalities, but also provides the capability to design sustainable polymer systems.</dc:description>

The compositions of MSPs can be facilely and precisely tuned via the recipe of the inputted star polymer mixtures. Interestingly, the obtained MSPs can be sorted into homo-arm star polymers through a typical solvent extraction protocol. The hybridization and sorting process can be reversibly conducted via the cycle of thermal annealing and solvent treatment. The complex coordination framework not only opens new avenues for the facile and precise synthesis of MSPs and MOPs with hybrid functionalities, but also provides the capability to design sustainable polymer systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid, Selective Extraction of Silver from Complex Water Matrices with a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework/Oligomer Composite Constructed via Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Every year vast quantities of silver are lost in various waste streams; this, combined with its limited, diminishing supply and rising demand, makes silver recovery of increasing importance. Thus, herein, we report a controllable, green process to produce a host of highly porous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)/oligomer composites using supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO2) as a medium. One resulting composite, referred to as MIL&#8208;127/Poly&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine (PoPD), has an excellent Ag+ adsorption capacity, removal efficiency (&gt;99%) and provides rapid Ag+ extraction in as little as 5 min from complex liquid matrices. Notably, the composite can also reduce sliver concentrations below the levels (&lt;0.1 ppm) established by the United States&#160;Environmental Protection Agency. Using theoretical simulations, we find that there are spatially ordered polymeric units inside the MOF that promotes the complexation of Ag+ over other common competing ions. Moreover, the oligomer is able to reduce silver to its metallic state, also providing antibacterial properties.</dc:description>

         <title>NADH Photosynthesis System with Affordable Electron Supply and Inhibited NADH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthesis offers a green approach for the recycling of nicotinamide cofactors primarily NADH in bio&#8208;redox reactions. Herein, we report an NADH photosynthesis system where the biomass derivatives oxidation is designed as an electron supply module (ESM) to afford electrons and the superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascades catalysis is designed as reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Glucose as the electron donor guarantees the reaction sustainability accompanied with oxidative products of gluconic acid and formic acid. Meanwhile, enzyme cascades of SOD/CAT greatly eliminate ROS, leading to a ~2.00&#8208;fold elevation of NADH yield (61.1% vs. 30.7%). The initial reaction rate and turnover frequency (TOF) increased by 2.50 times and 2.54 times, respectively, compared with those systems without REM. Our study establishes a novel and efficient platform for NADH photosynthesis coupled to biomass&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia via Tuning of N&#8208;Intermediate Adsorption on a Zn&#8208;Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;powered electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8208;) to ammonia (NH3) has garnered significant interest as an eco&#8208;friendly and promising substitute for the Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, the sluggish kinetics hinders its application at a large scale. Herein, we first calculated the N&#8208;containing species (*NO3 and *NO2) binding energy and the free energy of the hydrogen evolution reaction over Cu with different metal dopants, and it was shown that Zn was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we designed and synthesized Zn&#8208;doped Cu nanosheets, and the as&#8208;prepared catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3. The maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of NH3 could reach 98.4% with an outstanding yield rate of 5.8 mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is among the best results up to date. The catalyst also had excellent cycling stability. Meanwhile, it also presented a FE exceeding 90% across a wide potential range and NO3&#8208; concentration range. Detailed experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the Zn doping could modulate intermediates adsorption strength, enhance NO2&#8208; conversion, change the *NO adsorption configuration to a bridge adsorption, and decrease the energy barrier, leading to the excellent catalytic performance for NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic ipso&#8208;Nitration of Organosilanes Enabled by Electrophilic N&#8208;Nitrosaccharin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deploying N&#8208;nitrosaccharin reagents in combination with Lewis acid activation enables the facile, regio&#8208; and chemoselective nitration of (het)aryl silanes, allowing the introduction of nitro group under unprecedently mild conditions suitable for the late&#8208;stage nitration of complex and polyfunctionalized molecules. Theoretical and experimental mechanistic investigations formulate a plausible mechanism involving a &#8220;Wheland transition state&#8221;.







Abstract
Nitroaromatic compounds represent one of the essential classes of molecules that are widely used as feedstock for the synthesis of intermediates, the preparation of nitro&#8208;derived pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials on both laboratory and industrial scales. We herein disclose the efficient, mild, and catalytic ipso&#8208;nitration of organotrimethylsilanes, enabled by an electrophilic N&#8208;nitrosaccharin reagent and allows chemoselective nitration under mild reaction conditions, while exhibiting remarkable substrate generality and functional group compatibility. Additionally, the reaction conditions proved to be orthogonal to other common functionalities, allowing programming of molecular complexity via successive transformations or late&#8208;stage nitration. Detailed mechanistic investigation by experimental and computational approaches strongly supported a classical electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) mechanism, which was found to proceed through a highly ordered transition state.

         <title>Highly Efficient Decomposition of Perfluorocarbons for over 1000 Hours via Active Site Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga assists the defluorination of Al&#8722;F over a Ga/&#952;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst. Al&#8722;OH reacts with CF4 to form Al&#8722;F, resulting in fluorine poisoning on the Al active sites. Adsorption of F at the Al active site is strong and limits the regeneration of the Al&#8722;OH site. However, Ga exhibits weaker adsorption of F and the resulting Ga&#8722;F can easily hydrolyze to Ga&#8722;OH, which can assist the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites through a dehydration&#8208;like process.







Abstract
Tetrafluoromethane (CF4), the simplest perfluorocarbon (PFC), has the potential to exacerbate global warming. Catalytic hydrolysis is a viable method to degrade CF4, but fluorine poisoning severely restricts both the catalytic performance and catalyst lifetime. In this study, Ga is introduced to effectively assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites, leading to highly efficient CF4 decomposition at 600&#8201;&#176;C with a catalytic lifetime exceeding 1,000&#8197;hours. 27Al and 71Ga magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR) showed that the introduced Ga exists as tetracoordinated Ga sites (GaIV), which readily dissociate water to form Ga&#8722;OH. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density function theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that Ga&#8722;OH assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites via a dehydration&#8208;like process. As a result, the Ga/Al2O3 catalyst achieved 100&#8201;% CF4 decomposition keeping an ultra&#8208;long catalytic lifetime and outperforming reported results. This work proposes a new approach for efficient and long&#8208;term CF4 decomposition by promoting the regeneration of active sites.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;cationic metal glue strategy&#8221; for increasing the size and nuclearity of hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters is demonstrated by using lacunary&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) as rigid multidentate ligands. The method enabled the expansion of {FeMn4} to {(FeMn4)Mn2Ln2(FeMn4)} oxo clusters (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, and Lu), which are the largest among previously reported paramagnetic hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters in POMs.







Abstract
Precise structural design of large hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters is crucial for controlling their large spin ground states and multielectron redox properties for application as a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM), molecular magnetic refrigeration, and efficient redox catalyst. However, it is difficult to synthesize large hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal oxo clusters as designed because the final structures are unpredictable when employing conventional one&#8208;step condensation reaction of metal cations and ligands. Herein, we report a &#8220;cationic metal glue strategy&#8221; for increasing the size and nuclearity of hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters by using lacunary&#8208;type anionic molecular metal oxides (polyoxometalates, POMs) as rigid multidentate ligands. The employed method enabled the synthesis of {(FeMn4)Mn2Ln2(FeMn4)} oxo clusters (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, and Lu), which are the largest among previously reported paramagnetic hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters in POMs and showed unique SMM properties. These clusters were synthesized by conjugating {FeMn4} oxo clusters with Mn and Ln cations as glues in a predictable way, indicating that the &#8220;cationic metal glue strategy&#8221; would be a powerful tool to construct desired large hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal clusters precisely and effectively.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Engineering in Perovskite Solar Cells with 2D Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) carbides Ti3C2Clx Nano&#8208;MXene and o&#8208;TB&#8208;GDY NanoGDY are successfully employed to passivate the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces, respectively. Due to significantly inhibited non&#8208;radiative recombination, enhanced energy band alignment, and improved charge&#8208;carrier extraction, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p devices obtain a high efficiency of 24.86&#8201;% with improved long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Passivating the interfaces between the perovskite and charge transport layers is crucial for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here we report a dual&#8208;interface engineering approach to improving the performance of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3&#8208;based PSCs by incorporating Ti3C2Clx Nano&#8208;MXene and o&#8208;TB&#8208;GDY nanographdiyne (NanoGDY) into the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite and perovskite/ hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces, respectively. The dual&#8208;interface passivation simultaneously suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and promotes carrier extraction by forming the Pb&#8722;Cl chemical bond and strong coordination of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation with undercoordinated Pb defects. The resulting perovskite film has an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;s and an enlarged crystal size exceeding 2.5&#8197;&#956;m. A maximum PCE of 24.86&#8201;% is realized, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.20&#8197;V. Unencapsulated cells retain 92&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1464&#8197;hours in ambient air and 80&#8201;% after 1002&#8197;hours of thermal stability test at 85&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a high&#8208;quality SnO2 layer with decreased adsorbed oxygen (Ochem) active sites and oxygen vacancies (Ovac) was fabricated on a flexible substrate by introducing TiCl4 into the SnO2 bulk layer. The first evidence of flexible perovskite cells working at low temperature was demonstrated, with efficiency as high as 23.7&#8201;% based on an improved SnO2 layer.







Abstract
Photovoltaic technology with low weight, high specific power in cold environments, and compatibility with flexible fabrication is highly desired for near&#8208;space vehicles and polar region applications. Herein, we demonstrate efficient low&#8208;temperature flexible perovskite solar cells by improving the interfacial contact between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite layer. We find that the adsorbed oxygen active sites and oxygen vacancies of flexible tin oxide (SnO2) ETL layer can be effectively decreased by incorporating a trace amount of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). The effective defects elimination at the interfacial increases the electron mobility of flexible SnO2 layer, regulates band alignment at the perovskite/SnO2 interface, induces larger perovskite crystal growth, and improves charge collection efficiency in a complete solar cell. Correspondingly, the improved interfacial contact transforms into high&#8208;performance solar cells under one&#8208;sun illumination (AM 1.5G) with efficiencies up to 23.7&#8201;% at 218&#8197;K, which might open up a new era of application of this emerging flexible photovoltaic technology to low&#8208;temperature environments such as near&#8208;space and polar regions.

         <title>Bifunctional Near&#8208;Neutral Electrolyte Enhances Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed KBi/KF (KBi=potassium borate) electrolyte enhances the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at near&#8208;neutral pH via: 1) stabilizing the interfacial pH by forming the BF2(OH)2&#8722; anion; and, 2) activating the interfacial water by F&#8208;containing species.







Abstract
Performance of electrocatalytic reactions depends on not only the composition and structure of the active sites, but also their local environment, including the surrounding electrolyte. In this work, we demonstrate that BF2(OH)2&#8722; anion is the key fluoroborate species formed in the mixed KBi/KF (KBi=potassium borate) electrolyte to enhance the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at near&#8208;neutral pH. Through a combination of electrokinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies, we show that the mixed KBi/KF electrolyte promotes the OER via two pathways: 1) stabilizing the interfacial pH during the proton&#8208;producing reaction with its high buffering capacity; and 2) activating the interfacial water via strong hydrogen bonds with F&#8208;containing species. With the KBi/KF electrolyte, electrodeposited Co(OH)2 is able to achieve 100&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.74&#8197;V, which is among the highest reported activities with earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts at near neutral conditions. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging electrolyte&#8208;engineering for improving the electrochemical performance of the OER.

         <title>Deciphering the Primary Role of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X Hydrogen Bonding in Gold Catalysis</title>

Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X (X=N or C) hydrogen bonding interactions play a directing role in gold catalysis. DFT calculations on the free energy profile of the experimentally studied multicomponent A3&#8208;coupling reaction and topological analysis of the intermediates and transition states provide direct evidences.







Abstract
Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X (X=N or C) hydrogen bonding is gaining increasing interest, both in the study of its intrinsic nature and in their operability in different fields. While the role of these interactions has been studied in the stabilization of gold(I) complexes, their role during the minimum free energy reaction pathway of a given catalytic process remains unexplored. We report herein that complex [Au(C&#8801;CPh)(pip)] (pip=piperidine) catalyses the A3&#8208;coupling reaction for the synthesis of propargylamines, thanks to the ability of Au(I) to promote weak hydrogen bonding interactions with the reactants along the free energy profile. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that these Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X interactions play a directing role in the catalysed A3&#8208;coupling. Topological non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), interaction region indicator (IRI) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis in real space of the electron density provide a description of these interactions accurately.

&lt;p&gt;Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X (X=N or C) hydrogen bonding interactions play a directing role in gold catalysis. DFT calculations on the free energy profile of the experimentally studied multicomponent A&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-coupling reaction and topological analysis of the intermediates and transition states provide direct evidences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X (X=N or C) hydrogen bonding is gaining increasing interest, both in the study of its intrinsic nature and in their operability in different fields. While the role of these interactions has been studied in the stabilization of gold(I) complexes, their role during the minimum free energy reaction pathway of a given catalytic process remains unexplored. We report herein that complex [Au(C&#8801;CPh)(pip)] (pip=piperidine) catalyses the A&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-coupling reaction for the synthesis of propargylamines, thanks to the ability of Au(I) to promote weak hydrogen bonding interactions with the reactants along the free energy profile. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that these Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X interactions play a directing role in the catalysed A&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-coupling. Topological non-covalent interactions (NCI), interaction region indicator (IRI) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis in real space of the electron density provide a description of these interactions accurately.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Biocatalysis by Unspecific Peroxygenases with Genetically Encoded Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have recently gained attraction as versatile oxyfunctionalization catalysts. One shortcoming, however, is their susceptibility towards the co&#8208;substrate hydrogen peroxide. As a solution, the concept of light&#8208;dependent UPO biocatalysis with genetically encoded flavin&#8208;containing photosensitizer proteins for in situ hydrogen peroxide production is introduced.







Abstract
Fungal unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have gained substantial attention for their versatile oxyfunctionalization chemistry paired with impressive catalytic capabilities. A major drawback, however, remains their sensitivity towards their co&#8208;substrate hydrogen peroxide, necessitating the use of smart in situ hydrogen peroxide generation methods to enable efficient catalysis setups. Herein, we introduce flavin&#8208;containing protein photosensitizers as a new general tool for light&#8208;controlled in situ hydrogen peroxide production. By genetically fusing flavin binding fluorescent proteins and UPOs, we have created two virtually self&#8208;sufficient photo&#8208;enzymes (PhotUPO). Subsequent testing of a versatile substrate panel with the two divergent PhotUPOs revealed two stereoselective conversions. The catalytic performance of the fusion protein was optimized through enzyme and substrate loading variation, enabling up to 24300 turnover numbers (TONs) for the sulfoxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide. The PhotUPO concept was upscaled to a 100&#8197;mg substrate preparative scale, enabling the extraction of enantiomerically pure alcohol products.

         <title>A Screening Protocol for Exploring Loop Length Requirements for the Formation of a Three Cytosine&#8208;Cytosine+ Base&#8208;Paired i&#8208;Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interactive protocol for the identification of minimal sequence requirements for i&#8208;Motif (iM) folding was developed. It allowed the resolution by NMR of the simplest intra&#8208;molecular iM with an odd number of cytosine&#8208;cytosine+ (CC+) base pairs. The experimental design revealed the minimal number of nucleotides in the loops&#8211;2 and 3 in the minor and major groove, respectively&#8211;with a preference for the 5&#8242; localization of the outmost CC+ base pair.







Abstract
DNA sequences containing at least four runs of repetitive cytosines can fold into tetra&#8208;helical structures called i&#8208;Motifs (iMs). The interest in these DNA secondary structures is increasing due to their therapeutical and technological applications. Still, limited knowledge of their folding requirements is currently available. We developed a novel step&#8208;by&#8208;step pipeline for the systematic screening of putative iM&#8208;forming model sequences. Focusing on structures comprising only three cytosine&#8208;cytosine+ base pairs, we investigated what the minimal lengths of the loops required for formation of an intra&#8208;molecular iM are. Our data indicate that two and three nucleotides are required to connect the strands through the minor and majorgrooves of the iM, respectively. Additionally, they highlight an asymmetric behavior according to the distribution of the cytosines. Specifically, no sequence containing a single cytosine in the first and third run was able to fold into intra&#8208;molecular iMs with the same stability of those formed when the first and the third run comprise two cytosines. This knowledge represents a step forward toward the development of prediction tools for the proper identification of biologically functional iMs, as well as for the rational design of these secondary structures as technological devices.

         <title>Nanostructure Explains the Behavior of Slippery Covalently Attached Liquid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slippery covalently&#8208;attached liquid surfaces (SCALS) are highly slippery towards liquid droplets, but an understanding of the underpinning mechanism is lacking. This study establishes that a combination of layer uniformity and layer mobility determines optimal SCALS performance. These findings provide insights into SCALS synthesis and nanostructure, enabling rational design of these highly anti&#8208;adhesive surfaces.







Abstract
Slippery covalently&#8208;attached liquid surfaces (SCALS) with low contact angle hysteresis (CAH, &lt;5&#176;) and nanoscale thickness display impressive anti&#8208;adhesive properties, similar to lubricant&#8208;infused surfaces. Their efficacy is generally attributed to the liquid&#8208;like mobility of the constituent tethered chains. However, the precise physico&#8208;chemical properties that facilitate this mobility are unknown, hindering rational design.
This work quantifies the chain length, grafting density, and microviscosity of a range of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) SCALS, elucidating the nanostructure responsible for their properties. Three prominent methods are used to produce SCALS, with characterization carried out via single&#8208;molecule force measurements, neutron reflectometry, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. CO2 snow&#8208;jet cleaning was also shown to reduce the CAH of SCALS via a modification of their grafting density. SCALS behavior can be predicted by reduced grafting density, &#931;, with the lowest water CAH achieved at &#931;&#8776;2. This study provides the first direct examination of SCALS grafting density, chain length, and microviscosity and supports the hypothesis that SCALS properties stem from a balance of layer uniformity and mobility.

         <title>Potential Controllable Redox Couple for Mild and Efficient Lithium Recovery from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from their tunable electron affinities and tailored potential, PAHs were used to extract active lithium from spent batteries without discharging. Furthermore, the reducing Li&#8208;PAHs solution can be used for direct regeneration of spent cathodes and pre&#8208;lithiation of anodes, which has great prospects in the sustainable development of the battery recycling industry.







Abstract
The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is dialectically accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries. It is an urgent priority to develop green and efficient battery recycling strategies for helping ease resources and environmental pressures at the current stage. Here, we propose a mild and efficient lithium extracting strategy based on potential controllable redox couples. Active lithium in the spent battery without discharging is extracted using a series of tailored aprotic solutions comprised of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers. This ensures a safe yet efficient recycling process with nearly &#8776;100&#8201;% lithium recovery. We further investigate the Li+&#8208;electron concerted redox reactions and the effect of solvation structure on kinetics during the extraction, and broaden the applicability of the Li&#8208;PAHs solution. This work can stimulate new inspiration for designing novel solutions to meet efficient and sustainable demands in recycling batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Benefiting from their tunable electron affinities and tailored potential, PAHs were used to extract active lithium from spent batteries without discharging. Furthermore, the reducing Li-PAHs solution can be used for direct regeneration of spent cathodes and pre-lithiation of anodes, which has great prospects in the sustainable development of the battery recycling industry.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Comprehensive Comparisons between Directing and Alternating Current Electrolysis in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to DC electrolysis, alternating current (AC) features polarity reversal and periodic variation, and will provide more chances and potentials for organic synthesis. This minireview delineates the unfolding landscape of recent progress in AC&#8208;driven organic transformations and endeavors to dissect disparities between DC and AC electrolytic patterns from their physical principles, reaction features and selectivity control.







Abstract
Organic electrosynthesis has consistently aroused significant interest within both academic and industrial spheres. Despite the considerable progress achieved in this field, the majority of electrochemical transformations have been conducted through the utilization of direct&#8208;current (DC) electricity. In contrast, the application of alternating current (AC), characterized by its polarity&#8208;alternating nature, remains in its infancy within the sphere of organic synthesis, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive theoretical framework. This minireview offers an overview of recent advancements in AC&#8208;driven organic transformations and seeks to elucidate the differences between DC and AC electrolytic methodologies by probing into their underlying physical principles. These differences encompass the ability of AC to preclude the deposition of metal catalysts, the precision in modulating oxidation and reduction intensities, and the mitigation of mass transfer processes.

         <title>Synchronous Switching of Dielectric Constant and Photoluminescence in Cyanidonitridorhenate&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular hybrid materials based on tetracyanidonitridorhenate(V) ions bearing diamine ligands exhibit a thermal phase transition related to a change from an ordered to a disordered state of the organic counter&#8208;ions. This leads to a thermal switching of the dielectric constant and the emission features connected with the photoluminescence of the Re(V) complexes.







Abstract
Switching of multiple physical properties by external stimuli in dynamic materials enables applications in, e.g., smart sensors, biomedical tools, as well as data&#8208;storage devices. Among stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, inorganic&#8208;organic molecular hybrids exhibiting thermal order&#8208;disorder phase transitions were tested as promising molecular switches of electrical characteristics, including dielectric constant. We aimed at broadening the multifunctional potential of such hybrid materials towards the switching of not only electrical but also other physical properties, e.g., light emission. We report two ionic salts based on luminescent tetracyanidonitridorhenate(V) anions bearing two different diamine ligands, 1,2&#8208;diaminoethane (1) and 1,3&#8208;diaminopropane (2), both crystallizing with polar N&#8208;methyl&#8208;dabconium cations. They exhibit an order&#8208;disorder phase transition related to the heating&#8208;induced turning&#8208;on of the rotation of polar cations. This leads to a unique synchronous switching of the dielectric constant as well as metal&#8208;complex&#8208;centered photoluminescence, as demonstrated by changes in, e.g., emission lifetime. The roles of organic cations, non&#8208;trivial Re(V) complexes, and their interaction in achieving the coupled thermal switching of electrical and optical properties are discussed utilizing experimental and theoretical approaches.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Activated Self&#8208;Immolation of Hydrogels via Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a hydrogel system that self&#8208;destroys after mechanical activation via the combination of a mechano&#8211;to&#8211;chemo signal translation and a chemical signal amplifier module to trigger many chain breaks following one single mechano event. Self&#8208;regulating soft robotic elements and mechano&#8208;induced debonding in adhesives can be realized.







Abstract
Cellular organisms possess intricate mechano&#8208;adaptive systems that enable them to sense forces and process them with (bio)chemical circuits for functional adaptation. Inspired by such processes, this study introduces a hydrogel system capable of mechanically activated and chemically transduced self&#8208;destruction. Our judiciously designed hydrogels can mechanically generate radicals that are processed and amplified in a self&#8208;propagating radical de&#8208;crosslinking reaction, ultimately leading to mechanically triggered self&#8208;immolation. We put such systems to work in mechano&#8208;induced debonding, and in a bilayer actuator, where swelling&#8208;induced bending generates sufficient force for selective degradation of one layer, leading to autonomous self&#8208;regulation associated with unbending. Our work helps define design criteria for molecularly controlled adaptive and self&#8208;regulating materials with embodied mechano&#8208;chemical information processing, and showcases their potential for adhesives and soft robotics.

         <title>A Supramolecular Naphthalene Diimide Radical Anion with Efficient NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion for E. coli&#8208;Responsive Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular naphthalene diimide radical anion with efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion is generated through E.&#8197;coli&#8208;induced in situ reduction. It exhibits unexpectedly strong absorption at 1104&#8197;nm and remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency. Therefore, excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal antimicrobial activity is demonstrated. This work opens a new avenue for constructing NIR&#8208;II dyes on the basis of limited &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures.







Abstract
We report a supramolecular naphthalene diimide (NDI) radical anion with efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion for E.&#8197;coli&#8208;responsive photothermal therapy. The supramolecular radical anion (NDI&#8208;2CB[7])&#8901;&#8722;, which is obtained from the E.&#8197;coli&#8208;induced in situ reduction of NDI&#8208;2CB[7] neutral complex, formed by the host&#8211;guest interaction between an NDI derivative and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), exhibits unexpectedly strong NIR&#8208;II absorption and remarkable photothermal conversion capacity in aqueous solution. The NIR&#8208;II absorption is caused by the self&#8208;assembly of NDI radical anions to form supramolecular dimer radicals in aqueous solution, which is supported by theoretically predicted spectra. The (NDI&#8208;2CB[7])&#8901;&#8722; demonstrates excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal antimicrobial activity (&gt;99&#8201;%). This work provides a new approach for constructing NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents and non&#8208;contact treatments for bacterial infections.

&#8220;The research was initiated in response to the unmet clinical need in accurate and timely diagnosis of preeclampsia, a major cause of maternal mortality and pregnancy complications, particularly in developing countries &#8230; What sets our work apart from previous studies is the convergence of three distinct yet complementary skill sets and backgrounds. We seamlessly integrated expertise in physics/photonics, biology/biotechnology, and biomedical/clinical domains &#8230;&#8221; Find out more about the collaborative work in the McClements, Yen, and Kaitu'u&#8208;Lino/Hannan groups to improve women's health.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the McClements and the Wen groups, Institute for Biomedical Materials and Devices, Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney (Australia); and the Kaitu'u&#8208;Lino/Hannan groups, Mercy Hospital for Women, the University of Melbourne (Australia). They recently published an article on the development and validation of the first&#8208;in&#8208;class point&#8208;of&#8208;care assay for preeclampsia diagnosis. This assay can detect and quantify the concentration of FKBPL and CD44 proteins in human plasma in 15&#8197;minutes with high sensitivity and specificity enabling timely diagnosis of early&#8208;onset preeclampsia. &#8220;Quantitative Point of Care Tests for Timely Diagnosis of Early&#8208;Onset Preeclampsia with High Sensitivity and Specificity&#8221;, S.&#8197;M.

         <title>Hybrid Vesicles Enable Mechano&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a strategy that enables the development of a mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogel capable of on&#8208;demand degradation. Phospholipid&#8208;block copolymer hybrid vesicles embedded in a hydrogel matrix can act as signal transducers, releasing encapsulated compounds that control the hydrogel network when an external compressive stress is applied. This generalizable approach holds promise for the creation of diverse functional hydrogels.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels are intriguing biomimetic materials. Previous efforts to develop mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogels have mostly relied on chemical modifications of the hydrogel structures. Here, we present a simple, generalizable strategy that confers mechano&#8208;responsive behavior on hydrogels. Our approach involves embedding hybrid vesicles, composed of phospholipids and amphiphilic block copolymers, within the hydrogel matrix to act as signal transducers. Under mechanical stress, these vesicles undergo deformation and rupture, releasing encapsulated compounds that can control the hydrogel network. To demonstrate this concept, we embedded vesicles containing ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a calcium chelator, into a calcium&#8208;crosslinked alginate hydrogel. When compressed, the released EGTA sequesters calcium ions and degrades the hydrogel. This study provides a novel method for engineering mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogels that may be useful in various biomedical applications.

         <title>Regulating Relative Nitrogen Locations of Diazine Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relative nitrogen locations of diazine rings on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are finely tailored to maximize the photocatalytic performance for producing H2O2 with O2 and pure water. Benefiting from effective electron&#8208;hole separation, low charge transfer resistance, and reactive sites for the direct 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway, the pyridazine&#8208;based COF exhibits an excellent H2O2 production rate of 7327&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising candidates for the overall photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the effects of the relative nitrogen locations remain obscured and photocatalytic performances of COFs need to be further improved. Herein, a collection of COFs functionalized by various diazines including pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine have been judiciously designed and synthesized for photogeneration of H2O2 without sacrificial agents. Compared with pyrimidine and pyrazine, pyridazine embedded in TpDz tends to stabilize endoperoxide intermediate species, leading toward the more efficient direct 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. Benefiting from the effective electron&#8208;hole separation, low charge transfer resistance, and high&#8208;efficiency ORR pathway, an excellent production rate of 7327&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) value of 0.62&#8201;% has been achieved by TpDz, which ranks one of the best COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work might shed fresh light on the rational design of functional COFs targeting photocatalysts in H2O2 production.

         <title>2D Plasmonic Molecules via Hydrogen Bond Interaction between Polymer&#8208;Grafted Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly symmetric 2D plasmonic molecules were assembled through hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between a pair of polymer&#8208;capped gold nanoparticles (donor and acceptor). Polymer interaction and solvation were found to compete with each other during the colloidal self&#8208;assembly process, which can be used to precisely control the coordination number. The nanostructures rearrange themselves from 3D to 2D when being cast onto a substrate.







Abstract
The use of macromolecular design features to regulate non&#8208;covalent bonding on the nanoscale is a young and emerging fabrication strategy for advanced nanostructures. For the first time, we describe a self&#8208;assembly method to create a series of 2D plasmonic molecules (PMs) using hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between a pair of polymer&#8208;capped gold nanoparticles (hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor). Due to the nature of hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, we found that polymer interaction and solvation compete with each other during the self&#8208;assembly process, which turns out to be the most important condition for controlling the coordination number of PMs. We have conducted an extensive study on the solvent effect, which has helped us to design and fabricate a series of precise PMs with high symmetry.

         <title>Enhanced Active Sites and Stability in Nano&#8208;MOFs for Electrochemical Energy Storage through Dual Regulation by Tannic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilized the rich chemical properties of TA to achieve functionalization of nano&#8208;MOFs through acid&#8208;etching and further chelation strategies. The results indicated that the functionalization effect of TA on MOFs is both universal and targeted.







Abstract
The limited active sites and poor acid&#8208;alkaline solution stability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), significantly limit their wider application. In this study, the acid property of tannic acid (TA) was used as an etchant to etch the surface&#8208;active sites. Subsequently, the further chelation of the protonated TA with the exposed metal active site can effectively protect the metal ions. Meanwhile, the TA provided a large amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can greatly improve the stability of imidazolate&#8208;coordinated MOFs. The electrochemical test results indicated that the MOFs composite materials synthesized using this scheme had high specific capacitance and stability. And the mechanism of its electrochemical reaction process was explored through in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and theoretical calculations. In addition, the same treatment was carried out through a series of carboxyl&#8208;coordinated MOFs, which further confirmed the principle of this scheme to obtain a higher active site and stability. This paper explains the mechanism of functionalization of nano&#8208;MOFs by polyphenolic compounds, providing new ideas for the research of nano&#8208;MOFs.

         <title>Directing (110) Oriented Lithium Deposition through High&#8208;flux Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(110) orientated lithium (Li) deposition is achieved via high&#8208;flux solid electrolyte interphase. Bravais rule and Curie&#8208;Wulff principle clarify Li electrocrystallization process. Long&#8208;term Li deposition regulation ability is realized. Planar and dendrite&#8208;free (110) orientated Li enables Li||LiFePO4, Li||NCM811 cells in practical conditions dramatically improved electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Controlling lithium (Li) electrocrystallization with preferred orientation is a promising strategy to realize highly reversible Li metal batteries (LMBs) but lack of facile regulation methods. Herein, we report a high&#8208;flux solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) strategy to direct (110) preferred Li deposition even on (200)&#8208;orientated Li substrate.

&lt;p&gt;(110) orientated lithium (Li) deposition is achieved via high-flux solid electrolyte interphase. Bravais rule and Curie-Wulff principle clarify Li electrocrystallization process. Long-term Li deposition regulation ability is realized. Planar and dendrite-free (110) orientated Li enables Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Li||NCM811 cells in practical conditions dramatically improved electrochemical performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling lithium (Li) electrocrystallization with preferred orientation is a promising strategy to realize highly reversible Li metal batteries (LMBs) but lack of facile regulation methods. Herein, we report a high-flux solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) strategy to direct (110) preferred Li deposition even on (200)-orientated Li substrate. Bravais rule and Curie-Wulff principle are expanded in Li electrocrystallization process to decouple the relationship between SEI engineering and preferred crystal orientation. Multi-spectroscopic techniques combined with dynamics analysis reveal that the high-flux CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) induced SEI (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-SEI) with high LiF and &#8722;Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; contents can ingeniously accelerate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport dynamics and ensure the sufficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration below SEI to direct Li (110) orientation. The induced Li (110) can in turn further promote the surface migration of Li atoms to avoid tip aggregation, resulting in a planar, dendrite-free morphology of Li. As a result, our F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-SEI enables ultra-long stability of Li||Li symmetrical cells for more than 336&#8197;days.

         <title>Annulation&#8208;Induced Hidden Reactivity of the 1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual hidden reactivity of the 1,2,4&#8208;triazole backbone was unveiled that involves the elusive N&#8722;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reaction. This reactivity allows access to a novel class of unsymmetrically substituted 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamines (dpa), which were used to prepare unsymmetrical boron aza&#8208;dipyridylmethene fluorescent dyes suitable for intracellular selective lipid droplet imaging studies.







Abstract
Triazoles are an important class of compounds with widespread applications. Functionalization of the triazole backbone is thus of significant interest. In comparison to 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, C&#8722;H activation&#8208;functionalization of the congeners 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles is surprisingly underdeveloped. Indeed, no such C&#8722;H activation&#8208;functionalization has been reported for 4&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;triazole cores. Furthermore, although denitrogenative ring&#8208;opening of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles is well&#8208;explored, 1,2,4&#8208;triazole/triazolium substrates have not been known to exhibit N&#8722;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reactivity so far. In this work, we unveiled an unusual hidden reactivity of the 1,2,4&#8208;triazole backbone involving the elusive N&#8722;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reaction. This new reactivity was induced by a Satoh&#8208;Miura&#8208;type C&#8722;H activation&#8208;annulation at the 1,2,4&#8208;triazole motif appended with a pyridine directing group. This unique reaction allowed ready access to a novel class of unsymmetrically substituted 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamines, with one pyridine ring fully&#8208;substituted with alkyl groups. The unsymmetrical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamines were utilized to access unsymmetrical boron&#8208;aza&#8208;dipyridylmethene fluorescent dyes. Empowered with desirable optical/physical properties such as large Stokes shifts and suitable hydrophobicity arising from optimal alkyl chain length at the fully&#8208;substituted pyridine&#8208;ring, these dyes were used for intracellular lipid droplet&#8208;selective imaging studies, which provided useful information toward designing suitable lipid droplet&#8208;selective imaging probes for biomedical applications.

         <title>Narrowband Pure Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Ir(III) Complexes for Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode (OLED) with External Quantum Efficiency Over 16&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By linking the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene group to the diarylboron&#8208;substituted isoquinolinyl moiety, two Ir(III) complexes were successfully obtained to show narrowband pure near&#8208;infrared emissions peaking around 730&#8197;nm with high photoluminescence efficiencies. Moreover, they could show impressively high electroluminescent performance in solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode with external quantum efficiency up to 16.43&#8201;%.







Abstract
Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters have significant applications in medical and optoelectronic fields, but the development stays a great challenge due to the energy gap law. Here, we report two NIR phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes which display emission peaks around 730&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum of only 43&#8197;nm. Therefore, pure NIR luminescence can be obtained without having a very long emission wavelength, thus alleviating the restriction of the energy gap law, and obtaining impressively high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 0.70. More importantly, the pure NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) fabricated by the solution&#8208;processed mothed shows outstanding device performance with the highest external quantum efficiency of 16.43&#8201;%, which sets a new record for solution&#8208;processed NIR&#8208;OLEDs based on different emitters. This work sheds light on the development of Ir(III) complexes with narrowband emissions as highly efficient pure NIR&#8208;emitters.

         <dc:description>
A direct, efficient, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic functionalization of allylic C&#8722;H bonds integrated with CO2 reduction to syngas, over SiO2&#8208;supported single Ni atom&#8208;decorated CdS quantum dots (QDs), is reported for the first time. Such a protocol not only bypasses additional oxidant/reductant and pre&#8208;functionalization to afford a broad range of allylic C&#8722;C products with moderate to excellent yields, but also efficiently produces tunable syngas.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction integrated with C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming organic synthesis represents a substantially untapped opportunity to simultaneously tackle carbon neutrality and create an atom&#8208;/redox&#8208;economical chemical synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate the first cooperative photoredox catalysis of efficient and tunable CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with direct alkylation/arylation of unactivated allylic sp3 C&#8722;H bonds for accessing allylic C&#8722;C products, over SiO2&#8208;supported single Ni atoms&#8208;decorated CdS quantum dots (QDs). Our protocol not only bypasses additional oxidant/reductant and pre&#8208;functionalization of organic substrates, affording a broad of allylic C&#8722;C products with moderate to excellent yields, but also produces syngas with tunable CO/H2 ratios (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8211;5&#8201;:&#8201;1). Such win&#8208;win coupling catalysis highlights the high atom&#8208;, step&#8208; and redox&#8208;economy, and good durability, illuminating the tantalizing possibility of a renewable sunlight&#8208;driven chemical feedstocks manufacturing industry.

         <title>Diaryl Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers Enhance Synergistic Catalysis in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diaryl dihydrophenazine&#8208;based porous organic polymers display extraordinary activities toward visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The enhanced activity and stability of the porous organic polymers over small molecular counterparts leads to a more than 30&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and enables catalyst recovery and reuse.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as a novel class of porous materials that are synthesized by the polymerization of various organic monomers with different geometries and topologies. The molecular tunability of organic building blocks allows the incorporation of functional units for photocatalytic organic transformations. Here, we report the synthesis of two POP&#8208;based photocatalysts via homopolymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized diaryl dihydrophenazine (DADHP) monomer (POP1) and copolymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized DADHP and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine monomers (POP2). The fluorescence lifetimes of DADHP units in the POPs significantly increased, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances over homogeneous controls. POP1 is highly effective in catalysing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8722;N bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Upon coordination with Ni2+ ions, POP2&#8208;Ni shows strong synergy between photocatalytic and Ni catalytic cycles due to the confinement effect within the POP framework, leading to high efficiency in energy, electron, and organic radical transfer. POP2&#8208;Ni displays excellent activity in catalysing C&#8722;P bond forming reactions between diarylphosphine oxides and aryl iodides. They increased the photocatalytic activities by more than 30&#8208;fold in C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These POP catalysts were readily recovered via centrifugal separation and reused in six catalytic cycles without loss of activities. Thus, photosensitizer&#8208;based POPs provide a promising platform for heterogeneous photocatalytic organic transformations.

The enhanced activity and stability of the porous organic polymers over small molecular counterparts leads to a more than 30-fold increase in catalytic activity and enables catalyst recovery and reuse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as a novel class of porous materials that are synthesized by the polymerization of various organic monomers with different geometries and topologies. The molecular tunability of organic building blocks allows the incorporation of functional units for photocatalytic organic transformations. Here, we report the synthesis of two POP-based photocatalysts via homopolymerization of vinyl-functionalized diaryl dihydrophenazine (DADHP) monomer (&lt;b&gt;POP1&lt;/b&gt;) and copolymerization of vinyl-functionalized DADHP and 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine monomers (&lt;b&gt;POP2&lt;/b&gt;). The fluorescence lifetimes of DADHP units in the POPs significantly increased, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances over homogeneous controls. &lt;b&gt;POP1&lt;/b&gt; is highly effective in catalysing visible-light-driven C&#8722;N bond forming cross-coupling reactions. Upon coordination with Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, &lt;b&gt;POP2-Ni&lt;/b&gt; shows strong synergy between photocatalytic and Ni catalytic cycles due to the confinement effect within the POP framework, leading to high efficiency in energy, electron, and organic radical transfer. &lt;b&gt;POP2-Ni&lt;/b&gt; displays excellent activity in catalysing C&#8722;P bond forming reactions between diarylphosphine oxides and aryl iodides. They increased the photocatalytic activities by more than 30-fold in C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P cross-coupling reactions. These POP catalysts were readily recovered via centrifugal separation and reused in six catalytic cycles without loss of activities. Thus, photosensitizer-based POPs provide a promising platform for heterogeneous photocatalytic organic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence via Integrated Top&#8208;Down and Bottom&#8208;Up Approach</title>

Integrating bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down supramolecular methods enables substantial increases in the luminescence dissymmetry factor and the photoluminescence quantum yield.







Abstract
In the dynamic domain of chiroptical technologies, it is imperative to engineer emitters endowed with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. This research demonstrates an advancement by employing a combined top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up strategy for the simultaneous amplification of photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;) and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum). Square&#8208;planar Pt(II) complexes form helical assemblies, driven by torsional strain induced by bis(nonyl) chains. Integration of chiral anions leads these assemblies to prefer distinct helical sense. This arrangement activates the metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MMLCT) transition that is CPL&#8208;active, with &#934; and |glum| observing an upswing contingent on the charge number and aryl substituents in chiral anions. Utilizing the soft&#8208;lithographic micromolding in capillaries technique, we could fabricate exquisitely&#8208;ordered, one&#8208;dimensional co&#8208;assemblies to achieve the metrics to &#934; of 0.32 and |glum| of 0.13. Finally, our spectroscopic research elucidates the underlying mechanism for the dual amplification, making a significant stride in the advancement of CPL&#8208;active emitters.

         <dc:description>
Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) hetero&#8208;microrings was realized through a surface tension&#8208;assisted heterogeneous self&#8208;assembly strategy via the regulation of charge&#8208;transfer interactions along circular boundaries. which remarkably promotes the security level and encoding capacity of the barcodes. The results may be useful to fabricate organic hierarchical hybrid WGM heterostructures for optical information recording and security labels.







Abstract
Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) microcavities featuring distinguishable sharp peaks in a broadband exhibit enormous advantages in the field of miniaturized photonic barcodes. However, such kind of barcodes developed hitherto are primarily based on microcavities wherein multiple gain medias were blended into a single matrix, thus resulting in the limited and indistinguishable coding elements. Here, a surface tension assisted heterogeneous assembly strategy is proposed to construct the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple spatial colors along its circular direction. Through precisely regulating the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) strength, full&#8208;color microrings covering the entire visible range were effectively acquired, which exhibit a series of sharp and recognizable peaks and allow for the effective construction of high&#8208;quality photonic barcodes. Notably, the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple coding elements were finally acquired through heterogeneous nucleation and growth controlled by the directional diffusion between the hetero&#8208;emulsion droplets, thus remarkably promoting the security strength and coding capacity of the barcodes. The results would be useful to fabricate new types of organic hierarchical hybrid WGM heterostructures for optical information recording and security labels.

         <title>The S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; Pocket of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Is Critical for Substrate Selectivity and Can Be Targeted with Covalent Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;peptide screening for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro was performed to select suitable residues for the S1&#8242;&#8211;S4&#8242; sites of Mpro. The Ala&#8722;Ile&#8722;Phe (AIF) motif was chosen as the scaffold for discovering inhibitors that target the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket. Warhead screening and structure&#8211;activity relationship studies revealed a covalent inhibitor, D&#8208;4&#8211;77, with an &#945;&#8208;bromoacetamide warhead that exhibited potent inhibitory activity in vitro.







Abstract
The main protease (Mpro) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is a well&#8208;characterized target for antiviral drug discovery. To date, most antiviral drug discovery efforts have focused on the S4&#8211;S1&#8242; pocket of Mpro; however, it is still unclear whether the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket per se can serve as a new site for drug discovery. In this study, the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket of Mpro was found to differentially recognize viral peptidyl substrates. For instance, S3&#8242; in Mpro strongly favors Phe or Trp, and S1&#8242; favors Ala. The peptidyl inhibitor D&#8208;4&#8211;77, which possesses an &#945;&#8208;bromoacetamide warhead, was discovered to be a promising inhibitor of Mpro, with an IC50 of 0.95&#8197;&#956;M and an antiviral EC50 of 0.49&#8197;&#956;M. The Mpro/inhibitor co&#8208;crystal structure confirmed the binding mode of the inhibitor to the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket and revealed a covalent mechanism. In addition, D&#8208;4&#8211;77 functions as an immune protectant and suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro&#8208;induced antagonism of the host NF&#8208;&#954;B innate immune response. These findings indicate that the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro is druggable, and that inhibiting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro can simultaneously protect human innate immunity and inhibit virion assembly.

         <title>Enhanced Li+ Diffusion and Lattice oxygen Stability by the High Entropy Effect in Disordered&#8208;Rocksalts Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation&#8208;disordered Rocksalt oxides (DRXs) are a promising new class of cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their natural abundance, low cost and great electrochemical performance. High entropy strategy in Mn&#8208;based DRXs appears to be an effective strategy for improving the rate capability, but it suffers from challenges including capacity degradation. The present paper reports a new group of high entropy DRXs (HE DRX) based on Ni2+&#8208;Nb5+ pair; the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of DRXs with an increasing transition metal (TM) species are systematically investigated. An explanation is proposed for how the crystal field stability energy determines that HE DRX could exist in single Rocksalt solid solution structures. We further reveal that the charge compensation mechanism in HE DRX is the result of various TM synergistic effect. More importantly, through various in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ techniques and theoretical calculation, the effective integration of more TM cation species within the HE DRX framework promotes better Li+ diffusion and improves lattice oxygen stability, consequently increasing capacity upon cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Polysulfide Solvation Structure with Electrode Kinetics towards Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising due to ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, their cycling lifespan is crucially affected by the electrode kinetics of lithium polysulfides. Herein, the polysulfide solvation structure is correlated with polysulfide electrode kinetics towards long&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S batteries. The solvation structure derived from strong solvating power electrolyte induces fast anode kinetics and rapid anode failure, while that derived from weak solvating power electrolyte causes sluggish cathode kinetics and rapid capacity loss. By contrast, the solvation structure derived from medium solvating power electrolyte balances cathode and anode kinetics and improves the cycling performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. Li&#8211;S coin cells with ultra&#8208;thin Li anodes and high&#8208;S&#8208;loading cathodes deliver 146 cycles and a 338 Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cell undergoes stable 30 cycles. This work clarifies the relationship between polysulfide solvation structure and electrode kinetics and inspires rational electrolyte design for long&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Five&#8208;Component Radical Relay Aminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical relay five&#8208;component double aminocarbonylation reaction of alkenes is described for direct access to valuable &#947;&#8208;trifluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides with good yields and selectivities. Crucial was the identification of distinct dual roles of the amine coupling partners, which sequentially act as electron donors for the formation of photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with radical precursors and then as a CO acceptor to form carbamoyl radicals.







Abstract
Radical single carbonylation reactions with CO constitute a direct and robust strategy toward various carbonyl compounds from readily available chemicals, and have been extensively studied over the past decades. However, realizing highly selective catalytic systems for controlled radical double carbonylation reactions has remained a substantial challenge, particularly for the more advanced multicomponent variants, despite their great potential value. Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical relay five&#8208;component radical double aminocarbonylation reaction of unactivated alkenes using CO under metal&#8208;free conditions. This protocol provides direct access to valuable &#947;&#8208;trifluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides with good yields and high chemoselectivity. Crucial was the identification of distinct dual roles of amine coupling partners, sequentially acting as electron donors for the formation of photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with radical precursors and then as a CO acceptor via nitrogen radical cations to form carbamoyl radicals. Cross&#8208;coupling of carbamoyl radicals with the acyl radicals that are formed in an alkene&#8208;based relay process affords double aminocarbonylation products.

         <title>A DNA Logic Circuit Equipped with a Biological Amplifier Loaded into Biomimetic ZIF&#8208;8 Nanoparticles Enables Accurate Identification of Specific Cancers In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amplifier module (AMP) was introduced to boost the signal of the DNA&#8208;based three&#8208;input &#8220;AND&#8221; logic circuit. Three microRNAs abnormally expressed in cancer cells were used as inputs, and all DNA logic circuit and amplifier elements were encapsulated in a ZIF&#8208;8 nano&#8208;carrier, which was then camouflaged with cancer cell membranes for the accurate identification of specific tumor subtypes in vivo.







Abstract
DNA logic circuits (DLC) enable the accurate identification of specific cell types, such as cancer cells, but they face the challenges of weak output signals and a lack of competent platforms that can efficiently deliver DLC components to the target site in the living body. To address these issues, we rationally introduced a cascaded biological amplifier module based on the Primer Exchange Reaction inspired by electronic circuit amplifier devices. As a paradigm, three abnormally expressed Hela cell microRNAs (&#8208;30a, &#8208;17, and &#8208;21) were chosen as &#8220;AND&#8221; gate inputs. DLC response to these inputs was boosted by the amplifier markedly enhancing the output signal. More importantly, the encapsulation of DLC and amplifier components into ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles resulted in their efficient delivery to the target site, successfully distinguishing the Hela tumor subtype from other tumors in vivo. Thus, we envision that this strategy has great potential for clinical cancer diagnosis.

         <title>Urea Functionalized Fe4L6 Cages for Supramolecular Gold Catalyst Encapsulation to Control Substrate Activation Modes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excellent catalytic performances of enzymes in terms of activity and selectivity are an inspiration for synthetic chemists and this has resulted in the development of synthetic containers for supramolecular catalysis. In such containers the local environment and pre&#8208;organization of catalysts and substrates leads to control of activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Herein we report a supramolecular strategy to encapsulate single catalysts in a urea functionalized Fe4L6 cage, which can co&#8208;encapsulate a functionalized urea&#8208;substrate via hydrogen bonding. Distinguished selectivity is obtained imposed by the cage as site isolation is only allowing catalysis via &#960; activation of the substrate and as a result the selectivity is independent of catalyst concentration. The encapsulated catalyst is more active than the free analogue, an effect that can be ascribed to transition state stabilization rather than substrate pre&#8208;organization, as revealed by the MM kinetic data. The simple strategy reported here is expected to be of general use in many reactions for which the catalyst can be functionalized with a sulfonate group required for encapsulation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multidimensional Approach to Modulating Ionizable Lipids for High&#8208;Performing and Organ&#8208;Selective mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has enabled a successful clinical application of mRNA vaccines. However, disclosure of design principles for the core component&#8722;ionizable lipids (ILs), improving the delivery efficacy and organ targeting of LNPs, remains a formidable challenge. Here, we reported a powerful strategy to modulate ILs in one&#8208;step chemistry using the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) under mild conditions. A large IL library of new structures was established simply and efficiently through a multidimensional approach, allowing us to identify the top&#8208;performing ILs in delivering mRNA via the formulated LNPs. Adjusting the skeleton of ILs has transformed the organ&#8208;specific and robust transfection in mRNA delivery from the liver to the spleen following different administration routes. Of note, a series of isomeric ILs were prepared and we found that the isomers mattered greatly in the performance of LNPs for mRNA delivery. Furthermore, owing to the bis&#8208;amide bonds formed in the Ugi&#8208;4CR reaction, the ILs within LNPs may form hydrogen bonding intermolecularly, facilitating the colloidal stabilization of LNPs. This work provides clues to the rapid discovery and rational design of IL candidates, assisting the application of mRNA therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nickel PyBox catalysts promote nucleophilic cyclopropanation reactions using CH2Cl2 as a methylene source and Mn as a stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope includes a broad range of alkenes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, including esters, amides, ketones, nitriles, sulfones, phosphonate esters, trifluoromethyl groups, and electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Enantioselective cyclopropanations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters have been developed using chiral PyBox ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest the intermediacy of a (PyBox)Ni=CH2 species, which adds to the alkene by a stepwise [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8211;C reductive elimination mechanism.

DFT models provide a rationale for the nucleophilic character of the nickel carbene and the sense of enantioinduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Low&#8208;Valence Single Atoms by Constructing Metalloid Tungsten Carbide Supports for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing novel single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supports to modulate the electronic structure is crucial to optimize the catalytic activity, but rather challenging. Herein, a general strategy is proposed to utilize the metalloid properties of supports to trap and stabilize single&#8208;atoms with low&#8208;valence states. A series of single&#8208;atoms supported on the surface of tungsten carbide (M&#8208;WCx, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a facile pyrolysis method. Benefiting from the metalloid properties of WCx, the single&#8208;atoms exhibit weak coordination with surface W and C atoms, resulting in the formation of low&#8208;valence active centers similar to metals. The unique metal&#8208;metal interaction effectively stabilizes the low&#8208;valence single atoms on the WCx surface and improves the electronic orbital energy level distribution of the active sites. As expected, the representative Ru&#8208;WCx exhibits superior mass activities of 7.84 and 62.52 A mgRu&#8208;1 for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER), respectively. In&#8208;depth mechanistic analysis demonstrates that an ideal dual&#8208;sites cooperative mechanism achieves a suitable adsorption balance of Had and OHad, resulting in an energetically favorable Vollmer step. This work offers new guidance for the precise construction of highly active SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;encapsulating Cofactor and Enzymes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Multienzyme Cascade Reactions with Cofactor Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Use of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for enzyme immobilization faces challenges in improving enzyme activity recovery and assembling cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme systems. Herein, we report a polyelectrolyte&#8208;assisted encapsulation approach (PAEA) that enables two cascades with four oxidoreductases and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) cofactors co&#8208;encapsulated in BioHOF&#8208;1 with excellent cargo loading and over 100%&#160;cascade activities. The key role of the polyelectrolyte is to coat enzymes and tether NAD(P)H, thus interacting with HOF monomers in place of enzymes, avoiding enzymes from destruction by HOF monomers. The versatility&#160;and efficiency of PAEA are further illustrated by an HOF&#8208;101&#8208;based bio&#8208;nanoreactor. Moreover, the immobilization by PAEA makes enzymes and NAD(P)H display excellent stability and recyclability. This work has demonstrated a facile and versatile PAEA for fabricating cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme cascade nanoreactors with HOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Absolute CO2/Xe Separation in Ultramicropore&#160;MOF for Anesthetic Gases Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xe is an ideal anesthetic gas, but it has not been widely used in practice due to its high cost and low output. Closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling is an economically viable method to ensure adequate supply in medical use. Herein, we design an innovative way to recover Xe by using a stable fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni to eliminate CO2 from moist exhaled anesthetic gases. Unlike other Xe recovery MOFs with low Xe/CO2 selectivity (less than 10), NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni could achieve absolute molecular sieve separation of CO2/Xe with excellent CO2 selectivity (825). Mixed&#8208;gas breakthrough experiments assert the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni as a molecular sieve adsorbent for the effective and energy&#8208;efficient removal of carbon dioxide with 99.16% Xe recovery. Absolute CO2/Xe separation in NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni makes closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling can be easily realized, demonstrating the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni for important anesthetic gas regeneration under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteomics&#8208;Based Discovery of First&#8208;in&#8208;Class Chemical Probes for Programmed Cell Death Protein 2 (PDCD2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical probes are essential tools for understanding biological systems and for credentialing potential biomedical targets. Programmed cell death 2 (PDCD2) is a member of the B&#8208;cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl&#8208;2) family of proteins, which are critical regulators of apoptosis. Here we report the discovery and characterization of 10e, a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule degrader of PDCD2. We discovered PDCD2 degrader by serendipity using a chemical proteomics approach in contrast to the conventional approach for making bivalent degraders starting from a known binding ligand targeting the protein of interest. Using 10e as a pharmacological probe, we demonstrate that PDCD2 functions as a critical regulator of cell growth by modulating the progression of the cell cycle in T lymphoblasts. Our work provides a useful pharmacological probe for investigating PDCD2 function and highlights using chemical proteomics to discover selective small molecule degraders of unanticipated targets.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion&#8208;type batteries apply the principle that more charge transfer is preferable. The underutilized electron transfer mode within two undermines the electrochemical performance of halogen batteries. Here, we realised a three&#8208;electron transfer lithium&#8211;halogen battery based on I&#8722;/I+ and Cl&#8722;/Cl0 couples by using a common commercial electrolyte saturated with Cl&#8722; anions. The resulting Li||tetrabutylammonium triiodide (TBAI3) cell exhibits three distinct discharging plateaus at 2.97, 3.40, and 3.85 V. Moreover, it has a high capacity of 631 mAh g&#8722;1I (265 mAh g&#8722;1electrode, based on entire mass loading) and record&#8208;high energy density of up to 2013 Wh kg&#8722;1I (845 Wh kg&#8722;1electrode). To support these findings, experimental characterisations and density functional theory calculations were conducted to elucidate the redox chemistry involved in this novel interhalogen strategy. We believe our paradigm presented here has a foreseeable inspiring effect on other halogen batteries for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pursuit.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Formal [1,3]&#8208;Aryl Shift within Molecular Bows</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delving into the influence of strain on organic reactions in small molecules at the molecular level can unveil valuable insight into developing innovative synthetic strategies and structuring molecules with superior properties. Herein, we present a molecular&#8208;strain engineering approach to facilitate  the  consecutive [1,2]&#8208;aryl shift (formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift) in molecular bows (MBs) that integrate 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene moieties. By introducing ring strain into MB through tethering the bow&#8208;limb, we can harness the intrinsic mechanical forces to drive multistep aryl shifts from para&#8208; to meta&#8208; to ortho&#8208;position.Through exercise of precise intramolecular strain, the seemingly impractical [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift was realized, resulting in the formation of ortho&#8208;disubstituted products. The solvent and temperature play a crucial role in the occurrence of the [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift.The free energy calculations with inclusion of solvation support a feasible mechanism, which entails multistep carbocation rearrangements, for the formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift. By exploring the application of molecular strain in synthetic chemistry, this research offers a promising direction for developing new tools and strategies towards precision organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Reversible Reforming between Ethylamine and Acetonitrile on Heterostructured Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of electrocatalysts is essential to achieve desirable performance of electrochemical synthesis process. Heterostructured catalysts have thus attracted widespread attention due to their multifunctional intrinsic properties, and diverse catalytic applications with corresponding outstanding activities. Here, we report an in&#8208;situ restoration strategy for the synthesis of ultrathin Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. Such Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets exhibit excellent activity and selectivity towards reversible electrochemical reforming of ethylamine and acetonitrile. In the acetonitrile reduction process, Pd acts as reaction center, while Ni(OH)2 provide proton hydrogen through promoting the dissociation of water. Also ethylamine oxidation process can be achieved on the surface of the heterostructured nanosheets with abundant Ni(II) defects. More importantly, an electrolytic cell driven by solar cells was successfully constructed to realize ethylamine&#8208;acetonitrile reversible reforming. This work demonstrates the importance of heterostructure engineering in the rational synthesis of multifunctional catalysts towards electrochemical synthesis of fine chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Hybrid Germanium(II) Halide with Strong Nonlinear Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral germanium halide is synthesized, which exhibits strong nonlinear chiroptical property. The second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism of the chiral germanium halide can reach 0.48, which is the highest value among lead&#8208;free chiral metal halides. Moreover, a large effective second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of 0.86&#8197;pm/V and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 38.46&#8197;GW/cm2 are also obtained.







Abstract
Due to the pronounced anisotropic response to circularly polarized light, chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have been regarded as promising candidates for the application in nonlinear chiroptics, especially for the second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) effect. However, designing novel lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides with large anisotropy factors and high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LDT) of SHG&#8208;CD remains challenging. Herein, we develop the first chiral hybrid germanium halide, (R/S&#8208;NEA)3Ge2I7&#8901;H2O (R/S&#8208;NGI), and systematically investigated its linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. S&#8208;NGI and R&#8208;NGI exhibit large anisotropy factors (gSHG&#8208;CD) of 0.45 and 0.48, respectively, along with a high LDT of 38.46&#8197;GW/cm2; these anisotropy factors were the highest values among the reported lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides. Moreover, the effective second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of S&#8208;NGI could reach up to 0.86&#8197;pm/V, which was 2.9 times higher than that of commercial Y&#8208;cut quartz. Our findings facilitate a new avenue toward lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides, and their implementation in nonlinear chiroptical applications.

         <title>Metal Free D&#246;tz&#8208;Type Aminobenzannulation Reaction via 1,1&#8208;Dipoles Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal free D&#246;tz&#8208;type Aminobenzannulation reaction via 1,1&#8208;dipoles cross&#8208;coupling is achieved. 100 examples including anilines, fused aryl amines and fused heteroaryl amines were synthesized through this versatile and practical strategy with broad substrate scope. Experimental and computational evidence confirms the key intermediate ketenimine, elucidates the reaction mechanism, and demonstrates the chemoselectivity in this approach.







Abstract
Aryl amines are of constant interest in organic synthesis owing to their ubiquity in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic materials. However, C&#8722;H amination or pre&#8208;functionalization frequently results in uncontrollable site selectivity, over activation and the generation of inseparable mixtures of regio&#8208;isomers. Here we present a novel metal free D&#246;tz&#8208;type aminobenzannulation reaction that circumvents the selectivity issues inherent in aromatic chemistry, as well as the use of stoichiometric unstable organolithium reagents and toxic chromium complexes. The concept of utilizing readily available isocyanides and Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) carbonates to achieve 1,1&#8208;dipoles cross&#8208;coupling to construct ketenimine is the key to success, which has been experimentally and computationally verified. The tandem 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/aromatization process offers a versatile method for synthesizing functionalized anilines, fused aryl amines and fused heteroaryl amines.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Effect in a Covalent&#8211;Organic Framework with Imidazole Groups Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent effect plays an important role in catalytic reaction, but there is little research and attention on it in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, we report a stable covalent&#8208;organic framework (denoted as PcNi&#8208;im) with imidazole groups as a new electrocatalyst for eCO2RR to CO. Interestingly, compared with neutral conditions, PcNi&#8208;im not only showed high Faraday efficiency of CO product (~100%) under acidic conditions (pH &#8776; 1), but also the partial current density was increased from 258 to 320 mA cm&#8211;2. No obvious degradation was observed over 10 hours of continuous operation at the current density of 250 mA cm&#8722;2. The mechanism study shows that the imidazole group on the framework can be protonated to form an imidazole cation in acidic media, hence reducing the surface work function and charge density of the active metal center. As a result, CO poisoning effect is weakened and the key intermediate *COOH is also stabilized, thus accelerating the catalytic reaction rate.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity Control in the Direct CO Esterification over Pd@UiO&#8208;66: The Pd Location Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selectivity control of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite toward dimethyl oxalate (DMO) or dimethyl carbonate (DMC) remains a grand challenge. Herein, Pd NPs are incorporated into isoreticular metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = &#8208;H, &#8208;NO2, &#8208;NH2), affording Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X, which unexpectedly exhibit high selectivity (up to 99%) to DMC and regulated activity in the direct CO esterification. In sharp contrast, the Pd NPs supported on the MOF, yielding Pd/UiO&#8208;66, displays high selectivity (89%) to DMO as always reported with Pd NPs. Both experimental and DFT calculation results prove that the Pd location relative to UiO&#8208;66 gives rise to discriminated microenvironment of different amounts of interface between Zr&#8208;oxo clusters and Pd NPs in Pd@UiO&#8208;66 and Pd/UiO&#8208;66, resulting in their distinctly different selectivity. This is an unprecedented finding on the production of DMC by Pd NPs, which was previously achieved by Pd(II) only, in the direct CO esterification.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Hydrophobicity&#8208;Induced Electro&#8208;Kinetic Retardation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electro&#8208;kinetic retardation strategy was developed to promote CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbon products. Slow reaction kinetics induced by the strong hydrophobicity of the ionomer prolongs the *CO intermediate residence on Cu surfaces, increasing the probability of C&#8722;C coupling. As a result, a multi&#8208;carbon product Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;90&#8201;% was achieved at a partial current density of 223&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Advancing the performance of the Cu&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is crucial for its practical applications. Still, the wettable pristine Cu surface often suffers from low exposure to CO2, reducing the Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and current densities for multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. Recent studies have proposed that increasing surface availability for CO2 by cation&#8208;exchange ionomers can enhance the C2+ product formation rates. However, due to the rapid formation and consumption of *CO, such promotion in reaction kinetics can shorten the residence of *CO whose adsorption determines C2+ selectivity, and thus the resulting C2+ FEs remain low. Herein, we discover that the electro&#8208;kinetic retardation caused by the strong hydrophobicity of quaternary ammonium group&#8208;functionalized polynorbornene ionomers can greatly prolong the *CO residence on Cu. This unconventional electro&#8208;kinetic effect is demonstrated by the increased Tafel slopes and the decreased sensitivity of *CO coverage change to potentials. As a result, the strongly hydrophobic Cu electrodes exhibit C2+ Faradaic efficiencies of &#8776;90&#8201;% at a partial current density of 223&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, more than twice of bare or hydrophilic Cu surfaces.

&lt;p&gt;An electro-kinetic retardation strategy was developed to promote CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to multi-carbon products. Slow reaction kinetics induced by the strong hydrophobicity of the ionomer prolongs the *CO intermediate residence on Cu surfaces, increasing the probability of C&#8722;C coupling. As a result, a multi-carbon product Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;90&#8201;% was achieved at a partial current density of 223&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancing the performance of the Cu-catalyzed electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) is crucial for its practical applications. Still, the wettable pristine Cu surface often suffers from low exposure to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, reducing the Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and current densities for multi-carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) products. Recent studies have proposed that increasing surface availability for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by cation-exchange ionomers can enhance the C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; product formation rates. However, due to the rapid formation and consumption of *CO, such promotion in reaction kinetics can shorten the residence of *CO whose adsorption determines C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity, and thus the resulting C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; FEs remain low. Herein, we discover that the electro-kinetic retardation caused by the strong hydrophobicity of quaternary ammonium group-functionalized polynorbornene ionomers can greatly prolong the *CO residence on Cu. This unconventional electro-kinetic effect is demonstrated by the increased Tafel slopes and the decreased sensitivity of *CO coverage change to potentials. As a result, the strongly hydrophobic Cu electrodes exhibit C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiencies of &#8776;90&#8201;% at a partial current density of 223&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, more than twice of bare or hydrophilic Cu surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Polyanionic Electrolytes for Highly Stable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biomass seaweed plants, an anionic polyelectrolyte alginate acid (SA) was used to initiate the in situ formation of the high&#8208;performance solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Zn anode. Attribute to the anionic groups of &#8722;COO&#8722;, the affinity of Zn2+ ions to alginate acid induces a well&#8208;aligned accelerating channel for uniform plating. The SEI also regulates the desolvation structure of Zn2+ and facilitates the formation of compact Zn (002) lattice planes.







Abstract
For zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), the non&#8208;uniform Zn plating/stripping results in a high polarization and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), hindering the large&#8208;scale application of ZIBs. Here, inspired by biomass seaweed plants, an anionic polyelectrolyte alginate acid (SA) was used to initiate the in situ formation of the high&#8208;performance solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Zn anode. Attribute to the anionic groups of &#8722;COO&#8722;, the affinity of Zn2+ ions to alginate acid induces a well&#8208;aligned accelerating channel for uniform plating. This SEI regulates the desolvation structure of Zn2+ and facilitates the formation of compact Zn (002) crystal planes. Even under high depth of discharge conditions (DOD), the SA&#8208;coated Zn anode still maintains a stable Zn stripping/plating behavior with a low potential difference (0.114&#8197;V). According to the classical nucleation theory, the nucleation energy for SA&#8208;coated Zn is 97&#8201;% less than that of bare Zn, resulting in a faster nucleation rate. The Zn||Cu cell assembled with the SA&#8208;coated electrode exhibits an outstanding average CE of 99.8&#8201;% over 1,400 cycles. The design is successfully demonstrated in pouch cells, where the SA&#8208;coated Zn exhibits capacity retention of 96.9&#8201;% compared to 59.1&#8201;% for bare Zn anode, even under the high cathode mass loading (&gt;10&#8197;mg/cm2).

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Metals in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Via Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Matrix isolation of low&#8208;valent complexes within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) facilitates exceptional gas&#8208;phase catalytic activity, stabilization of solution&#8208;inaccessible catalysts, and fundamental insight into pertinent reaction mechanisms. MOFs present an ideal porous, crystalline, and chemically mutable matrix for such species. Herein we examine synthesis techniques and applications for the matrix isolation of low&#8208;valent complexes within MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide uniquely tunable, periodic platforms for site&#8208;isolation of reactive low&#8208;valent metal complexes of relevance in modern catalysis, adsorptive applications, and fundamental structural studies. Strategies for integrating such species in MOFs include post&#8208;synthetic metalation, encapsulation and direct synthesis using low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes as building blocks. These approaches have each proven effective in enhancing catalytic activity, modulating product distributions (i.e., by improving catalytic selectivity), and providing valuable mechanistic insights. In this minireview, we explore these different strategies, as applied to isolate low&#8208;valent species within MOFs, with a particular focus on examples that leverage the unique crystallinity, permanent porosity and chemical mutability of MOFs to achieve deep structural insights that lead to new paradigms in the field of hybrid catalysis.

         <title>Hollow STW&#8208;Type Zeolite Single Crystals with Aluminum Gradient for Highly Selective Production of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol&#8208;Toluene Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical hollow single crystal STW&#8208;type zeolite is directly prepared in an alkalinous fluoride medium and exhibits excellent catalytic performance in toluene methylation reactions to p&#8208;xylene.







Abstract
Zeolites with uniform micropores are important shape&#8208;selective catalysts. However, the external acid sites of zeolites have a negative impact on shape&#8208;selective catalysis, and the microporosity may lead to serious diffusion limitation. Herein, we report on the direct synthesis of hierarchical hollow STW&#8208;type zeolite single crystals with a siliceous exterior. In an alkalinous fluoride medium, the nucleation of highly siliceous STW zeolites takes place first, and the nanocrystals are preferentially aligned on the outer surface of the gel agglomerates to grow into single crystalline shells upon crystallization. The lagged crystallization of the internal Al&#8208;rich amorphous gels onto the inner surface of nanocrystalline zeolite shells leads to the formation of hollow cavities in the core of the zeolite crystals. The hollow zeolite single crystals possess a low&#8208;to&#8208;high aluminum gradient from the surface to the core, resulting in an intrinsic inert external surface, and exhibit superior catalytic performance in toluene methylation reactions.

         <title>Bismuth in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: Access to a Bowl&#8208;Type Macrocycle and a Barrel&#8208;Type Heptanuclear Complex Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bi&#8722;C bonds in a dinuclear organometallic bismuth(III) compound with a thioxanthene linker are highly susceptible to transformations in the realm of dynamic covalent chemistry. Control of the reactions is obtained through template strategies, solvent effects, and the utilization of catalysts. This grants access to novel macrocyclic and barrel&#8208;type compounds, including a well&#8208;defined heptanuclear cationic complex.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) is a powerful and widely applied tool in modern synthetic chemistry, which is based on the reversible cleavage and formation of covalent bonds. One of the inherent strengths of this approach is the perspective to reversibly generate in an operationally simple approach novel structural motifs that are difficult or impossible to access with more traditional methods and require multiple bond cleaving and bond forming steps. To date, these fundamentally important synthetic and conceptual challenges in the context of DCvC have predominantly been tackled by exploiting compounds of lighter p&#8208;block elements, even though heavier p&#8208;block elements show low bond dissociation energies and appear to be ideally suited for this approach. Here we show that a dinuclear organometallic bismuth compound, containing BiMe2 groups that are connected by a thioxanthene linker, readily undergoes selective and reversible cleavage of its Bi&#8722;C bonds upon exposure to external stimuli. The exploitation of DCvC in the field of organometallic heavy p&#8208;block chemistry grants access to unprecedented macrocyclic and barrel&#8208;type oligonuclear compounds.

         <title>Back Cover: Manipulating Intermetallic Charge Transfer for Switchable External Stimulus&#8208;Enhanced Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying external stimuli is critical to circumvent the limitations imposed by linear scaling relationships in electrocatalytic applications. Franziska Simone Hegner, Ferdi Karadas et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Research Article (e202308647) that the water oxidation electrocatalytic activity of Co&#8211;Fe Prussian blue could be enhanced under magnetic field and light irradiation, which originates from an external&#8208;stimulus sensitive spin&#8208;crossover process.

         <title>Photoactivatable Carbo&#8208; and Silicon&#8208;Rhodamines and Their Application in MINFLUX Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical nanoscopy of cells expressing Vimentin&#8208;HaloTag fusion proteins and labeled with photoactivatable fluorescent dyes is demonstrated in 2D and 3D modes on a commercial MINFLUX (minimal fluxes) setup. The dye synthesis and properties, photoactivation rates, labeling procedures, detection efficiencies, and other parameters related to the practical use of the probes are reported and discussed.







Abstract
New photoactivatable fluorescent dyes (rhodamine, carbo&#8208; and silicon&#8208;rhodamines [SiR]) with emission ranging from green to far red have been prepared, and their photophysical properties studied. The photocleavable 2&#8208;nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl unit with an alpha&#8208;carboxyl group as a branching point and additional functionality was attached to a polycyclic and lipophilic fluorescent dye. The photoactivatable probes having the HaloTagTM amine (O2) ligand bound with a dye core were obtained and applied for live&#8208;cell staining in stable cell lines incorporating Vimentin (VIM) or Nuclear Pore Complex Protein NUP96 fused with the HaloTag. The probes were applied in 2D (VIM, NUP96) and 3D (VIM) MINFLUX nanoscopy, as well as in superresolution fluorescence microscopy with single fluorophore activation (VIM, live&#8208;cell labeling). Images of VIM and NUPs labeled with different dyes were acquired and their apparent dimensions and shapes assessed on a lower single&#8208;digit nanometer scale. Applicability and performance of the photoactivatable dye derivatives were evaluated in terms of photoactivation rate, labeling and detection efficiency, number of detected photons per molecule and other parameters related to MINFLUX nanoscopy.

         <title>Zwitterionic Polymeric Sulfur Ylides with Minimal Charge Separation Open a New Generation of Antifouling and Bactericidal Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stronger together: Unlike most zwitterionic materials, including polybetaines, sulfur ylides exhibit minimal charge separation. We show that poly(sulfur ylides) effectively inhibit the adhesion of biomolecules and pathogenic bacteria. Notably, we show that polymeric sulfur ylides create a toxic environment for bacterial cells that surpass the initial hydration barrier while remaining non&#8208;toxic to mammalian cells.







Abstract
Zwitterionic polymers are widely employed hydrophilic building blocks for antifouling coatings with numerous applications across a wide range of fields, including but not limited to biomedical science, drug delivery and nanotechnology. Zwitterionic polymers are considered as an attractive alternative to polyethylene glycol because of their biocompatibility and effectiveness to prevent&#160;formation of biofilms. To this end, zwitterionic polymers are classified in two categories, namely polybetaines and polyampholytes. Yet, despite a fundamental interest to drive the development of new antifouling materials, the chemical composition of zwitterionic polymer remains severely limited. Here, we show that poly(sulfur ylides) that&#160;belong&#160;to the largely overlooked class of poly(ylides),&#160;effectively prevent the&#160;formation of biofilms from pathogenic bacteria. While surface energy analysis reveals strong hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor capabilities of poly(sulfur ylide), membrane damage of pathogenic bacteria induced by poly(sulfur ylides) indicates toxicity towards bacteria while not affecting eucaryotic cells. Such synergistic effect of poly(sulfur ylides) offers distinct advantages over polyethylene glycol when designing new antifouling materials. We expect that our findings will pave the way for the development of a range of ylide&#8208;based materials with antifouling properties that have yet to be explored, opening up new directions at the interface of chemistry, biology, and material science.

         <title>Back Cover: Promoter&#8208;Controlled Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Cyclic Mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic oligosaccharides such as cyclodextrins are extensively employed as carriers for drug delivery owing to their remarkable host properties and excellent biocompatibility. In their Research Article (e202307851), You Yang et&#8197;al. present a promoted&#8208;controlled cycloglycosylation approach for the synthesis of a series of cyclic mannosides up to a 32&#8208;mer. The cyclic mannosides of various sizes were demonstrated by NMR and computational studies to adopt different conformational states and shapes.

         <title>Inside Cover: Rationalizing In Situ Active Repair in Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysis via Non&#8208;Invasive Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ active repair and detection of hydrogen via ammonium persulfate (APS) and rotational Raman spectroscopy facilitates the responsible use of non&#8208;abundant transition metal complexes. The bridged heterodinuclear photocatalyst RuPtI2 used in photocatalytic hydrogen production can now be repaired via the simple addition of ammonium persulfate, as reported by Sven Rau, Boris Mizaikoff et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202306287). Along with the innovative in situ detection of hydrogen via rotational Raman spectroscopy the applicability of active repair mechanisms for a wide range of reductive catalysts is demonstrated.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs), which transport small molecules, proteins, and nucleotides within a lipid bilayer, serve as communication facilitators. Toshiyuki Wakimoto et&#8197;al. revealed in their Research Article (e202307304) that MVs&#8208;mediated interbacterial communication triggers silent secondary metabolite production in various bacteria. Particularly striking is the competitive interaction between Burkholderia multivorans and Xenorhabdus innexi, involving the exchange of their respective MVs and the MVs&#8208;induced&#160;secondary metabolites.

         <dc:description>The design of efficient heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) based on through bond charge transfer (TBCT) features is a formidable challenge due to the criteria of orthogonal donor&#8208;acceptor geometry. Herein, we propose using parallel (face&#8208;to&#8208;face) conformation carbazole&#8208;bodipy donor&#8208;acceptor dyads (BCZ&#8208;1 and BCZ&#8208;2) featuring through space intramolecular charge transfer (TSCT) process as efficient triplet PS. Efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916; = 61%) and long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (&#964;T = 186 &#956;s) were observed in the TSCT dyads compared to BCZ&#8208;3 (&#934;&#916; = 0.4%), the dyad involving TBCT, demonstrating the superiority of the TSCT approach over conventional donor&#8208;acceptor system. Moreover, the transient absorption study revealed that TSCT dyads have a faster charge separation and slower intersystem crossing process induced by charge recombination compared to TBCT dyad. A long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (CSS) was observed in the BCZ&#8208;1 (&#964;CSS = 24 ns). For the first time, the TSCT dyad was explored for the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion, and a high upconversion quantum yield of 11% was observed. Our results demonstrate a new avenue for designing efficient PSs and open up exciting opportunities for future research in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Unstrained Heterocycles Using Cobalt Vinylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt catalysts promote highly enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2,5&#8208;dihydrofurans using vinylidenes. The products are acyclic organozinc compounds that can be functionalized with an electrophile. The proposed mechanism involves the generation of a cobalt vinylidene species that adds to the alkene by a [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloaddition pathway. Ring&#8208;opening then occurs via outer&#8208;sphere &#946;&#8208;O elimination assisted by coordination of a ZnX2 Lewis acid to the alkoxide leaving group. DFT models reveal that competing inner&#8208;sphere syn &#946;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;O elimination pathways are suppressed by the geometric constraints of the metallacycle intermediate. These models rationalize the observed stereochemical outcome of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Multiple Phosphorescence from Functionalized Corannulenes: Temperature Sensing and Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Corannulene&#8208;derived materials have been extensively explored in energy storage and solar cells, but, however, are rarely documented as emitters in light&#8208;emitting sensors and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), due to low exciton utilization. Here, we report a family of multi&#8208;donor and acceptor (multi&#8208;D&#8208;A) motifs, TCzPhCor, TDMACPhCor, and TPXZPhCor, using corannulene as the acceptor and carbazole (Cz), 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;dimethylacridine (DMAC), and phenoxazine (PXZ) as the donor, respectively. By decorating corannulene with different donors, multiple phosphorescence is realized. Theoretical and photophysical investigations reveal that TCzPhCor shows room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from the lowest&#8208;lying T1; however, for TDMACPhCor, dual RTP originating from a higher&#8208;lying T1 (T1H) and a lower&#8208;lying T1 (T1L) can be observed, while for TPXZPhCor, T1H&#8208;dominated RTP occurs resulting from a stabilized high&#8208;energy T1 geometry. Benefiting from the high&#8208;temperature sensitivity of TPXZPhCor, high color&#8208;resolution temperature sensing is achieved. Besides, due to degenerate S1 and T1H states of TPXZPhCor, the first corannulene&#8208;based solution&#8208;processed afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is investigated. The afterglow OLED with TPXZPhCor shows a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) and a luminance (Lmax) of 3.3% and 5167 cd m&#8208;2, respectively, which is one of the most efficient afterglow RTP OLEDs reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Four &#8211; Electron Oxidative Addition of an N=N Double Bond at a Chromium Metallocyclopropene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report describes the synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral chromium alkyne complex supported by a bidentate phosphinimide ligand and its reactivity with azobenzene. Characterization of the former by structural and computational methods reveals an unprecedented extent of alkyne activation by a formal chromium(II) center, suggesting that this complex is best described as a chromium(IV)&#8208;metallocyclopropene. Exposure of this compound to an azobenzene derivative results in the formation of a chromium(VI) diimido complex, which constitutes a rare 4&#8208;electron oxidative addition of an N=N double bond. The isolation of a chromium(IV)&#8208;hydrazido intermediate enabled mechanistic investigations of this challenging bond cleavage process. This work substantiates the notion that terminal phosphinimide ligands can engender first&#8208;row transition metal ions with exceptional reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional conductive covalent organic framework with anisotropic charge transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with efficient charge transport is of high immense interest for application in opto&#8208;electronic devices. To enhance COF charge transport properties, electroactive building blocks and dopants can be used to induce extended conduction channels. However, understanding their intricate interplay remains challenging. We designed and synthesized a tailor&#8208;made COF structure with electroactive hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) core units and planar dioxin (D) linkages, denoted as HD&#8208;COF. With the support of theoretical calculations, we found that the HAT units in the HD&#8208;COF induce strong, eclipsed &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The unique stacking of HAT units and the weak in&#8208;plane conjugation of dioxin linkages leads to efficient anisotropic charge transport. We fabricated HD&#8208;COF films to minimize the grain boundary effect of bulk COFs, which resulted in enhanced conductivity. As a result, the HD&#8208;COF films showed an electrical conductivity as high as 1.25 S cm&#8722;1 after doping with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Oximesulfonylation of Alkenes Using Sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as Bifunctional Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of oxime ethers as bifunctional reagents remains unknown. Herein, we present a mechanistically distinct strategy that enables oximesulfonylation of olefins using sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as bifunctional reagents under metal&#8208;free photochemical conditions. Via concomitant C&#8208;S and C&#8208;C bond formation, the process permits incorporation of oxime and sulfonyl groups into olefins in a complete atom&#8208;economic fashion, providing rapid access to multi&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl oxime ethers with good yields and stereoselectivity. The method is amenable to functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and is shown to be scalable. A radical chain mechanism initiated via photochemical Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) mediated N&#8208;O bond cleavage is suggested for the process, based on our results on mechanistic investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane over Au1Ag Single&#8208;atom Alloy Modified ZnO with Oxygen and Water Vapor: Synergy of Gold and Silver</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H dissociation and C&#8211;C coupling are two key steps in converting CH4 into multi&#8208;carbon compounds. Here we report a synergy of Au and Ag to greatly promote C2H6 formation over Au1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticles (Au1Ag NPs)&#8208;modified ZnO catalyst via photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (POCM) with O2 and H2O. Atomic dispersed Au in Au1Ag NPs effectively promotes the dissociation of O2 and H2O into *OOH, promoting C&#8211;H activation of CH4 on the photogenerated O&#8210; to form *CH3. Electron&#8208;deficient Au single atoms, as hopping ladders, also facilitate the migration of electron donor *CH3 from ZnO to Au1Ag NPs. Finally, *CH3 coupling can readily occur on Ag atoms of Au1Ag NPs. An excellent C2H6 yield of 14.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (79% selectivity) with apparent quantum yield (14.6% at 350 nm) is obtained via POCM with O2 and H2O, which is at least 2 times of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalytic system. The bimetallic synergistic strategy offers guidance for the future catalysts design for POCM with O2 and H2O.</dc:description>

         <title>Superparamagnetic Composite Nanobeads Anchored with Molecular Glues for Ultrasensitive Label&#8208;free Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mass spectrometry has emerged as a mainstream technique for label&#8208;free proteomics. However, proteomic coverage for trace samples is constrained by adsorption loss during repeated elution at sample pretreatment. Here, we demonstrated superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles functionalized with molecular glues (MGs) to enrich proteins in trace human biofluid. We showed high protein binding (&gt;95%) and recovery (~90%) rates by anchor&#8208;nanoparticles. We further proposed a Streamlined Workflow based on Anchor&#8208;nanoparticles for Proteomics (SWAP) method that enabled unbiased protein capture, protein digestion and pure peptides elution in one single tube. We demonstrated SWAP to quantify over 2500 protein groups with 100 HEK 293T cells. We adopted SWAP to profile proteomics with trace aqueous humor samples from cataract (n=15) and wet age&#8208;related macular degeneration (n=8) patients, and quantified ~1400 proteins from 5 &#956;l aqueous humor. SWAP simplifies sample preparation steps, minimizes adsorption loss and improves protein coverage for label&#8208;free proteomics with previous trace samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Chemical Regulation of Reactive X Species for Versatile Disease Treatments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive X species (RXS), encompassing elements such as O, N, C, S, Se, Cl, Br, I, and H, play vital roles in cell biology and physiological function, impacting cellular signal transduction, metabolic regulation and disease processes. The redox unbalance of RXS is firmly implicated in an assortment of physiological and pathological disorders, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the intricate nature and multifactorial dependence of RXS pose challenges in comprehending and precisely modulating their biological behavior. Nanomaterials with distinct characteristics and biofunctions offer promising avenues for generating or scavenging RXS to maintain redox homeostasis and advance disease therapy. This minireview provides a tutorial summary of the relevant chemistry and specific mechanisms governing different RXS, focusing on cellular metabolic regulation, stress responses, and the role of nanomedicine in RXS generation and elimination. The challenges associated with chemically regulating RXS for diverse disease treatments are further discussed along with the future prospects, aiming to facilitate the clinical translation of RXS&#8208;based nanomedicine and open new avenues for improved therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>
