         <title>Photo&#8208;Switchable Peroxidase/Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of Carbon Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes possess multi&#8208;enzyme activities over the natural enzymes, which produce multi&#8208;pathway synergistic effects&#160;for varies of biomedical applications. Unfortunately, their&#160;multi&#8208;enzyme activities&#160;are in fighting, significantly reducing the synergistic effects. Dynamic regulation of their multi&#8208;enzyme activities is the bottleneck for intelligent therapies. Herein, we construct a novel oxygen&#8208;nitrogen functionalized carbon quantum dots (O/N&#8208;CQDs) with peroxidase&#8208;like&#160;(Reactive oxygen species (ROS) producer) activity. Interestingly, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity can be reversibly converted to catalase&#8208;like&#160;(ROS scavenger) activity under visible light irradiation. It is found that both the peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs can be precisely manipulated by the light intensity. The mechanism of switchable enzyme activities is attributed to the polarization of quinoid nitrogen in polyaniline (PANI) precursor retained on O/N&#8208;CQDs under visible light, which consumes the ROS to produce O2&#160;and H2O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we are able to non&#8208;intrusively up and down regulate the ROS level in cells successfully by simply switching off and on the light&#160;respectively, potentially facilitating the precise medicine based on the development of the disease. Indeed, the photo&#8208;switchable peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs opens a non&#8208;invasive strategy for better manipulations of the multi&#8208;activity of nanozymes, promising their wider and more intelligent biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of Protonated Sulfur Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salts of protonated sulfur dioxide were synthesized by recrystallization of [FS(OX)2][SbF6] (X&#160;=&#160;H, D) in aprotic solvents at low temperatures. Hemiprotonated sulfur dioxide [(SO2)2H][Sb2F11] was obtained from the solvent SO2 and the monoprotonated sulfur dioxide [OSOD][Sb2F11], using 1,1,1,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethane as solvent. For both compounds, single crystals were obtained and an X&#8208;ray structure analysis was conducted. Furthermore, the salts were characterized by Raman spectroscopy and the results were discussed together with quantum chemical calculations on the M06&#8208;2X/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyl&#8211;&#960; Functional Molecular Gels: Control of Elastic Modulus and Improvement of Electret Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of optoelectronically&#8208;active soft materials is drawing attention to the application of soft electronics. A room&#8208;temperature solvent&#8208;free liquid obtained by modifying a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with flexible yet bulky alkyl chains is a promising functional soft material. Tuning the elastic modulus (G&#8242;) is essential for employing optoelectronically&#8208;active alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids in deformable devices. However, the range of G&#8242; achieved through the molecular design of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids is limited. We report herein a method for controlling G&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by gelation. Adding 1 wt% low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator formed the alkyl&#8211;&#960; functional molecular gel (FMG) and increased G&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by up to seven orders of magnitude while retaining the optical properties. Because alkyl&#8211;&#960; FMGs have functional &#960;&#8208;moieties in the gel medium, this new class of gels has a much higher content of &#960;&#8208;moieties of up to 59 wt% compared to conventional &#960;&#8208;gels of only a few wt%. More importantly, the gel state has a 23% higher charge&#8208;retention capacity than the liquid, providing better performance in deformable mechanoelectric generator&#8208;electret devices. The strategy used in this study is a novel approach for developing next&#8208;generation optoelectronically&#8208;active FMG materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution in Neutral Media by Differential Intermediate Binding at Charge&#8208;modulated Sites of a Bimetallic Alloy Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The energy barrier to dissociate neutral water has been lowered by the differential intermediate binding on the charge&#8208;modulated metal centers of Co85Mo15 sheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam (NF), where the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) is only 50 &#177; 9 mV at &#8208;10 mA cm&#8208;2. It has a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.18 s&#8208;1, mass activity of 13.2 A g&#8208;1 at &#8208;200 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and produces 16 ml H2 h&#8208;1 at &#8208;300 mV vs. RHE, more than double that of 20% Pt/C. The Mod+ and Cod&#8208; sites adsorb OH*, and H*, respectively, and the electron injection from Co to H&#8208;O&#8208;H cleaves the O&#8208;H bond to form the Mo&#8208;OH* intermediate. Operando spectral analyses indicate a weak H&#8208;bonded network for facilitating the H2O*/OH* transport, and a potential&#8208;induced reversal of the charge density from Co to the more electronegative Mo, because of the electron withdrawing Co&#8208;H* and Mo&#8208;OH* species. Co85Mo15/NF can also drive the complete electrolysis of neutral water at only 1.73 V (10 mA cm&#8208;2). In alkaline, and acidic media, it demonstrates a Pt&#8208;like HER activity, accomplishing &#8208;1000 mA cm&#8208;2 at overpotentials of 161 &#177; 7, and 175 &#177; 22 mV, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Ethylene Epoxidation by Single Atom Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical synthesis of ethylene oxide (EO) using ethylene and water under ambient conditions presents a low&#8208;carbon alternative to existing industrial production process. Yet, the electrocatalytic ethylene epoxidation route is currently hindered by largely insufficient activity, EO selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. Here we report a single atom Ru&#8208;doped hollandite structure KIr4O8 (KIrRuO) nanowire catalyst for efficient EO production via a chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene epoxidation process. The KIrRuO catalyst exhibits an EO partial current density up to 0.7 A cm&#8722;2 and an EO yield as high as 92.0%. The impressive electrocatalytic performance towards ethylene epoxidation is ascribed to the modulation of electronic structure of adjacent Ir sites by single Ru atoms, which stabilizes the *CH2CH2OH intermediate and facilitates the formation of active Cl2 species during the generation of 2&#8208;chloroethanol, the precursor of EO. This work provides a single atom modulation strategy for improving the reactivity of adjacent metal sites in heterogeneous electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Nondirected Late&#8208;Stage C(sp2)&#8211;H Deuteration of Heteroarenes Enabled Through a Multi&#8208;Substrate Screening Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The importance of deuterium labelling in a variety of applications, ranging from mechanistic studies to drug&#8208;discovery, has spurred immense interest in the development of new methods for its efficient incorporation in organic, and especially in bioactive molecules. The five&#8208;membered heteroarenes at the center of this work are ubiquitous motifs in bioactive molecules and efficient methods for the deuterium labelling of these compounds are therefore highly desirable. However, the profound differences in chemical properties encountered between different heteroarenes hamper the development of a single set of broadly applicable reaction conditions, often necessitating a separate optimization campaign for a given type of heteroarene. In this study we describe the use of a multi&#8208;substrate screening approach to identify optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. Using this approach, four sets of complementary reaction conditions derived from our dual ligand&#8208;based palladium catalysts for nondirected C(sp2)&#8211;H activation were identified, that together enable the deuteration of structurally diverse heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

However, the profound differences in chemical properties encountered between different heteroarenes hamper the development of a single set of broadly applicable reaction conditions, often necessitating a separate optimization campaign for a given type of heteroarene. In this study we describe the use of a multi-substrate screening approach to identify optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. Using this approach, four sets of complementary reaction conditions derived from our dual ligand-based palladium catalysts for nondirected C(sp2)&#8211;H activation were identified, that together enable the deuteration of structurally diverse heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Dienes for Stereodivergent Construction of 1,5&#8208;Nonadjacent Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of two distal stereocenters through a single catalytic process is of great interest in organic synthesis. While there are some successful reports regarding stereodivergent preparation of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;stereocenters, the more challenged 1,5&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters have never been achieved in a stereodivergent fashion. Herein we describe a synergistic palladium/copper catalysis for 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes, providing access to 1,5&#8208;nonadjacent quaternary stereocenters. Because each of the two catalysts separately controlled one of the newly formed stereocenters, stereodivergent synthesis of all four diastereomers of the products could readily be achieved simply by choosing an appropriate combination of chiral catalysts. Experimental and computational studies supported a mechanism involving a Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost cascade reaction, and the origins of the stereoselectivity were elucidated.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed reconstructing connected hydrogen&#8208;bond networks on the spinel surface by coupling hydrophilic units to defuse the trade&#8208;off of free water migration and deprotonation. The designed Mn&#8722;Co3O4@CN as a non&#8208;precious OER catalyst demonstrated a low overpotential of 395&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an acidic medium and even surpasses RuO2 activity at high current density (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 @ ~538&#8197;mV).







Abstract
Developing highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acidic conditions is a pressing demand for proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis. Manipulating proton character at the electrified interface, as the crux of all proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, is highly desirable but elusive. Herein we present a promising protocol, which reconstructs a connected hydrogen&#8208;bond network between the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface by coupling hydrophilic units to boost acidic OER activity. Modelling on N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;layer clothed Mn&#8208;doped&#8208;Co3O4 (Mn&#8722;Co3O4@CN), we unravel that the hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between CN units and H2O molecule not only drags the free water to enrich the surface of Mn&#8722;Co3O4 but also serves as a channel to promote the dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, the modulated local charge of the Co sites from CN units/Mn dopant lowers the OER barrier. Therefore, Mn&#8722;Co3O4@CN surpasses RuO2 at high current density (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 @ ~538&#8197;mV).

         <title>Long&#8208;cycling and High&#8208;voltage Solid State Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Fluorinated and Crosslinked Polyether Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated and crosslinked polyether electrolyte (FGPE) exhibiting excellent oxidation stability was developed, which enabled the polymer electrolyte&#8208;based Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 batteries to achieve the longest cycling of 1000 cycles and high operating voltage of 4.7&#8197;V. Notably, solid&#8208;state industry&#8208;level 18650 cylindrical cells were first reported with an outstanding stability (500 cycles).







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), constructed through the in situ fabrication of polymer electrolytes, are considered a critical strategy for the next&#8208;generation battery systems with high energy density and enhanced safety. However, the constrained oxidation stability of polymers, such as the extensively utilized polyethers, limits their applications in high&#8208;voltage batteries and further energy density improvements. Herein, an in situ fabricated fluorinated and crosslinked polyether&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte, FGPE, is presented, exhibiting a high oxidation potential (5.1&#8197;V). The fluorinated polyether significantly improves compatibility with both lithium metal and high&#8208;voltage cathode, attributed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8722;CF3 group and the generated LiF&#8208;rich electrolyte/electrode interphase. Consequently, the solid&#8208;state Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 batteries employing FGPE demonstrate exceptional cycling performances of 1000 cycles with 78&#8201;% retention, representing one of the best results ever reported for polymer electrolytes. Moreover, FGPE enables batteries to operate at 4.7&#8197;V, realizing the highest operating voltage of polyether&#8208;based batteries to date. Notably, our designed in situ FGPE provides the solid&#8208;state batteries with exceptional cycling stability even at practical conditions, including high cathode loading (21&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and industry&#8208;level 18650&#8208;type cylindrical cells (1.3&#8197;Ah, 500 cycles). This work provides critical insights into the development of oxidation&#8208;stable polymer electrolytes and the advancement of practical high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Modulation by Co (II) Ion of Optical Activities of L/D&#8208;glutathione (GSH)&#8208;modified Chiral Copper Nanoclusters for Sensitive Adenosine Triphosphate Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the regulation ability of Co2+ toward the chiral and fluorescent optical activities of chiral Cu NCs is discovered, which produces strong chiral optical activity (the asymmetry factor of chirality is enhanced by a factor of 223), and its distribution is modulated from the UV region to the visible region. More importantly, the chirality effect on the detection sensitivity of chiral biological targets is well illustrated, providing helpful guidance for constructing chiral nanoprobes with better detection performances for chiral biotargets.







Abstract
Chiral nanoscale enantiomers exhibit different biological effects in living systems. However, their chirality effect on the detection sensitivity for chiral biological targets still needs to be explored. Here, we discovered that Co2+ can modulate the luminescence performance of L/D&#8208;glutathione (GSH)&#8208;modified copper nanoclusters (L/D&#8722;Cu NCs) and induce strong chiroptical activities as the asymmetric factor was enhanced 223&#8208;fold with their distribution regulating from the ultraviolet to visible region. One Co2+ coordinated with two GSH molecules that modified on the surface of Cu NCs in the way of CoN2O2. On this basis, dual&#8208;modal chiral and luminescent signals of Co2+ coordinated L/D&#8722;Cu NCs (L/D&#8722;Co&#8722;Cu NCs) were used to detect the chiral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) based on the competitive interaction between surficial GSH and ATP molecules with Co2+. The limits of detection of ATP obtained with fluorescence and circular dichroism intensity were 9.15&#8197;&#956;M and 15.75&#8197;nM for L&#8722;Co&#8722;Cu NCs, and 5.35&#8197;&#956;M and 4.69&#8197;nM for D&#8722;Co&#8722;Cu NCs. This demonstrated that selecting suitable chiral configurations of nanoprobes effectively enhances detection sensitivity. This study presents not only a novel method to modulate and enhance the chiroptical activity of nanomaterials but also a unique perspective of chirality effects on the detection performances for bio&#8208;targets.

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor in Organic Photovoltaic Cells by Tuning Molecular Electrostatic Potential Fluctuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized an outstanding acceptor material, namely ITOC6&#8208;4F, characterized by a considerably low amplitude of electrostatic potential fluctuation (0.8&#8197;kcal/mol). The ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell exhibits an extremely low bimolecular recombination rate constant of 0.66&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1. Consequently, this has led to the attainment of a new record fill factor of 0.816 in binary organic photovoltaic cells.







Abstract
In the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), significant progress has been made in tailoring molecular structures to enhance the open&#8208;circuit voltage and the short&#8208;circuit current density. However, there remains a crucial gap in the development of coordinated material design strategies focused on improving the fill factor (FF). Here, we introduce a molecular design strategy that incorporates electrostatic potential fluctuation to design organic photovoltaic materials. By reducing the fluctuation amplitude of IT&#8208;4F, we synthesized a new acceptor named ITOC6&#8208;4F. When using PBQx&#8208;TF as a donor, the ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell shows a markedly low recombination rate constant of 0.66&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1 and demonstrates an outstanding FF of 0.816, both of which are new records for binary OPV cells. Also, we find that a small fluctuation amplitude could decrease the energetic disorder of OPV cells, reducing energy loss. Finally, the ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell creates the highest efficiency of 16.0&#8201;% among medium&#8208;gap OPV cells. Our work holds a vital implication for guiding the design of high&#8208;performance OPV materials.

         <title>Discovery of Selective and Potent ATR Degrader for Exploration its Kinase&#8208;Independent Functions in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present work, a selective and potent ATR degrader was identified which was used as probe for explore the kinase&#8208;independent function of ATR. The results showed that ATR kinase inhibitor induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited the growth of AML&#8197;cells. The ATR degrader was inclined to trigger immediate apoptosis in AML&#8197;cells. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that ATR deletion induced nuclear envelope rupture, leading to genome instability, irreparable DNA damage. It causes to upregulate the level of p53 and subsequently triggers p53&#8208;mediated cell apoptosis.







Abstract
ATR has emerged as a promising target for anti&#8208;cancer drug development. Several potent ATR inhibitors are currently undergoing various stages of clinical trials, but none have yet received FDA approval due to unclear regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we discovered a potent and selective ATR degrader. Its kinase&#8208;independent regulatory functions in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were elucidated using this proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecule as a probe. The ATR degrader, 8&#8201;i, exhibited significantly different cellular phenotypes compared to the ATR kinase inhibitor 1. Mechanistic studies revealed that ATR deletion led to breakdown in the nuclear envelope, causing genome instability and extensive DNA damage. This would increase the expression of p53 and triggered immediately p53&#8208;mediated apoptosis signaling pathway, which was earlier and more effective than ATR kinase inhibition. Based on these findings, the in vivo anti&#8208;proliferative effects of ATR degrader 8&#8201;i were assessed using xenograft models. The degrader significantly inhibited the growth of AML&#8197;cells in vivo, unlike the ATR inhibitor. These results suggest that the marked anti&#8208;AML activity is regulated by the kinase&#8208;independent functions of the ATR protein. Consequently, developing potent and selective ATR degraders could be a promising strategy for treating AML.

         <title>Overcoming Thermal Quenching in X&#8208;ray Scintillators through Multi&#8208;Excited State Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of the hybrid perovskite TpyBiCl5 scintillator to switch between TDAF and phosphorescence modes at elevated temperatures provides an effective solution to overcome thermal quenching in X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray scintillators have gained significant attention in medical diagnostics and industrial applications. Despite their widespread utility, scintillator development faces a significant hurdle when exposed to elevated temperatures, as it usually results in reduced scintillation efficiency and diminished luminescence output. Here we report a molecular design strategy based on a hybrid perovskite (TpyBiCl5) that overcomes thermal quenching through multi&#8208;excited state switching. The structure of perovskite provides a platform to modulate the luminescence centers. The rigid framework constructed by this perovskite structure stabilized its triplet states, resulting in TpyBiCl5 exhibiting an approximately 12&#8197;times higher (45&#8201;% vs. 3.8&#8201;%) photoluminescence quantum yield of room temperature phosphorescence than that of its organic ligand (Tpy). Most importantly, the interactions between the components of this perovskite enable the mixing of different excited states, which has been revealed by experimental and theoretical investigations. The TpyBiCl5 scintillator exhibits a detection limit of 38.92&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 213&#8197;K and a detection limit of 196.31&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 353&#8197;K through scintillation mode switching between thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence. This work opens up the possibility of solving the thermal quenching in X&#8208;ray scintillators by tuning different excited states.

         <title>Mechanically Adaptive Polymers Constructed from Dynamic Coordination Equilibria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel strategy with reversible coordination equilibria for fabricating rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;responsive mechanically adaptive materials. Based on dynamic coordination interactions, the developed polymers demonstrate excellent energy dissipation, damping, self&#8208;healing and 3D printing properties, providing potential applications in durable and customizable impact protection fields.







Abstract
Designing materials capable of adapting their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli is the key to preventing failure and extending their service life. However, existing mechanically adaptive polymers are hindered by limitations such as inadequate load&#8208;bearing capacity, difficulty in achieving reversible changes, high cost, and a lack of multiple responsiveness. Herein, we address these challenges using dynamic coordination bonds. A new type of mechanically adaptive material with both rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;responsiveness was developed. Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the coordination equilibria, the prepared polymers, PBMBD&#8208;Fe and PBMBD&#8208;Co, exhibit mechanically adaptive properties, including temperature&#8208;sensitive strength modulation and rate&#8208;dependent impact hardening. Benefitting from the dynamic nature of the coordination bonds, the polymers exhibited impressive energy dissipation, damping capacity (loss factors of 1.15 and 2.09 at 1.0&#8197;Hz), self&#8208;healing, and 3D printing abilities, offering durable and customizable impact resistance and protective performance. The development of impact&#8208;resistant materials with comprehensive properties has potential applications in the sustainable and intelligent protection fields.

         <title>Organic Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shift for the Visualization of Rapid Protein and Nucleic Acid Assays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By assembling organic modules like building blocks, we explored design strategies for large Stokes shift fluorophores. A series of wavelength&#8208;tunable fluorophores have been synthesized, which exhibit large Stokes shift and satisfactory brightness. Furthermore, these dyes were applied in lateral flow assay (LFA). Consequently, direct visualization of protein assays with 100&#8208;fold sensitivity improvement over colloidal gold based LFA was achieved.







Abstract
Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores, characterized by flexible chemical structure and adjustable optical performance, have shown tremendous potential in biosensing. However, classical organic fluorophore motifs feature large overlap between excitation and emission spectra, leading to the requirement of advanced optical set up to filter desired signal, which limits their application in scenarios with simple settings. Here, a series of wavelength&#8208;tunable small&#8208;molecule fluorescent dyes (PTs) bearing simple organic moieties have been developed, which exhibit Stokes shift up to 262&#8197;nm, molar extinction coefficients ranged 30,000&#8211;100,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, with quantum yields up to 54.8&#8201;%. Furthermore, these dyes were formulated into fluorescent nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs), and applied in lateral flow assay (LFA). Consequently, limit of detection for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein reached 20&#8197;fM with naked eye, a 100&#8208;fold improvement in sensitivity compared to the pM detection level for colloidal gold&#8208;based LFA. Besides, combined with loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the LFA system achieved the visualization of single copy level nucleic acid detection for monkeypox (Mpox).

However, classical organic fluorophore motifs feature large overlap between excitation and emission spectra, leading to the requirement of advanced optical set up to filter desired signal, which limits their application in scenarios with simple settings. Here, a series of wavelength-tunable small-molecule fluorescent dyes (&lt;b&gt;PTs&lt;/b&gt;) bearing simple organic moieties have been developed, which exhibit Stokes shift up to 262&#8197;nm, molar extinction coefficients ranged 30,000&#8211;100,000&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with quantum yields up to 54.8&#8201;%. Furthermore, these dyes were formulated into fluorescent nanoparticles (&lt;b&gt;PT-NPs&lt;/b&gt;), and applied in lateral flow assay (LFA). Consequently, limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein reached 20&#8197;fM with naked eye, a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to the pM detection level for colloidal gold-based LFA. Besides, combined with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the LFA system achieved the visualization of single copy level nucleic acid detection for monkeypox (Mpox).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymer Dots with Delayed Fluorescence and Tunable Cellular Uptake for Photodynamic Therapy and Time&#8208;Gated Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic block copolymers capable of self&#8208;assembling into polymer dots (Pdots) with both delayed emission and singlet oxygen generation were prepared. The hydrophobic core shields an emitter with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) to allow for time&#8208;gated spectroscopy. Simultaneously, the hydrophilic corona exposes a photosensitizer to allow for photodynamic therapy (PDT) through a theranostic approach. In vitro studies with HeLa cells show that the nature of the hydrophilic corona can alter uptake while maintaining PDT efficiency.







Abstract
By combining bioimaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT), it is possible to treat cancer through a theranostic approach with targeted action for minimum invasiveness and side effects. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) probes have gained recent interest in theranostics due to their ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) while providing delayed emission that can be used in time&#8208;gated imaging. However, it is still challenging to design systems that simultaneously show (1) high contrast for imaging, (2) low dark toxicity but high phototoxicity and (3) tunable biological uptake. Here, we circumvent shortcomings of TADF systems by designing block copolymers and their corresponding semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) that encapsulate a TADF dye in the core and expose an additional boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) oxygen sensitizer in the corona. This architecture provides orange&#8208;red luminescent particles (&#934;PL up to 18&#8201;%) that can efficiently promote PDT (1O2 QY=42&#8201;%) of HeLa cells with very low photosensitizer loading (IC50 ~0.05&#8211;0.13&#8197;&#956;g/mL after 30&#8197;min). Additionally, we design Pdots with tunable cellular uptake but similar PDT efficiencies using either polyethylene glycol or guanidinium&#8208;based coronas. Finally, we demonstrate that these Pdots can be used for time&#8208;gated imaging to effectively filter out background fluorescence from biological samples and improve image contrast.

         <title>Conformer&#8208;Selective Photoelectron Circular Dichroism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformer selective Photoelectron Circular Dichroism of chiral 1&#8208;indanol is obtained via a resonance&#8208;enhanced two&#8208;photon ionization Scheme, thanks to the selectivity due to the S1&#8592;S0 transition. The equatorial and axial conformers of 1&#8208;indanol display PECD that dramatically differ in both amplitude and sign.







Abstract
Conformational flexibility and chirality both play a key role in molecular recognition. It is therefore very useful to develop spectroscopic methods that simultaneously probe both properties. It has been theoretically predicted that photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) should be very sensitive to conformational isomerism. However, experimental proof has been less forthcoming and only exists for a very few favorable cases. Here, we present a new PECD scheme based on resonance&#8208;enhanced two&#8208;photon ionization (RE2PI) using UV/Vis nanosecond laser excitations. The spectral resolution obtained thereby guarantees conformer&#8208;selectivity by inducing resonant conformer&#8208;specific &#960;&#960;* S1&#8592;S0 transitions. We apply this experimental scheme to the study of chiral 1&#8208;indanol, which exists in two conformers linked by a ring inversion and defined by the position of the hydroxyl group, namely axial and equatorial. We show that the PECD of the equatorial and axial forms considerably differ in sign, magnitude and shape. We also discuss the influence of the total ionization energy, vibronic excitation of intermediate and final states, and relative polarization of the excitation and ionization lasers. Conformer&#8208;specificity adds a new dimension to the applications of PECD in analytical chemistry addressing now the general case of floppy systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Memristors are essential components of neuromorphic systems that mimic the synaptic plasticity observed in biological neurons. In this study, a novel approach employing one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (1D COF) films was explored to enhance the performance of memristors. The unique structural and electronic properties of two 1D COF films (COF&#8208;4,4'&#8208;methylenedianiline (MDA) and COF&#8208;4,4'&#8208;oxydianiline (ODA)) offer advantages for multilevel resistive switching, which is a key feature in neuromorphic computing applications. By further introducing a TiO2&#160;layer on the COF&#8208;ODA film, a built&#8208;in electric field between the COF&#8208;TiO2&#160;interfaces could be generated, demonstrating&#160;the feasibility of utilizing COFs as a platform for constructing memristors with tunable resistive states. The 1D nanochannels of these COF structures contributed to the efficient modulation of electrical conductance, enabling precise control over synaptic weights in neuromorphic circuits. This study also investigated the potential of these COF&#8208;based memristors to achieve energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;density memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Euphorbia Diterpenoid Pepluacetal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of the Euphorbia diterpenoid pepluacetal is disclosed in both racemic and chiral fashions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first total synthesis of the Euphorbia diterpenoid pepluacetal is disclosed in both racemic and chiral fashions. The synthesis strategically relies on a photo-induced Wolff rearrangement/lactonization cascade (WRLC) reaction to access the cyclobutane moiety, a ring-closing metathesis/cyclopropanation sequence to rapidly forge the 7&#8211;3 bicyclic system, and a late-stage Rh-catalyzed transannular carbenoid insertion to C(sp3)&#8211;H bond followed by a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation and ring-opening manipulations to install the side chain. The synthetic route demonstrates excellent stereochemical control on the non-classical concave-face bond formation and high scalability to provide 20 mg of (+)-pepluacetal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cascade Reaction in Organic Hole Transport Layer Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The doped organic hole transport layer (HTL) is crucial for achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the traditional doping strategy undergoes a time&#8208;consuming and environment&#8208;dependent oxidation process, which hinders the technology upgrades and commercialization of PSCs. Here, we reported a new strategy by introducing a cascade reaction in traditional doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, which can simultaneously achieve rapid oxidation and overcome the erosion of perovskite by 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine (tBP) in organic HTL. The ideal dopant iodobenzene diacetate was utilized as the initiator that can react with Spiro to generate Spiro&#8226;+ radicals quickly and efficiently without the participation of ambient air, with the byproduct of iodobenzene (DB). Then, the DB can coordinate with tBP through a halogen bond to form a tBP&#8208;DB complex, minimizing the sustained erosion from tBP to perovskite. Based on the above cascade reaction, the resulting Spiro&#8208;based PSCs have a champion PCE of 25.76% (certificated of 25.38%). This new oxidation process of HTL is less environment&#8208;dependent and produces PSCs with higher reproducibility. Moreover, the PTAA&#8208;based PSCs obtain a PCE of 23.76%, demonstrating the excellent applicability of this doping strategy on organic HTL.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Therapeutic Effects of Ferroptosis on Myocardial Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury Using Dual&#8208;Locking Mitochondrial Targeting Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research of ferroptosis in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) using mitochondrial viscosity as a nexus holds great promise for MIRI therapeutics. However, high precision visualizing mitochondrial viscosity remains a formidable task owing to the debilitating electrostatic interaction caused by damaged mitochondrial membrane potential. Herein, we proposed a dual&#8208;locking mitochondrial targeting strategy that incorporates the idea of electrostatic forces and probe&#8208;protein molecular docking. Even in the damaged mitochondria, stable and precise visualization of mitochondrial viscosity in triggered and medicated MIRI was achieved owing to the sustained driving forces (pi&#8208;cation, pi&#8208;alkyl interactions etc.) between the developed probe CBS and mitochondrial membrane protein. Moreover, complemented by the western blot technology, we confirmed that ferrostatin&#8208;1 exerts its therapeutic effect on MIRI by improving the system xc&#8722;/GSH/GPX4 antioxidant system, confirming the therapeutic value of ferroptosis in MIRI. This work presents a new strategy for developing robust mitochondrial probes, thereby advancing the treatments for MIRI.</dc:description>

         <title>Validating &#916;&#916;G Selectivity Descriptor for Electrosynthesis of H2O2&#160;from Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding selectivity trends is a crucial hurdle in the developing innovative catalysts for generating hydrogen peroxide through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR). The identification of selectivity patterns has been made more accessible through the introduction of a newly developed selectivity descriptor derived from thermodynamics, denoted as &#916;&#916;G introduced in Chem Catal.2023, 3 (3), 100568. To validate the suitability of this parameter as a descriptor for 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity, we utilize an extensive library of 155 binary alloys. We validate that &#916;&#916;G reliably depicts the selectivity trends in binary alloys reported for their high activity in the 2e&#8208;ORR. This analysis also enables the identification of nine selective 2e&#8208;ORR catalysts underscoring the efficacy of &#916;&#916;G as 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity descriptor. This work highlights the significance of concurrently considering both selectivity and activity trends. This holistic approach is crucial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding in the identification of high&#8208;performance catalyst materials for optimal efficiency in various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer: A&#160;Simple Strategy for an Efficient Visible Light&#8208;Induced Photoclick Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoclick reactions combine the advantages offered by light&#8208;driven processes and classical click chemistry and have found applications ranging from surface functionalization, polymer conjugation, photo&#8208;crosslinking, and protein labeling. Despite these advances, the dependency of most of the photoclick reactions on UV light poses a severe obstacle for their general implementation, as this light can be absorbed by other molecules in the system resulting in their degradation or unwanted reactivity. However, the development of a simple and efficient system to achieve bathochromically shifted photoclick transformations remains challenging. Here, we introduce triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer as a fast and selective way to enable visible light&#8208;induced photoclick reactions. Specifically, we show that 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) can efficiently react with electron&#8208;rich alkenes (ERAs) in the presence of a catalytic amount (as little as 5 mol%) of photosensitizers. The photocycloaddition reaction can be achieved under green (530 nm) or orange (590 nm) light irradiation, representing a bathochromic shift of over 100 nm as compared to the classical PQ&#8208;ERAs system. Furthermore, by combining appropriate reactants, we establish an orthogonal, blue and green light&#8208;induced photoclick reaction system in which the product distribution can be precisely controlled by the choice of the color of light.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Activation of Diorganyl Bis(pyridylimino) Isoindolide Aluminum(III) Complexes and Their Organometallic Radical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the synthesis and characterization of a series of (mostly) air&#8208;stable diorganyl bis(pyridylimino) isoindolide (BPI) aluminum complexes and their chemistry upon visible&#8208;light excitation. The redox non&#8208;innocent BPI pincer ligand allows for efficient charge transfer homolytic processes of the title compounds. This makes them a universal platform for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals. The photo&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage of the Al&#8211;C bonds was investigated by means of stationary and transient UV/Vis spectroscopy, spin trapping experiments, as well as EPR and NMR spectroscopy. The experimental findings were supported by quantum chemical calculations. Reactivity studies enabled the utilization of the aluminum complexes as reactants in tin&#8208;free Giese&#8208;type reactions and carbonyl alkylations under ambient conditions, which both indicated radical&#8208;polar crossover behavior. A deeper understanding of the physical fundamentals and photochemical process was provided, furnishing in turn a new strategy to control the reactivity of bench&#8208;stable aluminum organometallics.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Observation of Solvent&#8208;Mediated Cyclic Intermediates during the Alkene Epoxidation/Hydration over a Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvent effects in catalytic reactions have received widespread attention as they can promote reaction rates and product selectivities by orders of magnitude. It is well accepted that the stable five&#8208;membered cyclic intermediates formed between the solvent molecules and Ti species are crucial to the alkene epoxidation in a heterogeneous Ti(IV)&#8208;H2O2 system. However, the direct spectroscopic evidence of these intermediates is still missing and the corresponding reaction pathway for the alkene epoxidation remains unclear. By combining in situ 13C MAS NMR, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 1H&#8208;13C heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, the five&#8208;membered ring structures, where the protic solvents (ROH), and aprotic solvent (acetone), coordinate and stabilize the active Ti species, are identified for the first time over Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 system. Moreover, the role of these cyclic intermediates in the alkene epoxidation/hydration conversion is clarified. These results provide new insights into the solvent effect in liquid&#8208;phase epoxidation/hydration reactions over Ti(IV)&#8208;H2O2 system.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Dual&#8208;Functionalized PolyHIPE Resin for Photobiocatalytic Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of a dual resin for photobiocatalysis, encompassing both a photocatalyst and an immobilized enzyme, brings several challenges including effective immobilization, maintaining photocatalyst and enzyme activity and ensuring sufficient light penetration. However, the benefits such as integrated processes, reusability, easier product separation, and potential for scalability can outweigh these challenges, making dual resin systems promising for efficient and sustainable photobiocatalytic applications. In this work we employ a photosensitizer&#8208;containing porous emulsion&#8208;templated polymer as a functional support that is used to covalently anchor a chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO). We demonstrate the versatility of this heterogeneous photobiocatalytic material which enables the bromination of four aromatic substrates, including Rutin &#8211; a natural occurring flavonol &#8211; under blue light (456 nm) irradiation and continuous flow conditions.</dc:description>

A selenium&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended acceptor&#8208;dimeric unit, namely BBSeE, is designed and synthesized for constructing ambipolar polymer pN&#8208;BBSeE, featuring narrower band gap, high planarity, and low&#8208;lying LUMO. pN&#8208;BBSeE demonstrates ideally balanced ambipolar TFT performances with hole and electron mobility values up to 10.65 and 10.72&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, which is among the best ambipolar polymers reported so far.







Abstract
The lack of ambipolar polymers with balanced hole (&#956;h) and electron mobilities (&#956;e) &gt;10&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 is the main bottleneck for developing organic integrated circuits. Herein, we show the design and synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;extended selenium&#8208;containing acceptor&#8208;dimeric unit, namely benzo[c][1,2,5]selenadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethane (BBSeE), to address this dilemma. In comparison to its sulfur&#8208;counterpart, BBSeE demonstrates enlarged co&#8208;planarity, selective noncovalent interactions, polarized Se&#8722;N bond, and higher electron affinity. The successful stannylation of BBSeE offers a great opportunity to access acceptor&#8208;acceptor copolymer pN&#8208;BBSeE, which shows a narrower band gap, lower&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (&#8722;4.05&#8197;eV), and a higher degree of backbone planarity. Consequently, the pN&#8208;BBSeE&#8208;based organic transistors display an ideally balanced ambipolar transporting property with &#956;h and &#956;e of 10.65 and 10.72&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the simultaneous &#956;h/&#956;e values &gt;10.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 are the best performances ever reported for ambipolar polymers. In addition, pN&#8208;BBSeE shows an excellent shelf&#8208;storage stability, retaining over 85&#8201;% of the initial mobility values after two months storage. Our study demonstrates the &#960;&#8208;extended acceptor&#8208;dimeric BBSeE is a promising acceptor building block for constructing high&#8208;performance ambipolar polymers applied in next&#8208;generation organic integrated circuit.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Free Preparation for Efficient and Photostable Pure&#8208;Iodide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free (ASF) technique is devised to fabricate photostable pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Compared with wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs made from anti&#8208;solvent process, the ASF method significantly improves the device performance and reproducibility. Furthermore, methylammonium chloride is applied to enhance the crystallinity. Consequently, the ASF&#8208;based PSCs deliver a highest PCE of 21.30&#8201;% with excellent photostability.







Abstract
The perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell (TSC) has attracted tremendous attention due to its potential to breakthrough the theoretical efficiency set for single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the perovskite solar cell (PSC) designed as its top component cell suffers from severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation owing to its mixed&#8208;halide strategy for achieving desirable wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68&#8197;eV). Developing pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites is a promising route to fabricate photostable perovskite/silicon TSCs. Here, we report efficient and photostable pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs made from an anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free (ASF) technique. The ASF process is achieved by mixing two precursor solutions, both of which are capable of depositing corresponding perovskite films without involving anti&#8208;solvent. The mixed solution finally forms Cs0.3DMA0.2MA0.5PbI3 perovskite film with a bandgap of 1.68&#8197;eV. Furthermore, methylammonium chloride additive is applied to enhance the crystallinity and reduce the trap density of perovskite films. As a result, the pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap PSC delivers efficiency as high as 21.30&#8201;% with excellent photostability, the highest for this type of solar cells. The ASF method significantly improves the device reproducibility as compared with devices made from other anti&#8208;solvent methods. Our findings provide a novel recipe to prepare efficient and photostable wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs.

         <title>Asymmetric, Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation via Sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The merger of hydrogen atom transfer and Sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles rearrangement enables the asymmetric arylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in remote position to the double bond under photoredox conditions. Various chiral &#945;&#8208;arylated amides are obtained with up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er where the sulfinamido groups dictates the stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
An efficient asymmetric remote arylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under photoredox conditions is described here. The reaction features the addition radicals to a double bond followed by a site&#8208;selective radical translocation (1,n&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer) as well as a stereocontrolled aryl migration via sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles rearrangement furnishing a wide range of chiral &#945;&#8208;arylated amides with up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er. Mechanistic studies indicate that the sulfinamide group governs the stereochemistry of the product with the aryl migration being the rate determining step preceded by a kinetically favored 1,n&#8208;HAT process.

         <title>Tapcin, an In Vivo Active Dual Topoisomerase I/II Inhibitor Discovered by Synthetic Bioinformatic Natural Product (Syn&#8208;BNP)&#8208;Coupled Metagenomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coupling sequence&#8208;tag&#8208;based metagenome mining, bioinformatic structure prediction algorithms, and total chemical synthesis we discovered the synthetic bioinformatic natural product tapcin. Tapcin is a mixed p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid&#8208;thiazole with a rare tri&#8208;thiazole substructure. It has topoisomerase&#8197;I and II activity and exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
DNA topoisomerases are attractive targets for anticancer agents. Dual topoisomerase&#8197;I/II inhibitors are particularly appealing due to their reduced rates of resistance. A number of therapeutically relevant topoisomerase inhibitors are bacterial natural products. Mining the untapped chemical diversity encoded by soil microbiomes presents an opportunity to identify additional natural topoisomerase inhibitors.

&lt;p&gt;By coupling sequence-tag-based metagenome mining, bioinformatic structure prediction algorithms, and total chemical synthesis we discovered the synthetic bioinformatic natural product tapcin. Tapcin is a mixed p-aminobenzoic acid-thiazole with a rare tri-thiazole substructure. It has topoisomerase&#8197;I and II activity and exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative activity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA topoisomerases are attractive targets for anticancer agents. Dual topoisomerase&#8197;I/II inhibitors are particularly appealing due to their reduced rates of resistance. A number of therapeutically relevant topoisomerase inhibitors are bacterial natural products. Mining the untapped chemical diversity encoded by soil microbiomes presents an opportunity to identify additional natural topoisomerase inhibitors. Here we couple metagenome mining, bioinformatic structure prediction algorithms, and chemical synthesis to produce the dual topoisomerase inhibitor tapcin. Tapcin is a mixed &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-thiazole with a rare tri-thiazole substructure and picomolar antiproliferative activity. Tapcin reduced colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29&#8197;cell proliferation and tumor volume in mouse hollow fiber and xenograft models, respectively. In both studies it showed similar activity to the clinically used topoisomerase&#8197;I inhibitor irinotecan.

         <title>Visualizing and Regulating Dynamic Evolution of Interfacial Electrolyte Configuration during De&#8208;solvation Process on Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ FTIR and in situ MRI are employed to reveal the interfacial electrolyte configuration dynamic variation on Li&#8208;metal anode. During Li plating (de&#8208;solvation process), an anion&#8208;lean solvent&#8208;rich interface is revealed, which determines the SEI architecture.







Abstract
Acting as a passive protective layer, solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the Li&#8208;metal anode. Derived from the reductive decomposition of electrolytes (e.g., anion and solvent), the SEI construction presents as an interfacial process accompanied by the dynamic de&#8208;solvation process during Li&#8208;metal plating. However, typical electrolyte engineering and related SEI modification strategies always ignore the dynamic evolution of electrolyte configuration at the Li/electrolyte interface, which essentially determines the SEI architecture. Herein, by employing advanced electrochemical in situ FT&#8208;IR and MRI technologies, we directly visualize the dynamic variations of solvation environments involving Li+&#8208;solvent/anion. Remarkably, a weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interaction and anion&#8208;lean interfacial electrolyte configuration have been synchronously revealed, which is difficult for the fabrication of anion&#8208;derived SEI layer. Moreover, as a simple electrochemical regulation strategy, pulse protocol was introduced to effectively restore the interfacial anion concentration, resulting in an enhanced LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer and improved Li&#8208;metal plating/stripping reversibility.

         <title>Regulating Charge Transport Dynamics at the Buried Interface and Bulk of Perovskites by Tailored&#8208;phase Two&#8208;dimensional Crystal Seed Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored&#8208;phase two&#8208;dimensional crystal seed layer has been developed to optimize the charge transport dynamics at the buried interface and crystallization kinetics of perovskite films. The corresponding solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 24.58&#8201;%. The devices exhibit an improved photostability with 88.4&#8201;% of initial efficiency being retained after aging under continuous 0.8&#8208;sun illumination for 2000&#8197;h in air.







Abstract
Targeting the trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and photochemical degradation occurring at the interface and bulk of perovskite, especially the overlooked buried bottom interface, a strategy of tailored&#8208;phase two&#8208;dimensional (TP&#8208;2D) crystal seed layer has been developed to improve the charge transport dynamics at the buried interface and bulk of perovskite films. Using this approach, TP&#8208;2D layer constructed by TP&#8208;2D crystal seeds at the buried interface can induce the formation of homogeneous interface electric field, which effectively suppress the accumulation of charge carriers at the buried interface. Additionally, the presence of TP&#8208;2D crystal seed has a positive effect on the crystallization process of the upper perovskite film, leading to optimized crystal quality and thus promoted charge transport inside bulk perovskites. Ultimately, the best performing PSCs based on TP&#8208;2D layer deliver a power conversion efficiency of 24.58&#8201;%. The devices exhibit an improved photostability with 88.4&#8201;% of their initial PCEs being retained after aging under continuous 0.8&#8208;sun illumination for 2000&#8197;h in air. Our findings reveal how to regulate the charge transport dynamics of perovskite bulk and interface by introducing homogeneous components.

         <title>A P2/P3 Biphasic Layered Oxide Composite as a High&#8208;Energy and Long&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Cathode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A biphasic P2/P3&#8208;K0.7Mn0.67Ni0.33O2 composite is proposed for potassium&#8208;ion batteries with large energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability and characterized by XRD refinement, HAADF and ABF&#8208;STEM, and Fourier transformation. This P2/P3 intergrown layered composite can manifest a high energy density of 321&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and also exhibit excellent capacity preservation during 600&#8197;cycles of K+ uptake/release.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides are extensively considered as appealing cathode candidates for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their abundant raw materials and low cost, but their further implementations are limited by slow dynamics and impoverished structural stability. Herein, a layered composite having a P2 and P3 symbiotic structure is designed and synthesized to realize PIBs with large energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability. The unique intergrowth of P2 and P3 phases in the obtained layered oxide is plainly characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction refinement, high&#8208;angle annular dark field and annular bright field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy at atomic resolution, and Fourier transformation images. The synergistic effect of the two phases of this layered P2/P3 composite is well demonstrated in K+ intercalation/extraction process. The as&#8208;prepared layered composite can present a large discharge capacity with the remarkable energy density of 321&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and also manifest excellent capacity preservation after 600&#8197;cycles of K+ uptake/removal.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel selective ring&#8208;opening amination of isochromans and tetrahydroisoquinolines have been developed by employing molecular editing strategy. This chemistry offers a practical method to access various valuable compounds from easily available starting materials.







Abstract
The molecular structure&#8208;editing through selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage allows for the precise modification of molecular structures and opens up new possibilities in chemical synthesis. By strategically cleaving C&#8722;C bonds and editing the molecular structure, more efficient and versatile pathways for the synthesis of complex compounds could be designed, which brings significant implications for drug development and materials science. o&#8208;Aminophenethyl alcohols and amines are the essential key motifs in bioactive and functional material molecules. The traditional synthesis of these compounds usually requires multiple steps which could generate inseparable isomers and induce low efficiencies. By leveraging a molecular editing strategy, we herein reported a selective ring&#8208;opening amination of isochromans and tetrahydroisoquinolines for the efficient synthesis of o&#8208;aminophenethyl alcohols and amines. This innovative chemistry allows for the precise cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds under mild transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Notably, further synthetic application demonstrated that our method could provide an efficient approach to essential components of diverse bioactive molecules.

A feasible dipolar chemical bridge is constructed between the perovskite and TiO2 layers to lower the photovoltage deficits of perovskite solar cells. The functional molecules could firmly anchor to the TiO2 surface and chemically bond with the [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedral frameworks of perovskites to ameliorate the interfacial disorder and facilitate charge transport, leading to the perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of 21.86&#8201;% being realized.







Abstract
CsPbI3 perovskite receives tremendous attention for photovoltaic applications due to its ideal band gap and good thermal stability. However, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) significantly suffer from photovoltage deficits because of serious interfacial energy losses within the PSCs, which to a large extent affects the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Herein, a dipolar chemical bridge (DCB) is constructed between the perovskite and TiO2 layers to lower interfacial energy losses and thus improve the charge extraction of PSCs. The results reveal that the DCB could form a beneficial interfacial dipole between the perovskite and TiO2 layers, which could optimize the interfacial energetics of perovskite/TiO2 layers and thus improve the energy level alignment within the PSCs. Meanwhile, the constructed DCB could also simultaneously passivate the surface defects of perovskite and TiO2 layers, greatly lowering interfacial recombination. Consequently, the photovoltage deficit of CsPbI3 PSCs is largely reduced, leading to a record efficiency of 21.86&#8201;% being realized. Meanwhile, the operation stability of PSCs is also largely improved due to the high&#8208;quality perovskite films with released interfacial tensile strain being obtained after forming the DCB within the PSCs.

         <title>Rationally Designed Cyclooctatetrathiophene&#8208;Based Porous Aromatic Frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) that considers the directions of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, the charge transfer position and the O2 adsorption sites provides feasible access for the construction of efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway.







Abstract
Constructing stable and efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production is of great importance and is challenging. In this study, the synthesis of three photoactive cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) in an alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) fashion is presented. In combination with a triazine&#8208;derived electron acceptor, PAF&#8208;363 exhibits high efficiency for the photosynthesis of H2O2 with production rates of 11733&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1(with sacrificial agent) and 3930&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (without sacrificial agent) from water and oxygen under visible light irradiation. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer positions and the O2 adsorption sites in PAF&#8208;363 are both concentrated on COTh fragments, which facilitate the H2O2 production through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. This work highlights that the rational design of COTh&#8208;PAFs with consideration of D&#8722;A direction, charge transfer positions, and O2 adsorption sites provides a feasible access to efficient H2O2 production photocatalysts.

         <title>Unlocking Double Redox Reaction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy of organic/inorganic double electroactive sites is proposed to obtain extra capacity and enhance the energy density in a manganese&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74). Simultaneously, a co&#8208;insertion/extraction of Zn2+ and H+ is demonstrated accompanying with manganese and oxygen double redox reactions in Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 cathode. As a result, the Zn/Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 batteries exhibit a high energy density and superior cycling stability in the electrolyte of 2&#8197;M ZnSO4.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) show wide application as the cathode of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) in the future owning to their high porosity, diverse structures, abundant species, and controllable morphology. However, the low energy density and poor cycling stability hinder the feasibility in practical application. Herein, an innovative strategy of organic/inorganic double electroactive sites is proposed and demonstrated to obtain extra capacity and enhance the energy density in a manganese&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74). Simultaneously, its energy storage mechanism is systematically investigated. Moreover, profiting from the coordination effect, the Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 features with stable structure in ZnSO4 electrolyte. Therefore, the Zn/Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 batteries exhibit a high energy density and superior cycling stability. This work aids in the future development of MOFs in AZIBs.

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Labile Polyoxometalates for Catalysis in Confined Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of labile polyoxometalates (POMs) in aqueous solutions has been achieved within the confined cavity of a robust and water&#8208;soluble coordination cage. This encapsulation significantly enhances the stability of these POMs in water, rendering them into green catalysts with high reactivity and selectivity. This cavity&#8208;directed approach represents the first example of utilizing the coordination cage for synthesizing metallic clusters.







Abstract
The artificial microenvironments inside coordination cages have gained significant attention for performing enzyme&#8208;like catalytic reactions by facilitating the formation of labile and complex molecules through a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; approach. Despite many fascinating examples, this approach remains scarcely explored in the context of synthesizing metallic clusters such as polyoxometalates (POMs). The development of innovative approaches to control and influence the speciation of POMs in aqueous solutions would greatly advance their applicability and could ultimately lead to the formation of elusive clusters that cannot be synthesized by using traditional methods. In this study, we employ host&#8211;guest stabilization within a coordination cage to enable a novel cavity&#8208;directed synthesis of labile POMs in aqueous solutions under mild conditions. The elusive Lindqvist [M6O19]2&#8722; (M=Mo or W) POMs were successfully synthesized at room temperature via the condensation of molybdate or tungstate building blocks within the confined cavity of a robust and water&#8208;soluble Pt6L4(NO3)12 coordination cage. Importantly, the encapsulation of these POMs enhances their stability in water, rendering them efficient catalysts for environmentally friendly and selective sulfoxidation reactions using H2O2 as a green oxidant in a pure aqueous medium. The approach developed in this paper offers a means to synthesize and stabilize the otherwise unstable metal&#8208;oxo clusters in water, which can broaden the scope of their applications.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Organogold(III) Complexes Enable High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organogold(III) complexes, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;1 and Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2, based on a through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer motif have been developed to simultaneously exhibit high X&#8208;ray attenuation efficiency and efficient harvesting of triplet excitons for emission. The resulting scintillator screen based on Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2 achieves an optimal combination of ultrahigh light yield of 77,600 photons MeV&#8722;1, favorable X&#8208;ray stability, and excellent X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of exceeding 16.0&#8197;line&#8201;pairs&#8201;mm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Organic scintillators have recently attracted growing attention for X&#8208;ray detection in industrial and medical applications. However, these materials still face critical obstacles of low attenuation efficiency and/or inefficient triplet exciton utilization. Here we developed a new category of organogold(III) complexes, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;1 and Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2, through adopting a through&#8208;space interaction motif to realize high X&#8208;ray attenuation efficiency and efficient harvesting of triplet excitons for emission. Thanks to the efficient through&#8208;space charge transfer process, this panel of complexes achieved higher photoluminescence quantum yield and shorter radiative lifetimes compared with the through&#8208;bond reference complexes. Inspiringly, these organogold(III) complexes exhibited polarity&#8208;dependent emission origins: thermally activated delayed fluorescence and/or phosphorescence. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2 manifested intense radioluminescence together with a record&#8208;high scintillation light yield of 77,600&#8197;photons&#8201;MeV&#8722;1 for organic scintillators. The resulting scintillator screens demonstrated high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging with &gt;16.0&#8197;line&#8201;pairs&#8201;mm&#8722;1 spatial resolution, outstripping most organic and inorganic scintillators. This finding provides a feasible strategy for the design of superior organic X&#8208;ray scintillators.

The resulting scintillator screen based on Tp-Au-2 achieves an optimal combination of ultrahigh light yield of 77,600 photons MeV&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, favorable X-ray stability, and excellent X-ray imaging resolution of exceeding 16.0&#8197;line&#8201;pairs&#8201;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic scintillators have recently attracted growing attention for X-ray detection in industrial and medical applications. However, these materials still face critical obstacles of low attenuation efficiency and/or inefficient triplet exciton utilization. Here we developed a new category of organogold(III) complexes, &lt;b&gt;Tp-Au-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Tp-Au-2&lt;/b&gt;, through adopting a through-space interaction motif to realize high X-ray attenuation efficiency and efficient harvesting of triplet excitons for emission. Thanks to the efficient through-space charge transfer process, this panel of complexes achieved higher photoluminescence quantum yield and shorter radiative lifetimes compared with the through-bond reference complexes. Inspiringly, these organogold(III) complexes exhibited polarity-dependent emission origins: thermally activated delayed fluorescence and/or phosphorescence. Under X-ray irradiation, &lt;b&gt;Tp-Au-2&lt;/b&gt; manifested intense radioluminescence together with a record-high scintillation light yield of 77,600&#8197;photons&#8201;MeV&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for organic scintillators. The resulting scintillator screens demonstrated high-quality X-ray imaging with &amp;gt;16.0&#8197;line&#8201;pairs&#8201;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; spatial resolution, outstripping most organic and inorganic scintillators. This finding provides a feasible strategy for the design of superior organic X-ray scintillators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimodal Oxidation Electrochemiluminescence Mechanism of Coreactant&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks via Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coreactant&#8208;embedded nanoemitter (C&#8211;COF) is obtained by covalently linking a covalent organic framework (COF) with a coreactant via a postsynthetic modification strategy, resulting in a 1008&#8208;fold increase in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensity compared to the COF with an equivalent external coreactant. Notably, a bimodal oxidation ECL mechanism emerges from the oxidation of the coreactant in the framework and COF self&#8208;oxidation.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) efficiency is determined by charge transfer between coreactants and emitters in coreactant systems, which are usually limited by their slow intermolecular charge transfer. In this study, a covalent organic framework (COF) with aldehyde residue was synthesized, and then coreactants were covalently integrated into the skeleton through the postsynthetic modification strategy, resulting in a crystalline coreactant&#8208;embedded COF nanoemitter (C&#8211;COF). Compared to the pristine COF with an equivalent external coreactant, C&#8211;COF exhibited an extraordinary 1008&#8208;fold enhancement of ECL intensity due to the rapid intrareticular charge transfer. Significantly, with the pH increase, C&#8211;COF shows protonation&#8208;induced ECL enhancement for the first ECL peaked at +1.1&#8197;V and an opposite trend for the second ECL at +1.4&#8197;V, which were attributed to the antedating oxidation of coreactant in framework and COF self&#8208;oxidation, respectively. The resulting bimodal oxidation ECL mechanism was rationalized by spectral characterization and density functional theory calculations. The postsynthetic coreactant&#8208;embedded nanoemitters present innovative and universal avenues for advancing ECL systems.

         <title>Photocatalytic O&#8208; to S&#8208;Rearrangement of Tertiary Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Newman&#8208;Kwart rearrangement, the development of a photocatalyzed O&#8208; to S&#8208;rearrangement of tertiary thiocarbonyl&#8208;activated cyclopropanol derivatives to access cyclopropanethiols is disclosed. Mechanistic findings enabled a preliminary extension toward other aliphatic alcohol classes. This work is anticipated to inspire new radical approaches to other valuable C(sp3)&#8722;S derivatives from abundant aliphatic feedstocks.







Abstract
Despite the importance of heteroatom&#8208;substituted cyclopropane derivatives in drug design and organic synthesis, cyclopropanethiols remain critically underexplored. Inspired by the wide use of the Newman&#8208;Kwart rearrangement to access valuable thiophenols from phenol feedstocks, we report the development of a photocatalytic approach for efficient ambient temperature aliphatic O&#8208; to S&#8208;rearrangement on tertiary cyclopropanol derivatives. After demonstrating that a range of cyclopropanethiols&#8212;that are difficult to access by other methods&#8212;can be obtained with this strategy, we show that these rearranged products can be easily hydrolyzed and further derivatized. We conclude this study with mechanistic findings that enabled an initial extension of this approach toward other classes of aliphatic alcohols.

         <title>F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer: Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Purely Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Dynamic B&#8722;N bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a reversible capture&#8208;release strategy using dynamic B/N Lewis pairs for the construction of stimulus&#8208;responsive room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. RTP of the Lewis acid of BrBA can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base of TPAPy and reactivated by dissociation of the B&#8722;N bond to release BrBA. During this process, RTP properties can be regulated by exposure to HCl and NH3.







Abstract
Recently, stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties have attracted significant attention owing to their potential applications in chemical sensing, anticounterfeiting, and displays. However, molecular design currently lacks systematicity and effectiveness. Herein, we report a capture&#8208;release strategy for the construction of reversible RTP via B/N Lewis pairs. Specifically, the RTP of the Lewis acid of 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene (BrBA) can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base, N,N&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)aniline (TPAPy), and reactivated by dissociation of B&#8722;N bonds to release BrBA. Reversible RTP is attributed to the exceptional self&#8208;assembly capability of BrBA, whereas the tunable RTP colors are derived from distinct F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) processes. The potential applications of RTP materials in information storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting were also experimentally validated. The capture&#8208;release approach proposed in this study offers an effective strategy for designing stimulus&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Helical Nanographenes Bearing Pentagon&#8208;Heptagon Pairs by Stepwise Dehydrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled dehydrogenation of [6]helicene units provides a facile and feasible method for the synthesis of helical nanographenes containing pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs. The presence of pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs has proven to be quite effective in modulating the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the resulting nanographenes, including enhanced circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
The incorporation of pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs into helical nanographenes lacks a facile synthetic route, and the impact of these pairs on chiroptical properties remains unclear. In this study, a method for the stepwise construction of pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs in helical nanographenes by the dehydrogenation of [6]helicene units was developed. Three helical nanographenes containing pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs were synthesized and characterized using this approach. A wide variation in the molecular geometries and photophysical properties of these helical nanographenes was observed, with changes in the helical length of these structures and the introduction of the pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs. The embedded pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs reduced the oxidation potential of the synthesized helical nanographenes. The high isomerization energy barriers enabled the chiral resolution of the helicene enantiomers. Chiroptical investigations revealed remarkably enhanced circularly polarized luminescence and luminescence dissymmetry factors with an increasing number of the pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs.

         <title>Homochiral &#960;&#8208;Rich Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabled Chirality Imprinting in Conjugated Polymers: Confined Polymerization and Chiral Memory from Scratch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically active &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (OACPs) have garnered increasing research interest for their resemblance to biological helices and intriguing chirality&#8208;related functions. Traditional methods for synthesizing involve decorating achiral conjugated polymer architectures with enantiopure side substituents through complex organic synthesis. Here, we report a new approach: the templated synthesis of unsubstituted OACPs via supramolecularly confined polymerizations of achiral monomers within nanopores of 2D or 3D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs). We show that the chiral &#960;&#8208;rich nanospaces facilitate the in situ enantiospecific polymerization and self&#8208;propagation, akin to nonenzymatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, resulting in chiral imprinting. The stacked polymer chains are kinetically inert enough to memorize the chiral information after liberating from CCOFs, and even after treatment at temperature up to 200 oC. The isolated OACPs demonstrate robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85% ee in separating racemic amino acids. This underscores the potential of utilizing CCOFs as templates for supramolecularly imprinting optical activity into CPs, paving the way for synthetic evolution and advanced functional exploration of OACPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Rim&#8208;Based Binding of Perfluorinated Acids to Pillararenes Purifies Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a rapidly increasing global problem as their widespread use and high stability lead worldwide to water contamination, with significant detrimental health effects.[1] Supramolecular chemistry has been invoked to develop materials geared towards the specific capture of PFAS from water,[2] to reduce the concentration below advisory safety limits (e.g., 70 ng/L for the sum of perfluorooctyl sulfonic acid, PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA). Scale&#8208;up and use in natural waters with high PFAS concentrations has hitherto posed a problem. Here we report a new type of host&#8208;guest interaction between deca&#8208;ammonium&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arenes (DAF&#8208;P5s) and perfluoroalkyl acids. DAF&#8208;P5 complexes show an unprecedented 1:10 stoichiometry, as confirmed by isothermal calorimetry and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies, and high binding constants (up to 106 M&#8208;1) to various polyfluoroalkyl acids. In addition, non&#8208;fluorinated acids do not hamper this process significantly. Immobilization of DAF&#8208;P5s allows a simple single&#8208;time filtration of PFAS&#8208;contaminated water to reduce the PFOS/PFOA concentration 106 times to 15&#8208;50 ng/L level. The effective and fast (&lt;5 min) orthogonal binding to organic molecules without involvement of fluorinated supramolecular hosts, high breakthrough capacity (90 mg/g), and robust performance (&gt; 10 regeneration cycles without decrease in performance) set a new benchmark in PFAS&#8208;absorbing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene&#8208;Alkyne Metathesis&#8208;mediated Cascade: Synthesis of Benzoxazine Polychiral Polyheterocycles and Discovery of a Novel Pain Blocker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for synthesizing Benzoxazine&#8208;Centered Polychiral Polyheterocycles (BPCPHCs) via an innovative asymmetric carbene&#8208;alkyne metathesis&#8208;triggered cascade. Overcoming challenges associated with intricate stereochemistry and multiple chiral centers, the catalytic asymmetric Carbene Alkyne Metathesis&#8208;mediated Cascade (CAMC) is employed using dirhodium catalyst/Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalysis, ensuring precise stereo control as validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Systematic substrate scope evaluation establishes exceptional diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities, creating a unique library of BPCPHCs. Pharmacological exploration identifies twelve BPCPHCs as potent Nav ion channel blockers, notably compound 8g. In vivo studies demonstrate that intrathecal injection of 8g effectively reverses mechanical hyperalgesia associated with chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), suggesting a promising therapeutic avenue. Electrophysiological investigations unveil the inhibitory effects of 8g on Nav1.7 currents. Molecular docking, dynamics simulations and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay provide insights into the stable complex formation and favorable binding free energy of 8g with C5aR1. This research represents a significant advancement in asymmetric CAMC for BPCPHCs and unveils BPCPHC 8g as a promising, uniquely acting pain blocker, establishing a C5aR1&#8208;Nav1.7 connection in the context of CIPN.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Proximity of Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn Ensembles Encaged in UiO&#8208;67 Boosting&#160;Catalytic Conversion of Syngas to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maintaining high conversion under the premise of high oxygenates selectivity in syngas conversion is important but a formidable challenge in Rh catalysis. Monometallic Rh catalysts provide poor oxygenate conversion efficiency, and efforts have been focused on constructing adjacent polymetallic sites; however, the one&#8208;pass yields of C2+ oxygenates over the reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts were mostly &lt;20%. In this study, we constructed a monometallic Rh catalyst encapsulated in UiO&#8208;67 (Rh/UiO&#8208;67) with enhanced proximity to dual&#8208;site Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn ensembles. Unexpectedly, this catalyst exhibited high efficacy for oxygenate synthesis from syngas, giving a high oxygenate selectivity of 72.0% with a remarkable CO conversion of 50.4%, and the one&#8208;pass yield of C2+ oxygenates exceeded 25%. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterizations further revealed the spontaneous formation of an ensemble of Rh single atoms/dimers (Rh1,2) in the proximity of ultrasmall Rh clusters (Rhn) confined within the nanocavity of UiO&#8208;67, providing adjacent Rh+&#8208;Rh0 dual sites dynamically during the reaction that promote the relay of the undissociated CHO species to the CHx species. Thus, our results open a new route for designing highly efficient Rh catalysts for the conversion of syngas to oxygenates by precisely tuning the ensemble and proximity of the dual active sites in a confined space.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefin hydrogenation is one of the most important transformations in organic synthesis. Electrochemical transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an attractive approach to replace the dangerous hydrogen gas with electrons and protons. However, this reaction poses major challenges due to rapid hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal&#8208;hydride species that outcompetes alkene hydrogenation step, and facile deposition of the metal catalyst at the electrode that stalls reaction. Here we report an economical and efficient strategy to achieve high selectivity for hydrogenation reactivity over the well&#8208;established HER. Using an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable nickel salt as the catalyst, this mild reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. In addition, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides could be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection. The practicability of our method has been demonstrated by the success of large&#8208;scale synthesis using catalytic amount of electrolyte and a minimal amount of solvent. Cyclic voltammetry and kinetic studies were performed, which support a NiII/0 catalytic cycle and the pre&#8208;coordination of the substrate to the nickel center.</dc:description>

         <title>Acoustic Levitation Synthesis of Ultrahigh&#8208;density Spherical Nucleic Acid Architectures for Specific SERS Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllably regulating the electrostatic bilayer of nanogold colloids is a significant premise for synthesizing spherical nucleic acid (SNA) and building ordered plasmonic architectures. We develop a facile acoustic levitation reactor to universally synthesize SNAs with an ultra&#8208;high density of DNA strands. Results reveal a new mechanism of DNA grafting via acoustic wave that can reconfigure the ligands on colloidal surfaces. The acoustic levitation reactor enables substrate&#8208;free three&#8208;dimentional (3D) spatial assembly of SNAs with controllable interparticle nanogaps through regulating DNA lengths.  This kind of architecture may overcome the plasmonic enhancement limits by blocking electron tunneling and breaking electrostatic shielding in dried aggregations. Finite element simulations support the architecture with 3D spatial plasmonic hotspot matrix, and its ultrahigh surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) capability is evidenced by in&#8208;situ untargeted tracking of biomolecular events during photothermal stimulation (PTS)&#8208;induced cell death process. For biomarker diagnosis, the conjugation of ATP aptamer onto SNAs enables in&#8208;situ targeted tracking of ATP during PTS&#8208;induced cell death process. Particularly, the CD71 receptor and integrin &#945;3&#946;1 protein on PL45 cell could be well distinguished by label&#8208;free SERS fingerprints when using specific XQ&#8208;2d and DML&#8208;7 aptamers, respectively. Our current acoustic levitation reactor promises great potentials in biochemical synthesis and sensing in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Diluted Active Sites of Ultrasmall High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Efficient Formic Acid Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poisoning of undesired intermediates or impurities greatly hinders the catalytic performances of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, high&#8208;entropy intermetallics i&#8208;(PtPdIrRu)2FeCu (HEI) are constructed to inhibit the strongly adsorbed carbon monoxide intermediates (CO*) during the formic acid oxidation reaction. As probed by multiple&#8208;scaled structural characterizations, HEI nanoparticles are featured with partially negative Pt oxidation states, diluted Pt/Pd/Ir/Ru atomic sites and ultrasmall average size less than 2 nm. Benefiting from the optimized structures, HEI nanoparticles deliver more than 10 times promotion in intrinsic activity than that of pure Pt, and well&#8208;enhanced mass activity/durability than that of ternary i&#8208;Pt2FeCu intermetallics counterpart. In situ infrared spectroscopy manifests that both bridge and top CO* are favored on pure Pt but limited on HEI. Further theoretical elaboration indicates that HEI displayed a much weaker binding of CO* on Pt sites and sluggish diffusion of CO* among different sites, in contrast to pure Pt that CO* bound more strongly and was easy to diffuse on larger Pt atomic ensembles. This work verifies that HEIs are promising catalysts via integrating the merits of intermetallics and high&#8208;entropy alloys.</dc:description>

         <title>Postsynthetically Modified Alkoxide&#8208;Exchanged Ni2(OR)2BTDD: Synergistic Interactions of CO2 with Open Metal Sites and Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Postsynthetic modifications (PSMs) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) play a crucial role in enhancing material performance through open metal site (OMS) functionalization or ligand exchange. However, a significant challenge persists in preserving open metal sites during ligand exchange, as these sites are inherently bound by incoming ligands. In this study, for the first time, we introduced alkoxides by exchanging bridging chloride in Ni2Cl2BTDD (BTDD = bis (1H&#8208;1,2,3,&#8208;triazolo [4,5&#8208;b],&#8208;[4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;i]) dibenzo[1,4]dioxin) through PSM. Rietveld refinement of synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data indicated that the alkoxide oxygen atom bridges Ni(II) centers while the OMSs of the MOF are preserved. Due to the synergy of the existing OMS and introduced functional group, the alkoxide&#8208;exchanged MOFs showed CO2 uptakes superior to the pristine MOF. Furthermore, the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations for Ni_T suggested that CO2 interacts with the OMS and the surrounding methyl groups of tert&#8208;butoxide groups, which is responsible for the enhanced CO2 capacity. This work provides a facile and unique synthetic strategy for realizing a desirable OMS&#8208;incorporating MOF platform through bridging ligand exchange.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Ni&#8208;W Dimer Sites Induced Stable Compressive Strain for Boosting the Performance of&#160;Pt as Electrocatalyst&#160;for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying Pt catalysts with transition metal elements is an effective pathway to enhance the performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but often accompanied with severe metal dissolution issue, resulting in poor stability of alloy catalysts. Here, instead of forming traditional alloy structure, we modify Pt surface with a novel Ni&#8208;W dimer structure by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The obtained NiW@PtC catalyst exhibits superior ORR performance both in liquid half&#8208;cell and practical fuel cell compared with initial Pt/C. It is discovered that strong synergistic Ni&#8208;W dimer structure arising from short atomic distance induced a stable compressive strain on the Pt surface, thus boosting Pt catalytic performance. This surface modification by synergistic dimer sites offers an effective strategy in tailoring Pt with excellent activity and stability, which provides a significant perspective in boosting the performance of commercial Pt catalyst modified with polymetallic atom sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Engineering of MOF&#8208;Derived Bimetallic Oxide Solid Solution Anchored with Au Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas and C2 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering that CO2 reduction is mostly a multielectron reaction, it is necessary for the photocatalysts to integrate multiple catalytic sites and cooperate synergistically to achieve efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to various products, such as C2 hydrocarbons. Herein, through crystal engineering, we designed and constructed a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived Zr/Ti bimetallic oxide solid solution support, which was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. After anchoring Au nanoparticles, the composite photocatalyst exhibited excellent performances toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction to syngas (H2 and CO production rates of 271.6 and 260.6 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and even C2 hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6 production rates of 6.80 and 4.05 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1). According to the control experiments and theoretical calculations, the strong interaction between bimetallic oxide solid solution support and Au nanoparticles was found to be beneficial for binding intermediates and reducing CO2 reduction, highlighting the synergy effect of the catalytic system with multiple active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Linkage Chemistry and Its Critical Role in The Evolution of &#960; Electronic Structures and Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a molecular platform for designing a novel class of functional materials with well&#8208;defined structures. A crucial structural parameter is the linkage, which dictates how knot and linker units are connected to form two&#8208;dimensional polymers and layer frameworks, shaping ordered &#960;&#8208;array and porous architectures. However, the roles of linkage in the development of ordered &#960; electronic structures and functions remain fundamental yet unresolved issues. Here we report the designed synthesis of COFs featuring four representative linkages: hydrazone, imine, azine, and C=C bonds, to elucidate their impacts on the evolution of &#960; electronic structures and functions. Our observations revealed that the hydrazone linkage provides a non&#8208;conjugated connection, while imine and azine allow partial &#960; conjugation, and the C=C bond permits full &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Importantly, the linkage profoundly influences the control of &#960; electronic structures and functions, unraveling its pivotal role in determining key electronic properties such as bandgap, frontier energy levels, light absorption, luminescence, carrier density and mobility, and magnetic permeability. These findings highlight the significance of linkage chemistry in COFs and offer a general and transformative guidance for designing framework materials to achieve electronic functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Strategy Tailoring Molecular Structures of Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials (HTMs) are ideal materials for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but most current design strategies for tailoring the molecular structures of HTMs are limited to single strategy. Herein, four HTMs based on dithienothiophenepyrrole (DTTP) core are devised through dual&#8208;strategy methods combining conjugate engineering and side chain engineering. DTTP&#8208;ThSO with ester alkyl chain that can form six&#8208;membered ring by the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O noncovalent conformation lock with thiophene in the backbone shows good planarity, high&#8208;quality film, matching energy level and high hole mobility, as well as strong defect passivation ability. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3% with a nice long&#8208;term stability is achieved by dopant&#8208;free DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based PSCs, representing one of the highest values for un&#8208;doped organic HTMs based PSCs. Especially, the fill factor (FF) of 82.3% is the highest value for dopant&#8208;free small molecular HTMs&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs to date. Moreover, DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based devices have achieved an excellent PCE of 20.9% in large&#8208;area (1.01 cm2) devices. This work clearly elucidates the structure&#8208;performance relationships of HTMs and offers a practical dual&#8208;strategy approach to designing dopant&#8208;free HTMs for high&#8208;performance PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridged Bicyclic Lactam Enables Chemically Recyclable Nylon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nylon, a widely&#8208;used high&#8208;performance thermoplastic, boasts exceptional durability and resistance to various solvents and weak acids, making it indispensable across diverse applications. However, its nonbiodegradable nature has led to alarming environmental pollution in land and oceans. Chemical recycling to monomers (CRM) stands as a crucial strategy for establishing a circular plastic economy, but the CRM of nylon remains largely unexplored. Herein, we introduce the bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), evolved from &#948;&#8208;valerolactam and pyrrolidone, to solve the the trade&#8208;off in depolymerizability and performance. Notably, 5/6&#8208;LM exhibits nearly 95% conversion in mild polymerization conditions and efficient depolymerization catalyzed by lewis acids. This compound is synthetically accessible from commercially available chemicals in a single step at room temperature, demonstrating high efficiency and scalability up to 50g in laboratory. Furthermore, the resulting polyamide displays remarkable attributes including high crystallinity and thermostability up to 283&#176;C, significantly broadening the scope of chemically recyclable nylons.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis for Electrochemical Chlorination and Nitration of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique biphasic electrochemical reaction, wherein tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts play a dual role as both electrolyte and phase transfer catalysts, was developed to furnish chlorination and nitration of aromatic compounds using cheap inorganic salts with up to 98&#8201;% yield, shorter reaction time and higher Faradaic efficiency.







Abstract
A biphasic anodic oxidation method for aromatic halogenation process was developed, where aqueous metal salts were directly used as halogen source. Ammonium salts serve as both electrolytes and phase transfer catalysis to facilitate anion transport and oxidative transformation. This design allows for chlorination or nitration of multiple types of arenes using NaCl or KNO2.

         <title>Breaking Global Diatropic Current to Tame Diradicaloid Character: Thiele's Hydrocarbon Under Macrocyclic Constraints</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two p&#8208;phenylene units with dissimilar resonance character (benzene and quinone) are embedded in a macrocyclic system. Their mutual orientation, in terms of the dihedral angle between the carbocyclic units, can stabilize the diradicaloid character of the system. Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analysis confirmed a presence of open&#8208;shell singlet state with a low &#916;EST of &#8722;0.34&#8197;kcal/mol.







Abstract
A diradical/biradical character of organic derivatives is one of the key aspects of contemporary research focusing on the fundamental studies followed by potential applicability relying on the unique optical, electronic, or magnetic properties assigned to unpaired electrons. A precise involvement of two p&#8208;phenylenes into a cyclophane&#8208;like conjugated, diatropic system creates a flexible molecule with the two different characters of both subunits (benzene and quinone) imprinting into the structure a Kekul&#233; delocalized system. A dynamic of both carbocyclic subunits, and their mutual interaction generates a singlet open&#8208;shell state (J=&#8722;1.25&#8197;kcal/mol) as documented spectroscopically (NMR and EPR). The extended theoretical analysis has proved a correlation between dihedral angle and the diradicaloid character that shifts from a closed&#8208;shell singlet to an open&#8208;shell state, eventually showing the y0=0.86 for 78&#8197;degrees and &#916;EST=&#8722;0.34&#8197;kcal/mol.

         <title>Dienes as Versatile Substrates for Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dienes are valued for their abundance, ease of preparation, and unique properties, as they play a crucial role in synthesizing complex, bioactive molecules. This review focuses on the past decade's advances and challenges in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving diene substrates, emphasizing their versatility and the emergence of novel reactivity patterns.







Abstract
Dienes have been of great interest to synthetic chemists as valuable substrates due to their abundance and ease of synthesis. Their unique stereoelectronic properties enable broad reactivity with a wide range of transition metals to construct molecular complexity facilitating synthesis of biologically active compounds. In addition, structural diene variation can result in substrate&#8208;controlled reactions, providing valuable mechanistic insights into reactivity and selectivity patterns. The last decade has seen a wealth of new methodologies involving diene substrates through the power of transition metal catalysis. This review summarizes recent advances and remaining opportunities for transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving dienes.

         <title>Binding FSI&#8722; to Construct a Self&#8208;Healing SEI Film for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries by In situ Crosslinking Vinyl Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing SEI film containing bound FSI&#8722; anions as repairing agent is constructed via the cross&#8208;linking of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) to improve the performances of lithium anode. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&#8722; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self&#8208;healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO2 cells with the loading of 16.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and are stably operated for 500&#8197;cycles with the retention rates of 81.4&#8201;% and the average coulombic efficiency of 99.97&#8201;%, operated between 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li.







Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) membrane on the Li metal anode tends to breakdown and undergo reconstruction during operation, causing Li metal batteries to experience accelerated decay. Notably, an SEI membrane with self&#8208;healing characteristics can help considerably in stabilizing the Li&#8208;electrolyte interface; however, uniformly fixing the repairing agent onto the anode remains a challenging task. By leveraging the noteworthy film&#8208;forming attributes of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;) anions and the photopolymerization property of the vinyl group, the ionic liquid 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) was crosslinked with polyethylene oxide (PEO) in this study to form a self&#8208;healing film fixing FSI&#8722; groups as the repairing agent. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&#8722; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self&#8208;healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO2 cells with the loading of 16.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and are stably operated for 500&#8197;cycles with the retention rates of 81.4&#8201;% and the average coulombic efficiency of 99.97&#8201;%, operated between 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li. This study presents a new design approach for self&#8208;healing Li metal anodes and durable lithium metal battery.

&lt;p&gt;A self-healing SEI film containing bound FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions as repairing agent is constructed via the cross-linking of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and 1-vinyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI-FSI) to improve the performances of lithium anode. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp;amp; Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self-healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells with the loading of 16.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and are stably operated for 500&#8197;cycles with the retention rates of 81.4&#8201;% and the average coulombic efficiency of 99.97&#8201;%, operated between 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) membrane on the Li metal anode tends to breakdown and undergo reconstruction during operation, causing Li metal batteries to experience accelerated decay. Notably, an SEI membrane with self-healing characteristics can help considerably in stabilizing the Li-electrolyte interface; however, uniformly fixing the repairing agent onto the anode remains a challenging task. By leveraging the noteworthy film-forming attributes of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) anions and the photopolymerization property of the vinyl group, the ionic liquid 1-vinyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI-FSI) was crosslinked with polyethylene oxide (PEO) in this study to form a self-healing film fixing FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups as the repairing agent. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp;amp; Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self-healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells with the loading of 16.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and are stably operated for 500&#8197;cycles with the retention rates of 81.4&#8201;% and the average coulombic efficiency of 99.97&#8201;%, operated between 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li. This study presents a new design approach for self-healing Li metal anodes and durable lithium metal battery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Principinol B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total synthesis of principinol B was achieved by convergent and modular synthetic strategies. Two enantioenriched fragments were assembled by a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction/carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis sequence. The oxabicyclo[3.2.1] core structure was introduced by the Williamson ether synthesis.







Abstract
We have accomplished the first and asymmetric total synthesis of principinol B, a grayanoid possessing an oxabicyclo[3.2.1] architecture. A functionalized 5/7/6/5 tetracyclic intermediate was assembled in a convergent manner by a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction and subsequent carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis of two enantiomerically enriched fragments. The oxabicyclo[3.2.1] architecture containing a 6,10&#8208;ether bridge was constructed by the Williamson ether synthesis.

         <title>MoS2 Hollow Multishelled Nanospheres Doped Fe Single Atoms Capable of Fast Phase Transformation for Fast&#8208;charging Na&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time, which promotes the electron transfer and Na+ diffusion kinetic, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. Besides, the strong adsorption with Na+ and self&#8208;catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S, combining buffering effect of HoMS to improve the cyclic stability.







Abstract
Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self&#8208;catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple&#8208;shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is superior to previously&#8208;reported results. Even at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 259.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (83.68&#8201;%) was reserved after 500 cycles. Such elaborate catalytic site decorated HoMS is also promising to realize other &#8220;fast&#8208;charging&#8221; high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Integrating Olefin Carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag Reaction by Radical Deconstruction of Hydrazonyl N&#8722;N Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel conversion mode for hydrazone by the division use of N2&#8208;moiety is developed by the photocatalytic redox neutral reaction of N&#8208;homoallyl&#8208;N&#8208;mesitylenesulfonyl (Mts)&#8208;hydrazones with ICF2CO2Et. The reaction merges olefin carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag (HLF) reaction by radical addition/crucial distal N and H transfer sequences to yield &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;sulphonamide&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;amino acid esters under tandem C&#8722;C and dual C&#8722;N bonds forging.







Abstract
As a type of elementary organic compounds containing N&#8722;N single bond, hydrazone involved chemical conversions are extremely extensive, but they are mainly limited to N2&#8208;retention and N2&#8208;removal modes. We report herein an unprecedented protocol for the realization of division utilization of the N2&#8208;moiety of hydrazone by a radical facilitated N&#8722;N bond deconstruction strategy. This new conversion mode enables the successful combination of alkene carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reaction by the reaction of N&#8208;homoallyl mesitylenesulfonyl hydrazones with ethyl difluoroiodoacetate under photocatalytic redox neutral conditions. Mechanism studies reveal that the reaction undergoes a radical relay involving addition, crucial remote imino&#8208;N migration and H&#8208;atom transfer. Consequently, a series of structurally significant &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;sulphonamide&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;amino acid esters are efficiently produced via continuous C&#8722;C bond and dual C&#8722;N bonds forging.

         <title>Predicting Lewis Acidity: Machine Learning the Fluoride Ion Affinity of p&#8208;Block&#8208;Atom&#8208;Based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluoride ion affinity (FIA) is among the most prominent descriptors for Lewis acidity. This paper presents FIA&#8208;GNN, a machine learning model that predicts FIA values in gas and solution (CH2Cl2) phase within a fraction of a second on a standard personal laptop. This is several orders of magnitude faster compared to the conventional quantum chemical approach. FIA&#8208;GNN is applied in four different case studies including catalysis research.







Abstract
&#8220;How strong is this Lewis acid?&#8221; is a question researchers often approach by calculating its fluoride ion affinity (FIA) with quantum chemistry. Here, we present FIA49k, an extensive FIA dataset with 48,986 data points calculated at the RI&#8208;DSD&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/def2&#8208;QZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c level of theory, including 13 different p&#8208;block atoms as the fluoride accepting site. The FIA49k dataset was used to train FIA&#8208;GNN, two message&#8208;passing graph neural networks, which predict gas and solution phase FIA values of molecules excluded from training with a mean absolute error of 14&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (r2=0.93) from the SMILES string of the Lewis acid as the only input. The level of accuracy is notable, given the wide energetic range of 750&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 spanned by FIA49k. The model's value was demonstrated with four case studies, including predictions for molecules extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database and by reproducing results from catalysis research available in the literature. Weaknesses of the model are evaluated and interpreted chemically. FIA&#8208;GNN and the FIA49k dataset can be reached via a free web app (grebgroup.de/fia&#8208;gnn).

This is several orders of magnitude faster compared to the conventional quantum chemical approach. FIA-GNN is applied in four different case studies including catalysis research.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How strong is this Lewis acid?&#8221; is a question researchers often approach by calculating its fluoride ion affinity (FIA) with quantum chemistry. Here, we present FIA49k, an extensive FIA dataset with 48,986 data points calculated at the RI-DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ)/def2-QZVPP//PBEh-3c level of theory, including 13 different &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-block atoms as the fluoride accepting site. The FIA49k dataset was used to train FIA-GNN, two message-passing graph neural networks, which predict gas and solution phase FIA values of molecules excluded from training with a mean absolute error of 14&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.93) from the SMILES string of the Lewis acid as the only input. The level of accuracy is notable, given the wide energetic range of 750&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; spanned by FIA49k. The model's value was demonstrated with four case studies, including predictions for molecules extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database and by reproducing results from catalysis research available in the literature. Weaknesses of the model are evaluated and interpreted chemically. FIA-GNN and the FIA49k dataset can be reached via a free web app (&lt;a target="_blank"

         <title>Catalytic and Base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls via a Cyclic Iodonium Ylide Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and catalytic &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls have been developed, providing expedient access toward a wide range of high&#8208;value 2&#8208;aryl (hetero)cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls. The key to success is through a cyclic iodonium ylide strategy. Our approach is base&#8208;free and exhibits broad substrate scope (&gt;100&#8197;examples). Importantly, our approach allows late&#8208;stage modification and significantly simplifying previous synthesis.







Abstract
To date, it remains challenging to achieve a general and catalytic &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, particularly ubiquitous heteroaromatic ones. In most cases, the preparation of their medically significant arylated derivatives requires multistep synthetic sequences. Herein, we introduce a new, convenient strategy involving the conversion of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls to cyclic iodonium ylides (CIYs), followed by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation with arylboronic reagents via carbene coupling. This approach is mild, operationally simple, base&#8208;free, biocompatible, and exhibits broad substrate scope (&gt;100&#8197;examples), especially with respect to various heteroaromatic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls and ortho&#8208;substituted or base&#8208;sensitive arylboronic acids. Importantly, owing to the excellent compatibility with various arylboronic acids or boronate esters (ArBpin, ArBneop, or ArBF3K), this method allows the late&#8208;stage installation of heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motifs in highly complex settings. The utility of this transformation is further demonstrated through significantly simplifying the synthesis of several bioactive molecules and natural products.

         <title>Precisely Patterned Channels in a Vertical Organic Electrochemical Transistor with a Diazirine Photo&#8208;Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted interest in the field of neuromorphic devices and implantable electronics due to their excellent characteristics. Here, we use small molecule photo&#8208;crosslinkers double&#8208;end trifluoromethyl diazirine (DtFDA) to precisely pattern the channel layer and modulate ion transport in OECTs to fabricate high&#8208;performance vertical electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) rely on both efficient ionic doping/de&#8208;doping process and carrier transport in the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic channel under the modulation of gate bias. Moreover, channels that hold photopatterning capability are highly desired to minimize parasitic capacitance and simplify the fabrication process/cost. However, yielding photo&#8208;patternable channels with both precise/robust patterning capability and controllable ionic&#8208;electronic coupling is still challenging. Herein, double&#8208;end trifluoromethyl diazirines (DtFDA) with different chain lengths are introduced in the OECT channel to act as both photo&#8208;crosslinker and medium to regulate ionic&#8208;electronic transport. Specifically, high&#8208;resolution patterns with a minimum line width/gap of 2&#8197;&#956;m are realized in p(g2T&#8208;T) or Homo&#8208;gDPP based channels by introducing DtFDA. Maximum transconductances of 68.6&#8197;mS and 81.6&#8197;mS, current on/off ratio of 106 and 107 (under a drain voltage of only &#177;0.1&#8197;V), are achieved in p&#8208; and n&#8208;type vertical OECTs (vOECTs), respectively, along with current densities exceeding 1&#8197;kA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability of more than 100,000 cycles (2000&#8197;seconds). This work provides a new and facile strategy for the fabrication of vOECT channels with high resolution and high performance via the introduction of a simple and efficient crosslinker.

         <title>The Rhodium Analogue of Coenzyme B12 as an Anti&#8208;Photoregulatory Ligand Inhibiting Bacterial CarH Photoreceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to the memory of Albert EschenmoserCarH photoreceptors bound to photolabile cobalt corrin coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl) are DNA&#8208;binding tetramers that repress genes for carotenoid synthesis in the dark. Light triggers AdoCbl photolysis and CarH tetramer disassembly to activate gene expression. AdoRhbl, a synthetic photostable isostructural rhodium surrogate of AdoCbl, emulates AdoCbl in CarH binding, tetramerization and DNA binding yet blocks photoregulation by CarH in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl; 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;adenosylcobalamin), the quintessential biological organometallic radical catalyst, has a formerly unanticipated, yet extensive, role in photoregulation in bacteria. The light&#8208;responsive cobalt&#8208;corrin AdoCbl performs this nonenzymatic role by facilitating the assembly of CarH photoreceptors into DNA&#8208;binding tetramers in the dark, suppressing gene expression. Conversely, exposure to light triggers the decomposition of this AdoCbl&#8208;bound complex by a still elusive photochemical mechanism, activating gene expression. Here, we have examined AdoRhbl, the non&#8208;natural rhodium analogue of AdoCbl, as a photostable isostructural surrogate for AdoCbl. We show that AdoRhbl closely emulates AdoCbl in its uptake by bacterial cells and structural functionality as a regulatory ligand for CarH tetramerization, DNA binding, and repressor activity. Remarkably, we find AdoRhbl is photostable even when bound &#8220;base&#8208;off/His&#8208;on&#8221; to CarH in vitro and in vivo. Thus, AdoRhbl, an antivitamin B12, also represents an unprecedented anti&#8208;photoregulatory ligand, opening a pathway to precisely target biomimetic inhibition of AdoCbl&#8208;based photoregulation, with new possibilities for selective antibacterial applications. Computational biomolecular analysis of AdoRhbl binding to CarH yields detailed structural insights into this complex, which suggest that the adenosyl group of photoexcited AdoCbl bound to CarH may specifically undergo a concerted non&#8208;radical syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;elimination mechanism, an aspect not previously considered for this photoreceptor.

         <title>Evolved Readers of 5&#8208;Carboxylcytosine CpG Dyads Reveal a High Versatility of the Methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;Binding Domain for Recognition of Noncanonical Epigenetic Marks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytosine 5&#8208;modifications&#8211;occurring in different combinations in the two DNA strands of CpG dyads&#8211;are central to human chromatin regulation, but the customized recognition of such combinatorial marks is challenging. By re&#8208;evolving MBDs, the readers of canonical 5&#8208;methylated CpGs, we identify strong and selective readers of noncanonical 5&#8208;carboxylcytosine&#8208;containing CpGs that have fully abandoned the conserved recognition of methylated CpGs.







Abstract
Mammalian genomes are regulated by epigenetic cytosine (C) modifications in palindromic CpG dyads. Including canonical cytosine 5&#8208;methylation (mC), a total of four different 5&#8208;modifications can theoretically co&#8208;exist in the two strands of a CpG, giving rise to a complex array of combinatorial marks with unique regulatory potentials. While tailored readers for individual marks could serve as versatile tools to study their functions, it has been unclear whether a natural protein scaffold would allow selective recognition of marks that vastly differ from canonical, symmetrically methylated CpGs. We conduct directed evolution experiments to generate readers of 5&#8208;carboxylcytosine (caC) dyads based on the methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;binding domain (MBD), the widely conserved natural reader of mC. Despite the stark steric and chemical differences to mC, we discover highly selective, low nanomolar binders of symmetric and asymmetric caC&#8208;dyads. Together with mutational and modelling studies, our findings reveal a striking evolutionary flexibility of the MBD scaffold, allowing it to completely abandon its conserved mC recognition mode in favour of noncanonical dyad recognition, highlighting its potential for epigenetic reader design.

         <title>Sustainable Polymers with High Performance and Infinite Scalability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time report the polyaddition of COS, diamines, and diacrylates, which is highly efficient, atom&#8208;economical, quantitatively yield, catalyst&#8208;free, and affords 46&#8197;polymers covering high&#8208;Tm crystalline plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, and amorphous plastics. The in&#8208;chain ester and thiourethane groups contribute to the enzyme&#8208;degradability and enhanced thermal/mechanical properties of the obtained polymers.







Abstract
Our society has been pursuing high&#8208;performance biodegradable polymers made from facile methods and readily available monomers. Here, we demonstrate a library of enzyme&#8208;degradable polymers with desirable properties from the first reported step polyaddition of diamines, COS, and diacrylates. The polymers contain in&#8208;chain ester and thiourethane groups, which can serve as lipase&#8208;degradation and hydrogen&#8208;bonding physical crosslinking points, respectively, resulting in possible biodegradability as well as upgraded mechanical and thermal properties. Also, the properties of the polymers are scalable due to the versatile method and the wide variety of monomers. We obtain 46&#8197;polymers with tunable performance covering high&#8208;Tm crystalline plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, and amorphous plastics by regulating polymer structure. Additionally, the polymerization method is highly efficient, atom&#8208;economical, quantitatively yield, metal&#8208; and even catalyst&#8208;free. Overall, the polymers are promising green materials given their degradability, simple and modular synthesis, remarkable and tunable properties, and readily available monomers.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Single&#8208;Copper&#8208;Site Catalysts for Room&#8208;Temperature Benzene Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (Cu SACs, designated as Cu/NPC) with the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Cu sites on the nitrogen (N)&#8208;phosphorus (P)&#8208;carbon (C) support were synthesized using an in situ phosphorous&#8208;immitting method. The P&#8208;rich coordinated Cu sites of the Cu/NPC were responsible for the direct C&#8722;H activation of benzene to phenol conversion.







Abstract
Crafting single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) that possess &#8220;just right&#8221; modulated electronic and geometric structures, granting accessible active sites for direct room&#8208;temperature benzene oxidation is a coveted objective. However, achieving this goal remains a formidable challenge. Here, we introduce an innovative in situ phosphorus&#8208;immitting strategy using a new phosphorus source (phosphorus nitride, P3N5) to construct the phosphorus&#8208;rich copper (Cu) SACs, designated as Cu/NPC. These catalysts feature locally protruding metal sites on a nitrogen (N)&#8208;phosphorus (P)&#8208;carbon (C) support (NPC). Rigorous analyses, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), validate the coordinated bonding of nitrogen and phosphorus with atomically dispersed Cu sites on NPC. Crucially, systematic first&#8208;principles calculations, coupled with the climbing image nudged&#8208;elastic&#8208;band (CI&#8208;NEB) method, provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of the distorted Cu&#8722;N2P2 centers in Cu/NPC for selective oxidation of benzene to phenol production. Interestingly, Cu/NPC has shown more energetically favorable C&#8722;H bond activation compared to the benchmark Cu/NC SACs in the direct oxidation of benzene, resulting in outstanding benzene conversion (50.3&#8201;%) and phenol selectivity (99.3&#8201;%) at room temperature. Furthermore, Cu/NPC achieves a remarkable turnover frequency of 263&#8197;h&#8722;1 and mass&#8208;specific activity of 35.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benzene&#8208;to&#8208;phenol conversion catalysts to date.

         <title>Deprotective Functionalization: A Direct Conversion of Nms&#8208;Amides to Carboxamides Using Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a concept termed &#8220;deprotective functionalization&#8221;, which we have applied to the coupling of Nms&#8208;protected amines with carboxylic acids. Notably, this approach circumvents the need for a dedicated amine&#8208;deprotection step and obviates the use of additional reagents for carboxylate activation. The reaction was shown to be, in many cases, superior to deprotection followed by functionalization, both in terms of yield and atom economy.







Abstract
The nature of protecting group chemistry necessitates a deprotection step to restore the initially blocked functionality prior to further transformation. As this aspect of protecting group manipulation inevitably adds to the step count of any synthetic sequence, the development of methods enabling simultaneous deprotection and functionalization (&#8220;deprotective functionalization&#8221;&#8212;distinct from &#8220;deprotection followed by functionalization&#8221;) is appealing, as it has the potential to improve efficiency and streamline synthetic routes. Herein, we report a deprotective functionalization of the newly introduced Nms&#8208;amides guided by density functional theory (DFT) analysis, which exploits the inherent Nms reactivity. Mechanistic studies further substantiate and help rationalize the exquisite reactivity of Nms&#8208;amides, as other commonly used protecting groups are shown not to exhibit the same reactivity patterns. The practicality of this approach was ultimately demonstrated in selected case studies.

         <title>Stable&#160;Anion Exchange Membrane Bearing Quinuclidinium for High&#8208;performance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are core components in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs). However, the stability of functional quaternary ammonium cations, especially under high temperatures and harsh alkaline conditions, seriously affects their performance and durability. Herein, we synthesized a 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenylquinuclidinium molecular building unit.&#160;Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and accelerated aging analysis indicated that the quinine ring structure was exceedingly stable, and the SN2 degradation mechanism dominated. Through acid&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts polymerization, a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) AEMs with controllable molecular weight and adjustable ion exchange conductivity (IEC) were prepared. The stable quinine structure in PAQ&#8208;x&#160;was verified and retained in the ex&#8208;situ alkaline stability. Furthermore, the branched polymer structure reduces the swelling rate and water uptake to achieve a tradeoff between dimensional stability and ionic conductivity, significantly improving the membrane's overall performance. Importantly, PAQ&#8208;5 was used in non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based AEM&#8208;WE, achieving a high current density of 8 A cm&#8208;2 at 2 V and excellent stability over 2446 h in a gradient constant current test. Based on the excellent alkaline stability of this diaryl&#8208;quinuclidinium group, it can be further considered as a multifunctional building unit to create multi&#8208;topological polymers for energy conversion devices used in alkaline environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating and stabilizing a reversible four electron redox reactions of I&#8208;/I+ for aqueous Zn&#8208;iodine battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low capacity and poor cycle stability greatly inhibit the development of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. Herein, a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;Iodine battery has been reached by designing and optimizing both electrode and electrolyte. The Br&#8208; is introduced as the activator to trigger I+, and coupled with I+ forming interhalogen to stabilize I+ to achieve a four&#8208;electron reaction, which greatly promotes the capacity. And the Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;I LDH nanoflowers served as the confinement host to enable the reactions of I&#8208;/I+ occurring in the layer due to the spacious and stable interlayer spacing of Ni&#8208;Fe&#8208;I LDH, which effectively suppresses the iodine&#8208;species shuttle ensuring high cycling stability. As a result, the electrochemical performance is greatly enhanced, especially in specific capacity (as high as 350 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 far higher than two&#8208;electron transfer Zn&#8208;Iodine batteries) and cycling performance (94.6% capacity retention after 10000 cycles). This strategy provides a new way to realize high capacity and long&#8208;term stability of Zn&#8208;Iodine batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxide Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions&#160;for Abundant Production of Mugineic Acids and Nicotianamine Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A succinct synthetic approach to mugineic acids and 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was established.&#160;Unlike all other synthetic methods, this approach utilized epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions to form two C&#8208;N bonds and is characterized by the absence of redox reactions.&#160;Mugineic acid was synthesized from three readily available fragments on a gram scale in 6 steps. The protected 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was also synthesized in 4 steps, and the dansyl group, serving as a fluorophore, was introduced through a click reaction after propargylation of the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy group. The dansyl&#8208;labeled nicotianamine (NA) iron complexes were&#160;internalized by oocytes overexpressing ZmYS1 (from maize) or PAT1 (from human) transporters, indicating successful transport of the synthesized NA&#8208;probe through these&#160;transporters.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Chlorotonils: Dehalogenil as Promising Lead Compound for In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural product chlorotonil displays high potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Yet, its scaffold is characterized by low solubility and oral bioavailability but progress was recently made to enhance these properties. Applying late&#8208;stage functionalization, we aimed to further optimize the molecule. Previously unknown reactions including a sulfur&#8208;mediated dehalogenation were revealed. Dehalogenil, the product of this reaction, was identified as the most promising compound so far, as this new derivative displayed improved solubility and in vivo efficacy while retaining excellent antimicrobial activity. We confirmed superb activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. and mature transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We also demonstrated favorable in vivo toxicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in infection models with S.&#160;aureus. Taken together, these results identify dehalogenil as an advanced lead molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Modification of Polysulfide Surfaces with Low&#8208;Power Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The modification of polymer surfaces using laser light is important for many applications in the nano&#8208;, bio&#8208; and chemical sciences. Such capabilities have supported advances in biomedical devices, electronics, information storage, microfluidics, and other applications. In most cases, these modifications require high power lasers that are expensive and require specialized equipment and facilities to minimize risk of hazardous radiation. Additionally, polymer systems that can be easily modified by lasers are often complex and costly to prepare. In this report, these challenges are addressed with the discovery of low&#8208;cost sulfur copolymers that can be rapidly modified with lasers emitting low&#8208;power infrared and visible light. The featured copolymers are made from elemental sulfur and either cyclopentadiene or dicyclopentadiene. Using a suite of lasers with discreet wavelengths (532, 638 and 786 nm) and powers, a variety of surface modifications could be made on the polymers such as controlled swelling or etching via ablation. The facile synthesis and laser modification of these polymer systems were exploited in applications such as direct laser lithography and erasable information storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Metabolic Glycosylation Reporters Enable Detection of Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in Living Cells without S&#8208;Glyco Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification of cytosolic and nuclear proteins involved in numerous fundamental regulation processes. Investigation of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation by metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) has been carried out for two decades with peracetylated N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine derivatives modified with varying reporter groups. Recently, it has been shown that these derivatives can result in non&#8208;specific protein labeling termed S&#8208;glyco modification. Here, we report norbornene&#8208;modified GlcNAc derivatives with a protected phosphate at the anomeric position and their application in MGE. These derivatives overcome two limitations of previously used O&#8208;GlcNAc reporters. They do not lead to detectable S&#8208;glyco modification, and they efficiently react in the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which can be carried out even within living cells. Using a derivative with an S&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;thioethyl&#8208;protected phosphate, we demonstrate the protein&#8208;specific detection of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation of several proteins and the protein&#8208;specific imaging of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation inside living cells by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) visualized by confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Delivery of Charged Species using Ion&#8208;selective Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled release systems have gained considerable attention owing to their potential to deliver molecules, including ions and drugs, in a customized manner. We present a light&#8208;induced ion&#8208;transfer platform consisting of a dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs, ~300 nm) with the conductive polymer poly(3&#8208;octylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (POT) in the core and a potassium (K+)&#8208;selective membrane in the shell. Owing to the photoactive nature of POT, each NP can be used for a dual purpose: as a host for positively charged species and as an actuator to trigger the subsequent release. POT0&#160;and doped POT+&#160;coexist in the core, allowing K+&#160;encapsulation in the shell. As POT0&#160;is photo&#8208;oxidized to POT+, K+&#160;is released to the (aqueous) dispersion phase to preserve the neutrality. This process is reversible and can be assessed using the native fluorescence of POT0&#160;and via potentiometric measurements. The NP structure and its mechanism of action were thoroughly studied with a series of control experiments and complementary techniques. Understanding the NP and its surrounding interactions will pave the way for other nanostructured systems, facilitating sophisticated applications. The delivery of ionic drugs and interference/pollutant catching for advanced sensing/restoration will be considered in future research.</dc:description>

However, achieving precise control over the selectivity in coupling reactions of unsubstituted phenols utilizing solar light as the driving force remains a big challenge. In this study, we report a series of porous Cs3Bi2X9 (X = Cl, Br, I) photocatalysts with tailored bandgaps and compositions engineered for efficient solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative phenol coupling. Notably, p&#8208;Cs3Bi2Br9 exhibited about 73 % selectivity for C&#8208;C coupling, displaying a high formation rate of 47.3 &#956;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8209;1 under solar radiation. Furthermore, this approach enables control of the site&#8208;selectivity for phenol derivatives on Cs3Bi2X9, enhancing C&#8208;C coupling. The distinctive porous structure and appropriate band&#8208;edge positions of Cs3Bi2Br9 facilitated efficient charge separation, and surface interaction/activation of phenolic hydroxyl groups, resulting in the kinetically preferred formation of C&#8208;C over C&#8208;O bond. Mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway, supported by comprehensive control experiments, unveiled the crucial role of interfacial charge transfers and Lewis acid Bi sites in stabilizing phenolic intermediates, thereby directing the regioselectivity of diradical couplings and resulting in the formation of unsymmetrical biphenols.</dc:description>

         <title>The Use of Xenonucleic Acids Significantly Reduces the In Vivo Drift of Electrochemical Aptamer&#8208;Based Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based sensors support the high&#8208;frequency, real&#8208;time monitoring of molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest in vivo. Achieving this requires methods for correcting the sensor drift seen during in vivo placements. While this correction ensures EAB sensor measurements remain accurate, as drift progresses it reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and precision. Here, we show that enzymatic cleavage of the sensor&#8217;s target&#8208;recognizing DNA aptamer is a major source of this signal loss. To demonstrate this, we deployed a tobramycin&#8208;detecting EAB sensor analog fabricated with the DNase&#8208;resistant &#8220;xenonucleic acid&#8221; 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA in a live rat. In contrast to the sensor employing the equivalent DNA aptamer, the 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA aptamer sensor lost very little signal and had improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise. We further characterized the EAB sensor drift using unstructured DNA or 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA oligonucleotides. While the two devices drift similarly in vitro in whole blood, the in vivo drift of the 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA&#8208;employing device is less compared to the DNA&#8208;employing device. Studies of the electron transfer kinetics suggested that the greater drift of the latter sensor arises due to enzymatic DNA degradation. These findings, coupled with advances in the selection of aptamers employing XNA, suggest a means of improving EAB sensor stability when they are used to perform molecular monitoring in the living body.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Crystallinity and Suppressing Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Completely Non&#8208;fused Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) organic solar cells (OSCs) have received increasing attention because of their promising application in tandem device and indoor photovoltaic. However, the lack of a precise correlation between molecular structure and stacking behaviors of wide bandgap electron acceptors has greatly limited its development. Here, we adopted an asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) and synthesized two completely non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), HF&#8208;BTA33 and HCl&#8208;BTA33. The results show that AHS significantly enhances the molecular dipoles and suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in enhanced intramolecular/intermolecular interactions and decreased nonradiative decay. As a result, PTQ10:HF&#8208;BTA33 realizes a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42% with a VOC of 1.232 V, higher than that of symmetric analogue F&#8208;BTA33 (PCE=10.02%, VOC=1.197 V). Notably, PTQ10:HCl&#8208;BTA33 achieves the highest PCE of 12.54% with a VOC of 1.201 V due to the long&#8208;range ordered &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing and enhanced surface electrostatic interactions thereby facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport. This work not only proves that asymmetric halogenation of completely NFREAs is a simple and effective strategy for achieving both high PCE and VOC, but also provides deeper insights for the precise molecular design of low cost completely NFREAs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Elastomer Bearing Loop Structures with Dissipating Characteristics and Enhanced Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Loops are prevalent topological structures in cross&#8208;linked polymer networks, resulting from the folding of polymer chains back onto themselves. Traditionally, they have been considered as defects that compromise the mechanical properties of the network, leading to extensive efforts in synthesis to prevent their formation. In this study, we introduce the inclusion of cyclic dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moieties within the polymer network strands to form CCNs, and surprisingly, these loops enhance the mechanical performances of the network, leading to tough elastomers. The toughening effect can be attributed to the unique cyclic structure of DB24C8. The relatively small size and the presence of rigid phenyl rings provide the loops with relatively stable conformations, allowing for substantial energy dissipation upon the application of force. Furthermore, the DB24C8 rings possess a broad range of potential conformations, imparting the materials with exceptional elasticity. The synergistic combination of these two features effectively toughens the materials, resulting in a remarkable 66&#8208;fold increase in toughness compared to the control sample of covalent networks. Moreover, the mechanical properties, particularly the recovery performance of the network, can be effectively tuned by introducing guests to bind with DB24C8, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the discovery and biosynthesis of new piperazine alkaloids&#8210;arizonamides, and their derived compounds&#8210;arizolidines, featuring heterobicyclic and spirocyclic isoquinolone skeletons, respectively. Their biosynthetic pathway involves two crucial non&#8208;heme iron enzymes, ParF and ParG, for core skeleton construction. ParF has a dual function facilitating 2,3&#8208;alkene formation of helvamide, as a substrate for ParG, and oxidative cleavage of piperazine. Notably, ParG exhibits catalytic versatility in multiple oxidative reactions, involving cyclization and ring reconstruction. A key amino acid residue Phe67 was characterized to control the formation of the constrained arizonamide B backbone by ParG.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Design and Efficient Synthesis for High Ambipolar Mobility Emissive Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High ambipolar mobility emissive conjugated polymers   (HAME&#8208;CPs) are perfect candidates for organic optoelectronic devices, such as polymer light emitting transistors. However, due to intrinsic trade&#8208;off relationship between high ambipolar mobility and strong solid&#8208;state luminescence, the development of HAME&#8208;CPs suffers from high structural and synthetic complexity. Herein, a universal design principle and simple synthetic approach for HAME&#8208;CPs are developed.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High ambipolar mobility emissive conjugated polymers   (HAME-CPs) are perfect candidates for organic optoelectronic devices, such as polymer light emitting transistors.

         <title>Metabolic Glycoengineering&#8208;Enabled Molecularly Specific Acoustic Tweezing Cytometry for Targeted Mechanical Stimulation of Cell Surface Sialoglycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study developed a new type of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;functionalized microbubbles (MBs) and validated their attachment to azide&#8208;labelled sialoglycans on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated via metabolic glycoengineering (MGE). This enabled application of mechanical forces to sialoglycans on hPSCs via molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry (mATC), i.e., displacing sialoglycan&#8208;anchored MBs using ultrasound (US). It was shown that subjected to forces of US pulses, sialoglycan&#8208;anchored MBs exhibited significantly larger displacements and faster, more complete recovery after each pulse than integrin&#8208;anchored MBs, indicating that sialoglycans are more stretchable and elastic than integrins on hPSCs in response to mechanical force. Furthermore, stimulating sialoglycans on hPSCs using mATC reduced stage&#8208;specific embryonic antigen&#8208;3 (SSEA&#8208;3) and GD3 expression but not OCT4 and SOX2 nuclear localization. Conversely, stimulating integrins decreased OCT4 nuclear localization but not SSEA&#8208;3 and GD3 expression, suggesting that mechanically stimulating sialoglycans and integrins initiated distinct mechanoresponses during the early stages of hPSC differentiation. Taken together, the results demonstrated that MGE&#8208;enabled mATC uncovered not only different mechanical properties of sialoglycans on hPSCs than integrins but also their different mechanoregulatory impacts on hPSC differentiation, validating MGE&#8208;based mATC as a new, powerful tool for investigating the roles of glycans and other cell surface biomolecules in mechanotransduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanols by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Alkenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of a commercially available L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid ligand, the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols via the Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#8722;H alkenylation has been realized. Employing the oxime ether as the directing group, the silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanol derivatives could be readily prepared with excellent enantioselectivities via desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution, featuring a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols via Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#8722;H alkenylation with the assistance of a commercially available L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid has been realized for the first time. Employing oxime ether as the directing group, silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanol derivatives could be readily prepared with excellent enantioselectivities, featuring a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, parallel kinetic resolution with unsymmetric substrates further highlighted the generality of this protocol. Mechanistic studies indicate that L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid could stabilize the Pd catalyst and provide excellent chiral induction. Preliminary computational studies unveil the origin of the enantioselectivity in the C&#8722;H bond activation step.

         <title>Oligo(phenyleneethynylene)s: Shape&#8208;Tunable Building Blocks for Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses in a comparative way the self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution of oligophenyleneethynylenes (OPEs), a class of dyes that has been widely used for various functional materials. The classification of different OPEs according to their molecular shape allows to rationalize their structure/self&#8208;assembly correlation, which should pave the way for the development of functional materials based on &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.







Abstract
Oligo(phenyleneethynylene)s (OPEs) have attracted widespread attention due to their remarkable (opto)electronic and photophysical properties, which have enabled numerous applications. The versatile functionalization possibilities of OPEs make them unique candidates to form various shape&#8208;persistent geometries, including linear, triangular, rectangular, hexagonal and macrocyclic. However, as a result of this structural variety, it is oftentimes challenging to correlate molecular design with self&#8208;assembly properties. In this minireview, we have classified OPEs based on their molecular shapes and correlated them with their self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution. Particularly, we provide important insights into the aggregation propensity of the different molecular shapes and how to tune the association strength using various non&#8208;covalent interactions. Our classification will enable a better understanding of the structure&#8208;property correlation in OPEs, which is key to develop supramolecular functional materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Dialane&#8208;Bridged Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable, dialane&#8208;bridged diradical species has been synthesized that exists in two conformers&#8212;twisted and planar&#8212;depending on the solvent of crystallization. Both conformers have been isolated and thoroughly characterized using various analytical techniques. Their reactivity has been examined with oxidizing agents to demonstrate the reduction capability of diradicals.







Abstract
Radicals of the lightest group 13 element, boron, are well established and observed in numerous forms. In contrast to boron, radical chemistry involving the heavier group 13 elements (aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium) remains largely underexplored, primarily attributed to the formidable synthetic challenges associated with these elements. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of planar and twisted conformers of a doubly CAAC (cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene)&#8208;radical&#8208;substituted dialane. Extensive characterization through spectroscopic analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms their identity, while quantum chemical calculations support their open&#8208;shell nature and provide further insights into their electronic structures. The dialane&#8208;connected diradicals exhibit high susceptibility to oxidation, as evidenced by electrochemical measurements and reactions with o&#8208;chloranil and a variety of organic azides. This study opens a previously uncharted class of dialuminum systems to study, broadening the scope of diradical chemistry and its potential applications.

         <title>(111) Facet&#8208;oriented Cu2Mg Intermetallic Compound with Cu3&#8208;Mg Sites for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (111) facet&#8208;oriented Cu2Mg intermetallic compound with high&#8208;density ordered Cu3&#8208;Mg sites can stabilize oxygen&#8208;containing ethanol intermediates (*CHCHOH) at adjacent Cu catalytic sites during CO2 electroreduction, thus promoting the ethanol production with high selectivity.







Abstract
The efficient ethanol electrosynthesis from CO2 is challenging with low selectivity at high CO2 electrolysis rates, due to the competition with H2 and other reduction products. Copper&#8208;based bimetallic electrocatalysts are potential candidates for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion, but the secondary metal has mainly been focused on active components (such as Ag, Sn) for CO2 electroreduction, which also promote selectivity of ethylene or other reduction products rather than ethanol. Limited attention has been given to alkali&#8208;earth metals due to their inherently active chemical property. Herein, we rationally synthesized a (111) facet&#8208;oriented nano Cu2Mg (designated as Cu2Mg(111)) intermetallic compound with high&#8208;density ordered Cu3&#8208;Mg sites. The in situ Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculations revealed that the Cu3&#8722;
&#8722;&#8208;Mg&#8722;
+ active sites allowed to increase *CO surface coverage, decrease reaction energy for *CO&#8722;CO coupling, and stabilize *CHCHOH intermediates, thus promoting the ethanol formation pathway. The Cu2Mg(111) catalyst exhibited a high FEC2H5OH of 76.2&#177;4.8&#8201;% at 600&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, and a peak value of |jC2H5OH| of 720&#177;34&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, almost 4 times of that using conventional Cu2Mg with (311) facets, comparable to the best reported values for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol electroreduction.

&lt;p&gt;The efficient ethanol electrosynthesis from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is challenging with low selectivity at high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis rates, due to the competition with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other reduction products. Copper-based bimetallic electrocatalysts are potential candidates for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol conversion, but the secondary metal has mainly been focused on active components (such as Ag, Sn) for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction, which also promote selectivity of ethylene or other reduction products rather than ethanol. Limited attention has been given to alkali-earth metals due to their inherently active chemical property. Herein, we rationally synthesized a (111) facet-oriented nano Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg (designated as Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg(111)) intermetallic compound with high-density ordered Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Mg sites. The in situ Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculations revealed that the Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-Mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; active sites allowed to increase *CO surface coverage, decrease reaction energy for *CO&#8722;CO coupling, and stabilize *CHCHOH intermediates, thus promoting the ethanol formation pathway. The Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg(111) catalyst exhibited a high FE&lt;sub&gt;C2H5OH&lt;/sub&gt; of 76.2&#177;4.8&#8201;% at 600&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a peak value of |&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C2H5OH&lt;/sub&gt;| of 720&#177;34&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, almost 4 times of that using conventional Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg with (311) facets, comparable to the best reported values for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol electroreduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Driven Evolution of Adaptive Artificial Ion Channels or Nanopores with Specific Anticancer Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a novel class of artificial channels, showing an intriguing adaptive ability to form chloride ion channels at low concentrations while transforming into nanopores at high concentrations. The triphenylphosphonium (TPP) groups endow the channel&#8208;forming units with mitochondria&#8208;targeting properties, enabling them to drill holes on the mitochondrial membrane which subsequently induce targeted apoptosis of cancer cells.







Abstract
In nature, ceramides are a class of sphingolipids possessing a unique ability to self&#8208;assemble into protein&#8208;permeable channels with intriguing concentration&#8208;dependent adaptive channel cavities. However, within the realm of artificial ion channels, this interesting phenomenon is scarcely represented. Herein, we report on a novel class of adaptive artificial channels, Pn&#8208;TPPs, based on PEGylated cholic acids bearing triphenylphosphonium (TPP) groups as anion binding motifs. Interestingly, the molecules self&#8208;assemble into chloride ion channels at low concentrations while transforming into small molecule&#8208;permeable nanopores at high concentrations. Moreover, the TPP groups endow the molecules with mitochondria&#8208;targeting properties, enabling them to selectively drill holes on the mitochondrial membrane of cancer cells and subsequently trigger the caspase&#8197;9 apoptotic pathway. The anticancer efficacies of Pn&#8208;TPPs correlate with their abilities to form nanopores. Significantly, the most active ensembles formed by P5&#8208;TPP exhibits impressive anticancer activity against human liver cancer cells, with an IC50 value of 3.8&#8197;&#956;M. While demonstrating similar anticancer performance to doxorubicin, P5&#8208;TPP exhibits a selectivity index surpassing that of doxorubicin by a factor of 16.8.

         <title>Halide Superionic Conductors with Non&#8208;Close&#8208;Packed Anion Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design of non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion frameworks for halide superionic conductors is reported to show great potential for achieving superionic conductivity due to the significantly more distorted site and larger diffusion channel compared to its close&#8208;packed counterparts.







Abstract
Halide superionic conductors (SICs) are drawing significant research attention for their potential applications in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A key challenge in developing such SICs is to explore and design halide structural frameworks that enable rapid ion movement. In this work, we show that the close&#8208;packed anion frameworks shared by traditional halide ionic conductors face intrinsic limitations in fast ion conduction, regardless of structural regulation. Beyond the close&#8208;packed anion frameworks, we identify that the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion frameworks have great potential to achieve superionic conductivity. Notably, we unravel that the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed UCl3&#8208;type framework exhibit superionic conductivity for a diverse range of carrier ions, including Li+, Na+, K+, and Ag+, which are validated through both ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and experimental measurements. We elucidate that the remarkable ionic conductivity observed in the UCl3&#8208;type framework structure stems from its significantly more distorted site and larger diffusion channel than its close&#8208;packed counterparts. By employing the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion framework as the key feature for high&#8208;throughput computational screening, we also identify LiGaCl3 as a promising candidate for halide SICs. These discoveries provide crucial insights for the exploration and design of novel halide SICs.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Terpolymerisation of Elemental Sulfur Waste with Propylene Oxide and Carbon Disulfide via Lithium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental sulfur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, cannot form a copolymer with industrially relevant propylene oxide unless a mechanistic trick is employed, wherein thiolate intermediates are formed in situ to combine the two incompatible monomers.







Abstract
Elemental sulfur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, represents a promising raw material for the synthesis of degradable polymers. We show that simple lithium alkoxides facilitate the polymerisation of elemental sulfur S8 with industrially relevant propylene oxide (PO) and CS2 (a base chemical sourced from waste S8 itself) to give poly(monothiocarbonate&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx) in which x can be controlled by the amount of supplied sulfur. The in situ generation of thiolate intermediates obtained by a rearrangement, which follows CS2 and PO incorporation, allows to combine S8 and epoxides into one polymer sequence that would otherwise not be possible. Mechanistic investigations reveal that alkyl oligosulfide intermediates from S8 ring opening and sulfur chain length equilibration represent the better nucleophiles for inserting the next PO if compared to the trithiocarbonates obtained from the competing CS2 addition, which causes the sequence selectivity. The polymers can be crosslinked in situ with multifunctional thiols to yield reprocessable and degradable networks. Our report demonstrates how mechanistic understanding allows to combine intrinsically incompatible building blocks for sulfur waste utilisation.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Phosphine Boranes via Crystallization&#8208;Induced Dynamic Resolution of Lithiated Intermediate by Understanding the Underlying Epimerization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis of chiral phosphine boranes in high e.r.s utilizing the inexpensive ligand (R,R)&#8208;TMCDA by crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic resolution of its &#945;&#8208;lithiated intermediate. By in&#8208;depth mechanistical studies, the as stereochemically stable known intermediate epimerizes in presence of remaining starting material rendering this method promising for other important P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.







Abstract
Described herein is the successful crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic resolution (CIDR) of an &#945;&#8208;lithiated phosphine borane utilizing the easily accessible and inexpensive ligand (R,R)&#8208;TMCDA. Starting from the essential P&#8208;prochiral building block dimethyl phenyl phosphine borane we were able to obtain phosphine boranes in yields up to 80&#8201;% and e.r. up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 by crystallization of the lithiated intermediate prior to the trapping reaction. NMR&#8208;based deuterium labeling experiments indicate that the epimerization in solution is based on the intermolecular proton transfer between nonlithiated phosphine borane and the corresponding lithiated intermediate, rendering the presence of the remaining starting compound in an optimized solvent mixture the main factor for successful enantioselective synthesis. Quantum chemical calculations using different model systems based on solid state structures confirm these experimental results. By gaining insights into the epimerization mechanism, essential principles for CIDR of lithiated phosphine boranes are elucidated that may be expanded to other important P&#8208;stereogenic compounds and simple chiral amines.

A nanoparticle formulation, using oligonucleotide chemistry, able to release a gene editing system with single cell resolution after near infrared laser activation. The full potential of the formulation was demonstrated in the brain after intracerebral and intranasal administrations. The spot of the laser defined the region of gene editing.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as a promising platform for gene editing; however, the lack of an efficient and safe delivery system to introduce it into cells continues to hinder clinical translation. Here, we report a rationally designed gene&#8208;editing nanoparticle (NP) formulation for brain applications: an sgRNA:Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex is immobilized on the NP surface by oligonucleotides that are complementary to the sgRNA. Irradiation of the formulation with a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser generates heat in the NP, leading to the release of the ribonucleoprotein complex. The gene&#8208;editing potential of the formulation was demonstrated in vitro at the single&#8208;cell level. The safety and gene editing of the formulation were also demonstrated in the brains of reporter mice, specifically in the subventricular zone after intracerebral administration and in the olfactory bulb after intranasal administration. The formulation presented here offers a new strategy for the spatially controlled delivery of the CRISPR system to the brain.

         <title>A Terrylene Bisimide based Universal Host for Aromatic Guests to Derive Contact Surface&#8208;Dependent Dispersion Energies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large &#960;&#8208;surface provided by terrylene bisimide affords a cyclophane that can accommodate a large variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guests with binding constants up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1. A linear relationship between the Gibbs binding energy and the surface area of the guest could be used to derive the interaction parameter of 0.31&#8197;kJ/mol&#197;2.







Abstract
&#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are among the most important intermolecular interactions in supramolecular systems. Here we determine experimentally a universal parameter for their strength that is simply based on the size of the interacting contact surfaces. Toward this goal we designed a new cyclophane based on terrylene bisimide (TBI) &#960;&#8208;walls connected by para&#8208;xylylene spacer units. With its extended &#960;&#8208;surface this cyclophane proved to be an excellent and universal host for the complexation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guests, including small and large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as dye molecules. The observed binding constants range up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1 and show a linear dependence on the 2D area size of the guest molecules. This correlation can be used for the prediction of binding constants and for the design of new host&#8211;guest systems based on the herewith derived universal Gibbs interaction energy parameter of 0.31&#8197;kJ/mol&#197;2 in chloroform.

         <title>Pt&#8208;Decorated Gold Nanoflares for High&#8208;Fidelity Phototheranostics: Reducing Side&#8208;Effects and Enhancing Cytotoxicity toward Target Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, photodynamic nanoflares constructed on Pt&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (Au@Pt PDNF) were communicated to avoid false&#8208;positive therapeutic signals caused by intracellular biothiol. Compared to conventional nanoflares, the Au@Pt PDNF exhibited high&#8208;fidelity theranostics while reducing side&#8208;effects. Furthermore, the Pt&#8208;shell was confirmed to generate oxygen which relieved hypoxia&#8208;related photodynamic resistance and enhanced the antitumor effect.







Abstract
Functionalized with the Au&#8722;S bond, gold nanoflares have emerged as promising candidates for theranostics. However, the presence of intracellular abundantly biothiols compromises the conventional Au&#8722;S bond, leading to the unintended release of cargoes and associated side&#8208;effects on non&#8208;target cells. Additionally, the hypoxic microenvironment in diseased regions limits treatment efficacy, especially in photodynamic therapy. To address these challenges, high&#8208;fidelity photodynamic nanoflares constructed on Pt&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (Au@Pt PDNF) were communicated to avoid false&#8208;positive therapeutic signals and side&#8208;effects caused by biothiol perturbation. Compared with conventional photodynamic gold nanoflares (AuNP PDNF), the Au@Pt PDNF were selectively activated by cancer biomarkers and exhibited high&#8208;fidelity phototheranostics while reducing side&#8208;effects. Furthermore, the ultrathin Pt&#8208;shell catalysis was confirmed to generate oxygen which alleviated hypoxia&#8208;related photodynamic resistance and enhanced the antitumor effect. This design might open a new venue to advance theranostics performance and is adaptable to other theranostic nanomaterials by simply adding a Pt shell.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Induced Formation of Surface Acid Sites on Pt/Al(PO3)3 Enables Remarkably Efficient Hydrogenolysis of C&#8722;O Bonds in Alcohols and Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum metaphosphate&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles have been developed for the hydrogenolysis of a wide range of alcohols and ethers under exceptionally mild conditions (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;atm of H2, as low as 70&#8201;&#176;C). The key for the high performance of the catalyst is H2&#8208;induced formation of surface Br&#248;nsted acid sites, which efficiently activate C&#8722;O bonds in alcohols and ethers.







Abstract
The hydrogenolysis of oxygenates such as alcohols and ethers is central to the biomass valorization and also a valuable transformation in organic synthesis. However, a mild and efficient catalyst system for the hydrogenolysis of a large variety of alcohols and ethers with various functional groups is still underdeveloped. Here, we report an aluminum metaphosphate&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/Al(PO3)3) for the hydrogenolysis of a wide variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl and benzylic alcohols, and dialkyl, aryl alkyl, and diaryl ethers, including biomass&#8208;derived furanic compounds, under mild conditions (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;atm of H2, as low as 70&#8201;&#176;C). Mechanistic studies suggested that H2 induces formation of the surface Br&#248;nsted acid sites via its cleavage by supported Pt nanoparticles. Accordingly, the high efficiency and the wide applicability of the catalyst system are attributed to the activation and cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds by the hydrogen&#8208;induced Br&#248;nsted acid sites with the assistance of Lewis acidic Al sites on the catalyst surface. The high efficiency of the catalyst implies its potential application in energy&#8208;efficient biomass valorization or fine chemical synthesis.

         <dc:description>
Selenium&#8211;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry creates seleno&#8208;connecting linkage to efficiently explore the organo&#8208;Se chemical world. In their Research Article (e202318534), Wei Hou, Hongtao Xu et&#8197;al. put forward the concept of SeNEx chemistry based on the excellent performance of the reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Tolerance Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium batteries employing Li or silicon (Si) anodes hold promise for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their cycling behavior encounters rapid capacity degradation due to the vulnerability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). Though anion&#8208;derived SEIs mitigate this degradation, the unavoidable reduction of solvents introduces heterogeneity to SEIs, leading to fractures during cycling. Here, we elucidate how the reductive stability of solvents, dominated by the electrophilicity (EPT) and coordination ability (CDA), delineates the SEI formed on Li or Si anodes. Solvents exhibiting lower EPT and CDA demonstrate enhanced tolerance to reduction, resulting in inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs with homogeneity. Guided by these criteria, we synthesized three promising solvents tailored for Li or Si anodes. The decomposition of these solvents is dictated by their EPTs under similar solvation structures, imparting distinct characteristics to SEIs and impacting battery performance. The optimized electrolyte, 1 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in N&#8208;Pyrrolidine&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFSPY), achieves 600 cycles of Si anodes with a capacity retention of 81% (1910 mAh g&#8208;1). In anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) pouch cells, this electrolyte sustains over 100 cycles with an 82% capacity retention. These findings illustrate that reducing solvent decomposition benefits SEI formation, offering valuable insights for the designing electrolytes in high&#8208;energy lithium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock: A Rebuilding&#8208;free Electrochemical Chip with a Customizable Decoding Probe for Real&#8208;Time and Portable Pathogen Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to realize portable pathogen diagnostics with easier quantitation, digitization and integration, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use electrochemical sensing strategy (Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock) for real&#8208;time detection of isothermal nucleic acid amplification. Bridged by a branch DNA as codelock, the isothermal amplicon is transduced into increased current of an electrochemical probe, holding multiple advantages of high sensitivity, high selectivity, signal&#8208;on response, &#8220;zero&#8221; background and one&#8208;pot operation. Through a self&#8208;designed portable instrument (BioAlex PHE&#8208;T), the detection can implement on a multichannel microchip and output real&#8208;time amplification curves just like an expensive commercial PCR machine. The microchip is a rebuilding&#8208;free and disposable component. The branch codelock probe can be customized for different targets and designs. Such high performance and flexibility have been demonstrated utilizing four virus (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, African swine fever, Flu A and Flu B) genes as targets, and two branch (3&#8208;way and 4&#8208;way) DNAs as codelock probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Enhancement of Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Entropically Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Addressing the dual enhancement of circular polarization (glum) and luminescence quantum yield (QY) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) systems poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present an innovative strategy utilizing the entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes (L&#8208;Pt) with tetraethylene glycol chains, resulting in unique temperature dependencies. The entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;Pt leads to a synergistic improvement in phosphorescence emission efficiency (QY was amplified from 15% at 25 &#176;C to 53% at 60 &#176;C) and chirality, both in the ground state and the excited state (glum value has been magnified from 0.04 &#215; 10&#8208;2 to 0.06) with increasing temperature. Notably, we observed reversible modulation of phosphorescence and chirality observed over at least 10 cycles through successive heating and cooling, highlighting the intelligent control of luminescence and chiroptical properties by regulating intermolecular interactions among neighboring L&#8208;Pt molecules. Importantly, the QY and glum of the L&#8208;Pt assembly in solid state were measured as 69% and 0.16 respectively, representing relatively high values compared to most self&#8208;assembled CPL systems. This study marks the pioneering demonstration of dual thermo&#8208;enhancement of phosphorescence and CPL and provides valuable insights into the thermal effects on high&#8208;temperature and switchable CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Carborane Clusters into Crystalline Frameworks via Thiol&#8208;yne Click Chemistry for Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline frameworks represent a cutting&#8208;edge frontier in material science, and recently, there has been a surge of interest&#160;in energetic crystalline frameworks. However, the well&#8208;established porosity often leads to diminished output energy, necessitating a novel approach for performance enhancement. Thiol&#8208;yne coupling, a versatile metal&#8208;free click reaction, has been underutilized in crystalline frameworks. As a proof of concept, we herein demonstrate the potential of this approach by introducing the energy&#8208;rich, size&#8208;matched, and reductive 1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaborane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol (CB&#8208;SH) into an acetylene&#8208;functionalized framework, Zn(AIm)2,via thiol&#8208;yne click reaction. This innovative decoration strategy resulted in a remarkable 46.6% increase in energy density, a six&#8208;fold reduction in ignition delay time (4 ms) with red fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer, and impressive enhancement of stability. Density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanism by which CB&#8208;SH promotes hypergolic ignition. The thiol&#8208;yne click modification strategy presented here permits engineering of crystalline frameworks for the design of advanced energetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Boundary&#8208;Rich Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts with Manganese(II)&#8208;Coordinated Active Environment for Selective Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;supported manganese&#8208;centered boundary&#8208;rich electrocatalysts show high activity for selective H2O2 synthesis. The secondary epoxide and hydroxyl groups surrounding Mn&#8722;N3&#8722;O sites and the O2 enrichment in the curved boundaries together contribute to the activity enhancement for the targeted electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Coordinated manganese (Mn) electrocatalysts owing to their electronic structure flexibility, non&#8208;toxic and earth abundant features are promising for electrocatalytic reactions. However, achieving selective hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production through two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8208;ORR) is a challenge on Mn&#8208;centered catalysts. Targeting this goal, we report on the creation of a secondary Mn(II)&#8208;coordinated active environment with reactant enrichment effect on boundary&#8208;rich porous carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts, which facilitates the selective and rapid synthesis of H2O2 through 2e&#8208;ORR. The catalysts exhibit nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and H2O2 productivity up to 15.1&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, representing the record high activity for Mn&#8208;based electrocatalyst in H2O2 electrosynthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that the epoxide and hydroxyl groups surrounding Mn(II) centers improve spin state by modifying electronic properties and charge transfer, thus tailoring the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate. Multiscale simulations reveal that the high&#8208;curvature boundaries facilitate oxygen (O2) adsorption and result in local O2 enrichment due to the enhanced interaction between carbon surface and O2. These merits together ensure the efficient formation of H2O2 with high local concentration, which can directly boost the tandem reaction of hydrolysis of benzonitrile to benzamide with nearly 100&#8201;% conversion rate and exclusive benzamide selectivity.

         <title>pKa as a Predictive Descriptor for Electrochemical Anion Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using detailed experiments on a single&#8208;crystal electrode, we find that the adsorption strength of a series of carboxylate anions to a metal is linearly corelated with their acid dissociation constant (pKa). Density functional theory shows that this correlation is dictated by the difference in their electron affinity&#8212;how easily the anion can give up its electron upon adsorption determines its adsorption strength.







Abstract
The adsorption of anions onto metal surfaces is important in many applications including effective (electro)catalyst design, metal surface modification, and contaminant removal in wastewater treatment. In electrocatalysis, anions can be both reactive intermediates or site&#8208;blocking spectators, where their adsorption strength therefore dictates the rate of reaction. In this work, we have measured the adsorption energy of a series of carboxylic acids on a Pt (111) single&#8208;crystal electrode surface from aqueous solution. We find that the adsorption strength of the carboxylate anion is linearly correlated with its acid&#8208;dissociation constant (pKa) and therefore the heterolytic O&#8722;H bond dissociation strength in solution. Using density functional theory modeling, we split the anion adsorption energy into a sum of the adsorption energy and electron affinity of a neutral (carboxyl) radical. Surprisingly, the adsorption energy of the carboxyl radicals are similar and therefore the large difference in electron affinity is what dictates anion adsorption strength; the greater the cost in energy to remove the electron from the anion upon adsorption, the weaker its binding. Therefore, at least within a class of anions with similar structure and surface binding atoms, both electron affinity and acidity are predictive descriptors of adsorption strength.

         <title>Tuning the Absorption, Fluorescence, Intramolecular Charge Transfer, and Intersystem Crossing in Spiro[fluorene]acridinone</title>

The rational design and photophysical investigation of donor&#8208;acceptor dyads based on spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,7&#8217;&#8208;dibenzo[c,h]acridine]&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;one uncover the complex interplay among different light&#8208;driven pathways, including intramolecular charge transfer, fluorescence, and intersystem crossing. This investigation offers important guidance for designing novel functional materials for triplet sensitizers and fluorescent sensors.







Abstract
In this work, we prepared a series of electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems based on spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,7&#8217;&#8208;dibenzo[c,h]acridine]&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;one (SFDBAO). Our SFDBAOs consist of orthogonally positioned fluorenes and aromatic ketones. By fine&#8208;tuning the substitution of electron&#8208;donating pyrenes, the complex interplay among different excited&#8208;state decay channels and the overall impact of solvents on these decay channels were uncovered. Placing pyrene, for example, at the aromatic ketones resulted in a profound solvatochromism in the form of a bright charge&#8208;transfer (CT) emission spanning from yellow to red&#8208;NIR. In contrast, a dark non&#8208;emissive CT was noted upon pyrene substitution at the fluorenes. In apolar solvents, efficient triplet&#8208;excited state generation was observed for all SFDBAOs. Either charge transfer was concluded to mediate the intersystem crossing (ISC) in the case of pyrene substitution or the El&#8208;Sayed rule was applicable when lacking pyrene substitution as in the case of SFABAO. In polar solvents, charge separation is the sole decay upon pyrene substitution. Moreover, competition between ISC and CT lowered the triplet&#8208;excited state generation in SFDBAO.

         <title>Reversible Radical Addition Guides Selective Photocatalytic Intermolecular Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Ene Molecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photoredox three&#8208;component coupling of thiols with readily available alkynes and alkenes has been developed. The reaction mechanism was evaluated by combining ESI&#8208;HRMS, EPR spectroscopy, isotope labeling and control experiments. The applicability of the reversible radical addition approach for intermolecular reactions and the key role of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in stereoselectivity control have been shown by DFT studies.







Abstract
In modern organic chemistry, harnessing the power of multicomponent radical reactions presents both significant challenges and extraordinary potential. This article delves into this scientific frontier by addressing the critical issue of controlling selectivity in such complex processes. We introduce a novel approach that revolves around the reversible addition of thiyl radicals to multiple bonds, reshaping the landscape of multicomponent radical reactions. The key to selectivity lies in the intricate interplay between reversibility and the energy landscapes governing C&#8722;C bond formation in thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reactions. The developed approach not only allows to prioritize the thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene cascade, dominating over alternative reactions, but also extends the scope of coupling products obtained from alkenes and alkynes of various structures and electron density distributions, regardless of their relative polarity difference, opening doors to more versatile synthetic possibilities. In the present study, we provide a powerful tool for atom&#8208;economical C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bond formation, paving the way for the efficient synthesis of complex molecules. Carrying out our experimental and computational studies, we elucidated the fundamental mechanisms underlying radical cascades, a knowledge that can be broadly applied in the field of organic chemistry.

         <title>Amphiphilic Covalent Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Pickering Emulsion Catalysis with Size Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles constructed with highly hydrophobic monomers as linkers were demonstrated to show a superior amphiphilicity for the formation of stable Pickering emulsions. Because of the high surface areas and tunable pore diameters of COFs, Pickering emulsion catalysis with both a high reaction efficiency and a remarkable size selectivity was achieved.







Abstract
Exploiting advanced amphiphilic solid catalysts is crucial to the development of Pickering emulsion catalysis. Herein, covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles constructed with highly hydrophobic monomers as linkers were found to show superior amphiphilicity and they were then developed as a new class of solid emulsifiers for Pickering emulsion catalysis. Employing amphiphilic COFs as solid emulsifiers, Pickering emulsions with controllable emulsion type and droplet sizes were obtained. COF materials have also been demonstrated to serve as porous surface coatings to replace traditional surface modifications for stabilizing Pickering emulsions. After implanting Pd nanoparticles into amphiphilic COFs, the obtained catalyst displayed a 3.9&#8197;times higher catalytic efficiency than traditional amphiphilic solid catalysts with surface modifications in the biphasic oxidation reaction of alcohols. Such an enhanced activity was resulted from the high surface area and regular porous structure of COFs. More importantly, because of their tunable pore diameters, Pickering emulsion catalysis with remarkable size selectivity was achieved. This work is the first example that COFs were applied in Pickering emulsion catalysis, providing a platform for exploring new frontiers of Pickering emulsion catalysis.

         <title>Axial&#8211;Equatorial Halide Ordering in Layered Hybrid Perovskites from Isotropic&#8211;Anisotropic 207Pb NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodide preferentially occupies the axial sites in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 2D perovskites. This results in a larger, more negative, 207Pb chemical shift anisotropy that can be distinguished in the isotropic&#8211;anisotropic 207Pb NMR correlation spectra.







Abstract
Bandgap&#8208;tuneable mixed&#8208;halide 3D perovskites are of interest for multi&#8208;junction solar cells, but suffer from photoinduced spatial halide segregation. Mixed&#8208;halide 2D perovskites are more resistant to halide segregation and are promising coatings for 3D perovskite solar cells. The properties of mixed&#8208;halide compositions depend on the local halide distribution, which is challenging to study at the level of single octahedra. In particular, it has been suggested that there is a preference for occupation of the distinct axial and equatorial halide sites in mixed&#8208;halide 2D perovskites. 207Pb NMR can be used to probe the atomic&#8208;scale structure of lead&#8208;halide materials, but although the isotropic 207Pb shift is sensitive to halide stoichiometry, it cannot distinguish configurational isomers. Here, we use 2D isotropic&#8211;anisotropic correlation 207Pb NMR and relativistic DFT calculations to distinguish the [PbX6] configurations in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 3D FAPb(Br1&#8722;xIx)3 perovskites and 2D BA2Pb(Br1&#8722;xIx)4 perovskites based on formamidinium (FA+) and butylammonium (BA+), respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Iodide preferentially occupies the axial sites in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 2D perovskites. This results in a larger, more negative, &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb chemical shift anisotropy that can be distinguished in the isotropic&#8211;anisotropic &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb NMR correlation spectra.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bandgap-tuneable mixed-halide 3D perovskites are of interest for multi-junction solar cells, but suffer from photoinduced spatial halide segregation. Mixed-halide 2D perovskites are more resistant to halide segregation and are promising coatings for 3D perovskite solar cells. The properties of mixed-halide compositions depend on the local halide distribution, which is challenging to study at the level of single octahedra. In particular, it has been suggested that there is a preference for occupation of the distinct axial and equatorial halide sites in mixed-halide 2D perovskites. &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb NMR can be used to probe the atomic-scale structure of lead-halide materials, but although the isotropic &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb shift is sensitive to halide stoichiometry, it cannot distinguish configurational isomers. Here, we use 2D isotropic&#8211;anisotropic correlation &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb NMR and relativistic DFT calculations to distinguish the [PbX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] configurations in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 3D FAPb(Br&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskites and 2D BA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(Br&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; perovskites based on formamidinium (FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and butylammonium (BA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Additive Enables High Moisture Tolerance and Favorable Electric Double Layer for Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;salt additive&#8208;reinforced carbonate electrolyte (LTFAN) is proposed for stabilizing high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The in situ generated nitrogenous and fluoride&#8208;rich electrode electrolyte interphase with LTFAN vastly accelerates the interfacial reaction dynamics, and dual&#8208;salt additive notably strengthens the moisture tolerance. A thermodynamically favorable electric double layer at charged cathode interface is constructed.







Abstract
The carbonate electrolyte chemistry is a primary determinant for the development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, their implementation is greatly plagued by sluggish electrode interfacial dynamics and insufficient electrolyte thermodynamic stability. Herein, lithium trifluoroacetate&#8208;lithium nitrate (LiTFA&#8722;LiNO3) dual&#8208;salt additive&#8208;reinforced carbonate electrolyte (LTFAN) is proposed for stabilizing high&#8208;voltage LMBs. We reveal that 1) the in situ generated inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (EEI) enables rapid interfacial dynamics, 2) TFA&#8722; preferentially interacts with moisture over PF6&#8722; to strengthen the moisture tolerance of designed electrolyte, and 3) NO3&#8722; is found to be noticeably enriched at the cathode interface on charging, thus constructing Li+&#8208;enriched, solvent&#8208;coordinated, thermodynamically favorable electric double layer (EDL). The superior moisture tolerance of LTFAN and the thermodynamically stable EDL constructed at cathode interface play a decisive role in upgrading the compatibility of carbonate electrolyte with high&#8208;voltage cathode. The LMBs with LTFAN realize 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;NCM523/4.4&#8197;V&#8208;NCM622 superior cycling reversibility and excellent rate capability, which is the leading level of documented records for carbonate electrode.

         <title>Diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine (DPPH) Affords Late&#8208;Stage S&#8208;imination to access free&#8208;NH Sulfilimines and Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free, and high&#8208;yielding sulfur&#8208;imination using O&#8208;(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine to access sulfilimine salts and free&#8208;NH sulfoximines has been reported. Its generality was evidenced using a broad substrate scope along with late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex, biologically relevant substrates including a notorious amatoxin. DPPH was also shown to iminate sulfoxides with high yields under Rh catalysis to afford sulfoximines.







Abstract
Sulfilimines, as potential aza&#8208;isosteres of sulfoxides, are valued as building blocks, auxiliaries, ligands, bioconjugation handles, and as precursors to versatile S(VI) scaffolds including sulfoximines and sulfondiimines. Here, we report a thioether imination methodology that exploits O&#8208;(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine (DPPH). Under mild, metal&#8208;free, and biomolecule&#8208;compatible conditions, DPPH enables late&#8208;stage S&#8208;imination on peptides, natural products, and a clinically trialled drug, and shows both excellent chemoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. This methodological report is extended to an efficient and high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot reaction for accessing free&#8208;NH sulfoximines with diverse substrates including ones of potential clinical importance. In the presence of a rhodium catalyst, sulfoxides are S&#8208;iminated in higher yields to afford free&#8208;NH sulfoximines. S&#8208;imination was validated on an oxidatively delicate amatoxin to give sulfilimine and sulfoximine congeners. Interestingly, these new sulfilimine and sulfoximine&#8208;amatoxins show cytotoxicity. This method is further extended to create sulfilimine and sulfoximine&#8208;Fulvestrant and buthionine analogues.

         <title>Surface Reconstruction on Metal Nitride during Photo&#8208;oxidation</title>

Photo&#8208;induced surface reconstruction of Co3Mo3N forming amorphous Mo&#8208;rich@Co&#8208;rich bilayer structure leads to a shortened Co&#8722;Mo bond length resulting in improved performance for both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (PHER) and photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (POER) compared to pure Co3Mo3N.







Abstract
The efficient conversion and storage of solar energy for chemical fuel production presents a challenge in sustainable energy technologies. Metal nitrides (MNs) possess unique structures that make them multi&#8208;functional catalysts for water splitting. However, the thermodynamic instability of MNs often results in the formation of surface oxide layers and ambiguous reaction mechanisms. Herein, we present on the photo&#8208;induced reconstruction of a Mo&#8208;rich@Co&#8208;rich bi&#8208;layer on ternary cobalt&#8208;molybdenum nitride (Co3Mo3N) surfaces, resulting in improved effectiveness for solar water splitting. During a photo&#8208;oxidation process, the uniform initial surface oxide layer is reconstructed into an amorphous Co&#8208;rich oxide surface layer and a subsurface Mo&#8722;N layer. The Co&#8208;rich outer layer provides active sites for photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (POER), while the Mo&#8208;rich sublayer promotes charge transfer and enhances the oxidation resistance of Co3Mo3N. Additionally, the surface reconstruction yields a shortened Co&#8722;Mo bond length, weakening the adsorption of hydrogen and resulting in improved performance for both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (PHER) and POER. This work provides insight into the surface structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationships of MNs in solar energy conversion, and is expected to have significant implications for the design of metal nitride&#8208;based catalysts in sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Sulfonyl Molecules Induced Oriented Lithium Deposition for Long&#8208;Term Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During Li+ desolvation, the electrochemical binding ability of TSOH regulates Li+ plating morphology along the (110) crystal surface toward dendrite&#8208;free Li anode. The electron&#8208;rich structure brings lower reduction potential energy and inhibits decomposition of Li salts. Even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, a &#8216;smooth and dense&#8217; SEI is formed, significantly reducing interface transmission resistance of Li+ ions.







Abstract
Dendrites growth and unstable interfacial Li+ transport hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we report an active layer of 2,4,6&#8211;trihydroxy benzene sulfonyl fluorine on copper substrate that induces oriented Li+ deposition and generates highly crystalline solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to achieve high&#8208;performance LMBs. The lithiophilic &#8722;SO2&#8722; groups of highly crystalline SEI accept the rapidly transported Li+ ions and form a dense inner layer of LiF and Li3N, which regulate Li+ plating morphology along the (110) crystal surface toward dendrite&#8208;free Li anode. Thus, Li||Cu cells with lithiophilic SEI achieve an average deposition efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% after 700&#8197;cycles, and Li||Li cells operate well for 1100&#8197;h. Besides, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells with modified SEI exhibit a capacity retention that is 14&#8197;times than that of conventional SEI. Even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, Li||Cu cells reach stable deposition efficiency of 83.2&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

The electron-rich structure brings lower reduction potential energy and inhibits decomposition of Li salts. Even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, a &#8216;smooth and dense&#8217; SEI is formed, significantly reducing interface transmission resistance of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dendrites growth and unstable interfacial Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we report an active layer of 2,4,6&#8211;trihydroxy benzene sulfonyl fluorine on copper substrate that induces oriented Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition and generates highly crystalline solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) to achieve high-performance LMBs. The lithiophilic &#8722;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups of highly crystalline SEI accept the rapidly transported Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and form a dense inner layer of LiF and Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N, which regulate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; plating morphology along the (110) crystal surface toward dendrite-free Li anode. Thus, Li||Cu cells with lithiophilic SEI achieve an average deposition efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% after 700&#8197;cycles, and Li||Li cells operate well for 1100&#8197;h. Besides, Li||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells with modified SEI exhibit a capacity retention that is 14&#8197;times than that of conventional SEI. Even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, Li||Cu cells reach stable deposition efficiency of 83.2&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
In dinitrogen (N2) fixation chemistry, bimetallic end&#8208;on bridging N2 complexes M(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)M can split N2 into terminal nitrides and hence attract great attention. To date, only 4d and 5d transition complexes, but none of 3d counterparts, could realize such a transformation. Likewise, complexes {[Cp*Cr(dmpe)]2(&#956;&#8208;N2)}0/1+/2+ (1&#8211;3) are incapable to cleave N2, in contrast to their Mo congeners. Remarkably, cross this series the N&#8722;N bond length of the N2 ligand and the N&#8722;N stretching frequency exhibit unprecedented nonmonotonic variations, and complexes 1 and 2 in both solid and solution states display rare thermally activated ligand&#8208;mediated two&#8208;center spin transitions, distinct from discrete dinuclear spin crossovers. In&#8208;depth analyses using wave function based ab initio calculations reveal that the Cr&#8208;N2&#8208;Cr bonding in complexes&#8197;1&#8211;3 is distinguished by strong multireference character and cannot be described by solely one electron configuration or Lewis structure, and that all intriguing spectroscopic observations originate in their sophisticate multireference electronic structures. More critical is that such multireference bonding of complexes&#8197;1&#8211;3 is at least a key factor that contributes to their kinetic inertness toward N2 splitting. The mechanistic understanding is then used to rationalize the disparate reactivity of related 3d M(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)M complexes compared to their 4d and 5d analogs.

         <title>Characterization and Engineering of Two Highly Paralogous Sesquiterpene Synthases Reveal a Regioselective Reprotonation Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three critical active site residues [L311&#8208;S419&#8208;C458]/[M311&#8208;V419&#8208;A458] were identified as the switch of the regioselective C3/C6 reprotonation of germacrene A in sesquiterpene synthase catalysis through the characterization and engineering of two highly paralogous sesquiterpene synthases, AhCS and AhIS, using a combination of isotopic labeling experiments, cryo&#8208;electron microscopy, and structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis.







Abstract
Sesquiterpene synthases (STPSs) catalyze carbocation&#8208;driven cyclization reactions that can generate structurally diverse hydrocarbons. The deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation process is widely used in STPSs to promote structural diversity, largely attributable to the distinct regio/stereoselective reprotonations. However, the molecular basis for reprotonation regioselectivity remains largely understudied. Herein, we analyzed two highly paralogous STPSs, Artabotrys hexapetalus (&#8722;)&#8208;cyperene synthase (AhCS) and ishwarane synthase (AhIS), which catalyze reactions that are distinct from the regioselective protonation of germacrene A (GA), resulting in distinct skeletons of 5/5/6 tricyclic (&#8722;)&#8208;cyperene and 6/6/5/3 tetracyclic ishwarane, respectively. Isotopic labeling experiments demonstrated that these protonations occur at C3 and C6 of GA in AhCS and AhIS, respectively. The cryo&#8208;electron microscopy&#8208;derived AhCS complex structure provided the structural basis for identifying different key active site residues that may govern their functional disparity. The structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis of these residues resulted in successful functional interconversion between AhCS and AhIS, thus targeting the three active site residues [L311&#8208;S419&#8208;C458]/[M311&#8208;V419&#8208;A458] that may act as a C3/C6 reprotonation switch for GA. These findings facilitate the rational design or directed evolution of STPSs with structurally diverse skeletons.

         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of thioamides with alkynoate esters is presented. The reaction provides alkenylated products in high yields and selectivities that are primed for diverse downstream derivatizations.







Abstract
An enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of thioamides with but&#8208;2&#8208;ynoate ester coupling partners employing thioamide directing groups is presented. The method is operationally simple and requires only mild reaction conditions, while providing alkenylated products as single regioisomers in excellent yields (up to 85&#8201;%) and high enantiomeric excess [up to 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 enantiomeric ratio (er), or up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er after a single recrystallization]. Diverse downstream derivatizations of the products are demonstrated, delivering a range of enantioenriched constructs. Extensive computational studies using density functional theory provide insight into the detailed reaction mechanism, origin of enantiocontrol, and the unusual regioselectivity of the alkenylation reaction.

Via the synergistic union with mechanochemistry, four archetypal photocatalysis reactions have been realized under solvent&#8208;free or solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. The mechanophotocatalytic versions feature competitive or superior efficiencies to the solution&#8208;state reactions, while also showcasing an enhanced tolerance to aerobic conditions.







Abstract
This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study cements the viability and generality of mechanophotocatalysis, merging mechanochemistry and photocatalysis to enable solvent&#8208;minimized photocatalytic reactions. We demonstrate the transmutation of four archetypal solution&#8208;state photocatalysis reactions to a solvent&#8208;minimized environment driven by the combined actions of milling, light, and photocatalysts. The chlorosulfonylation of alkenes and the pinacol coupling of aldehydes and ketones were conducted under solvent&#8208;free conditions with competitive or superior efficiencies to their solution&#8208;state analogues. Furthermore, decarboxylative alkylations are shown to function efficiently under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions, while the photoinduced energy transfer promoted [2+2] cycloaddition of chalcone experiences a significant initial rate enhancement over its solution&#8208;state variant. This work serves as a platform for future discoveries in an underexplored field: validating that solvent&#8208;minimized photocatalysis is not only generalizable and competitive with solution&#8208;state photocatalysis, but can also offer valuable advantages.

         <title>A Single Set of Well&#8208;Designed Aptamer Probes for Reliable On&#8208;site Qualitative and Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Quantitative Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>

An aptasensor was developed with supersandwich DNA (SSW&#8208;DNA) modified on the outer surface of nanochannels with hydrophobic inner walls realizing the reliable on&#8208;site qualitative and laboratory ultra&#8208;sensitive quantitative detection of MC&#8211;LR. This work highlights the enhanced performance and broader applicability based on the well&#8208;designed single set of probes and nanochannels.







Abstract
Aptamer&#8208;based probes are pivotal components in various sensing strategies, owing to their exceptional specificity and versatile programmable structure. Nevertheless, numerous aptamer&#8208;based probes usually offer only a single function, limiting their capacity to meet the diverse requirements of multi&#8208;faceted sensing systems. Here, we introduced supersandwich DNA probes (SSW&#8208;DNA), designed and modified on the outer surface of nanochannels with hydrophobic inner walls, enabling dual functionality: qualitative detection for on&#8208;site analysis and quantitative detection for precise analysis. The fragmented DNAs resulting from the target recognition, are subsequently identified through lateral flow assays, enabling robust on&#8208;site qualitative detection of microcystin&#8208;LR with an impressively low limit of detection (LOD) at 0.01&#8197;&#956;g/L. Meanwhile, the nanochannels enable highly sensitive quantification of microcystin&#8208;LR through the current analysis, achieving an exceptionally low LOD at 2.5&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;&#956;g/L, with a broad dynamic range spanning from 1&#215;10&#8722;6 to 1&#215;102&#8197;&#956;g/L. Furthermore, the process of target recognition introduces just a single potential error propagation, which reduces the overall risk of errors during the entire qualitative and quantitative detection process. This sensing strategy broadens the scope of applications for aptamer&#8208;based composite probes, holding promising implications across diverse fields, such as medical diagnosis, food safety, and environmental protection.

         <title>Multivariate Machine Learning Models of Nanoscale Porosity from Ultrafast NMR Relaxometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning allows rapid classification and prediction of the surface area (SA) of nanoporous materials through NMR relaxometry measurements of solvent imbibed in the porous network. Here, principal component analysis (PCA) screens &#8220;high&#8221; and &#8220;low&#8221; SA materials, and partial least squares (PLS) provides numerical estimates of SA. This non&#8208;destructive technique can be used to help develop new materials with optimized porosity.







Abstract
Nanoporous materials are of great interest in many applications, such as catalysis, separation, and energy storage. The performance of these materials is closely related to their pore sizes, which are inefficient to determine through the conventional measurement of gas adsorption isotherms. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry has emerged as a technique highly sensitive to porosity in such materials. Nonetheless, streamlined methods to estimate pore size from NMR relaxometry remain elusive. Previous attempts have been hindered by inverting a time domain signal to relaxation rate distribution, and dealing with resulting parameters that vary in number, location, and magnitude. Here we invoke well&#8208;established machine learning techniques to directly correlate time domain signals to BET surface areas for a set of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) imbibed with solvent at varied concentrations. We employ this series of MOFs to establish a correlation between NMR signal and surface area via partial least squares (PLS), following screening with principal component analysis, and apply the PLS model to predict surface area of various nanoporous materials. This approach offers a high&#8208;throughput, non&#8208;destructive way to assess porosity in c.a. one minute. We anticipate this work will contribute to the development of new materials with optimized pore sizes for various applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Detection of BODIPY&#8208;, Biotin&#8208;, and 19F&#8208; Labeled Single&#8208;Entity Dendritic Heparan Sulfate Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Labeled single&#8208;entity heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized to investigate their cellular distribution, involvement with the immune system, and biodistribution. A fluorescently labeled HS mimetic was observed in the brain of mice and was shown to preferentially associate with immune cells from the tumor site rather than from the spleen. The compounds reported represent a new tool box helping to unravel the mechanism of action of HS mimetics.







Abstract
Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) are naturally occurring mammalian glycosaminoglycans, and their synthetic and semi&#8208;synthetic mimetics have attracted significant interest as potential therapeutics. However, understanding the mechanism of action by which HS, heparin, and HS mimetics have a biological effect is difficult due to their highly charged nature, broad protein interactomes, and variable structures. To address this, a library of novel single&#8208;entity dendritic mimetics conjugated to BODIPY, Fluorine&#8208;19 (19F), and biotin was synthesized for imaging and localization studies. The novel dendritic scaffold allowed for the conjugation of labeling moieties without reducing the number of sulfated capping groups, thereby better mimicking the multivalent nature of HS&#8208;protein interactions. The 19F labeled mimetics were assessed in phantom studies and were detected at concentrations as low as 5&#8197;mM. Flow cytometric studies using a fluorescently labeled mimetic showed that the compound associated with immune cells from tumors more readily than splenic counterparts and was directed to endosomal&#8208;lysosomal compartments within immune cells and cancer cells. Furthermore, the fluorescently labeled mimetic entered the central nervous system and was detectable in brain&#8208;infiltrating immune cells 24&#8197;hours after treatment. Here, we report the enabling methodology for rapidly preparing various labeled HS mimetics and molecular probes with diverse potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Nanoscale Visualization of Lithium Plating/Stripping Tuned by On&#8208;site Formed Solid Electrolyte Interphase in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ methods of atomic force microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and optical microscopy, we visualized the processes of Li plating, stripping and replating tuned by the on&#8208;site formed SEI at the argyrodite solid&#8208;electrolyte/Li anode interface in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Our work provides insights into correlations between the interfacial evolution and cell performance, contributing to the improvement of solid&#8208;state energy devices.







Abstract
The interfacial processes, mainly the lithium (Li) plating/stripping and the evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), are directly related to the performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries (ASSLBs). However, the complex processes at solid&#8208;solid interfaces are embedded under the solid&#8208;state electrolyte, making it challenging to analyze the dynamic processes in real time. Here, using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy, we directly visualized the Li plating/stripping/replating behavior, and measured the morphological and mechanical properties of the on&#8208;site formed SEI at nanoscale. Li spheres plating/stripping/replating at the argyrodite solid electrolyte (Li6PS5Cl)/Li electrode interface is coupled with the formation/wrinkling/inflating of the SEI on its surface. Combined with in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, details of the stepwise formation and physicochemical properties of SEI on the Li spheres are obtained. It is shown that higher operation rates can decrease the uniformity of the Li+&#8208;conducting networks in the SEI and worsen Li plating/stripping reversibility. By regulating the applied current rates, uniform nucleation and reversible plating/stripping processes can be achieved, leading to the extension of the cycling life. The in situ analysis of the on&#8208;site formed SEI at solid&#8208;solid interfaces provides the correlation between the interfacial evolution and the electrochemical performance in ASSLBs.

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; methods of atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and optical microscopy, we visualized the processes of Li plating, stripping and replating tuned by the on-site formed SEI at the argyrodite solid-electrolyte/Li anode interface in all-solid-state Li-metal batteries. Our work provides insights into correlations between the interfacial evolution and cell performance, contributing to the improvement of solid-state energy devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interfacial processes, mainly the lithium (Li) plating/stripping and the evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), are directly related to the performance of all-solid-state Li-metal batteries (ASSLBs). However, the complex processes at solid-solid interfaces are embedded under the solid-state electrolyte, making it challenging to analyze the dynamic processes in real time. Here, using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; electrochemical atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy, we directly visualized the Li plating/stripping/replating behavior, and measured the morphological and mechanical properties of the on-site formed SEI at nanoscale. Li spheres plating/stripping/replating at the argyrodite solid electrolyte (Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl)/Li electrode interface is coupled with the formation/wrinkling/inflating of the SEI on its surface. Combined with &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, details of the stepwise formation and physicochemical properties of SEI on the Li spheres are obtained. It is shown that higher operation rates can decrease the uniformity of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conducting networks in the SEI and worsen Li plating/stripping reversibility. By regulating the applied current rates, uniform nucleation and reversible plating/stripping processes can be achieved, leading to the extension of the cycling life. The &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; analysis of the on-site formed SEI at solid-solid interfaces provides the correlation between the interfacial evolution and the electrochemical performance in ASSLBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Programmable DNA motors with tunable properties. The 0&#8201;% GC is the fastest motor and can detect and stall in the presence of single oligonucleotides.







Abstract
DNA motors that consume chemical energy to generate processive mechanical motion mimic natural motor proteins and have garnered interest due to their potential applications in dynamic nanotechnology, biosensing, and drug delivery. Such motors translocate by a catalytic cycle of binding, cleavage, and rebinding between DNA &#8220;legs&#8221; on the motor body and RNA &#8220;footholds&#8221; on a track. Herein, we address the well&#8208;documented trade&#8208;off between motor speed and processivity and investigate how these parameters are controlled by the affinity between DNA legs and their complementary footholds. Specifically, we explore the role of DNA leg length and GC content in tuning motor performance by dictating the rate of leg&#8208;foothold dissociation. Our investigations reveal that motors with 0&#8201;% GC content exhibit increased instantaneous velocities of up to 150&#8197;nm/sec, three&#8208;fold greater than previously reported DNA motors and comparable to the speeds of biological motor proteins. We also demonstrate that the faster speed and weaker forces generated by 0&#8201;% GC motors can be leveraged for enhanced capabilities in sensing. We observe single&#8208;molecule sensitivity when programming the motors to stall in response to the binding of nucleic acid targets. These findings offer insights for the design of high&#8208;performance DNA motors with promising real&#8208;world biosensing applications.

         <title>Conditional Cooperativity in RAS Assembly Pathways on Nanodiscs and Altered GTPase Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size&#8208;tunable nanodisc platforms and NMR revealed the structural mechanism for the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of both wild&#8208;type and oncogenic mutants of native, fully processed KRAS on the membrane. The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition of the membrane. Higher&#8208;order oligomers retain higher numbers of active GTP&#8208;bound protomers by reducing GTP hydrolysis and increasing GDP/GTP exchange.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assemblies (i.e., nanoclusters) of the RAS GTPase on the membrane act as scaffolds that activate downstream RAF kinases and drive MAPK signaling for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanistic details of nanoclustering remain largely unknown. Here, size&#8208;tunable nanodisc platforms and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) analyses revealed the structural basis of the cooperative assembly processes of fully processed KRAS, mutated in a quarter of human cancers. The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition of the membrane. Notably, the oncogenic mutants assemble in nonsequential pathways with two mutually cooperative &#8216;&#945;/&#945;&#8217; and &#8216;&#945;/&#946;&#8217; interfaces, while &#945;/&#945; dimerization of wild&#8208;type KRAS promotes the secondary &#945;/&#946; interaction sequentially. Mutation&#8208;based interface engineering was used to selectively trap the oligomeric intermediates of KRAS and probe their favorable interface interactions. Transiently exposed interfaces were available for the assembly. Real&#8208;time NMR demonstrated that higher&#8208;order oligomers retain higher numbers of active GTP&#8208;bound protomers in KRAS GTPase cycling. These data provide a deeper understanding of the nanocluster&#8208;enhanced signaling in response to the environment. Furthermore, our methodology is applicable to assemblies of many other membrane GTPases and lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based formulations of stable protein oligomers with enhanced cooperativity.

         <title>Molecular and Structural Basis for C&#947;&#8722;C Bond Formation by PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Fub7</title>

Fub7, a pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzyme, catalyzes stereoselective and substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective C&#947;&#8722;C bond formations. Now a structural and enzymological study have elucidated the structural and molecular underpinnings of its catalytic specificity and selectivity, paving the way for harnessing its activity in the synthesis of cyclic noncanonical amino acids.







Abstract
Pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze &#947;&#8208;replacement reactions are prevalent, yet their utilization of carbon nucleophile substrates is rare. The recent discovery of two PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes, CndF and Fub7, has unveiled unique C&#8722;C bond forming capabilities, enabling the biocatalytic synthesis of alkyl&#8208; substituted pipecolic acids from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine and &#946;&#8208;keto acid or aldehyde derived enolates. This breakthrough presents fresh avenues for the biosynthesis of pipecolic acid derivatives. However, the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes remain elusive, and a dearth of structural information hampers their extensive application. Here, we have broadened the catalytic scope of Fub7 by employing ketone&#8208;derived enolates as carbon nucleophiles, revealing Fub7&#8217;s capacity for substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of unsymmetrical ketones. Through an integrated approach combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopy, mutagenesis, and computational docking studies, we offer a detailed mechanistic insight into Fub7 catalysis. Our findings elucidate the structural basis for its substrate specificity, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity. Our work sets the stage ready for subsequent protein engineering effort aimed at expanding the synthetic utility of Fub7, potentially unlocking novel methods to access a broader array of noncanonical amino acids.

         <title>The Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride as the Reinforcing Phase of Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>

A powdery h&#8208;BN with a micron&#8208;sized three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure was developed with a facile NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted approach based on reduced reaction temperature. It exhibited superior advantages in improving the electrochemical performance of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes compared with the commercial two&#8208;dimensional (2D) h&#8208;BN.







Abstract
Powdery hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), as an important material for electrochemical energy storage, has been typically synthesized in bulk and one/two&#8208;dimensional (1/2D) nanostructured morphologies. However, until now, no method has been developed to synthesize powdery three&#8208;dimensional (3D) h&#8208;BN. This work introduces a novel NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize micron&#8208;sized 3D h&#8208;BN with a honeycomb&#8208;like structure and its proposed formation mechanism. We propose that NaCl acts as the template of 3D structure and promotes the nitridation reaction by adsorbing NH3. Glucose facilitates the homogeneous coating of boric acid onto the NaCl surface via functionalizing the NaCl surface. During the nitridation reaction, boron oxides (BO4 and BO3) form from a dehydration reaction of boric acid, which is then reduced to O2&#8208;B&#8208;N and O&#8208;B&#8208;N2 intermediates before finally being reduced to BN3 by NH3. When incorporated into polyethylene oxide&#8208;based electrolytes for Li metal batteries, 5&#8197;wt&#8201;% of 3D h&#8208;BN significantly enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Consequently, this composite electrolyte demonstrates superior electrochemical stability. It delivers 300&#8197;h of stable cycles in the Li//Li cell at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and retains 89&#8201;% of discharge capacity (138.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) after 100 cycles at 1&#8197;C in the LFP//Li full cell.

During the nitridation reaction, boron oxides (BO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) form from a dehydration reaction of boric acid, which is then reduced to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-B-N and O-B-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates before finally being reduced to BN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. When incorporated into polyethylene oxide-based electrolytes for Li metal batteries, 5&#8197;wt&#8201;% of 3D h-BN significantly enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Consequently, this composite electrolyte demonstrates superior electrochemical stability. It delivers 300&#8197;h of stable cycles in the Li//Li cell at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and retains 89&#8201;% of discharge capacity (138.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) after 100 cycles at 1&#8197;C in the LFP//Li full cell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of TNA Protects DNA Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) accepts threose nucleic acid (TNA) nucleotide substrates, and catalyzes de novo synthesis of TNA on the 3&#8217; ends of DNA oligonucleotides. The TNA extension protects DNAs from nuclease digestion, and the DNA&#8208;TNA chimeras are used directly as staple strands in the self&#8208;assembly of DNA origami nanostructures (DONs). The TNA&#8208;shielded DONs are more biologically stable under the physiological environment.







Abstract
Xeno&#8208;nucleic acids (XNAs) are synthetic genetic polymers with improved biological stabilities and offer powerful molecular tools such as aptamers and catalysts. However, XNA application has been hindered by a very limited repertoire of tool enzymes, particularly those that enable de novo XNA synthesis. Here we report that terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) catalyzes untemplated threose nucleic acid (TNA) synthesis at the 3&#8217; terminus of DNA oligonucleotide, resulting in DNA&#8208;TNA chimera resistant to exonuclease digestion. Moreover, TdT&#8208;catalyzed TNA extension supports one&#8208;pot batch preparation of biostable chimeric oligonucleotides, which can be used directly as staple strands during self&#8208;assembly of DNA origami nanostructures (DONs). Such TNA&#8208;protected DONs show enhanced biological stability in the presence of exonuclease I, DNase&#8197;I and fetal bovine serum. This work not only expands the available enzyme toolbox for XNA synthesis and manipulation, but also provides a promising approach to fabricate DONs with improved stability under the physiological condition.

         <title>Concentrated Formic Acid from CO2 Electrolysis for Directly Driving Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The continuous production of pure formic acid solution with high concentration (2&#8197;M) for more than 300&#8197;h was achieved by using an MEA electrolyzer containing solid state electrolytes equipped with our developed moist heat ventilation collection system. The resultant formic acid could directly serve as the fuel for air&#8208;breathing formic acid fuel cells, which closed the carbon cycle loop of the formic acid economy.







Abstract
The production of formic acid via electrochemical CO2 reduction may serve as a key link for the carbon cycle in the formic acid economy, yet its practical feasibility is largely limited by the quantity and concentration of the product. Here we demonstrate continuous electrochemical CO2 reduction for formic acid production at 2&#8197;M at an industrial&#8208;level current densities (i.e., 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for 300&#8197;h on membrane electrode assembly using scalable lattice&#8208;distorted bismuth catalysts. The optimized catalysts also enable a Faradaic efficiency for formate of 94.2&#8201;% and a highest partial formate current density of 1.16&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, reaching a production rate of 21.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. To assess the practicality of this system, we perform a comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis and life cycle assessment, showing that our approach can potentially substitute conventional methyl formate hydrolysis for industrial formic acid production. Furthermore, the resultant formic acid serves as direct fuel for air&#8208;breathing formic acid fuel cells, boasting a power density of 55&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an exceptional thermal efficiency of 20.1&#8201;%.

         <title>Bimetallic Synergy Enables Silole Insertion into THF and the Synthesis of Erbium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potassium silole salt reacts with erbium or yttrium cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl half&#8208;sandwich complexes via insertion of a silole silicon atom into a carbon&#8208;oxygen bond of THF. Analogous reactions involving a potassium germole salt reveal intact transfer of the germole to the rare&#8208;earth element, giving germole&#8208;ligated coordination polymers. The erbium&#8208;containing products are single&#8208;molecule magnets, and one example is characterized using high&#8208;frequency AC susceptometry.







Abstract
The potassium silole K2[SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2] reacts with [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4] (M=Er, Y; COT=cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl) in THF to give products that feature unprecedented insertion of the nucleophilic silicon centre into a carbon&#8208;oxygen bond of THF. The structure of the major product, [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(&#956;&#8208;L1)K]&#8734; (1M), consists of polymeric chains of sandwich complexes, where the spiro&#8208;bicyclic silapyran ligand [C4H8OSiC4(SiMe3)2Ph2]2&#8722; (L1) coordinates to potassium via the oxygen. The minor product [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(&#956;&#8208;L1)K(THF)]2 (2M) features coordination of the silapyran to the rare&#8208;earth metal. In forming 1M and 2M, silole insertion into THF only occurs in the presence of potassium and the rare&#8208;earth metal, highlighting the importance of bimetallic synergy. The lower nucleophilicity of germanium(II) leads to contrasting reactivity of the potassium germole K2[GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2] towards [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4], with intact transfer of the germole occurring to give the coordination polymers [{&#951;5&#8208;GeC4(SiMe3)2Me2}M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)K]&#8734; (3M). Despite the differences in reactivity induced by the group 14 heteroatom, the single&#8208;molecule magnet properties of 1Er, 2Er and 3Er are similar, with thermally activated relaxation occurring via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet, subject to effective energy barriers of 122, 80 and 91&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively. Compound 1Er is also analysed by high&#8208;frequency dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements up to 106&#8197;Hz.

         <title>Uncovering Photoelectronic and Photothermal Effects in Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work quantitatively disentangles the photoelectronic (PE) and photothermal (PT) effects in plasmon&#8208;mediated electrocatalysis using CO2RR on Ag NPs electrode as the model system. The PE effect prevails over a wide potential window for the CO2RR to CO, while the PT effect dominates the H2 evolution reaction at high overpotentials. It is revealed spectroscopically that the carbonyl&#8208;containing C1 intermediate applies to the plasmon&#8208;promoted CO2RR to CO process.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;mediated electrocatalysis that rests on the ability of coupling localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and electrochemical activation, emerges as an intriguing and booming area. However, its development seriously suffers from the entanglement between the photoelectronic and photothermal effects induced by the decay of plasmons, especially under the influence of applied potential. Herein, using LSPR&#8208;mediated CO2 reduction on Ag electrocatalyst as a model system, we quantitatively uncover the dominant photoelectronic effect on CO2 reduction reaction over a wide potential window, in contrast to the leading photothermal effect on H2 evolution reaction at relatively negative potentials. The excitation of LSPR selectively enhances the CO faradaic efficiency (17&#8208;fold at &#8722;0.6&#8197;VRHE) and partial current density (100&#8208;fold at &#8722;0.6&#8197;VRHE), suppressing the undesired H2 faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) reveals a plasmon&#8208;promoted formation of the bridge&#8208;bonded CO on Ag surface via a carbonyl&#8208;containing C1 intermediate. The present work demonstrates a deep mechanistic understanding of selective regulation of interfacial reactions by coupling plasmons and electrochemistry.

         <title>Adaptisorption of Nonporous Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptisortion tailored for nonporous polymers has been achieved by dative boron&#8208;nitrogen bonding and host&#8208;guest binding. The coupling of these two components enables nonporous polymeric crystals to adsorb molecules from solution and undergo recrystallization as thermodynamically favored crystals.







Abstract
Although our knowledge and understanding of adsorptions in natural and artificial systems has increased dramatically during the past century, adsorption associated with nonporous polymers remains something of a mystery, hampering applications. Here we demonstrate a model system for adaptisorption of nonporous polymers, wherein dative B&#8722;N bonds and host&#8208;guest binding units act as the kinetic and thermodynamic components, respectively. The coupling of these two components enables nonporous polymer crystals to adsorb molecules from solution and undergo recrystallization as thermodynamically favored crystals. Adaptisorption of nonporous polymer crystals not only extends the types of adsorption in which the sorbate molecules are integrated in a precise and orderly manner in the sorbent systems, but also provides a facile and accurate approach to the construction of polymeric materials with precise architectures and integrated functions.

         <title>Staggered Assembly of a Dimeric Au13 Cluster: Impacts on Coupling of Geometric Isomerism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first completely staggered configuration of a di&#8208;superatomic Au25 cluster was solved with atomic precision. The significant torsion angle induces changes in electron coupling and complicates the relaxation pathway of electrons in the excited state when compared with the parallel eclipsed configuration.







Abstract
The specific states of aggregation of metal atoms in sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized gold clusters are related to the different quantum confinement volumes of electrons, leading to novel optical and electronic properties. These volumes can be tuned by changing the relative positions of the gold atoms to generate isomers. Studying the isomeric gold core and the electron coupling between the basic units is fundamentally important for nanoelectronic devices and luminescence; however, appropriate cases are lacking. In this study, the structure of the first staggered di&#8208;superatomic Au25&#8208;S was solved using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The optical properties of Au25&#8208;S were studied by comparing with eclipsed Au25&#8208;E. From Au25&#8208;E to Au25&#8208;S, changes in the electronic structures occurred, resulting in significantly different optical absorptions originating from the coupling between the two Au13 modules. Au25&#8208;S shows a longer electron decay lifetime of 307.7&#8197;ps before populating the lowest triplet emissive state, compared to 1.29&#8197;ps for Au25&#8208;E. The experimental and theoretical results show that variations in the geometric isomerism lead to distinct photophysical processes owing to isomerism&#8208;dependent electronic coupling. This study offers new insights into the connection between the geometric isomerism of nanosized building blocks and the optical properties of their assemblies, opening new possibilities for constructing function&#8208;specific nanomaterials.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular ortho Photocycloaddition Reactions of 2&#8208;Acetonaphthones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular ortho photocycloaddition of 2&#8208;acetonaphthones has been achieved with high enantioselectivity. The catalytic use of a chiral Lewis acid was critical for the success of the reaction and its mode of action has been elucidated by mechanistic experiments and calculations. The primary photocycloaddition products underwent photochemically or thermally a variety of consecutive reactions.







Abstract
2&#8208;Acetonaphthones, which bear an alkenyl group tethered to its C1 carbon atom via an oxygen atom, were found to undergo an enantioselective intramolecular ortho photocycloaddition reaction. A chiral oxazaborolidine Lewis acid leads to a bathochromic absorption shift of the substrate and enables an efficient enantioface differentiation. Visible light irradiation (&#955;=450&#8197;nm) triggers the reaction which is tolerant of various groups at almost any position except carbon atom C8 (16 examples, 53&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, 80&#8211;97&#8201;% ee). Consecutive reactions were explored including a sensitized rearrangement to tetrahydrobiphenylenes, which occurred with full retention of configuration. Evidence was collected that the catalytic photocycloaddition occurs via triplet intermediates, and the binding mode of the acetonaphthone to the chiral Lewis acid was elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Coupling Electron Transfer and Redox Site in Boranil Covalent Organic Framework Toward Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metalloporphyrin&#8208;based boranil covalent organic framework (M&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2) photocatalysts are fabricated through the post&#8208;functionalization strategy. Density functional theory and experimental studies unveiled the synergistic effect of metal (Ni) and BF2 moiety that alter the electronic band structures and charge carrier mobility, leading to a lower energy barrier for boosting oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The efficient polymeric semiconducting photocatalyst for solar&#8208;driven sluggish kinetics with multielectron transfer oxygen evolution has spurred scientific interest. However, existing photocatalysts limited by &#960;&#8208;conjugations, visible&#8208;light harvest, and charge transfer often compromise the O2 production rate. Herein, we introduced an alternative strategy involving a boranil functionalized&#8208;based fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated ordered donor and acceptor (D&#8211;A) covalent organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2) photocatalyst. The co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2 exhibits an excellent ~11&#8208;fold photocatalytic water oxidation rate, reaching 1404&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation compared to pristine Ni&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF (123&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) alone and surpasses to reported organic frameworks counterpart. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the push/pull mechanism (metalloporphyrin/BF2) is responsible for the appropriate light&#8208;harvesting properties and extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation through chelating BF2 moieties. This strategy benefits in narrowing band structure, improving photo&#8208;induced charge separation, and prolonged charge recombination. Further, the lower spin magnetic moment of M&#8208;TAPP&#8208;COF&#8208;BF2 and the closer d&#8208;band center of metal sites toward the Fermi level lead to a lower energy barrier for *O intermediate. Reveal the potential of the functionalization strategy and opens up an alternative approach for engineering future photocatalysts in energy conversion applications.

Density functional theory and experimental studies unveiled the synergistic effect of metal (Ni) and BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moiety that alter the electronic band structures and charge carrier mobility, leading to a lower energy barrier for boosting oxygen evolution reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficient polymeric semiconducting photocatalyst for solar-driven sluggish kinetics with multielectron transfer oxygen evolution has spurred scientific interest. However, existing photocatalysts limited by &#960;-conjugations, visible-light harvest, and charge transfer often compromise the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate. Herein, we introduced an alternative strategy involving a boranil functionalized-based fully &#960;-conjugated ordered donor and acceptor (D&#8211;A) covalent organic frameworks (&lt;b&gt;Ni-TAPP-COF-BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) photocatalyst. The co-catalyst-free &lt;b&gt;Ni-TAPP-COF-BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits an excellent ~11-fold photocatalytic water oxidation rate, reaching 1404&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under visible light irradiation compared to pristine &lt;b&gt;Ni-TAPP-COF&lt;/b&gt; (123&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) alone and surpasses to reported organic frameworks counterpart. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the push/pull mechanism (metalloporphyrin/BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is responsible for the appropriate light-harvesting properties and extending &#960;-conjugation through chelating BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moieties. This strategy benefits in narrowing band structure, improving photo-induced charge separation, and prolonged charge recombination. Further, the lower spin magnetic moment of &lt;b&gt;M-TAPP-COF-BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and the closer d-band center of metal sites toward the Fermi level lead to a lower energy barrier for *O intermediate. Reveal the potential of the functionalization strategy and opens up an alternative approach for engineering future photocatalysts in energy conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes Embedding Azulene and Stone&#8208;Wales Topologies</title>

We report the on&#8208;surface synthesis of non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing different combinations of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Their structure and electronic properties were investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations.







Abstract
The incorporation of non&#8208;benzenoid motifs in graphene nanostructures significantly impacts their properties, making them attractive for applications in carbon&#8208;based electronics. However, understanding how specific non&#8208;benzenoid structures influence their properties remains limited, and further investigations are needed to fully comprehend their implications. Here, we report an on&#8208;surface synthetic strategy toward fabricating non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing different combinations of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Their structure and electronic properties were investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations. After thermal activation of the precursor P on the Au(111) surface, we detected two major nanographene products. Nanographene Aa&#8722;a embeds two azulene units formed through oxidative ring&#8208;closure of methyl substituents, while Aa&#8722;s contains one azulene unit and one Stone&#8208;Wales defect, formed by the combination of oxidative ring&#8208;closure and skeletal ring&#8208;rearrangement reactions. Aa&#8722;a exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with the highest magnetic exchange coupling reported up to date for a non&#8208;benzenoid containing nanographene, coexisting with side&#8208;products with closed shell configurations resulted from the combination of ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;rearragement reactions (Ba&#8722;a, Ba&#8722;s, Bs&#8208;a and Bs&#8722;s). Our results provide insights into the single gold atom assisted synthesis of novel NGs containing non&#8208;benzenoid motifs and their tailored electronic/magnetic properties.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Aminotetralins via [4+2] Annulation of Aldimines with Alkenes by Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation has been achieved for the first time by the use of half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts with different metals, providing an efficient protocol for the divergent synthesis of both trans and cis diastereoisomers of the multi&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminotetralin derivatives from readily available aldimines and alkenes.







Abstract
The search for efficient and selective methods for the divergent synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted aminotetralins is of much interest and importance. We report herein for the first time the diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of 2&#8208;methyl aromatic aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation by half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts, which constitutes an efficient route for the divergent synthesis of both trans and cis diastereoisomers of multi&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminotetralin derivatives from readily accessible aldimines and alkenes. The use of a scandium catalyst bearing a sterically demanding cyclopentadienyl ligand such as C5Me4SiMe3 or C5Me5 exclusively afforded the trans&#8208;selective annulation products in the reaction of aldimines with styrenes and aliphatic alkenes. In contrast, the analogous yttrium catalyst, whose metal ion size is larger than that of scandium, yielded the cis&#8208;selective annulation products. This protocol features 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. The reaction mechanisms have been elucidated by kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments and the isolation and transformations of some key reaction intermediates.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe for the High&#8208;Spatiotemporal&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Copper(II) Dynamics in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that in vivo Cu2+ dynamics in the brain can be spatiotemporal visualized using the rational designed BBB&#8208;permeable ratiometric photoacoustic probe as the imaging agent. Taking advantages of high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution imaging abilities of the probe, we have revealed the detailed alternations in Cu2+ levels in the Parkinson's disease mouse brain during both the disease progression and drug intervention at micron&#8208;resolution.







Abstract
Copper dysmetabolism is associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, making high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution imaging of Cu2+ in the brain essential for understanding the underlying pathophysiological processes. Nevertheless, the current probes encounter obstacles in crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and providing high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution in deep tissues. Herein, we present a photoacoustic probe capable of imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain with high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution. The probe demonstrates selective ratiometric and reversible responses to Cu2+, while also efficiently crossing the BBB. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully visualized Cu2+ in the brain of Parkinson's disease (PD) model mouse with a remarkable micron&#8208;level resolution. The imaging results revealed a significant increase in Cu2+ levels in the cerebral cortex as PD progresses, highlighting the close association between Cu2+ alternations in the region and the disease. We also demonstrated that the probe can be used to monitor changes in Cu2+ distribution in the PD model mouse brain during L&#8208;dopa intervention. Mechanism studies suggest that the copper dyshomeostasis in the PD mouse brain was dominated by the expression levels of divalent metal transporter 1. The application of our probe in imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain offers valuable insights into the copper&#8208;related molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Development of Mannosylated Lipid Nanoparticles for mRNA Cancer Vaccine with High Antigen Presentation Efficiency and Immunomodulatory Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to promote the antitumor efficacy of mRNA vaccines, sweet lipid nanoparticles (STLNPs&#8208;Man) are developed by incorporating a mannosylated ionizable lipid to enhance the uptake by DCs through the mannose receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, STLNPs&#8208;Man exhibits the ability to downregulate the expression of cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 on T cells through the blockade of CD206/CD45 axis to further potentiate the antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Insufficient accumulation of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)&#8208;based mRNA vaccines in antigen presenting cells remains a key barrier to eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. Herein, we develop dendritic cells (DCs) targeting LNPs by taking advantage of mannose receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Efficient delivery of mRNA to DCs is achieved in vitro and in vivo utilizing the sweet LNPs (STLNPs&#8208;Man). Intramuscular injection of mRNA vaccine (STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA) results in a four&#8208;fold higher uptake by DCs in comparison with commercially used LNPs. Benefiting from its DCs targeting ability, STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA significantly promotes the antitumor performances, showing a comparable therapeutic efficacy by using one&#8208;fifth of the injection dosage as the vaccine prepared from normal LNPs, thus remarkably avoiding the side effects brought by conventional mRNA vaccines. More intriguingly, STLNPs&#8208;Man@mRNAOVA exhibits the ability to downregulate the expression of cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 on T cells due to the blockade of CD206/CD45 axis, showing brilliant potentials in promoting antitumor efficacy combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

&lt;p&gt;In order to promote the antitumor efficacy of mRNA vaccines, sweet lipid nanoparticles (STLNPs-Man) are developed by incorporating a mannosylated ionizable lipid to enhance the uptake by DCs through the mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, STLNPs-Man exhibits the ability to downregulate the expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 on T cells through the blockade of CD206/CD45 axis to further potentiate the antitumor immunity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insufficient accumulation of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-based mRNA vaccines in antigen presenting cells remains a key barrier to eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. Herein, we develop dendritic cells (DCs) targeting LNPs by taking advantage of mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis. Efficient delivery of mRNA to DCs is achieved &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; utilizing the sweet LNPs (STLNPs-Man). Intramuscular injection of mRNA vaccine (STLNPs-Man@mRNA&lt;sup&gt;OVA&lt;/sup&gt;) results in a four-fold higher uptake by DCs in comparison with commercially used LNPs. Benefiting from its DCs targeting ability, STLNPs-Man@mRNA&lt;sup&gt;OVA&lt;/sup&gt; significantly promotes the antitumor performances, showing a comparable therapeutic efficacy by using one-fifth of the injection dosage as the vaccine prepared from normal LNPs, thus remarkably avoiding the side effects brought by conventional mRNA vaccines. More intriguingly, STLNPs-Man@mRNA&lt;sup&gt;OVA&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits the ability to downregulate the expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 on T cells due to the blockade of CD206/CD45 axis, showing brilliant potentials in promoting antitumor efficacy combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Direct room temperature dimerization of carbon monoxide by anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) has been reported to quantitatively yield (E)&#8208;ethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(olate) bridged mesoionic carbene (iMIC) lithium compounds, COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2. They undergo 2e&#8208;oxidation to afford 1,2&#8208;dione bridged bis iMIC, COon&#8208;(iMIC)2 containing compounds while redox neutral salt metatheses yield COen&#8208;[(iMIC)E]2 compounds (E=main group species).







Abstract
We report the room temperature dimerization of carbon monoxide mediated by C4/C5&#8208;vicinal anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) (ADC = ArC{(Dipp)NC}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph, DMP (4&#8208;Me2NC6H4), Bp (4&#8208;PhC6H4)) to yield (E)&#8208;ethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(olate) (i.e. &#8722;O&#8722;C=C&#8722;O&#8722; = COen) bridged mesoionic carbene (iMIC) lithium compounds COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2 (COen&#8208;[iMIC]2 = [ArC{(Dipp)NC}2(CO)]2) in quantitative yields. COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2 are highly colored stable solids, exhibit a strikingly small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, and readily undergo 2e&#8208;oxidations with selenium, CuCl (or CuCl2), and AgCl to afford the dinuclear compounds COon&#8208;[(iMIC)E]2 (E = Se, CuCl, AgCl) featuring a 1,2&#8208;dione bridged neutral bis&#8208;iMIC (i.e. COon&#8208;[iMIC]2 = [ArC{(Dipp)NC}2(C=O)]2). COen&#8208;[(iMIC)Li]2 undergo redox&#8208;neutral salt metathesis reactions with LiAlH4 and (Et2O)2BeBr2 and afford COen&#8208;[(iMIC)AlH2]2 and COen&#8208;[(iMIC)BeBr]2, in which the dianionic COen&#8208;moiety remains intact. All compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Stereoelectronic properties of COon&#8208;[iMIC]2 are quantified by experimental and theoretical methods.

         <title>Bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; Reaction&#8208;Triggered Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Combined with Released Lonidamine for Enhanced Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the application of bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; (BCR) reaction between prodrug iminosydnone&#8208;lonidamine (ImLND) and dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) to form highly photothermal&#8208;active nanoaggregates with synergistic drug release. The reactants of BCR reaction were grafted on surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and was proven both in vitro and in vivo to robustly enhance the therapeutic outcome of photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Cancer has been the most deadly disease, and 13 million cancer casualties are estimated to occur each year by 2030. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted great interest due to its high spatiotemporal controllability and noninvasiveness. Due to the trade&#8208;off between particle size and photothermal efficiency of AuNPs, rational design is needed to realize aggregation of AuNPs into larger particles with desirable NIR adsorption in tumor site. Exploiting the bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; (BCR) reaction between iminosydnone and cycloalkyne, aggregation of AuNPs can be achieved and attractively accompanied by the release of chemotherapeutic drug purposed to photothermal synergizing. We synthesize iminosydnone&#8208;lonidamine (ImLND) as a prodrug and choose dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) as the trigger of BCR reaction. A PEGylated AuNPs&#8208;based two&#8208;component nanoplatform consisting of prodrug&#8208;loaded AuNPs&#8208;ImLND and tumor&#8208;targeting peptide RGD&#8208;conjugated AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD is designed. In the therapeutic regimen, AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD are intravenously injected first for tumor&#8208;specific enrichment and retention. Once the arrival of AuNPs&#8208;ImLND injected later at tumor site, highly photothermally active nanoaggregates of AuNPs are formed via the BCR reaction between ImLND and DBCO. The simultaneous release of lonidamine further enhanced the therapeutic performance by sensitizing cancer cells to PTT.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Conjugated Electrolytes as Biomimetics of Lipid Bilayers for In Vivo Liposome Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the existing dye leakage drawback, lipophilic cyanine dyes are still widely used to track liposomes and other lipid systems. In this study, we have revolutionized the lipophilic dye structure by mimicking the entire lipid bilayer, rather than a single lipid molecule. The new conjugated electrolyte&#8208;based probes exhibit excellent compatibility with the lipid membrane, coupled with superior and readily adjustable photophysical properties.







Abstract
Liposomes serve as promising and versatile vehicles for drug delivery. Tracking these nanosized vesicles, particularly in vivo, is crucial for understanding their pharmacokinetics. This study introduces the design and synthesis of three new conjugated electrolyte (CE) molecules, which emit in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), facilitating deeper tissue penetration. Additionally, these CEs, acting as biomimetics of lipid bilayers, demonstrate superior compatibility with lipid membranes compared to commonly used carbocyanine dyes like DiR. To counteract the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, CEs employ a twisted backbone, as such their fluorescence intensities can effectively enhance after a fluorophore multimerization strategy. Notably, a &#8220;passive&#8221; method was employed to integrate CEs into liposomes during the liposome formation, and membrane incorporation efficiency was significantly promoted to nearly 100%. To validate the in vivo tracking capability, the CE&#8208;containing liposomes were functionalized with cyclic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (cRGD) peptides, serving as tumor&#8208;targeting ligands. Clear fluorescent images visualizing tumor site in living mice were captured by collecting the NIR&#8208;II emission. Uniquely, these CEs exhibit additional emission peak in visible region, enabling in vitro subcellular analysis using routine confocal microscopy. These results underscore the potential of CEs as a new&#8208;generation of membrane&#8208;targeting probes to facilitate the liposome&#8208;based medicine research.

         <title>Rationalizing the Influence of the Binding Affinity on the Activity of Phosphoserine Phosphatases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activity of diverse phosphoserine phosphatases was maximized around an intermediate binding affinity of Km=0.5&#8197;mM, supporting the applicability of the Sabatier principle towards enzymes in general. However, there was also a large deviation between theoretical and experimental activity. Therefore, binding energy is an important parameter, but other physicochemical parameters must also be considered to maximize enzymatic activity.







Abstract
The Sabatier principle states that catalytic activity can be maximized when the substrate binding affinity is neither too strong nor too weak. Recent studies have shown that the activity of several hydrolases is maximized at intermediate values of the binding affinity (Michaelis&#8211;Menten constant: Km). However, it remains unclear whether this concept of artificial catalysis is applicable to enzymes in general, especially for those which have evolved under different reaction environments. Herein, we show that the activity of phosphoserine phosphatase is also enhanced at an intermediate Km value of approximately 0.5&#8197;mM. Within our dataset, the variation of Km by three orders of magnitude accounted for a roughly 18&#8208;fold variation in the activity. Owing to the high phylogenetic and physiological diversity of our dataset, our results support the importance of optimizing Km for enzymes in general. On the other hand, a 77&#8208;fold variation in the activity was attributed to other physicochemical parameters, such as the Arrhenius prefactor of kcat, and could not be explained by the Sabatier principle. Therefore, while tuning the binding affinity according to the Sabatier principle is an important consideration, the Km value is only one of many physicochemical parameters which must be optimized to maximize enzymatic activity.

         <title>Enabling Stable and Low&#8208;Strain Lithium Plating/Stripping with 2D Layered Transition Metal Carbides by Forming Li&#8208;Zipped MXenes and a Li Halide&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;electrochemical scissor&#8221; and &#8220;Li zipper&#8221;&#8208;driven interlayer Li plating protocol in 2D layered transition metal carbides (MXenes) is proposed, where lithium serves as a &#8220;zipper&#8221; to reunite the adjacent MXene back to MAX&#8208;like phase to markedly enhance the bulk phase&#8208;structural stability, and a Li halide&#8208;rich SEI is formed by &#8220;electrochemical scissor&#8221; removing the terminals of MXenes to maintain the stability and high Li+ diffusivity of SEI.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials demonstrate prominent advantage in regulating lithium plating/stripping behavior by confining lithium diffusion/plating within interlayer gaps. However, achieving effective interlayer confined lithium diffusion/plating without compromising the stability of bulk&#8208;structural and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) remains a considerable challenge. This paper presents an electrochemical scissor and lithium zipper&#8208;driven protocol for realizing interlayer confined lithium plating with pretty&#8208;low strain and volume change. In this protocol, lithium serves as a &#8220;zipper&#8221; to reunite the adjacent MXene back to MAX&#8208;like phase to markedly enhance the structural stability, and a lithium halide&#8208;rich SEI is formed by electrochemically removing the terminals of halogenated MXenes to maintain the stability and rapid lithium ions diffusion of SEI. When the Ti3C2I2 serves as the host for lithium plating, the average coulomb efficiency exceeds 97.0&#8201;% after 320 lithium plating/stripping cycles in conventional ester electrolyte. Furthermore, a full cell comprising of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and Ti3C2I2@Li exhibits a capacity retention rate of 73.4&#8201;% after 200 cycles even under high cathode mass&#8208;loading (20&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.4. Our findings advance the understanding of interlayer confined lithium plating in 2D layered materials and provide a new direction in regulating lithium and other metal plating/stripping behaviors.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Mono&#8208;N&#8208;Methylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines without the Requirement of External High&#8208;Hydrogen Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy enables the selective synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylated aliphatic primary amines, including deuterium&#8208;labelled drugs. This innovative approach combines an earth&#8208;abundant manganese catalyst with a weak base, resulting in a practical and sustainable protocol for mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylation. By effectively inhibiting the formation of formamide byproducts, it eliminates the need for external high&#8208;pressure hydrogen.







Abstract
The synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylated aliphatic primary amines has traditionally been challenging, requiring noble metal catalysts and high&#8208;pressure H2 for achieving satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we developed an approach for the selective coupling of methanol and aliphatic primary amines, without high&#8208;pressure hydrogen, using a manganese&#8208;based catalyst. Remarkably, up to 98&#8201;% yields with broad substrate scope were achieved at low catalyst loadings. Notably, due to the weak base&#8208;catalyzed alcoholysis of formamide intermediates, our novel protocol not only obviates the addition of high&#8208;pressure H2 but also prevents side secondary N&#8208;methylation, supported by control experiments and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Probing a Major DNA Weakness: Resolving the Groove and Sequence Selectivity of the Diimine Complex &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Major changes&#8212;the crystallisation of a junction forming DNA decamer with &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+ shows three different sequence&#8208;selective binding modes, and displacement of Sr2+ from the minor groove to the interhelical space.







Abstract
The grooves of DNA provide recognition sites for many nucleic acid binding proteins and anticancer drugs such as the covalently binding cisplatin. Here we report a crystal structure showing, for the first time, groove selectivity by an intercalating ruthenium complex. The complex &#923;&#8208;[Ru(phen)2phi]2+, where phi=9,10&#8208;phenanthrenediimine, is bound to the DNA decamer duplex d(CCGGTACCGG)2. The structure shows that the metal complex is symmetrically bound in the major groove at the central TA/TA step, and asymmetrically bound in the minor groove at the adjacent GG/CC steps. A third type of binding links the strands, in which each terminal cytosine base stacks with one phen ligand. The overall binding stoichiometry is four Ru complexes per duplex. Complementary biophysical measurements confirm the binding preference for the &#923;&#8208;enantiomer and show a high affinity for TA/TA steps and, more generally, TA&#8208;rich sequences. A striking enantiospecific elevation of melting temperatures is found for oligonucleotides which include the TATA box sequence.

         <title>Photoinduced Precise Synthesis of Diatomic Ir1Pd1&#8208;In2O3 for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol via Angstrom&#8208;Scale&#8208;Distance Dependent Synergistic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>

We develop a novel photo&#8208;induced neighbour&#8208;deposition strategy to precisely synthesize the heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom Ir1Pd1&#8208;In2O3(CP&#8208;PD) catalyst. The strong synergistic effect in an angstrom scale endows adjacent diatomic Ir&#8208;Pd sites with extraordinary catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.







Abstract
The atomically dispersed metal catalysts with full atomic utilization and well&#8208;defined site structure hold great promise for various catalytic reactions. However, the single metallic site limits the comprehensive reaction performance in most reactions. Here, we demonstrated a photo&#8208;induced neighbour&#8208;deposition strategy for the precise synthesis of diatomic Ir1Pd1 on In2O3 applied for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The proximity synergism between diatomic sites enabled a striking promotion in both CO2 conversion (10.5&#8201;%) and methanol selectivity (97&#8201;%) with good stability of 100&#8197;h run. It resulted in record&#8208;breaking space&#8208;time yield to methanol (187.1&#8197;gMeOH&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8197;hour&#8722;1). The promotional effect mainly originated from stronger CO2 adsorption on Ir site with assistance of H&#8208;spillover from Pd site, thus leading to a lower energy barrier for *HCOO pathway. It was confirmed that this synergistic effect strongly depended on the dual&#8208;site distance in an angstrom scale, which was attributed to weaker *H spillover and less electron transfer from Pd to Ir site as the Pd&#8208;to&#8208;Ir distance increased. The average dual&#8208;site distance was evaluated by our firstly proposed photoelectric model. Thus, this study introduced a pioneering strategy to precisely synthesize homonuclear/heteronuclear diatomic catalysts for facilitating the desired reaction route via diatomic synergistic catalysis.

         <title>Engineering Hydroxylase Activity, Selectivity, and Stability for a Scalable Concise Synthesis of a Key Intermediate to Belzutifan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alpha&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) are promising biocatalysts for selective oxidations, but their practical use is limited by substrate scope and stability. We engineered an &#945;KGD to hydroxylate a non&#8208;native substrate with total turnovers exceeding those of reported &#945;KGDs. The engineered &#945;KGD enabled direct synthesis of a hydroxy&#8208;indanone to replace the previous five step synthesis en route to the oncology treatment belzutifan.







Abstract
Biocatalytic oxidations are an emerging technology for selective C&#8722;H bond activation. While promising for a range of selective oxidations, practical use of enzymes catalyzing aerobic hydroxylation is presently limited by their substrate scope and stability under industrially relevant conditions. Here, we report the engineering and practical application of a non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase for the direct stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective hydroxylation of a non&#8208;native fluoroindanone en route to the oncology treatment belzutifan, replacing a five&#8208;step chemical synthesis with a direct enantioselective hydroxylation. Mechanistic studies indicated that formation of the desired product was limited by enzyme stability and product overoxidation, with these properties subsequently improved by directed evolution, yielding a biocatalyst capable of &gt;15,000 total turnovers. Highlighting the industrial utility of this biocatalyst, the high&#8208;yielding, green, and efficient oxidation was demonstrated at kilogram scale for the synthesis of belzutifan.

What makes a chemistry&#8208;based innovation challenge successful and how can activities for scientific outreach be improved? In this Viewpoint we discuss the Compound Challenge&#8212;a global retrosynthesis competition that has resonated within the scientific community. Through examining the feedback of the participants, we gain valuable insight and lessons into what makes an open innovation activity successful and what pitfalls to avoid.







Abstract
For five years now, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany has hosted The Compound Challenge&#8212;a global retrosynthesis competition. When the event kicked off in 2018 on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of the company, no one could have predicted the path it would take&#8212;from a novel competition to a pivotal event within the synthetic chemistry community. But what makes the Compound Challenge tick and what drives its popularity? And, more importantly, what lessons can be taken from the Compound Challenge and applied to other challenges in scientific education and outreach? In this Viewpoint Article we will tell the story of the Compound Challenge, from its inception to its current status. Through examining feedback following each of its iterations, we begin to define what makes an open innovation challenge so compelling. It is our hope that educators, leaders, and innovators will be able to learn from our successes as well as our mistakes and apply these lessons to their future outreach activities.

A festive electrochemistry&#8208;informed neural network (ECINN) is demonstrated by Richard G. Compton et&#8197;al.&#160;(e202315937) in their Communication. The ECINN has three subnets, each made of three layers of &#8220;Chinese lantern&#8221; neurons, embedding diverse electrochemical knowledge including electrochemical kinetics to mass transport to solve experimental voltammograms and hence parameter estimation. Decorated with auspicious clouds and China&#8242;s earliest dragon from Neolithic Hongshan Culture, the cover celebrates the Year of the Dragon.

A multi&#8208;function biosensing system based on supersandwich DNA probes (SSW&#8208;DNA) and solid&#8208;state nanochannels with hydrophobic partition modification was developed by Yu Huang, Fan Xia et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316434). Based on the disassembly of SSW&#8208;DNA, during the target recognition, the on&#8208;site detection is achieved by introducing fluorescent molecules on SSW&#8208;DNA and using test strips. Since the entire detection system only involves one target identification process, it introduces only one potential error propagation, thereby reducing the overall risk of errors in the entire qualitative and quantitative detection process.

DNA binding by intercalation , showing both sequence and enantiospecificity, of a ruthenium diimine complex, is reported by Christine Cardin, Andrew Kellett et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202318863). The right&#8208;handed helix seen in the crystal structure shows variable degrees of twisting, including the first intercalation by a ruthenium complex from the DNA major groove. In solution, the lambda enantiomer was found to be more stabilising with a range of DNA sequences.

Dual&#8208;atom catalysts present a promising catalytic platform for improving activity and selectivity simultaneously. In their Research Article (e202401168), Xiaohao Liu et&#8197;al. develop a universal &#8220;photo&#8208;induced neighbour&#8208;deposition&#8221; strategy to precisely construct In2O3&#8208;supported diatomic Ir&#8208;Pd sites. The strong synergism on the Angstrom scale accelerates *H spillover and electron transfer from Pd to Ir. This as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a record&#8208;breaking performance for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.

         <title>Redox Out of the Box: Catalytic Versatility Across NAD(P)H&#8208;Dependent Oxidoreductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent reductases have been established as chemoselective biocatalysts for the asymmetric reduction of C=O, C=N, and C=C bonds. Serendipity, screening, and engineering unearthed that the ability to convert distinct electrophiles is shared by numerous enzyme families. This review sheds light on this underexplored facet of NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent reductases and highlights the catalytic versatility of these enzymes.







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of double bonds using NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases has proven to be an efficient tool for the synthesis of important chiral molecules in research and on industrial scale. These enzymes are commercially available in screening kits for the reduction of C=O (ketones), C=C (activated alkenes), or C=N bonds (imines). Recent reports, however, indicate that the ability to accommodate multiple reductase activities on distinct C=X bonds occurs in different enzyme classes, either natively or after mutagenesis. This challenges the common perception of highly selective oxidoreductases for one type of electrophilic substrate. Consideration of this underexplored potential in enzyme screenings and protein engineering campaigns may contribute to the identification of complementary biocatalytic processes for the synthesis of chiral compounds. This review will contribute to a global understanding of the promiscuous behavior of NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases on C=X bond reduction and inspire future discoveries with respect to unconventional biocatalytic routes in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Strategies for C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on strategies for C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers, amines and amides over heterogeneous photocatalysts including inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconductors and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) photocatalysts.







Abstract
Activation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is extremely attractive but remains a great challenge. Heterogeneous photocatalysis offers a promising and sustainable approach for C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and has been fast developing in the past decade. This Minireview focuses on mechanism and strategies for heterogeneous photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. After introducing mechanistic insights, heterogeneous photocatalytic strategies for C(sp3)&#8722;H activation including precise design of active sites, regulation of reactive radical species, improving charge separation and reactor innovations are discussed.

         <title>Nanocatalytic Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we discuss how nanocatalysts specifically regulate anti&#8208;tumor immunity through the tumor microenvironment, and the key is to use unique components or redox status in solid tumors to initiate catalytic reactions for selective release of immune regulators at the tumor site. The biological mechanism of nanocatalytic reaction in regulating antitumor immunity was discussed in detail and the prospects were prospected.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for human being to defeat cancer. Although existing immunotherapy regimens (CAR&#8208;T, etc.) have made breakthroughs in the treatments of hematological cancer and few solid tumors such as melanoma, the therapeutic efficacy on most solid tumors is still far from being satisfactory. In recent years, the researches on tumor immunotherapy based on nanocatalytic materials are under rapid development, and significant progresses have been made. Nanocatalytic medicine has been demonstrated to be capable of overcoming the limitations of current clinicnal treatments by using toxic chemodrugs, and exhibits highly attractive advantages over traditional therapies, such as the enhanced and sustained therapeutic efficacy based on the durable catalytic activity, remarkably reduced harmful side&#8208;effects without using traditional toxic chemodrugs, and so on. Most recently, nanocatalytic medicine has been introduced in the immune&#8208;regulation for disease treatments, especially, in the immunoactivation for tumor therapies. This article presents the most recent progresses in immune&#8208;response activations by nanocatalytic medicine&#8208;initiated chemical reactions for tumor immunotherapy, and elucidates the mechanism of nanocatalytic medicines in regulating anti&#8208;tumor immunity. By reviewing the current research progress in the emerging field, this review will further highlight the great potential and broad prospects of nanocatalysis&#8208;based anti&#8208;tumor immune&#8208;therapeutics.

         <title>Sonogenetics for Monitoring and Modulating Biomolecular Function by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonogenetics is an evolving field in which ultrasound is used for the molecular control of cellular functions at different levels, thereby opening new avenues in biological and medical research. Here we discuss sonogenetic mediators and review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic methods utilizing thermal and mechanical ultrasonic effects as well as mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems and ultrasound biomolecular imaging.







Abstract
Ultrasound technology, synergistically harnessed with genetic engineering and chemistry concepts, has started to open the gateway to the remarkable realm of sonogenetics&#8212;a pioneering paradigm for remotely orchestrating cellular functions at the molecular level. This fusion not only enables precisely targeted imaging and therapeutic interventions, but also advances our comprehension of mechanobiology to unparalleled depths. Sonogenetic tools harness mechanical force within small tissue volumes while preserving the integrity of the surrounding physiological environment, reaching depths of up to tens of centimeters with high spatiotemporal precision. These capabilities circumvent the inherent physical limitations of alternative in vivo control methods such as optogenetics and magnetogenetics. In this review, we first discuss mechanosensitive ion channels, the most commonly utilized sonogenetic mediators, in both mammalian and non&#8208;mammalian systems. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic approaches that leverage thermal or mechanical features of ultrasonic waves. Additionally, we explore strategies centered around the design of mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems. Furthermore, we delve into the realm of ultrasound imaging of biomolecular function, encompassing the utilization of gas vesicles and acoustic reporter genes. Finally, we shed light on limitations and challenges of sonogenetics and present a perspective on the future of this promising technology.

         <title>Designing Efficient Single Metal Atom Biocatalysts at the Atomic Structure Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we highlight the design of single metal atom catalysts at the atomic structure level by focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and briefly discuss their biological catalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Various nanomaterials as biocatalysts could be custom&#8208;designed and modified to precisely match the specific microenvironment of diseases, showing a promise in achieving effective therapy outcomes. Compared to conventional biocatalysts, single metal atom catalysts (SMACs) with maximized atom utilization through well&#8208;defined structures offer enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. Currently, there is still a gap in a comprehensive overview of the connection between structures and biocatalytic mechanisms of SMACs. Therefore, it is crucial to deeply investigate the role of SMACs in biocatalysis from the atomic structure level and to elucidate their potential mechanisms in biocatalytic processes. In this minireview, we summarize catalysis regulation methods of SMACs at the atomic structure level, focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and briefly discuss biocatalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.

         <title>Bidirectional Neuronal Actuation by Uncaging with Violet and Green Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have created a chromatically complimentary pair of caging chromophores from coumarin&#8208;102, by thionation of the exocyclic julolidine oxygen. This enabled wavelength selective photolysis of thio&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102&#8208;GABA on neurons with green versus violet light. When partnered with coumarin&#8208;102&#8208;Glu, violet and green light could be used for bidirectional neuronal actuation.







Abstract
We have developed a photochemical protecting group that enables wavelength selective uncaging using green versus violet light. Change of the exocyclic oxygen of the laser dye coumarin&#8208;102 to sulfur, gave thio&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102, a new chromophore with an absorption ratio at 503/402&#8197;nm of 37. Photolysis of thio&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102 caged &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid was found to be highly wavelength selective on neurons, with normalized electrical responses &gt;100&#8208;fold higher in the green versus violet channel. When partnered with coumarin&#8208;102 caged glutamate, we could use whole cell violet and green irradiation to fire and block neuronal action potentials with complete orthogonality. Localized irradiation of different dendritic segments, each connected to a neuronal cell body, in concert with 3&#8208;dimenional Ca2+ imaging, revealed that such inputs could function independently. Chemical signaling in living cells always involves a complex balance of multiple pathways, use of (thio)&#8208;coumarin&#8208;102 caged compounds will enable arbitrarily timed flashes of green and violet light to interrogate two independent pathways simultaneously.

         <title>Discovering Electrochemistry with an Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN) embeds chemistry prior knowledge including the Butler&#8208;Volmer, Nernst and Diffusion equations to discover electrode kinetics and mass transport parameter simultaneously from sparse experiments. ECINN seamlessly integrates mass transport and BV equation and provides arguably the best Tafel analysis method. This work encourages embedding domain knowledge to realize strong intelligence with sparse data.







Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly integrated into chemistry research by guiding experimental procedures, correlating structure and function, interpreting large experimental datasets, to distill scientific insights that might be challenging with traditional methods. Such applications, however, largely focus on gaining insights via big data and/or big computation, while neglecting the valuable chemical prior knowledge dwelling in chemists&#8217; minds. In this paper, we introduce an Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN) by explicitly embedding electrochemistry priors including the Butler&#8211;Volmer (BV), Nernst and diffusion equations on the backbone of neural networks for multi&#8208;task discovery of electrochemistry parameters.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemistry-Informed Neural Network (ECINN) embeds chemistry prior knowledge including the Butler-Volmer, Nernst and Diffusion equations to discover electrode kinetics and mass transport parameter simultaneously from sparse experiments. ECINN seamlessly integrates mass transport and BV equation and provides arguably the best Tafel analysis method. This work encourages embedding domain knowledge to realize strong intelligence with sparse data.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is increasingly integrated into chemistry research by guiding experimental procedures, correlating structure and function, interpreting large experimental datasets, to distill scientific insights that might be challenging with traditional methods. Such applications, however, largely focus on gaining insights via big data and/or big computation, while neglecting the valuable chemical prior knowledge dwelling in chemists&#8217; minds. In this paper, we introduce an Electrochemistry-Informed Neural Network (ECINN) by explicitly embedding electrochemistry priors including the Butler&#8211;Volmer (BV), Nernst and diffusion equations on the backbone of neural networks for multi-task discovery of electrochemistry parameters. We applied the ECINN to voltammetry experiments of 
 and 
redox couples to discover electrode kinetics and mass transport parameters. Notably, ECINN seamlessly integrated mass transport with BV to analyze the entire voltammogram to infer transfer coefficients directly, so offering a new approach to Tafel analysis by outdating various mass transport correction methods. In addition, ECINN can help discover the nature of electron transfer and is shown to refute incorrect physics if imposed. This work encourages chemists to embed their domain knowledge into machine learning models to start a new paradigm of chemistry-informed machine learning for better accountability, interpretability, and generalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Crystallinity of Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks through an in situ Protection&#8208;Deprotection Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protection of neighbouring groups during imine condensation reactions modulates the reactivity of building units in the synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The reduced reactivity of the protected aldehyde precursor decelerates the kinetics, making the reaction more reversible and improving the crystallinity of 2D COFs.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as highly robust materials, showing significant potential for practical applications. However, the exclusive reliance on 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (Tp aldehyde) in the design of such COFs often results in the production of non&#8208;porous amorphous polymers when combined with certain amine building blocks. Attempts to adjust the crystallinity and porosity by a modulator approach are inefficient because Tp aldehyde readily forms stable &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked monomers/oligomers with various aromatic amines through an irreversible keto&#8208;enol tautomerization process. Our research employed a unique protection&#8208;deprotection strategy to enhance the crystallinity and porosity of &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked squaramide&#8208;based 2D COFs. Advanced solid&#8208;state NMR studies, including 1D 13C CPMAS, 1H fast MAS, 15N CPMAS, 2D 13C&#8722;1H correlation, 1H&#8722;1H DQ&#8208;SQ, and 14N&#8722;1H HMQC NMR were used to establish the atomic&#8208;level connectivity within the resultant COFs. The TpOMe&#8208;Sqm COFs synthesized utilizing this strategy have a surface area of 487&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, significantly higher than similar COFs synthesized using Tp aldehyde. Furthermore, detailed time&#8208;dependent PXRD, solid&#8208;state 13C CPMAS NMR, and theoretical DFT studies shed more light on the crystallization and linkage conversion processes in these 2D COFs. Ultimately, we applied this protection&#8208;deprotection method to construct novel keto&#8208;enamine&#8208;linked highly porous organic polymers with a surface area of 1018&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Stabilization of Acenes: &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221;&#8208;Pentacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient three&#8208;step synthesis, starting from commercially available pentacenetetraone, gives helical, doubly quaterphenylene wrapped pentacenes. The &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; architecture effectively shields the acene backbones&#8212;the para&#8208;quaterphenylene derivative displays unique stability with respect to photoxodiation and Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with PTAD or fullerene.







Abstract
We report soluble tetrakis&#8208;biphenylyl substituted pentacenes comprised of sp2 carbons and synthesized from pentacene&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraone. Intramolecular Yamamoto coupling of two tetrakis(chlorobiphenylyl)pentacenes yields helical, doubly wrapped pentacenes, in which the quaterphenylene units solubilize the pentacenes and shield their central anthracene units to an unprecedented degree. The criss&#8208;cross&#8208;bridged pentacenes resist (photo)oxidation, Diels&#8211;Alder reactions and are much less reactive than TIPS&#8208;ethynylated pentacene. Extension of this concept might provide access to the larger acenes.

         <title>Metal Ion&#8208;Induced Large Fragment Deactivation: A Different Strategy for Site&#8208;Selectivity in a Complex Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex natural product functionalizations generally involve the use of highly engineered reagents, catalysts, or enzymes to achieve site&#8208;selectivity by lowering a selected transition state energy. We invert this strategy by raising the energy of transition states representing undesirable sites through metal ion chelation, leaving desirable ones accessible to functionalization by a potentially wide variety of electrophilic synthetic methods.







Abstract
Complex natural product functionalizations generally involve the use of highly engineered reagents, catalysts, or enzymes to react exclusively at a desired site through lowering of a select transition state energy. In this communication, we report a new, complementary strategy in which all transition states representing undesirable sites in a complex ionophore substrate are simultaneously energetically increased through the chelation of a metal ion to the large fragment we wish to neutralize. In the case of an electrophilic, radical based fluorination reaction, charge repulsion (electric field effects), induced steric effects, and electron withdrawal provide the necessary deactivation and proof of principle to afford a highly desirable natural product derivative. We envisage that many other electrophilic or charge based synthetic methods may be amenable to this approach as well.

         <title>Engineered Anchor Peptide LCI with a Cobalt Cofactor Enhances Oxidation Efficiency of Polystyrene Microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered anchor peptide LCI_F16C with a flexible cobalt cofactor Co&#8208;L2 hydroxylated polystyrene microparticles using commercially available oxone as oxidant. The oxidation using biohybrid catalyst (Co&#8208;L2@LCI_F16C) showed 15 times higher functionalization level than using the free cobalt cofactors.







Abstract
A typical component of polymer waste is polystyrene (PS) used in numerous applications, but degraded only slowly in the environment due to its hydrophobic properties. To increase the reactivity of polystyrene, polar groups need to be introduced. Here, biohybrid catalysts based on the engineered anchor peptide LCI_F16C are presented, which are capable of attaching to polystyrene microparticles and hydroxylating benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in polystyrene microparticles using commercially available oxone as oxidant. LCI peptides achieve a dense surface coverage of PS through monolayer formation within minutes in aqueous solutions at ambient temperature. The catalytically active cobalt cofactor Co&#8208;L1 or Co&#8208;L2 with a modified NNNN macrocyclic TACD ligand (TACD=1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane) is covalently bound to the anchor peptide LCI through a maleimide linker. Compared to the free cofactors, a 12&#8208; to 15&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity using biohybrid catalysts based on LCI_F16C was observed.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Tetracyclic Cycloheptanols through (4+3) Annulation via C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H Activation Cascade</title>

         <dc:description>
A Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular (4+3) annulation of &#945;&#8208;arylalkene&#8211;benzocyclobutenols has been developed, which proceeds through sequential &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination of alcohols, migratory insertion with alkenes, 1,4&#8208;Rh shift, and nucleophilic addition to the in situ formed ketones. The protocol offers a diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective approach to dihydrofuran&#8208;annulated dibenzocycloheptanols with two discontinuous chiral carbon centers built.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed annulations of four&#8208;membered rings via C&#8722;C activation are powerful tools to construct complex fused and bridged ring systems. Despite significant progress in (4+1), (4+2) and (4+4) annulations, the (4+3) annulation remains unexplored. Herein, we develop an asymmetric Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular (4+3) annulation of &#945;&#8208;arylalkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols for the synthesis of dihydrofuran&#8208;annulated dibenzocycloheptanols with two discontinuous chiral carbon centers via a C&#8722;C and C&#8722;H activation cascade. The reaction features excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities and 100&#8201;% atom economy, and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.

         <title>Selective C&#8722;H Halogenation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single component flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase AetF halogenates a range of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted styrenes, often with high stereoselectivity, and AetF and homologues of this enzyme also halogenate terminal alkynes. These findings expand the scope of FDH catalysis, and mutagenesis studies and deuterium kinetic isotope effects provide insight into the unique utility of single component FDHs for biocatalysis.







Abstract
Single component flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) possess both flavin reductase and FDH activity in a single enzyme. We recently reported that the single component FDH AetF catalyzes site&#8208;selective bromination and iodination of a variety of aromatic substrates and enantioselective bromolactonization and iodoetherification of styrenes bearing pendant carboxylic acid or alcohol substituents. Given this inherent reactivity and selectivity, we explored the utility of AetF as catalyst for alkene and alkyne C&#8722;H halogenation. We find that AetF catalyzes halogenation of a range of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted styrenes, often with high stereoselectivity. Despite the utility of haloalkenes for cross&#8208;coupling and other applications, accessing these compounds in a stereoselective manner typically requires functional group interconversion processes, and selective halogenation of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted olefins remains rare. We also establish that AetF and homologues of this enzyme can halogenate terminal alkynes. Mutagenesis studies and deuterium kinetic isotope effects are used to support a mechanistic proposal involving covalent catalysis for halogenation of unactivated alkynes by AetF homologues. These findings expand the scope of FDH catalysis and continue to show the unique utility of single component FDHs for biocatalysis.

         <title>Antenna Effect in Noble Metal&#8208;Free Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalytic Systems Enhances CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems are obtained by utilizing noble metal&#8208;free photosensitizer (zinc&#8208;porphyrin) and catalyst (cobalt&#8208;quaterpyridine) derivatives. Upon introducing an additional chromophore (Bodipy), an antenna effect enhanced the photoproduction leading to 42.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 of CO and 759 turnover numbers.







Abstract
Dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems (DSPs) have been extensively investigated for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution. However, their application in carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction remains limited. Furthermore, current solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO DSPs typically employ rhenium complexes as catalysts. In this study, we have developed DSPs that incorporate noble metal&#8208;free components, specifically a zinc&#8208;porphyrin as photosensitizer (PS) and a cobalt&#8208;quaterpyridine as catalyst (CAT). Taking a significant stride forward, we have achieved an antenna effect for the first time in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO DSPs by introducing a Bodipy as an additional chromophore to enhance light harvesting efficiency. The energy transfer from Bodipy to zinc porphyrin resulted in remarkable stability (turn over number (TON)=759 vs. CAT), and high CO evolution activity (42&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 vs. CAT).

Rapid access of diverse polysubstituted 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which were not readily accessible by known methods, has been realized through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with easily accessible nitrones.







Abstract
Herein, we have synthesized multifunctionalized 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which are considered potential bioisosteres for meta&#8208;substituted arenes, through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with nitrones. This methodology represents the initial instance of fabricating bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes adorned with multiple heteroatoms. The protocol exhibits both mild reaction conditions and a good tolerance for various functional groups. Computational density functional theory calculations support that the reaction mechanism likely involves a nucleophilic addition of nitrones to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, succeeded by an intramolecular cyclization. The synthetic utility of this novel protocol has been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of the analogue of Rupatadine.

         <title>An ATP &#8220;Synthase&#8221; Derived from a Single Structural Domain of Bacterial Histidine Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;domain ATP &#8220;synthase&#8221; was derived from bacterial histidine kinases. This enzyme catalyzes ATP synthesis from ADP under mild conditions in vitro by exploiting an AdK&#8208;like catalytic mechanism. It can be generally applied as new biomolecular catalyst used for ATP supply to facilitate multifarious vital phosphorylation systems.







Abstract
ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a vital energy source for living organisms, and its biosynthesis and precise concentration regulation often depend on macromolecular machinery composed of protein complexes or complicated multidomain proteins. We have identified a single&#8208;domain protein HK853CA derived from bacterial histidine kinases (HK) that can catalyze ATP synthesis efficiently. Here, we explored the reaction mechanism and multiple factors that influence this catalysis through a combination of experimental techniques and molecular simulations. Moreover, we optimized its enzymatic activity and applied it as an ATP replenishment machinery to other ATP&#8208;dependent systems. Our results broaden the understanding of ATP biosynthesis and show that the single CA domain can be applied as a new biomolecular catalyst used for ATP supply.

&lt;p&gt;A single-domain ATP &#8220;synthase&#8221; was derived from bacterial histidine kinases. This enzyme catalyzes ATP synthesis from ADP under mild conditions in vitro by exploiting an AdK-like catalytic mechanism. It can be generally applied as new biomolecular catalyst used for ATP supply to facilitate multifarious vital phosphorylation systems.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C4&#8208;selective Carboxylation of Pyridines with CO2 via Pyridylphosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical copper&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective carboxylation of pyridines with CO2 via pyridylphosphonium salts has been developed. The C&#8722;P bond carboxylation with CO2 was achieved for the first time. This work represents a novel mode of site&#8208;selective carboxylation of pyridines, which may be a useful approach in new drug design and discovery in the future.







Abstract
Pyridine motifs are widespread pharmacophores in many drugs. Installing various substituents through pyridine C&#8722;H bond functionalization is significant for new drug design and discovery. Developments of late&#8208;stage functionalization reactions enrich the strategies for selective functionalization of pyridines. However, late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H carboxylation of pyridines is a long&#8208;standing challenge, especially selectively carboxylation with CO2 on pyridine motifs. Herein, we describe a practical method for C4&#8722;H carboxylation of pyridines via one&#8208;pot C&#8722;H phosphination and copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of the resulted phosphonium salts with CO2. The reaction is conducted under mild conditions and compatible with multiple active groups and several pyridine drugs, providing diverse valuable isonicotinic acid compounds, demonstrating the application potential of this strategy.

         <title>Pushing The Extreme of Multicentre Bonding: Planar Pentacoordinate Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar pentacoordinate hydride has been predicted for the first time in the global minimum C2V geometry of Li5H6&#8722; cluster.







Abstract
Planar hypercoordination has sparkled interest among the researchers from last few decades. Most of the elements in the Periodic Table have shown this remarkable structural feature. However, the smallest element, hydrogen, is missing in the list. No evidence is there in the literature. Herein, we introduce the first planar pentacoordinate hydrogen atom (ppH) in the global minimum geometry of Li5H6&#8722; cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is stabilized by multicentre bonding with five surrounding Li atoms. Natural charge analysis reveals that the central hydrogen is acting like a hydride which is strongly attracted by the positively charged surrounding lithium centres. The ppH structure is stabilized by strong electrostatic attraction as well as extensive multicentre bonding. Aromaticity has no role to play here. The cluster is dynamically stable and is expected to be detected in gas phase.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Rod&#8208;Coil Bottlebrush Copolymers into Degradable Nanodiscs with a UV&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Immolation Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tadpole&#8208;like amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymer (BBC) with UV&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immolative poly(ethyl glyoxylate) side chains are prepared. Through direct self&#8208;assembly such BBC in water, nanoparticles with disc&#8208;like morphologies can be prepared. Upon UV irradiation, these nanodiscs demonstrate controlled degradation and disassembly, transitioning from discs to micelles, and facilitating targeted molecular release.







Abstract
Polymer nanodiscs, especially with stimuli&#8208;responsive features, represent an unexplored frontier in the nanomaterial landscape. Such 2D nanomaterials are considered highly promising for advanced biomedicine applications. Herein, we designed a rod&#8208;coil copolymer architecture based on an amphiphilic, tadpole&#8208;like bottlebrush copolymer, which can directly self&#8208;assemble into core&#8211;shell nanodiscs in an aqueous environment. As the bottlebrush side chains are made of amorphous, UV&#8208;responsive poly(ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG) chains, they can undergo rapid end&#8208;to&#8208;end self&#8208;immolation upon light irradiation. This triggered nanodisc disassembly can be used to boost small molecule release from the nanodisc core, which is further aided by a morphological change from discs to spheres.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Rhodium&#8208;Carbynoid in [2+1+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt was prepared, and it was applied in Rh&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component [2+1+2] cycloadditions for the first time, affording various imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles under mild conditions. This strategy involved a unique trifluoromethyl Rh&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=Rh), wherein three new chemical bonds were forged at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of trifluoromethyl in a single step.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl cationic carbyne (CF3C+:) possessing dual carbene&#8208;carbocation behavior emulated as trifluoromethyl metal&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=M) has not been explored yet, and its reaction characteristics are unknown. Herein, a novel &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt was prepared and used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component [2+1+2] cycloadditions for the first time with commercially available N&#8208;fused heteroarenes and nitriles, yielding a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles that are of interest in medicinal chemistry, in which the insertion of trifluoromethyl Rh&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=Rh) into C=N bonds of N&#8208;fused heteroarenes was involved. This strategy demonstrates synthetic applications in late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals, construction of CD3&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocycles, gram&#8208;scale experiments, and synthesis of phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor analog. These highly valuable and modifiable imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles exhibit good antitumor activity in vitro, thus demonstrating their potential applications in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>A Bioengineered Nanovesicle Vaccine Boosts T&#8208;B cell Interaction for Immunotherapy of Echinococcus multilocularis</title>

We constructed a nanovesicle vaccine that displays multiple epitope peptides of Echinococcus multilocularis on the surface. The vaccine can efficiently activate dendritic cells, induce specific T/B cells to form a mutually activated circuit, and inhibit Echinococcus multilocularis infection.







Abstract
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a zoonotic parasitic disease, resulting from being infected with the metacestode larvae of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis (E.&#8197;multilocularis). Novel prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed since the current chemotherapy displays limited efficiency in AE treatment. Bioengineered nano cellular membrane vesicles are widely used for displaying the native conformational epitope peptides because of their unique structure and biocompatibility. In this study, four T&#8208;cells and four B&#8208;cells dominant epitope peptides of E.&#8197;multilocularis with high immunogenicity were engineered into the Vero cell surface to construct a membrane vesicle nanovaccine for the treatment of AE. The results showed that the nanovesicle vaccine can efficiently activate dendritic cells, induce specific T/B cells to form a mutually activated circuit, and inhibit E.&#8197;multilocularis infection. This study presents for the first time a nanovaccine strategy that can completely eliminate the burden of E.&#8197;multilocularis.

         <title>A Modular Turn&#8208;On Strategy to Profile E2&#8208;Specific Ubiquitination Events in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade of three enzymes, E1&#8722;E2&#8722;E3, is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to target proteins, but the role of the central E2 has been largely overlooked. This work presents a new method, called targeted charging of ubiquitin to E2, or tCUbE, that can follow ubiquitin all the way through its cascade to report on E2 activity and interactions in living mammalian cells.







Abstract
A cascade of three enzymes, E1&#8722;E2&#8722;E3, is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to target proteins, which controls many different aspects of cellular signaling. The role of the E2 has been largely overlooked, despite influencing substrate identity, chain multiplicity, and topology. Here we report a method&#8212;targeted charging of ubiquitin to E2 (tCUbE)&#8212;that can track a tagged ubiquitin through its entire enzymatic cascade in living mammalian cells. We use this approach to reveal new targets whose ubiquitination depends on UbcH5a E2 activity. We demonstrate that tCUbE can be broadly applied to multiple E2s and in different human cell lines. tCUbE is uniquely suited to examine E2&#8722;E3&#8208;substrate cascades of interest and/or piece together previously unidentified cascades, thereby illuminating entire branches of the UPS and providing critical insight that will be useful for identifying new therapeutic targets in the UPS.

         <title>Synthesis of S(IV)&#8208;Stereogenic Chiral Thio&#8208;Oxazolidinones via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [3+2] Annulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulations are disclosed, providing a modular platform for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral thio&#8208;oxazolidinones. Preliminary mechanistic studies are performed to rationalize the observed enantio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;controls.







Abstract
Organic molecules bearing chiral sulfur stereocenters exert a great impact on asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral drugs, and chiral materials. Compared with acyclic ones, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of thio&#8208;heterocycles has largely lagged behind due to the lack of efficient synthetic strategies. Here we establish the first modular platform to access chiral thio&#8208;oxazolidinones via Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulations of vinylethylene carbonates with sulfinylanilines. This protocol is featured by readily available starting materials, and high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. In particular, an unusual effect of a non&#8208;chiral supporting ligand on the diastereoselectivity was observed. Possible reaction mechanisms and stereocontrol models were proposed.

         <title>Torsional Strain Enabled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization towards Axially Chiral Semiaromatic Polyesters with Chemical Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the non&#8208;polymerizability of the biaryl&#8208;fused monomer DBO, a cyclic ester Me&#8208;DBO installed with dimethyl substitution was prepared to enable its polymerizability via enhancing torsional strain while preserving an excellent recyclability. Remarkably, mixing these complementary enantiopure polymers containing axial chirality promoted a transformation from amorphous to crystalline material.







Abstract
The development of new chemically recyclable polymers via monomer design would provide a transformative strategy to address the energy crisis and plastic pollution problem. Biaryl&#8208;fused cyclic esters were targeted to generate axially chiral polymers, which would impart new material performance. To overcome the non&#8208;polymerizability of the biaryl&#8208;fused monomer DBO, a cyclic ester Me&#8208;DBO installed with dimethyl substitution was prepared to enable its polymerizability via enhancing torsional strain. Impressively, Me&#8208;DBO readily went through well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization, producing polymer P(Me&#8208;DBO) with high glass transition temperature (Tg &gt;100&#8201;&#176;C). Intriguingly, mixing these complementary enantiopure polymers containing axial chirality promoted a transformation from amorphous to crystalline material, affording a semicrystalline stereocomplex with a melting transition temperature more than 300&#8201;&#176;C. P(Me&#8208;DBO) were capable of depolymerizing back to Me&#8208;DBO in high efficiency, highlighting an excellent recyclability.

         <title>Anionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Showing Tautomerism and Colorful Luminescence for the Ultrasensitive Detection of Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) based on tautomers has been constructed from triarylamidine bromide salts. The HOF exhibits both structural phase transition and proton transfer tautomerism under external stimulation, accompanied by color&#8208;switching of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The HOF can be used for the highly sensitive and specific detection of acetone.







Abstract
Tautomers coexisting in an equilibrium system have significant potential for regulating luminescent properties because of their structural differences. However, separating and stabilizing tautomers at room temperature is a considerable challenge. In this study, it is found that hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composed of Br&#8208; anions can effectively separate and stabilize two proton&#8208;transfer tautomers of triarylformamidinium bromide: namely, the nitrogen cation (BA&#8208;N) and carbon cation (BA&#8208;C). The BA&#8208;N crystal consisting of a dense anionic HOF and parallelly aligned organic cations exhibits green thermally activated delayed fluorescence and red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). The BA&#8208;C crystal contains acetone molecules that induce an antiparallel arrangement of the organic cations to form a loose HOF, producing blue prompt fluorescence and green RTP. Interestingly, switching of the HOFs between BA&#8208;N and BA&#8208;C can be achieved through the uptake and release of acetone, thereby dynamically adjusting multiple luminescent properties. Consequently, the HOF crystals can be used for the highly sensitive and specific sensing of acetone with a detection limit of 66.74&#8197;ppm. This study not only stabilizes tautomeric luminescent materials at room temperature, but also provides a new method for constructing smart HOFs with a sensitive response to a stimulus.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven C&#8722;C Coupling for Targeted Synthesis of CH3COOH with Nearly 100&#8201;% Selectivity from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CO2 photoreduction towards CH3COOH with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity is realized over a catalyst with charge asymmetric metal pair sites, wherein the metal charge asymmetric active sites induced by doping engineering can boost the C&#8722;C coupling of double COOH* intermediates.







Abstract
Targeted synthesis of acetic acid (CH3COOH) from CO2 photoreduction under mild conditions mainly limits by the kinetic challenge of the C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we utilized doping engineering to build charge&#8208;asymmetrical metal pair sites for boosted C&#8722;C coupling, enhancing the activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction towards CH3COOH. As a prototype, the Pd doped Co3O4 atomic layers are synthesized, where the established charge&#8208;asymmetrical cobalt pair sites are verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra. Theoretical calculations not only reveal the charge&#8208;asymmetrical cobalt pair sites caused by Pd atom doping, but also manifest the promoted C&#8722;C coupling of double *COOH intermediates through shortening of the coupled C&#8722;C bond distance from 1.54 to 1.52 &#197; and lowering their formation energy barrier from 0.77 to 0.33&#8197;eV. Importantly, the decreased reaction energy barrier from the protonation of two*COOH into *CO intermediates for the Pd&#8208;Co3O4 atomic layer slab is 0.49&#8197;eV, higher than that of the Co3O4 atomic layer slab (0.41&#8197;eV). Therefore, the Pd&#8208;Co3O4 atomic layers exhibit the CH3COOH evolution rate of ca. 13.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100% selectivity, both of which outperform all previously reported single photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction towards CH3COOH under similar conditions.

         <title>Switching Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Pathways through Electronic Tuning of Copper Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cu porphyrins with fine&#8208;tuned electronic structures are synthesized and examined as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Mechanism studies reveal that the catalytically active species switches from a formal CuI species to a formal Cu0 species upon decreasing the electron density of these Cu porphyrins. This work presents an unparalleled example of regulating hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism via electronic tuning of catalysts.







Abstract
The electronic structure of metal complexes plays key roles in determining their catalytic features. However, controlling electronic structures to regulate reaction mechanisms is of fundamental interest but has been rarely presented. Herein, we report electronic tuning of Cu porphyrins to switch pathways of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Through controllable and regioselective &#946;&#8208;oxidation of Cu porphyrin 1, we synthesized analogues 2&#8211;4 with one or two &#946;&#8208;lactone groups in either a cis or trans configuration. Complexes 1&#8211;4 have the same Cu&#8208;N4 core site but different electronic structures. Although &#946;&#8208;oxidation led to large anodic shifts of reductions, 1&#8211;4 displayed similar HER activities in terms of close overpotentials. With electrochemical, chemical and theoretical results, we show that the catalytically active species switches from a CuI species for 1 to a Cu0 species for 4. This work is thus significant to present mechanism&#8208;controllable HER via electronic tuning of catalysts.

         <title>Giant Negative Thermal Expansion in Ultralight NaB(CN)4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 13, March 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaB(CN)4 exhibits a giant negative thermal expansion behaviour (&#945;V&#8764;&#8722;9.24&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 100&#8211;200&#8197;K; &#945;V&#8764;&#8722;3.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 200&#8211;650&#8197;K) with interesting ultralight mass density properties. Non&#8208;rigid vibrational modes, characterized by a maximum negative Gruneisen parameter, play a key factor in the generation of the giant NTE observed in NaB(CN)4.







Abstract
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) is crucial for controlling the thermomechanical properties of functional materials, albeit being relatively rare. This study reports a giant NTE (&#945;V&#8764;&#8722;9.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 100&#8211;200&#8197;K; &#945;V&#8764;&#8722;3.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 200&#8211;650&#8197;K) observed in NaB(CN)4, showcasing interesting ultralight properties. A comprehensive investigation involving synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations has been conducted to explore the thermal expansion mechanism. The findings indicate that the low&#8208;frequency phonon modes play a primary role in NTE, and non&#8208;rigid vibration modes with most negative Gr&#252;neisen parameters are the key contributing factor to the giant NTE observed in NaB(CN)4. This work presents a new material with giant NTE and ultralight mass density, providing insights for the understanding and design of novel NTE materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Regulated Nucleation for Growing Highly Uniform Single&#8208;Crystalline Microrods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a light&#8208;irradiation method to control the synchronous nucleation of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) fluorophore for growing highly uniform single&#8208;crystalline microrods, which is in sharp contrast to the prevailing methods of inhibiting spontaneous nucleation and additionally adding seeds. The D&#8208;A fluorophore was observed to undergo photoinduced electron transfer to CrCl3, leading to the generation of HCl and the subsequent protonation of the D&#8208;A fluorophore. By intensifying photoirradiation or prolonging its duration, the concentration of protonated D&#8208;A fluorophores can be rapidly increased to a high supersaturation level. This results in the formation of a controlled number of nuclei in a synchronous manner, which in turn kickstart the epitaxial growth of protonated D&#8208;A fluorophores towards uniform single&#8208;crystalline microrods of controlled sizes. &#160;The light&#8208;regulated synchronous nucleation and uniform growth of microrods are a unique phenomenon that can only be achieved by specific Lewis acids, making it a novel probing method for sensitively detecting strong Lewis acids such as chromium chloride.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent, Kinetically Controlled Isomerization of Terminal Alkenes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because internal alkenes are more challenging synthetic targets than terminal alkenes, metal&#8208;catalyzed olefin mono&#8208;transposition (i.e., positional isomerization) approaches have emerged to afford valuable E&#8208; or Z&#8208; internal alkenes from their complementary terminal alkene feedstocks. However, the applicability of these methods has been hampered by lack of generality, commercial availability of precatalysts, and scalability. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed platform for the stereodivergent E/Z&#8208;selective synthesis of internal alkenes at room temperature. Commercial reagents enable this one&#8208;carbon transposition of terminal alkenes to valuable E&#8208; or Z&#8208;internal alkenes via a Ni&#8211;H&#8208;mediated insertion/elimination mechanism. Though the mechanistic regime is the same in both systems, the underlying pathways that lead each of the active catalysts are distinct, with the Z&#8208;selective catalyst forming from comproportionation of an oxidative addition complex followed by oxidative addition with substrate and the E&#8208;selective catalyst forming from protonation of the metal by the trialkylphosphonium salt additive. In each case, ligand sterics and denticity control stereochemistry and prevent over&#8208;isomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>The Stability of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ion&#8208;Pair Complex Unexpectedly Increases with Increasing Solvent Polarity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generally observed decrease of the electrostatic energy in the complex with increasing solvent polarity has led to the assumption that the stability of the complexes with ion&#8208;pair hydrogen bonds decreases with increasing solvent polarity. Besides, the smaller solvent&#8208;accessible surface area (SASA) of the complex in comparison with the isolated subsystems results in a smaller solvation energy of the latter, leading to a destabilization of the complex in the solvent compared to the gas phase.
In our study, which combines Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Infrared Spectroscopy experiments, quantum chemical calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we question the general validity of this statement. We demonstrate that the binding free energy of the ion&#8208;pair hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex between 2&#8208;fluoropropionic acid and n&#8208;butylamine (CH3CHFCOO&#8208;&#8230; NH3But+) increases with increased solvent polarity. This phenomenon is rationalized by a substantial charge transfer between the subsystems that constitute the ion&#8208;pair hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex. This unexpected finding introduces a new perspective to our understanding of solvation dynamics, emphasizing the interplay between solvent polarity and molecular stability within hydrogen&#8208;bonded systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Functionalization of Dehydroalanine&#8208;Derived Peptides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unnatural amino acids, and their synthesis via the late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of peptides, play a crucial role in areas such as drug design and discovery. Historically, the LSF of biomolecules has predominantly utilized traditional synthetic methodologies that exploit nucleophilic residues, such as cysteine, lysine or tyrosine. In this study, we present a photocatalytic hydroarylation process targeting the electrophilic residue dehydroalanine (Dha). This residue possesses an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated moiety and can be combined with various arylthianthrenium salts, both in batch and flow reactors. Notably, the flow setup proved instrumental for efficient scale&#8208;up, paving the way for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids and peptides in substantial quantities. Our photocatalytic approach, being inherently mild, permits the diversification of peptides even when they contain sensitive functional groups. The readily available arylthianthrenium salts facilitate the seamless integration of Dha&#8208;infused peptides with a wide range of arenes, drug blueprints, and natural products, culminating in the creation of unconventional phenylalanine derivatives. The synergistic effect of the high functional group tolerance and the modular characteristic of the aryl electrophile enables efficient peptide conjugation and ligation in both batch and flow conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of &#8220;Structural Pin&#8221; Interactions and Their Significance for the Conformational Control of Macrocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While peptide macrocycles with rigid conformations have proven to be useful in the design of chemical probes of protein targets, conformational flexibility and rapid interconversion can be equally vital for biological activity and favorable physicochemical properties. This study introduces the concept of &#8220;structural pin&#8221;, which describes a hydrogen bond that is largely responsible for stabilizing the entire macrocycle backbone conformation. Structural analysis of macrocycles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X&#8208;ray diffraction indicates that disruption of the structural pin can drastically influence the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased flexibility. This finding provides a new tool to interrogate dynamic behaviour of macrocycles. Identification of structural pins offers a potentially useful conceptual framework to understand positions that can either be modified to give flexible structures or retained to maintain the rigidity of the scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>The Celiac&#8208;Disease Superantigen Oligomerizes and Increases Permeability in an Enterocyte Cell Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten proteins, affecting approximately 1% of the global population. The 33&#8208;mer deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) is a metabolically modified wheat&#8208;gluten superantigen for CeD. Here, we demonstrate that the 33&#8208;mer DGP spontaneously assembles into oligomers with a diameter of approximately 24 nm. The 33&#8208;mer DGP oligomers present two main secondary structural motifs&#8212;a major polyproline II helix and a minor &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. Importantly, in the presence of 33&#8208;mer DGP oligomers, there is&#160;a statistically significant increase in the permeability in the gut epithelial cell model Caco&#8208;2, accompanied by the redistribution of zonula occludens&#8208;1, a master tight junction protein. These findings provide novel molecular and supramolecular insights into the impact of 33&#8208;mer DGP in CeD and highlight the relevance of gliadin peptide oligomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Radicalizing CO by Mononuclear Palladium(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mononuclear, T&#8208;shaped palladium(I) d9 metalloradical (3), stabilized by a bulky carbazole&#8208;based PNP&#8208;ligand, was obtained by reduction of palladium chloride or thermal Pd&#8208;C bond homolysis of the corresponding neopentyl complex. Pressurizing with CO gave the Pd(I) carbonyl complex, which was structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Delocalization of the unpaired electron to the carbonyl carbon was detected by EPR spectroscopy and theoretically modeled by DFT and ab initio methods. The partially reduced and radicalized CO slowly reacts with di(tert&#8208;butyl) disulfide under homolytic S&#8208;S cleavage and C&#8208;S bond formation to give the corresponding metallathioester</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Pyroelectricity, Thermal and Photochemical Switching in a Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Crystal by In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The switching behavior of the novel hybrid material (FA)Na[Fe(CN)5(NO)].H2O (1) in response to temperature (T), light irradiation and electric field (E) is studied using in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Crystals of 1 display piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, second and third harmonic generation. XRD shows that the FA+ are disordered at room&#8208;temperature, but stepwise cooling from 273&#8208;100K induces gradual ordering, while cooling under an applied field (E = +40kVcm&#8208;1) induces a sudden phase change at 140K. Structural&#8208;dynamics calculations suggest the field pushes the system into a region of the structural potential&#8208;energy surface that is otherwise inaccessible, demonstrating that application of T and E offers an effective route to manipulating the crystal chemistry of these materials. Photocrystallography also reveals photoinduced linkage isomerism, which coexists with but is not correlated to other switching behaviors. These experiments highlight a new approach to in&#8208;situ studies of hybrid materials, providing insight into the structure&#8208;property relationships that underpin their functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental Evidence for Non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;Contact J Coupling Across Chalcogen Bonds in Ionic Salt Cocrystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of novel polymorphic ionic cocrystals of 3,4&#8208;dicyanotelluradiazole and tetraphenylphosphonium bromide are synthesized and are characterized by single&#8208;crystal XRD. Strong and directional non&#8208;covalent chalcogen bonds (ChB) between Te and Br are analyzed via solid&#8208;state NMR to reveal large and anisotropic J(125Te,79/81Br) coupling tensors, providing unequivocal evidence for non&#8208;Fermi contact contributions across ChBs. Along with large 79/81Br quadrupolar couplings for the Br&#8208; anions, these data provide new tools to characterize chalcogen bonds and to differentiate between ChB polymorphs.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning Non&#8208;emissive Schiff Bases into Aggregate Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Schiff bases are a crucial component in various functional materials but often exhibit non&#8208;emissive behavior which significantly limits their potential applications as luminescent materials. However, traditional approaches to convert them into aggregate emitters often require intricate molecular design, tedious synthesis, and significant time and resource consumption. Herein, we present a cocrystallization&#8208;induced emission strategy that can transform non&#8208;emissive (hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted Schiff bases into green&#8208;yellow to yellow aggregate emitters via even simple grinding of a mixture of Schiff bases and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCB) mixtures. The combined experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that the cocrystallization inhibits the C=N isomerization and promotes face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8722;&#960; interaction, which restricts access to both the dark state and canonical intersection to ultimately induce emission. Furthermore, the induced emission enables the observation of solid&#8208;state molecular motions through fluorescence signals, advancing white light emission diodes, and notably, solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on cocrystal for the first time. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.</dc:description>
