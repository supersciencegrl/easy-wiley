         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Phosphors: Highly Efficient Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution and Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution phase room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from organic phosphors is seldom realized. Herein we report one of the highest quantum yield solution state RTP (~41.8 %) in water, from a structurally simple phthalimide phosphor, by employing an organic&#8208;inorganic supramolecular scaffolding strategy. We further use these supramolecular hybrid phosphors as a light&#8208;harvesting scaffold to achieve delayed fluorescence from orthogonally anchored Sulforhodamine acceptor dyes via an efficient triplet to singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET), which is rarely achieved in solution. Electrostatic cross&#8208;linking of the inorganic scaffold at higher concentrations further facilitates the formation of self&#8208;standing hydrogels with efficient RTP and energy&#8208;transfer mediated long&#8208;lived fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell MFI zeolite synthesized using a simple di&#8208;quaternary ammonium structure&#8208;directing agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of a pentasil&#8208;type zeolite with ultra&#8208;small few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domains, which we call FDP (few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domain pentasil), is reported. FDP is made using bis&#8208;1,5(tributyl ammonium) pentamethylene cations as structure directing agent (SDA). This di&#8208;quaternary ammonium SDA combines (i) butyl ammonium, in place of the commonly used, for MFI synthesis, propyl ammonium, and (ii) a five&#8208;carbon nitrogen&#8208;connecting chain, in place of the six&#8208;carbon connecting chain SDAs that are known to fit well within the MFI pores. Although each modification, singularly implemented, is known to hinder nucleation and growth rates of MFI, they have not been, hitherto, combined to synergistically act on MFI morphology. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy imaging of FDP indicate ca. 10 nm crystalline domains organized in hierarchical micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;porous aggregates exhibiting mesoscopic order with an aggregate particle size that can be up to ca. 4 &#956;m. The synthesis of FDP is attributed to conflicting crystal shaping trends attributed to distinct moieties being incorporated in a single SDA. Specifically, the pentamethylene moiety is known to favor early crystal growth along the b&#8208;axis, while the butyl moieties are known to hinder growth along the b&#8208;axis. We attribute the obtained ultrasmall crystalline domains to the conflicting trends of the frustrated SDA. It is demonstrated that Al and Sn can be incorporated into the FDP zeolite framework to produce active and selective methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon and glucose isomerization catalysts, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Programming of Supramolecular Assemblies in Living Cell for Selective Cancer Cell Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report on the design, synthesis, and assembly of an enzymatic programmable peptide system inspired by endocytic processes to induce molecular assemblies formation spatiotemporally in living cancer cells, resulting in glioblastoma cell death mainly in necroptosis. Our results indicate the stability and glycosylation of molecules play an essential role in determining the final bioactivity. Detailed mechanistic studies by CLSM, Flow cytometry, Western blot, and Bio&#8208;EM suggest the site&#8208;specific formation of assemblies, which could induce the LMP and activate the downstream cell death pathway. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our strategy can boost the activity of commercial chemotherapy drug by escaping lysosome sequestration. We expected this work would be expanded towards artificial intelligent biomaterials for cancer therapy and imaging precisely.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoresponsive Supramolecular Polypseudorotaxanes with Infinite Switching Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemoresponsive supramolecular systems with infinite switching capability are important for applications in recycled materials and intelligent devices. To attain this objective, here a chemoresponsive polypseudorotaxane is reported on the basis of a bis(  p  &#8208;phenylene)&#8211;34&#8211;crown&#8211;10 macrocycle (  H  ) and a cyano&#8208;substituted viologen guest (  G  ).  H  and  G  form a [2]pseudorotaxane (  H  &#8835;  G  ) both in solution and in the solid state. Upon addition of AgSF  6  , a polypseudorotaxane (denoted as [  H&#183;G&#183;  Ag]  n  ) forms as synergistically driven by host&#8211;guest complexation and metal&#8208;coordination interactions. [  H&#183;G&#183;  Ag]  n  depolymerizes into a [3]pseudorotaxane (denoted as  H  2  &#183;G&#183;  Ag  2  &#183;  acetone  2  ) upon addition of  H  and AgSF  6  , while it reforms with successive addition of  G  . The transformations between [  H&#183;G&#183;  Ag]  n  and  H  2  &#183;G&#183;  Ag  2  &#183;  acetone  2  can be switched for infinite cycles, superior to the conventional chemoresponsive supramolecular polymeric systems with limited switching capability. Therefore, by taking advantage of the adaptive macrocycle/guest complexation characters, the current study opens up new avenues toward precision engineering of chemoresponsive supramolecular polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Polymer Molecular Weight Distribution through a Latent Mediator Strategy with Temporal Programming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer molecular weight distribution (MWD) is a key parameter of polymers. Here we present a robust method for controlling polymer MWD in controlled cationic polymerizations. A latent mediator strategy was designed and combined with temporal programming to regenerate mediators at different times during polymerization. Both the breadths and shapes of MWD curves were tuned easily by adjusting an external light source. Bimodal, trimodal and tetramodal distributions were obtained, and the breadths could be varied from 1.06 to 2.09. Polymers with different MWDs prepared by this method had good chain end fidelity, which was demonstrated with successful chain&#8208;extension experiments. In addition, the introduction of temporal programming with a computer&#8208;controlled single chip for the light source opened an avenue for the use of artificial intelligence in polymer synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;C Cleavage of Benzocyclobutenones Enabled by a Blocking Strategy via Ni Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation remains a great challenge. The transformations of benzocyclobutenones (BCBs) usually involve the cleavage of C1&#8722;C2 bond. In this work, an unprecedented highly selective cleavage of C1&#8722;C8 bond with the insertion of alkynes is achieved by using blocking strategy via Ni catalysis, providing an efficient method for synthesis of 1,8&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes. Notably, the blocking group could be readily removed after the transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>RNA&#8208;cleaving deoxyribozymes differentiate methylated cytidine isomers in RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deoxyribozymes are emerging as modification&#8208;specific endonucleases for the analysis of epigenetic RNA modifications. Here, we report RNA&#8208;cleaving deoxyribozymes that differentially respond to the presence of natural methylated cytidines, 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C), N4&#8208;methylcytidine (m4C), and 5&#8208;methyl&#173;cytidine (m5C), respectively. Using in vitro selection, we found several DNA catalysts, which are selectively activated by only one of the three cytidine isomers, and display 10&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold accelerated cleavage of their target m3C&#8208;, m4C&#8208; or m5C&#8208;modified RNA. An additional deoxy&#173;ribozyme is strongly inhibited by any of the three methylcytidines, but effectively cleaves unmodified RNA. The mXC&#8208;detecting deoxy&#173;ribozymes are program&#173;able for the interrogation of natural RNAs of interest, as demonstrated for human mitochondrial tRNAs containing known m3C and m5C sites. The results underline the potential of synthetic functional DNA to shape highly selective active sites</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Decorated Platinum&#8211;Gallium Intermetallics as Stable Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising chemical process that can satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene. However, the Pt&#8208;based catalysts that have been reported thus far are typically deactivated at &#8805;600&#176;C by side reactions and coke formation. Thus, such catalysts possess an insufficient life. Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively. Pb is deposited on the three&#8208;fold Pt  3  sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron&#8208;enriched single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pt  1  site, is placed around the nanoparticles. Thus, PtGa&#8211;Ca&#8211;Pb/SiO  2  exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600&#176;C (  k  d  = 0.00033 h  &#8722;1  ,  &#964;  = 3067 h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1 month for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated Crystal Structure Determination Has its Pitfalls: Correction to the Crystal Structures of Iodine Azide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the previous crystal structure determinations of both modifications of iodine azide half of the X&#8208;ray reflections were missed, resulting in incorrect unit cells, incorrect space groups, and unsatisfactory structural models. Using the old data, but including the missed weak reflections, sensible structures were determined. It pays off to take a skilled look at the primary X&#8208;ray data and not to rely solely on computer generated models.







Abstract
Previously published crystal structure determinations of two modifications of iodine azide (IN3) are corrected. In the original determinations, the very weak X&#8208;ray reflections with odd k&#8197;Miller indices had been discarded, resulting in too small unit cells and models with misordered, partly occupied atomic positions. Using the original diffraction data, refinements with the correct unit cells yield structures of polymeric (&#8722;I&#8722;N3&#8722;)n chains that are interlocked to layers. A skilled look at the primary X&#8208;ray data is always recommended to overcome the lack of crystallographic expertise of computers at automated structure determinations.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Insertion of Furyl Carbene into the N&#8722;H Bond of 2&#8208;Pyridones</title>

         <dc:description>
2&#8208;pyridoneasymmetric catalysiscarbeneinsertionproton transferA chemo&#8208; and enantioselective formal N&#8722;H insertion has been accomplished for the first time by using enynones as the donor&#8211;donor carbene precursors. Distinct with the selective O&#8722;H insertion of pyridones for diazo compounds, this reaction occurs exclusively on the desired nitrogen atom. DFT calculations indicate an unprecedented enantioselective O&#8208;to&#8208;C 1,4&#8208;proton transfer.







Abstract
Asymmetric carbene insertion reactions represent one of the most important protocols to construct carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. The use of donor&#8211;acceptor diazo compounds bearing an ester group is however a prerequisite for achieving high enantioselectivity. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208; and enantioselective formal N&#8722;H insertion of 2&#8208;pyridones that has been accomplished for the first time with enynones as the donor&#8211;donor carbene precursors. DFT calculations indicate an unprecedented enantioselective 1,4&#8208;proton transfer from O to C. The rhodium catalyst provides a chiral pocket in which the steric repulsion and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of the propeller ligand play a critical role in determining the selectivities.

However, the high salt cost, high viscosity, poor wettability and environmental hazards remain a great challenge. Herein, we present a &#8220;localized water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; (LWIS) electrolyte based on low&#8208;cost lithium nitrate (LiNO  3  ) salt and 1,5&#8208;pentanediol (PD) as inert diluent. The addition of PD not only maintains the solvation structure of the WIS electrolyte and improves the electrolyte stability via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with water and NO  3  &#8208;  molecules, but also dramatically reduces the total salt concentration. Furthermore, by in&#8208;situ gelling the LWIS electrolyte with tetraethylene glycol diacrylate (TEGDA) monomer, the electrolyte stability window can be further expanded to 3.0 V. The as&#8208;developed Mo  6  S  8  |LWIS gel electrolyte|LiMn  2  O  4  (LMO) batteries delivered outstanding cycling performance with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.53 % at after 250 cycles at 1 C.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimal Pore Chemistry in an Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Benchmark Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208; or electron&#8208;transfer strategy within confined pore space is reported for the design of CO2&#8208;selective ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks with specific pore environments. Using this strategy, high CO2 capacities and high&#8208;purity C2H2 (&gt; 99.9%) were obtained as proven by fixed bed breakthrough experiments.







Abstract
Isolation of CO2 from acetylene (C2H2) via CO2&#8208;selective sorbents is an energy&#8208;efficient technology for C2H2 purification, but a strategic challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. There is still no specific methodology for constructing sorbents that preferentially trap CO2 over C2H2. We report an effective strategy to construct optimal pore chemistry in a CeIV&#8208;based ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework CeIV&#8208;MIL&#8208;140&#8208;4F, based on charge&#8208;transfer effects, for efficient inverse CO2/C2H2 separation. The ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal cluster charge transfer is facilitated by CeIV with low&#8208;lying unoccupied 4f orbitals and electron&#8208;withdrawing F atoms functionalized tetrafluoroterephthalate, affording a perfect pore environment to match CO2. The exceptional CO2 uptake (151.7&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3) along with remarkable separation selectivities (above 40) set a new benchmark for inverse CO2/C2H2 separation, which is verified via simulated and experimental breakthrough experiments. The unique CO2 recognition mechanism is further unveiled by in&#8197;situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, and molecular calculations.

We report an effective strategy to construct optimal pore chemistry in a Ce&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;-based ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework Ce&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;-MIL-140-4F, based on charge-transfer effects, for efficient inverse CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. The ligand-to-metal cluster charge transfer is facilitated by Ce&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; with low-lying unoccupied 4f orbitals and electron-withdrawing F atoms functionalized tetrafluoroterephthalate, affording a perfect pore environment to match CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The exceptional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake (151.7&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) along with remarkable separation selectivities (above 40) set a new benchmark for inverse CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation, which is verified via simulated and experimental breakthrough experiments. The unique CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recognition mechanism is further unveiled by in&#8197;situ powder X-ray diffraction experiments, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, and molecular calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Redox&#8208;Responsive Gene Delivery from Perfluorocarbon Nanoemulsions through Cleavable Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disulfide&#8208;linked poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) surfactant allows for stabilization of perfluorocarbon&#8208;in&#8208;water nanoemulsions. Upon reduction, the surfactant is cleaved, triggering destabilization and subsequent release of the encapsulated payload. Stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior is achieved selectively in high concentrations of reducing agent, allowing for delivery of fluorous&#8208;tagged plasmid DNA encoding for enhanced green fluorescent protein.







Abstract
The clinical utility of emulsions as delivery vehicles is hindered by a dependence on passive release. Stimuli&#8208;responsive emulsions overcome this limitation but rely on external triggers or are composed of nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized droplets that preclude sizes necessary for biomedical applications. Here, we employ cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) diblock copolymer surfactants to form perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsions that release cargo upon exposure to glutathione. These surfactants allow for the first example of redox&#8208;responsive nanoemulsions in&#8197;cellulo. A noncovalent fluorous tagging strategy is leveraged to solubilize a GFP plasmid inside the PFC nanoemulsions, whereupon protein expression is achieved selectively when employing a stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant. This work contributes a methodology for non&#8208;viral gene delivery and represents a general approach to nanoemulsions that respond to endogenous stimuli.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Glasses with Lava and Healing Ability for High&#8208;Performance Gas Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four coordination polymers with good flowability at low vitrification temperature were developed and fabricated into high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes by hot&#8208;casting or hot&#8208;pressing methods. The obtained membranes show excellent H2 sieving ability, rivaling against the best&#8208;reported gas separation membranes. The cracks and functions of the broken membranes can be easily healed upon heating.







Abstract
Coordination polymer (CP) glasses offer a way to tackle the fabrication challenges encountered by inorganic porous membranes and show great potentials for size&#8208;exclusive gas separation. However, their processability and performance still cannot simultaneously meet the requirements for high&#8208;performance membrane separation. Herein, we have developed a series of CP glasses (M&#8208;P&#8208;dmbIm, M=Zn, Cd, Cu, and Mn), which possess low vitrification temperature as well as low viscosity (&#951;) and lave capability above the transition temperatures. The derived glass (agM&#8208;P&#8208;dmbIm) membranes show outstanding performances for H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 separation, which all far surpass the Robeson upper bound and even rival against the best of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gas separation membranes. The low viscosities not only allow us to hot&#8208;cast or hot&#8208;press the CP glasses into thin membranes within 5&#8197;min without sacrificing their selectivity and permeability, but also endow the resulted glass membranes with healing ability.

         <title>Thiols Act as Methyl Traps in the Biocatalytic Demethylation of Guaiacol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient demethylation of methyl phenyl ethers was achieved by biocatalytic O2&#8208;free methyl transfer to thiols forming thio ethers. Since the methyl group is not cleaved from the sulfur under these conditions, the thiol compound acts like a trap driving the reaction towards completion.







Abstract
Demethylating methyl phenyl ethers is challenging, especially when the products are catechol derivatives prone to follow&#8208;up reactions. For biocatalytic demethylation, monooxygenases have previously been described requiring molecular oxygen which may cause oxidative side reactions. Here we show that such compounds can be demethylated anaerobically by using cobalamin&#8208;dependent methyltransferases exploiting thiols like ethyl 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate as a methyl trap. Using just two equivalents of this reagent, a broad spectrum of substituted guaiacol derivatives were demethylated, with conversions mostly above 90&#8201;%. This strategy was used to prepare the highly valuable antioxidant hydroxytyrosol on a one&#8208;gram scale in 97&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Infrared Based Saliva Screening Test for COVID&#8208;19</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a modified infrared reflection accessory designed for high throughput saliva analysis we show proof of concept of a COVID&#8208;19 point&#8208;of&#8208;care screening device.







Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has resulted in an unprecedented need for diagnostic testing that is critical in controlling the spread of COVID&#8208;19. We propose a portable infrared spectrometer with purpose&#8208;built transflection accessory for rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care detection of COVID&#8208;19 markers in saliva. Initially, purified virion particles were characterized with Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron infrared (IR) and AFM&#8208;IR. A data set comprising 171 transflection infrared spectra from 29 subjects testing positive for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by RT&#8208;qPCR and 28 testing negative, was modeled using Monte Carlo Double Cross Validation with 50 randomized test and model sets. The testing sensitivity was 93&#8201;% (27/29) with a specificity of 82&#8201;% (23/28) that included positive samples on the limit of detection for RT&#8208;qPCR. Herein, we demonstrate a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high throughput infrared COVID&#8208;19 test that is rapid, inexpensive, portable and utilizes sample self&#8208;collection thus minimizing the risk to healthcare workers and ideally suited to mass screening.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Sequential Catalysis Featuring Two Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral transition&#8208;metal catalysts are combined in one pot to perform orthogonal asymmetric transformations. Simple allyl enol carbonates are converted to ketones bearing two non&#8208;contiguous stereogenic centers via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation followed by a Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Hayashi&#8211;Miyaura conjugate addition. This sequential catalysis process is enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent and exhibits statistical amplification of enantiomeric excess.







Abstract
This study demonstrates the feasibility and inherent benefits of combining two distinct asymmetric transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions in one pot. The reported transformation features a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation and a Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition, effectively converting simple allyl enol carbonate precursors into enantioenriched cyclic ketones with two remote stereocenters. Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling stereoselectivity in such a complex system, the products are obtained in enantiomeric excesses ranging up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee, exceeding those obtained from either of the individual asymmetric reactions. In addition, since the stereoselectivity of both steps is under catalyst control, this one&#8208;pot reaction is enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent, enabling facile access to all stereoisomers from the same set of starting materials.

Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling stereoselectivity in such a complex system, the products are obtained in enantiomeric excesses ranging up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;, exceeding those obtained from either of the individual asymmetric reactions. In addition, since the stereoselectivity of both steps is under catalyst control, this one-pot reaction is enantio- and diastereodivergent, enabling facile access to all stereoisomers from the same set of starting materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Precise Identification and Characterization of Catalytically Active Sites on the Surface of &#947;&#8208;Alumina**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#947;&#8208;Alumina is one of the oldest and largest&#8208;scale commercial catalytic materials, but the precise identification of its catalytically active sites has remained elusive. With the aid of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art FTIR, high&#8208;field solid state NMR, and HRTEM techniques, clarification of the nature of the active sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina is proposed.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;alumina is one of the oldest and most important commercial catalytic materials with high surface area and stability. These attributes enabled its use as the first commercial large&#8208;scale heterogeneous catalyst for ethanol dehydration. Despite progress in materials characterization the nature of the specific sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina that are responsible for its unique catalytic properties has remained obscure and controversial. By using combined infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements we identify the octahedral, amphoteric (O)5Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites on the (100) segments of massively restructured (110) facets on typical rhombus&#8208;platelet &#947;&#8208;alumina as well as the (100) segments of irrational surfaces (invariably always present in all &#947;&#8208;alumina samples) responsible for its unique catalytic activity. Such (O)5Al(VI)&#8208;OH sites are also present on the macroscopically defined (100) facets of &#947;&#8208;alumina with elongated/rod&#8208;like geometry. The mechanism by which these sites lose &#8208;OH groups upon thermal dehydroxylation resulting in coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al+3O5 sites is clarified. These coordinatively unsaturated penta&#8208;coordinate Al sites produce well&#8208;defined thermally stable Al&#8208;carbonyl complexes. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the nature of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites on the surface of &#947;&#8208;alumina and their role as catalytically active sites.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Highly Reactive Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive but easy to handle: For the first time, rare&#8208;earth metals (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tm, Y, Sc) are obtained as high&#8208;quality nanoparticles (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm in size) in the liquid phase. They can be highly interesting as reactive starting materials to realize new rare&#8208;earth metal compounds and/or phase&#8208;pure rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
The first liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of high&#8208;quality, small&#8208;sized rare&#8208;earth metal nanoparticles (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm)&#8212;ranging from lanthanum as one of the largest (187&#8197;pm) to scandium as the smallest (161&#8197;pm) rare&#8208;earth metal&#8212;is shown. Size, oxidation state, and reactivity of the nanoparticles are examined (e.g., electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, selected reactions). Whereas the nanoparticles are highly reactive (e.g. in contact to air and water), they are chemically stable as THF suspensions and powders under inert conditions. The reactivity can be controlled to obtain inorganic and metal&#8211;organic compounds at room temperature.

         <title>Halogen bonding tetraphenylethene anion receptors: anion&#8208;induced emissive aggregates and photoswitchable recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives functionalized with highly potent electron deficient perfluoroaryl iodo&#8208;triazole halogen bond (XB) donors for anion recognition are reported.  1  H NMR titration experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering measurements, TEM imaging and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveal that the tetra&#8208;substituted halogen bonding receptor forms luminescent nanoscale aggregates, the formation of which is driven by XB&#8208;mediated anion coordination. This anion&#8208;coordination induced aggregation effect serves as a powerful sensory mechanism, capable of luminescence chloride sensing at parts per billion concentration. Furthermore, the doubly substituted geometric isomers act as unprecedented photoswitchable XB donor anion receptors, where the composition of the photostationary state can be modulated by the presence of a coordinating halide anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Controlled Janus Organic&#8208;Inorganic Nanocomposite as a Versatile Photoacoustic Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new type of organic&#8208;inorganic Janus nanocomposite (JNCP) with an asymmetric architecture following a self&#8208;assembly approach, offering unique features such as the precisely controlled localization of PA agents, combined modular PA properties, and independent responsiveness.







Abstract
Controlling the structural order of nanoparticles (NPs), morphology, and composition is of paramount significance in tailoring the physical properties of nanoassembly. However, the commonly reported symmetrical nanocomposites often suffer an interference or sacrifice of the photophysical properties of the original components. To address this challenge, we developed a novel type of organic&#8208;inorganic Janus nanocomposite (JNCP) with an asymmetric architecture, offering unique features such as the precisely controlled localization of components, combined modular optical properties, and independent stimuli. As a proof of concept, JNCPs were prepared by incorporating two photoacoustic (PA) imaging agents, namely an organic semiconducting dye and responsive gold nanoparticles (AuNP) assembly in separate compartments of JNCP. Theoretical simulation results confirmed that the formation mechanism of JNCPs arises from the entropy equilibrium in the system. The AuNP assembly generated a PA images with the variation of pH, while the semiconducting molecule served as an internal PA standard agent, leading to ratiometric PA imaging of pH. JNCP based probe holds great potential for real&#8208;time and accurate detection of diverse biological targets in living systems.

         <title>Deciphering Competitive Routes for Nickel&#8208;Based Nanoparticle Electrodeposition by an Operando Optical Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results of electrodeposition can be challenging to predict in the absence of unambiguous electrochemical signature. Operando optical microscopy correlated to ex&#8197;situ SEM imaging allows probing mechanistic diversity with single nanoparticle resolution. It is illustrated by differentiating, with sub&#8208;25&#8197;nm size limit of detection, the electrodeposition of Ni and Ni(OH)2 NPs upon Ni2+ reduction.







Abstract
Electrodeposition of earth&#8208;abundant iron group metals such as nickel is difficult to characterize by simple electrochemical analyses since the reduction of their metal salts often competes with inhibiting reactions. This makes the mechanistic interpretation sometimes contradictory, preventing unambiguous predictions about the nature and structure of the electrodeposited material.

     alt="Deciphering Competitive Routes for Nickel-Based Nanoparticle Electrodeposition by an Operando Optical Monitoring"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of electrodeposition can be challenging to predict in the absence of unambiguous electrochemical signature. Operando optical microscopy correlated to ex&#8197;situ SEM imaging allows probing mechanistic diversity with single nanoparticle resolution. It is illustrated by differentiating, with sub-25&#8197;nm size limit of detection, the electrodeposition of Ni and Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs upon Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrodeposition of earth-abundant iron group metals such as nickel is difficult to characterize by simple electrochemical analyses since the reduction of their metal salts often competes with inhibiting reactions. This makes the mechanistic interpretation sometimes contradictory, preventing unambiguous predictions about the nature and structure of the electrodeposited material. Herein, the complexity of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) electrodeposition on indium tin oxide (ITO) is unraveled &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; and at a single entity NP level by optical microscopy correlated to &lt;i&gt;ex situ&lt;/i&gt; SEM imaging. Our correlative approach allows differentiating the dynamics of formation of two different NP populations, metallic Ni and Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a &amp;lt;25&#8197;nm limit of detection, their formation being ruled by the competition between Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and water reduction. At the single NP level this results in a self-terminated growth, an information which is most often hidden in ensemble averaged measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Continuous Flow Z&#8208;stereoselective Olefin Metathesis: Development and Applications in the Synthesis of Pheromones and Macrocyclic Odorant Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first continuous flow Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis process is reported. Key to realizing this process was the adequate choice of stereoselective catalysts combined with the design of an appropriate continuous reactor setup. The designed continuous process permits various self&#8208;, cross&#8208; and macro&#8208;ring&#8208;closing&#8208; metathesis reactions, delivering products in high selectivity and short residence times. This technique is exemplified by direct application to the preparation of a range of pheromones and macrocyclic odorant molecules and culminates in a telescoped Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis/Dieckmann cyclisation sequence to access (Z)&#8208;Civetone, incorporating a serial array of continually stirred tank reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopic Evidences of Key Intermediate Species and Role of NiFe Dual&#8208;Catalytic Center in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;based electrocatalysts have attracted great interests due to the low price and high activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the complex reaction mechanism of NiFe&#8208;catalyzed OER has not been fully explored yet. Detection of intermediate species can bridge the gap between OER performances and catalyst component/structure properties. Here, we performed label&#8208;free surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) monitoring of interfacial OER process on Ni  3  FeO  x  nanoparticles (NPs) in alkaline medium. By using bifunctional Au@Ni  3  FeO  x  core&#8208;satellite superstructures as Raman signal enhancer, we found direct spectroscopic evidences from intermediate O&#8208;O  &#8208;  species. According to the SERS results, Fe atoms are the catalytic sites for the initial OH  &#8208;  to O&#8208;O  &#8208;  oxidation. The O&#8208;O  &#8208;  species adsorbed across neighboring Fe and Ni sites experiences further oxidation caused by electron transfer to Ni(III) and eventually forms O  2  product. This work shows spectroscopic evidence of interfacial intermediates and confirms the dual&#8208;metal&#8208;centered catalysis in OER on NiFe oxides, which may provide a guidance for rational design of high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Physicochemical Understanding of the Impact of Pore Environment and Species of Adsorbates on Adsorption Behaviour</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For better design of adsorbents, it is important to know the intermolecular interaction among adsorbates and host material, leading to improved guest selectivity and uptake capacity. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of the interaction among adsorbates and substrate, controlled by the pore environment and species of adsorbates, on the adsorption behaviour. Especially, we report the unique CO2 adsorption behaviour of MOF&#8208;205 due to distinct pore geometry. The precise analysis through gas adsorption crystallography with molecular simulation shows that capillary condensation of CO2 in MOF&#8208;205 occurs preferentially in the large dodecahedral pore rather than the small tetrahedral pore, because the interaction of CO2 with MOF&#8208;205 framework relatively weaker than that among CO2 molecules, while Ar and N2 are sequentially filled into two different pores of MOF&#8208;205 following their size. Comparison of the materials with different pore environments reveals that the relative strength of the adsorbate&#8208;adsorbate and adsorbate&#8208;substrate interaction gives rise to different shapes of isotherm, which can lead to a detailed physicochemical understanding of the adsorption behaviour.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced 2D nanosheets architectures that fundamentally promote ions dynamic transportation and storage capacity, are significantly pivotal for high&#8208;performance electrochemical capacitors (ECs). However, the restacking microstructure, weak interlayer conduction and blocked electroactive utilization usually lead to a low energy density. Herein, we develop an ordered hetero&#8208;architecture of MoS  2  &#8208;CNTs, in which CNTs are vertically grafted within MoS  2  framework by C&#8208;Mo covalent bond. Benefiting from this  in situ  vertical&#8208;bridge, high&#8208;speed interlaminar conductivity, unimpeded ions&#8208;diffusion channels and sufficient pseudocapacitive reactivity, the MoS  2  &#8208;CNTs presents ultra&#8208;large capacitance (5485 F g  &#8208;1  ) and good structural stability in KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the all&#8208;unified solid&#8208;state flexible ECs via direct&#8208;write printing construction deliver high energy density (226 mWh g  &#8208;1  ), good capacitance (723 F g  &#8208;1  ) and stable high/low temperature operating ability. Specifically, the flexible ECs can efficiently power display and wearable health monitoring device, which opens up a prominent way to design new multi&#8208;structural electrodes for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology and wearable applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Brush Surfactants: Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using amphiphilic molecular brushes to stabilize emulsions usually requires the synthesis of specific side chains, which can be a time&#8208;consuming and difficult challenge to meet. By taking advantage of the electrostatic interactions between water&#8208;soluble molecular brushes and oil&#8208;soluble oligomeric ligands, the in&#8208;situ formation, assembly and jamming of molecular brush surfactants (MBSs) at the oil&#8208;water interface is described. With MBSs, stable emulsions including o/w, w/o and o/w/o can be easily prepared by varying the molar ratios of the molecular brushes to the ligands. Moreover, when jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, i.e., structuring liquids, producing an elastic film at the interface with exceptional mechanical properties. These structured liquids have numerous potential applications, including chemical biphasic reactions, liquid electronics, and all&#8208;liquid biomimetic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Integration of Bimetallic Electronic Synergy with Oxide Site Isolation for Boosting Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is an important process to purify ethylene streams in industry. However, among current approaches reported in literature, high ethylene selectivity has been generally achieved at large expense of activity. Here we show that Ga  2  O  3  coating of Ag@Pd core&#8208;shell bimetallic particle catalysts, allows improving the ethylene selectivity to a much greater extent than coating of monometallic Pd particles, while preserving a remarkable intrinsic activity, about 50 times higher than the benchmark catalyst of Pd  1  Ag single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs). Importantly, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent long&#8208;term stability, by suppressing coke formation efficiently. Spectroscopic characterization reveals that weakened ethylene adsorption by bimetallic electronic synergy, and oxide site isolation are both essential for the high ethylene selectivity and high&#8208;coking resistance. H&#8208;D exchange measurements further show that the Ga  2  O  3  &#8208;coated Ag@Pd catalyst possesses a much higher activity of H  2  activation than that of Pd  1  Ag SAAs, thus boosting the hydrogenation activity at the same time.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Nanodisc Formation of Non&#8208;ionic Polymers**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobically functionalized fructo&#8208;oligosaccharides/inulin polymers were synthesized and demonstrated to form lipid bilayer nanodiscs. These non&#8208;ionic amphiphilic polymer&#8208;based nanodiscs are stable against pH and divalent metal ions and they align magnetically in the presence of an external magnetic field. The reported results also demonstrate that the non&#8208;ionic polymers extract membrane proteins with unprecedented efficiency.







Abstract
Although lipid nanodiscs are increasingly used in the structural studies of membrane proteins, drug delivery and other applications, the interaction between the nanodisc belt and the protein to be reconstituted is a major limitation. To overcome this limitation and to further broaden the scope of nanodiscs, a family of non&#8208;ionic amphiphilic polymers synthesized by hydrophobic functionalization of fructo&#8208;oligosaccharides/inulin is reported. We show the stability of lipid nanodiscs formed by these polymers against pH and divalent metal ions, and their magnetic&#8208;alignment properties. The reported results also demonstrate that the non&#8208;ionic polymers extract membrane proteins with unprecedented efficiency.

         <title>Bifunctional Borane Catalysis of a Hydride Transfer/Enantioselective [2+2] Cycloaddition Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A borane&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction between a benzyl&#8208;protected 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline and an alkynone has been developed. The reaction consists of hydride transfer and enantioselective [2+2] cycloaddition, which are both promoted by the spiro&#8208;bicyclic bisborane catalysts.







Abstract
Herein, we present a mild and efficient method for synthesizing enantioenriched tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;fused cyclobutenes through a cascade reaction between 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines and alkynones with catalysis by chiral spiro&#8208;bicyclic bisboranes. The bisboranes served two functions: first they catalyzed a hydride transfer to convert the 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline substrate to a 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline, and then they activated the alkynone substrate for an enantioselective [2+2] cycloaddition reaction with the 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline generated in situ.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Responsive Polyoxometalate&#8211;Metalloviologen Hybrid: Reversible Intermolecular Three&#8208;Component Reaction and Temperature&#8208;Regulated Resistive Switching Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual polyoxometalate&#8208;metalloviologen hybrid with thermal&#8208;triggered reversible intermolecular multi&#8208;component reaction and structural transformation is made and used as a nonvolatile memristor, which exhibits unique temperature&#8208;regulated behavior and visual color changes for its silent and working states.







Abstract
The development of new&#8208;type memristors with special performance is of great interest. Herein, an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystalline polyoxometalate (POM) with usual dynamic structures is reported and used as active material for fabricating memristor with unique temperature&#8208;regulated resistive switching behaviors. The hybrid POM not only exhibits tunable thermochromic properties, but also thermal&#8208;induced reversible aggregation and disaggregation reactions, leading to reversible structural transformations in SCSC fashion. Further, the memory device using the hybrid POM as active layer exhibits uncommon performance, which can keep resistive switching silent in the low temperature range of 30&#8211;150&#8201;&#176;C, but show nonvolatile memory behavior in the high temperature range of 150&#8211;270&#8201;&#176;C. Particularly, the silent and working states at three special temperatures (30, 150 and 270&#8201;&#176;C) can be monitored by chromism. The correlation between structure and resistive switching property of the material has been discussed. The work demonstrates that crystalline inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid POMs are promising materials for making memristors with superior performance.

         <title>High Proton&#8208;Conductivity in Covalently Linked Polyoxometalate&#8208; Organoboronic Acid&#8208;Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate polymers with high proton conductivity are accessed for the first time by controlled covalent polymerization of Wells&#8211;Dawson&#8208;type niobotungstate and organoboronic acid monomers. The resulting polymer features a purely inorganic backbone, organic sidechains, and acts as a solid&#8208;state proton conductor.







Abstract
The controlled bottom&#8208;up design of polymers with metal oxide backbones is a grand challenge in materials design, as it could give unique control over the resulting chemical properties. Herein, we report a 1D&#8208;organo&#8208;functionalized polyoxometalate polymer featuring a purely inorganic backbone. The polymer is self&#8208;assembled from two types of monomers, inorganic Wells&#8211;Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates, and aromatic organo&#8208;boronates. Their covalent linkage results in 1D polymer strands, which combine an inorganic oxide backbone (based on B&#8722;O and Nb&#8722;O linkages) with functional organic side&#8208;chains. The polymer shows high bulk proton conductivity of up to 1.59&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity. This synthetic approach could lead to a new class of organic&#8211;inorganic polymers where function can be designed by controlled tuning of the monomer units.

         <title>Surface Engineering and Controlled Ripening for Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth of Au Islands on Au Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of secondary structures on pre&#8208;existing metal seeds can be achieved by controlling the interfacial energy between the seed and the deposited material, the degree of oxidative ripening, and the surface diffusion of metal precursors. This method yields Au nanostructures with morphologies tunable from core&#8208;satellites to tetramers, trimers, and dimers.







Abstract
Engineering the nucleation and growth of plasmonic metals (Ag and Au) on their pre&#8208;existing seeds is expected to produce nanostructures with unconventional morphologies and plasmonic properties that may find unique applications in sensing, catalysis, and broadband energy harvesting. Typical seed&#8208;mediated growth processes take advantage of the perfect lattice match between the deposited metal and seeds to induce conformal coating, leading to either simple size increases (e.g., Au on Au) or the formation of core&#8211;shell structures (e.g., Ag on Au) with limited morphology change. In this work, we show that the introduction of a thin layer of metal with considerable lattice mismatch can effectively induce the nucleation of well&#8208;defined Au islands on Au nanocrystal seeds. By controlling the interfacial energy between the seed and the deposited material, the oxidative ripening, and the surface diffusion of metal precursors, we can regulate the number of islands on the seeds and produce complex Au nanostructures with morphologies tunable from core&#8208;satellites to tetramers, trimers, and dimers.

         <title>Direct Immunodetection of Global A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA Editing Activity with a Chemiluminescent Bioassay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine (A&#8208;to&#8208;I) editing is a critical RNA modification, dysregulation of which is linked with autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and several types of cancer. Here, we develop a protein&#8208;based chemiluminescent bioassay to rapidly characterize global A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing signatures in normal and diseased human tissue, addressing a significant technological need for studying RNA editing and its relationship with disease.

Adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine (A&#8208;to&#8208;I) editing is a conserved eukaryotic RNA modification that contributes to development, immune response, and overall cellular function. Here, we utilize Endonuclease&#8197;V (EndoV), which binds specifically to inosine in RNA, to develop an EndoV&#8208;linked immunosorbency assay (EndoVLISA) as a rapid, plate&#8208;based chemiluminescent method for measuring global A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing signatures in cellular RNA. We first optimize and validate our assay with chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. We then demonstrate rapid detection of inosine content in treated cell lines, demonstrating equivalent performance against current standard RNA&#8208;seq approaches. Lastly, we deploy our EndoVLISA for profiling differential A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA editing signatures in normal and diseased human tissue, illustrating the utility of our platform as a diagnostic bioassay. Together, the EndoVLISA method is cost&#8208;effective, straightforward, and utilizes common laboratory equipment, offering a highly accessible new approach for studying A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing. Moreover, the multi&#8208;well plate format makes this the first assay amenable for direct high&#8208;throughput quantification of A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing for applications in disease detection and drug development.

&lt;p&gt;Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is a critical RNA modification, dysregulation of which is linked with autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and several types of cancer. Here, we develop a protein-based chemiluminescent bioassay to rapidly characterize global A-to-I editing signatures in normal and diseased human tissue, addressing a significant technological need for studying RNA editing and its relationship with disease.

         <title>Cyanine&#8208;Dyad Molecular Probe for the Simultaneous Profiling of the Evolution of Multiple Radical Species During Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular probe HCy5&#8208;Cy7 turns on its emission at 660&#8197;nm via superoxide or hydroxyl radical&#8208;mediated oxidation of the reduced HCy5 moiety to Cy5, while peroxynitrite or hypochlorous species&#8208;induced Cy7 structural degradation leads to the emission turn&#8208;off at 800&#8197;nm. This allows the imaging of in&#8197;situ oxidative and nitrosative stress events during the pathogenic and defensive processes of bacterial infection in both macrophage cells and living mice.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of the evolution of bacterial infection&#8208;associated multiple radical species is critical to accurately profile the pathogenesis and host&#8208;defense mechanisms. Here, we present a unique dual wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) cyanine&#8208;dyad molecular probe (HCy5&#8208;Cy7) for simultaneous monitoring of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) variations both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. HCy5&#8208;Cy7 specifically turns on its fluorescence at 660&#8197;nm via superoxide or hydroxyl radical (O2.&#8722;, .OH)&#8208;mediated oxidation of reduced HCy5 moiety to Cy5, while peroxynitrite or hypochlorous species (ONOO&#8722;, ClO&#8722;)&#8208;induced Cy7 structural degradation causes the emission turn&#8208;off at 800&#8197;nm. Such multispectral but reverse signal responses allow multiplex manifestation of in&#8197;situ oxidative and nitrosative stress events during the pathogenic and defensive processes in both bacteria&#8208;infected macrophage cells and living mice. Most importantly, this study may also provide new perspectives for understanding the bacterial pathogenesis and advancing the precision medicine against infectious diseases.

         <dc:description>
By combining X&#8208;ray total scattering and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to obtain unique insight into the formation of atomically precise nanoclusters. In a study of bismuth oxide clusters (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103641), Michael Mehring, Kirsten&#8197;M.&#8197;&#216;. Jensen et&#8197;al. investigate the formation of&#160;[Bi38O45] clusters from&#160;[Bi6O8], and show that an intermediate structure of [Bi22O26] play an important role in the process. This intermediate structure was identified through a new automated modelling&#160;approach.

         <title>Void Space vs. Surface Functionalization for Proton Conduction in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studies of proton conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have focused on increasing the charge carrier density. Of equal importance is the correlation of intrinsic properties (porosity and surface functionalization) of MOFs with conductivity. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202106181), Jihan Kim, Dae&#8208;Woon Lim, Hiroshi Kitagawa et&#8197;al. establish a correlation for proton conductivity in MOFs with the porosity and surface functionality. The confinement effect is essential for strengthening the hydrogen bonds leading to high proton conductivity.

Anisotropic synthetic melanins&#160;have been achieved by solid&#8208;state polymerization, as reported by Nathan&#8197;C. Gianneschi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103447). Ellipsoidal platelets of melanin, found to date only in biology, are obtained through pre&#8208;organizing the 4&#8208;4&#8242; dihydroxynaphthalene dimer as the building block, followed by solid&#8208;state oxidative polymerization to give polymeric melanin materials without changing their overall morphology.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Microparticle Tension Sensors (&#956;TS) for Measuring Cell Mechanics in Non&#8208;planar Geometries and for High&#8208;Throughput Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microparticle tension sensor is designed for measuring molecular forces in non&#8208;planar geometries and for high&#8208;throughput flow cytometry analysis of cell mechanics.







Abstract
Mechanotransduction, the interplay between physical and chemical signaling, plays vital roles in many biological processes. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques to quantify cell forces employ deformable polymer films or molecular probes tethered to glass substrates. However, the applications of these assays in fundamental and clinical research are restricted by the planar geometry and low throughput of microscopy readout. Herein, we develop a DNA&#8208;based microparticle tension sensor, which features a spherical surface and thus allows for investigation of mechanotransduction at curved interfaces. The micron&#8208;scale of &#956;TS enables flow cytometry readout, which is rapid and high throughput. We applied the method to map and measure T&#8208;cell receptor forces and platelet integrin forces at 12 and 56&#8197;pN thresholds. Furthermore, we quantified the inhibition efficiency of two anti&#8208;platelet drugs providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of &#956;TS to screen drugs that modulate cellular mechanics.

         <title>Catalytic System&#8208;Controlled Divergent Reaction Strategies for the Construction of Diversified Spiropyrazolone Skeletons from Pyrazolidinones and Diazopyrazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic system&#8208;controlled divergent reaction strategy was here reported to construct four types of intriguing spiroheterocyclic skeletons from simple and readily available starting materials via  a precise chemical bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade. The tetraazaspiroheterocyclic and trizazspiroheterocyclic scaffolds could be independently constructed by a selective N&#8208;N bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade, a C(sp 2  )&#8208;H activation/[4+1] annulation and a novel tandem C(sp 2  )&#8208;H/C(sp 3  )&#8208;H bond activation/[4+1] annulation strategy, along with a broad scope of substrates, moderate to excellent yields and value transformations. More importantly, in these transformations, we are the first time to capture a N&#8208;N bond activation and a C(sp 3  )&#8208;H bond activation of pyrazolidinones under different catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Acid&#8208;Assisted Hydrogenation of Oximes to Hydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15524-15532, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) complexes are found to be efficient catalysts for homogeneous oxime hydrogenation to hydroxylamine products, only if equipped with an aryl&#8208;imine ligand and operating under strong acidic conditions. Remarkably they do not hydrogenolyse the fragile N&#8722;O bond. Experimental evidence suggests an unusual acid&#8208;assisted ionic hydrogenation mechanism which may be applicable to the reduction of other challenging substrates.







Abstract
We found that cyclometalated cyclopentadienyl iridium(III) complexes are uniquely efficient catalysts in homogeneous hydrogenation of oximes to hydroxylamine products. A stable iridium C,N&#8208;chelation is crucial, with alkoxy&#8208;substituted aryl ketimine ligands providing the best catalytic performance. Several Ir&#8208;complexes were mapped by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis in order to collect steric parameters that might guide a rational design of even more active catalysts. A broad range of oximes and oxime ethers were activated with stoichiometric amounts of methanesulfonic acid and reduced at room temperature, remarkably without cleavage of the fragile N&#8722;O bond. The exquisite functional group compatibility of our hydrogenation system was further demonstrated by additive tests. Experimental mechanistic investigations support an ionic hydrogenation platform, and suggest a role for the Br&#248;nsted acid beyond a proton source. Our studies provide deep understanding of this novel acidic hydrogenation and may facilitate its improvement and application to other challenging substrates.

         <title>Novel Insight into Proximal DNA Domain Interactions from Temperature&#8208;Controlled Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>

Hybrid duplex&#8211;quadruplex oligonucleotides comprised of multiple domains have not been yet properly investigated because of their structural complexity. A new method based on native mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with a custom&#8208;built temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization (TCnESI) source is introduced to investigate effects between multiple proximal DNA domains.







Abstract
Quadruplexes are non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures essential for many cellular processes. Hybrid quadruplex&#8211;duplex oligonucleotide assemblies comprised of multiple domains are challenging to study with conventional biophysical methods due to their structural complexity. Here, we introduce a novel method based on native mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with a custom&#8208;built temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization (TCnESI) source designed to investigate interactions between proximal DNA domains. Thermal denaturation experiments were aimed to study unfolding of multi&#8208;stranded oligonucleotide constructs derived from biologically relevant structures and to identify unfolding intermediates. Using the TCnESI MS, we observed changes in Tm and thermodynamic characteristics of proximal DNA domains depending on the number of domains, their position, and order in a single experiment.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Nano&#8208;Crystallization and Solvation Modulation to Promote Highly Stable Anode Involving Alloy/De&#8208;alloy for Potassium Ion Batteries</title>

An in situ nano&#8208;crystallization easing volume exchange of the hierarchical particle and a stable and robust SEI formed on the particle lead to a (BiO)2CO3 based electrode wih a highly stable cycling performance during 1500&#8197;cycles, providing a new sight for anode materials design and an understanding about the relationship between solvation and SEI formation.







Abstract
For advanced anode materials involving alloy/de&#8208;alloy chemistry for potassium ion batteries (PIBs), two&#8208;dimensional (2D) bismuth subcarbonate (BCO) nanosheets that possess high theoretical capacity of 631&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 are proposed. The large lattice spacing of 0.683&#8197;nm along b axis facilitate insertion of K+ ion to boost high&#8208;capacity delivery of ca. 610&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the in situ nano&#8208;crystallization well ease volume changes of the integrated particle and shorten ion diffusion path during potassiation/depotassiation. After coupling with a concentrated KFSI&#8208;G2 electrolyte, the robust and efficient SEI built from enhanced participation of FSI&#8722; synergistically endow structural stability of the flower&#8208;like BCO, and enable a prolonged cycling performance with capacity of ca. 300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 1500&#8197;cycles, achieving an ultralow decay rate of 0.007&#8201;%. Mechanistic investigations probe the electrochemistry involving alloy/de&#8208;alloy and phase transition of the electrode.

         <title>Collective Vibrational Strong Coupling Effects on Molecular Vibrational Relaxation and Energy Transfer: Numerical Insights via Cavity Molecular Dynamics Simulations**
</title>

We performed cavity molecular dynamics simulations and showed that, under vibrational strong coupling conditions, vibrational relaxation and energy transfer from hot to thermal molecules can be accelerated relative to that outside a cavity due to polariton&#8208;accelerated intermolecular vibrational energy transfer.







Abstract
For a small fraction of hot CO2 molecules immersed in a liquid&#8208;phase CO2 thermal bath, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that forming collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the C=O asymmetric stretch of CO2 molecules and a cavity mode accelerates hot&#8208;molecule relaxation. This acceleration stems from the fact that polaritons can be transiently excited during the nonequilibrium process, which facilitates intermolecular vibrational energy transfer. The VSC effects on these rates 1)&#8197;resonantly depend on the cavity mode detuning, 2)&#8197;cooperatively depend on Rabi splitting, and 3)&#8197;collectively scale with the number of hot molecules. For larger cavity volumes, the average VSC effect per molecule can remain meaningful for up to N&#8776;104 molecules forming VSC. Moreover, the transiently excited lower polariton prefers to relax by transferring its energy to the tail of the molecular energy distribution rather than distributing it equally to all thermal molecules. As far as the parameter dependence is concerned, the vibrational relaxation data presented here appear analogous to VSC catalysis in Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot microcavities.

Seamless low&#8208;temperature syntheses, crystallization and spectroscopies provide structural details of the heterobimetallic reagent routinely used for regioselective carbon&#8722;carbon bond forming reactions with carbonyl compounds. 7Li&#8197;NMR spectroscopy takes on an important role here, tracking down n&#8208;BuLi dissociation.







Abstract
CeCl3(thf) reacts at low temperatures with MeLi, t&#8208;BuLi, and n&#8208;BuLi to isolable organocerium complexes. Solvent&#8208;dependent extensive n&#8208;BuLi dissociation is revealed by 7Li NMR spectroscopy, suggesting &#8220;Ce(n&#8208;Bu)3(thf)x&#8221; or solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs like &#8220;[Li(thf)4][Ce(n&#8208;Bu)4(thf)y]&#8221; as the dominant species of the Imamoto reagent. The stability of complexes Li3Ln(n&#8208;Bu)6(thf)4 increases markedly with decreasing LnIII size. Closer inspection of the solution behavior of crystalline Li3Lu(n&#8208;Bu)6(thf)4 and mixtures of LuCl3(thf)2/n&#8208;BuLi in THF indicates occurring n&#8208;BuLi dissociation only at molar ratios of &lt;1:3. n&#8208;BuLi&#8208;depleted complex LiLu(n&#8208;Bu)3Cl(tmeda)2 was obtained by treatment of Li2Lu(n&#8208;Bu)5(tmeda)2 with ClSiMe3, at the expense of LiCl incorporation. Imamoto's ketone/tertiary alcohol transformation was examined with 1,3&#8208;diphenylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;one, affording 99&#8201;% of alcohol.

         <title>Antiprotozoal Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships of Synthetic Leucinostatin Derivatives and Elucidation of their Mode of Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15613-15621, July 5, 2021. </description>

A structure&#8211;activity relationship of the natural product Leucinostatin A was performed to result in two highly potent compounds against the protozoa Trypanosoma brucei with decreased toxic effects in vitro and in vivo. Those compounds did not form any resistance by long&#8208;time sublethal exposure and their mode of action lies in the destabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane.







Abstract
Leucinostatin A is one of the most potent antiprotozoal compounds ever described, but little was known on structure&#8211;activity relationships (SAR). We used Trypanosoma brucei as a protozoal model organism to test synthetically modified derivatives, resulting in simplified but equally active compounds 2 (ZHAWOC6025) and 4 (ZHAWOC6027), which were subsequently modified in all regions of the molecule to gain an in&#8208;depth SAR understanding. The antiprotozoal SAR matched SAR in phospholipid liposomes, where membrane integrity, leaking, and dynamics were studied. The mode of action is discussed based on a structure&#8211;activity analysis of derivatives in efficacy, ultrastructural studies in T. brucei, and artificial membrane models, mimicking membrane stability and membrane potential. The main site of antiprotozoal action of natural and synthetic leucinostatins lies in the destabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, as demonstrated by ultrastructural analysis, electron microscopy and mitochondrial staining. Long&#8208;time sublethal exposure of T. brucei (200 passages) and siRNA screening of 12&#8242;000 mutants showed no signs of resistance development to the synthetic derivatives.

         <title>Hydrothermal Synthesis of Zinc&#8208;Doped Silica Nanospheres Simultaneously Featuring Stable Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy was developed for directly preparing zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres (Zn@SiNSs) in water, which can produce stable fluorescence (UV on) and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UV off) in water.







Abstract
Fluorescence and phosphorescence are known as two kinds of fundamental optical signals, which have been used for myriad applications. To date, simultaneous activation of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in the aqueous phase remains a big challenge. We prepare zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres (Zn@SiNSs) with fluorescence and RTP properties using a facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy. For the as&#8208;prepared Zn@SiNSs, the recombination of electrons and holes in defects and defect&#8208;stabilized excitons derived from oxygen vacancy/C=N bonds lead to the production of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived RTP (emission lasting for &#8776;9&#8197;s, quantum yield (QY): &#8776;33.6&#8201;%, RTP lifetime: &#8776;236&#8197;ms). The internal Si&#8722;O bonded networks and hydrophilic surface in Zn@SiNSs can reduce nonradiative decay to form self&#8208;protective RTP, and also provide high water solubility, excellent pH&#8208; and photostability.

We describe a tumor&#8208;targeting yet enhanced chemotherapy, which is enabled by nanomicelles self&#8208;assembled from multivalent aptamer drug conjugates. Co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with a multivalent PEG&#8208;conjugated drug analogue reaches an optimal complementation between the blood circulation and tumor&#8208;targeting ability of the nanomicelles, which augments the antitumor immune responses of the checkpoint blockade.







Abstract
A tumor&#8208;targeting enhanced chemotherapy, enabled by aptamer&#8208;drug conjugate nanomicelles, is reported that boosts antitumor immune responses. Multivalent aptamer drug conjugate (ApMDC), an amphiphilic telodendrimer consisting of a hydrophilic aptamer and a hydrophobic monodendron anchored with four anticancer drugs by acid&#8208;labile linkers, was designed and synthesized. By co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with an ApMDC analogue, in which aptamer is replaced with polyethylene glycol, the surface aptamer density of these nanomicelles can be screened to reach an optimal complementation between blood circulation and tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Optimized nanomicelles can enhance immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, which strikingly augments the tumor&#8208;specific immune responses of the checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent tumor&#8208;bearing mice. ApMDC nanomicelles represent a robust platform for structure&#8211;function optimization of drug conjugates and nanomedicines.

&lt;p&gt;We describe a tumor-targeting yet enhanced chemotherapy, which is enabled by nanomicelles self-assembled from multivalent aptamer drug conjugates. Co-self-assembly with a multivalent PEG-conjugated drug analogue reaches an optimal complementation between the blood circulation and tumor-targeting ability of the nanomicelles, which augments the antitumor immune responses of the checkpoint blockade.

         <title>Atomic Tungsten on Graphene with Unique Coordination Enabling Kinetically Boosted Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Atomic tungsten on graphene with a unique W state of the W&#8208;N2O2 structure are first used to decorate the separator of a Li&#8208;S battery to promote its electrochemical performance. The unique local coordination structure of W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C moiety not only acts as an active site for anchoring lithium polysulfides, but also boosts their kinetic conversion via electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Use of catalytic materials is regarded as the most desirable strategy to cope with sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) transformation and severe shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;utilization are advantagous in serving as anchoring and electrocatalytic centers for LiPSs. Herein, a novel kind of tungsten (W) SAC immobilized on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (W/NG) with a unique W&#8208;O2N2&#8208;C coordination configuration and a high W loading of 8.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% is proposed by a self&#8208;template and self&#8208;reduction strategy. The local coordination environment of W atom endows the W/NG with elevated LiPSs adsorption ability and catalytic activity. LSBs equipped with W/NG modified separator manifest greatly improved electrochemical performances with high cycling stability over 1000&#8197;cycles and ultrahigh rate capability. It indicates high areal capacity of 6.24&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with robust cycling life at a high sulfur mass loading of 8.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Implications of Quenching&#8208;to&#8208;Dequenching Switch in Quantitative Cell Uptake and Biodistribution of Dye&#8208;Labeled Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15426-15435, July 5, 2021. </description>

A ubiquitous quenching&#8208;to&#8208;dequenching switch of dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo is presented. When dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles interact with biological systems (cell culture medium, cells, and organs to animals), the dye undergoes the switch, causing a significant increase of fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
A general strategy to carry out cell uptake and biodistribution studies is to label nanoparticles (NPs) with a fluorescent dye. However, the comparative study of different dye&#8208;loaded NPs remains difficult owing to uncontrolled dye quenching and de&#8208;quenching. Here we compared two types of dye&#8208;labeled NPs and demonstrated their distinct properties. NPs with dye molecules at a solid state suffer from dye quenching, so the dye release and/or NP degradation in biological environments leads to a several&#8208;fold increase of fluorescence intensity despite the same amount of NPs, owing to the state switch from quenching to de&#8208;quenching. In contrast, NPs with dye molecules at a soluble state exhibit no quenching effect. To standardize the comparative study, we propose two possible solutions: using lower dye loading or using medium analysis for quantifying cell uptake of NPs. This work provides valuable insights into selecting valid quantification methods for bio&#8208;nano studies.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Linked Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium(III) Complexes&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C&#8722;H Arylation of Benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;Diazonaphthoquinones</title>

         <dc:description>
A class of chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands (BOCps) bearing an oxygen linker was developed. The BOCpRh complexes are powerful catalysts in an asymmetric C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones to construct axially chiral heterobiaryls. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that this reaction is likely to proceed via an electrophilic C&#8722;H rhodation and subsequent coupling with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones.







Abstract
Chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium (CpRh) complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization reactions have witnessed a significant progress in organic synthesis. In sharp contrast, the reported chiral Cp ligands are limited to C&#8208;linked Cp and are often synthetically challenging. To address these issues, we have developed a novel class of tunable chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing oxygen linkers, which were efficient catalysts for C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones, affording axially chiral heterobiaryls in excellent yields and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 98.5:1.5 er). Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction is likely to proceed by electrophilic C&#8722;H activation, and followed by coupling of the cyclometalated rhodium(III) complex with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones.

         <title>Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Metal Battery Achieved by a Safe Electrolyte Based on Recyclable and Low&#8208;Cost Molecular Sieve</title>

Low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite was used to sieve the excess solvents within Li&#8208;ion solvation sheaths of typical carbonate electrolyte to eliminate the adverse effects (high&#8208;voltage/temperature oxidation, unstable CEI/SEI). As a result, high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal battery (LMB) that used this zeolite sieved electrolyte demonstrated a significantly improved cycling time and safety, but largely reduced production cost.







Abstract
As one typical clean&#8208;energy technologies, lithium&#8208;metal batteries, especially high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries which use concentrated electrolytes hold promising prospect for the development of a sustainable world. However, concentrated electrolytes with aggregative configurations were achieved at the expense of using extra dose of costly and environmental&#8208;unfriendly salts/additives, which casts a shadow over the development of a sustainable world. Herein, without using any expensive salts/additives, we employed commercially&#8208;available low&#8208;cost and environmental&#8208;friendly molecular sieves (zeolite) to sieve the solvation sheath of lithium ions of classic commercialized electrolyte (LiPF6&#8208;EC/DMC), and resulting in a unique zeolite sieved electrolyte which was more aggregative than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Inspiringly, the new&#8208;designed electrolyte exhibited largely enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation stability under high&#8208;voltage (4.6&#8197;volts) and elevated temperature (55&#8201;&#176;C). NCM&#8208;811//Li cells assembled with this electrolyte delivered ultra&#8208;stable rechargeabilities (over 1000&#8197;cycles for half&#8208;cell; 300&#8197;cycles for pouch&#8208;cell). More importantly, sustainable NCM&#8208;811//Li pouch&#8208;cell with negligible capacity decay can also be obtained through using recyclable zeolite sieved electrolyte. This conceptually&#8208;new way in preparing safe and highly&#8208;efficient electrolyte by using low&#8208;price molecular sieve would accelerate the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion/lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Probing Interfacial Electronic Effects on Single&#8208;Molecule Adsorption Geometry and Electron Transport at Atomically Flat Surfaces</title>

STM breaking junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy techniques have been successfully applied to probe a solvent modification induced interfacial electronic effect on tuning contact geometries and electron transport of pyridyl molecules at atomically flat Au (111). Modulation of binding geometry from vertical to tilted and flat is observed and a 316&#8201;% modulation of single&#8208;molecule conductance is achieved.







Abstract
Clarifying interfacial electronic effects on molecular adsorption is significant in many chemical and biochemical processes. Here, we used STM breaking junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy to probe electron transport and adsorption geometries of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (4,4&#8242;&#8208;BPY) at Au(111). Modifying the surface with 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation&#8208;containing ionic liquids (ILs) decreases surface electron density and stabilizes a vertical orientation of pyridine through nitrogen atom &#963;&#8208;bond interactions, resulting in uniform adsorption configurations for forming molecular junctions. Modulation from vertical, tilted, to flat, is achieved on adding water to ILs, leading to a new peak ascribed to CC stretching of adsorbed pyridyl ring and 316&#8201;% modulation of single&#8208;molecule conductance. The dihedral angle between adsorbed pyridyl ring and surface decreases with increasing surface electronic density, enhancing electron donation from surface to pyridyl ring.

         <title>Controlling Catenation in Germanium(I) Chemistry through Hemilability</title>

A new approach for the rational construction of chains of Group&#8197;14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8211;metal bonds is reported, which exploits hemilabile ancillary ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The resulting oligo&#8208;dimetallyne chains feature alternating single and double metal&#8211;metal bonds.







Abstract
We present a novel approach for constructing chains of Group&#8197;14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8211;metal bonds that exploits hemilabile ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The formation/nature of catenated species (oligo&#8208;dimetallynes) can be controlled by the use of (acidic/basic) &#8220;protecting groups&#8221; and through variation of the ligand scaffold. Reduction of ArNiPr2GeCl (ArNiPr2=2,6&#8208;(iPr2NCH2)2C6H3)&#8212;featuring hemilabile NiPr2 donors&#8212;yields (ArNiPr2Ge)4 (2), which contains a tetrameric Ge4 chain. 2 represents a novel type of a linear homo&#8208;catenated GeI compound featuring unsupported E&#8722;E bonds. Trapping experiments reveal that a key structural component is the central two&#8208;way Ge=Ge donor&#8208;acceptor bond: reactions with IMe4 and W(CO)5(NMe3) give the base&#8208; or acid&#8208;stabilized digermynes (ArNiPr2Ge(IMe4))2 (4) and (ArNiPr2Ge{W(CO)5})2 (5), respectively. The use of smaller N&#8208;donors leads to stronger Ge&#8208;N interactions and quenching of catenation behaviour: reduction of ArNEt2GeCl gives the digermyne (ArNEt2Ge)2, while the unsymmetrical system ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2 dimerizes to give tetranuclear (ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2)2 through aggregation at the NiPr2&#8208;ligated GeI centres.

         <title>Mechanism of the Arene&#8208;Limited Nondirected C&#8722;H Activation of Arenes with Palladium**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15641-15649, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanistic study of the dual&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled directing&#8208;group&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation of arenes with palladium catalysts and the arene as limiting reagent is described. A detailed experimental and computational investigation supports a 1:1:1 complex of palladium and the two complementary ligands as the active species that enables a partially rate&#8208;limiting concerted C&#8722;H activation as part of a Pd0/PdII cycle.







Abstract
Recently palladium catalysts have been discovered that enable the directing&#8208;group&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation of arenes without requiring an excess of the arene substrate, thereby enabling methods for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex organic molecules. The key to success has been the use of two complementary ligands, an N&#8208;acyl amino acid and an N&#8208;heterocycle. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies on the dual&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled C&#8722;H activation of arenes have led us to identify the catalytically active species and a transition state model that explains the exceptional activity and selectivity of these catalysts. These findings are expected to be highly useful for further method development using this powerful class of catalysts.

         <title>Electrolyte Structure of Lithium Polysulfides with Anti&#8208;Reductive Solvent Shells for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15503-15509, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte structure of lithium polysulfides (PSs) with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proven to be a key reason for the decreased reactivity of PSs towards Li. With isopropyl ether as a cosolvent, the reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. The stability of practical Li&#8211;S batteries was improved and a pouch cell of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated.







Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising secondary battery. However, constant parasitic reactions between the Li anode and soluble polysulfide (PS) intermediates significantly deteriorate the working Li anode. The rational design to inhibit the parasitic reactions is plagued by the inability to understand and regulate the electrolyte structure of PSs. Herein, the electrolyte structure of PSs with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled by molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proven to be a key reason for the decreased reactivity of PSs towards Li. With isopropyl ether (DIPE) as a cosolvent, DIPE molecules tend to distribute in the outer solvent shell due to poor solvating power. Furthermore, DIPE is more stable than conventional ether solvents against Li metal. The reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. Consequently, the cycling performance of working Li&#8211;S batteries was significantly improved and a pouch cell of 300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated. The fundamental understanding in this work provides an unprecedented ground to understand the electrolyte structure of PSs and the rational electrolyte design in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Large Telluroxane Bowls Connected by a Layer of Iodine Ions</title>

Large telluroxane clusters are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI3]2 or the oxidation of [PhTe]2 with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. They consist of two half&#8208;spheres with {(PhTe)19O24}9+ networks, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The central {PhTe}3+ units of each half&#8208;sphere can be replaced by other metal ions. Mass spectrometry shows that the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.







Abstract
Phenyltelluroxane clusters of the composition [{(PhTe)19O24}2I18(solv)] (1) are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI3]2 or the oxidation of various phenyltellurium(II) compounds with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. The compounds consist of two half&#8208;spheres with a {(PhTe)19O24}9+ network, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The spherical clusters can accommodate solvent molecules such as pyridine or methanol in the center of two rings formed by iodine atoms. The presence of other metal ions during the cluster formation results in a selective replacement of the central {PhTe}3+ units of each half&#8208;sphere as has been demonstrated with the isolation of [{(PhTe)18({Ca(H2O)2}O24}2I16] (2) and [{(PhTe)18({Y(NO3)(H2O)}O24}2I16] (3). A crownether&#8208;like coordination by six oxygen atoms of the telluroxane network is found for the {Ca(H2O}2}2+ and {Y(NO3)(H2O)}2+ building blocks. Mass spectrometric studies show that considerable amounts of the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.

         <title>Quantitative and Multiplexed Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Intercellular Tensile Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15548-15555, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescence lifetime imaging&#8208;based cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA hairpin probe is designed to measure tensile forces at cell&#8211;cell junctions. The tension among multiple ligand&#8211;receptor pairs can be quantified simultaneously during cellular processes such as the epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition.







Abstract
Mechanical interactions between cells have been shown to play critical roles in regulating cell signaling and communications. However, the precise measurement of intercellular forces is still quite challenging, especially considering the complex environment at cell&#8211;cell junctions. In this study, we report a fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based approach to image and quantify intercellular molecular tensions. Using this method, tensile forces among multiple ligand&#8211;receptor pairs can be measured simultaneously. We first validated our approach and developed lifetime measurement&#8208;based DNA tension probes to image E&#8208;cadherin&#8208;mediated tension on epithelial cells. These probes were then further applied to quantify the correlations between E&#8208;cadherin and N&#8208;cadherin tensions during an epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition process. The modular design of these probes can potentially be used to study the mechanical features of various physiological and pathological processes.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Pyrrole &#945;&#8208;Cleavage with Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: Enzyme Model by Structural Constraint</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15632-15640, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of triplet dioxygen with closed shell molecules is formally spin&#8208;forbidden. Nature overcomes this prohibition by a variety of enzymes. The surprising reactivity of calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate with O2 is described and the spin&#8208;inversion process is analyzed. The square&#8208;planar aluminates transpire as enzyme models that substantiate the critical role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity and structural constraint for the functions of aerobic life.







Abstract
The present work describes the reaction of triplet dioxygen with the porphyrinogenic calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates to alkylperoxido aluminates in high selectivity. Multiconfigurational quantum chemical computations disclose the mechanism for this spin&#8208;forbidden process. Despite a negligible spin&#8211;orbit coupling constant, the intersystem crossing (ISC) is facilitated by singlet and triplet state degeneracy and spin&#8211;vibronic coupling. The formed peroxides are stable toward external substrates but undergo an unprecedented oxidative pyrrole &#945;&#8208;cleavage by ligand aromatization/dearomatization&#8208;initiated O&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission. A detailed comparison of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates with dioxygen&#8208;related enzymology provides insights into the ISC of metal&#8208; or cofactor&#8208;free enzymes. It substantiates the importance of structural constraint and element&#8211;ligand cooperativity for the functions of aerobic life.

         <title>Halide Replacement with Complete Preservation of Crystal Lattice in Mixed&#8208;Anion Lanthanide Oxyhalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15582-15589, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical halide ion replacement in lanthanide oxyiodide nanostructures proceeds with complete preservation of the tetragonal matlockite crystal structure along a gradient of increasing anion hardness. Reformation of the anion lattice around the intact cation slabs impedes 5D3&#8208;5D4 phonon&#8208;assisted cross relaxation and is observed as a distinctive blue hue for an embedded quantum reporter.







Abstract
A challenge in anion control in periodic solids is to preserve the crystal lattice while substituting for different anions of widely varying size and hardness. Post&#8208;synthetic modification routes that place cations or anions in non&#8208;equilibrium configurations are promising; however, such methods remain relatively unexplored for anion placement. Here, we report the synthesis of LaOI nanocrystals by a non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel condensation reaction and their transformation into LaOBr, LaOCl, and LaOF nanocrystals along hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principles using post&#8208;synthetic metathesis reactions with ammonium halides. Anion displacement proceeds along halide planes, preserving the tetragonal matlockite structure. Energy&#8208;variant X&#8208;ray excited optical luminesce signatures of alloyed Tb3+&#8208;ions is a sensitive quantum reporter of the preservation of the cation sublattice and hardening of the crystal structure upon anion replacement.

         <title>Engineering Nanoparticulate Organic Photocatalysts via a Scalable Flash Nanoprecipitation Process for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15590-15597, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with rationally designed hydrophilic polymers to prepare nanoparticulate photocatalysts is presented. It is effective in addressing limitations of bulky particles and greatly improving the photocatalytic activity. This nanostructure engineering is promising for scale&#8208;up owing to the continuous operation of FNP, leading to potential practical applications of solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions.







Abstract
Directly converting sunlight into hydrogen fuels using particulate photocatalysts represents a sustainable route for clean energy supply. Organic semiconductors have emerged as attractive candidates but always suffer from optical and exciton recombination losses with large exciton &#8220;dead zone&#8221; inside the bulk material, severely limiting the catalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy that combines a scalable flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with hydrophilic soluble polymers (PC&#8208;PEG5 and PS&#8208;PEG5) to prepare highly efficient nanosized photocatalysts without using surfactants. Significantly, a 70&#8208;fold enhancement of hydrogen evolution rate (HER) is achieved for nanosized PC&#8208;PEG5, and the FNP&#8208;processed PS&#8208;PEG5 shows a peak HER rate of up to 37.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under full&#8208;spectrum sunlight irradiation, which is among the highest results for polymer photocatalysts. A scaling&#8208;up production of nanocatalyst is demonstrated with the continuously operational FNP.

&lt;p&gt;A flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with rationally designed hydrophilic polymers to prepare nanoparticulate photocatalysts is presented. It is effective in addressing limitations of bulky particles and greatly improving the photocatalytic activity. This nanostructure engineering is promising for scale-up owing to the continuous operation of FNP, leading to potential practical applications of solar-to-chemical energy conversions.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly converting sunlight into hydrogen fuels using particulate photocatalysts represents a sustainable route for clean energy supply. Organic semiconductors have emerged as attractive candidates but always suffer from optical and exciton recombination losses with large exciton &#8220;dead zone&#8221; inside the bulk material, severely limiting the catalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy that combines a scalable flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) method with hydrophilic soluble polymers (&lt;b&gt;PC-PEG5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PS-PEG5&lt;/b&gt;) to prepare highly efficient nanosized photocatalysts without using surfactants. Significantly, a 70-fold enhancement of hydrogen evolution rate (HER) is achieved for nanosized &lt;b&gt;PC-PEG5&lt;/b&gt;, and the FNP-processed &lt;b&gt;PS-PEG5&lt;/b&gt; shows a peak HER rate of up to 37.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under full-spectrum sunlight irradiation, which is among the highest results for polymer photocatalysts. A scaling-up production of nanocatalyst is demonstrated with the continuously operational FNP.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Divergent Strategy for Site&#8208;Selective Radical Disulfuration of Carboxylic Acids with Trisulfide&#8208;1,1&#8208;Dioxides</title>

Trisulfide&#8208;1,1&#8208;dioxides undergo rapid homolytic substitution with alkyl radicals. This has enabled the development of an oxidative photocatalytic approach for the direct conversion of carboxylic acids into disulfides as well as a related approach for the installation of a disulfide moiety by remote C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
The direct conversion of carboxylic acids into disulfides is described. The approach employs oxidative photocatalysis for base&#8208;promoted decarboxylation of the substrate, which yields an alkyl radical that reacts with a trisulfide dioxide through homolytic substitution. The trisulfide dioxides are easily prepared by a newly described approach. 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176; carboxylic acids with varied substitution are good substrates, including amino acids and substrates with highly activated C&#8722;H bonds. Trisulfide dioxides are also used to achieve the &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H disulfuration of amides through a radical relay sequence. In both reactions, the sulfonyl radical that results from substitution propagates the reaction. Factors governing the selectivity of substitution at S2 versus S3 of the trisulfide dioxides have been explored.

         <title>Degradation in Order: Simple and Versatile One&#8208;Pot Combination of Two Macromolecular Concepts to Encode Diverse and Spatially Regulated Degradability Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15482-15489, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual polymerization approach creates new possibilities to access polymeric materials with sequence&#8208;controlled primary structure and diverse degradable bonds. The methodology is overall simple and effective and involves an in situ organocatalyst switch, which leads to different polymerization mechanisms, and as a consequence, specific degradability functions are encoded.







Abstract
The clever one&#8208;pot combination of two macromolecular concepts, ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and step&#8208;growth polymerization (SGP), is demonstrated to be a simple, yet powerful tool to design a library of sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with diverse and spatially regulated degradability functions. ROP and SGP occur sequentially at room temperature when the organocatalytic conditions are switched from basic to acidic, and each allows the encoding of specific degradable bonds. ROP controls the sequence length and position of the degradability functions, while SGP between the complementary vinyl ether and hydroxyl chain&#8208;ends enables the formation of acetal bonds and high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass copolymers. The result is the rational combination of cleavable bonds prone to either bulk or surface erosion within the same macromolecule. The strategy is versatile and offers higher chemical diversity and level of control over the primary structure than current aliphatic polyesters or polycarbonates, while being simple, effective, and atom&#8208;economical and having potential for scalability.

The controlled oxidation from thioether to sulfoxide and sulfone groups is a new post&#8208;synthetic modification to achieve the stimuli&#8208;responsive structural transformation from the molecular Borromean ring to tetranuclear metallacycles.







Abstract
A Cp*&#8208;Rh based D&#8208;shaped binuclear metallacycle and a template&#8208;free molecular Borromean ring (BR) were obtained in high yield using the semi&#8208;rigid thioether dipyridyl ligand 1,4&#8208;bis[(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylthio)methyl]benzene (Bptmb). The topological transformation from a binuclear metallacycle and a BR to tetranuclear metallacycles was realized via the controlled oxidation of thioethers. The strategy used in this work can be regarded as a new form of stimuli&#8208;responsive post&#8208;synthesis modification (PSM).

A range of functionalized organomagnesium halides and enol lactones underwent rhenium&#8208;catalyzed sequential arylation&#8211;acyl cyclization under mild reaction conditions, thus providing an expedient route to polyfunctionalized indenones with complete control of regioselectivity. This approach features a broad substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and synthetic utility in the straightforward synthesis of biologically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A set of rhenium&#8208;catalyzed arylation&#8211;acyl cyclizations between (hetero)arylmagnesium halides and enol lactones through a cascade C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2)/C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) bond formation under mild reaction conditions has been developed. Indeed, a wide range of functional groups on both organomagnesium halides and enol lactones is well tolerated by the simple rhenium catalysis, thus furnishing polyfunctionalized indenones in one&#8208;pot fashion and with complete control of the regioselectivity. Moreover, this approach also provides a straightforward synthetic route to neolignan and (iso)pauciflorol&#8197;F. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reaction involves a sequence of syn&#8208;carborhenation and intramolecular nucleophilic addition.

Relying on principles of supramolecular chemistry, this manuscript describes the design, characterization, and implementation of a method for the generation of artificial (non&#8208;luminescent) colors for MRI applications. The proposed approach, which is termed GEST, exploits the reversible binding of inhalable biocompatible fluorinated agent to macrocycle hosts for micromolar detectability of host&#8211;guest complexes using background&#8208;free 19F&#8208;MRI.







Abstract
The weak thermal polarization of nuclear spins limits the sensitivity of MRI, even for MR&#8208;sensitive nuclei as fluorine&#8208;19. Therefore, despite being the source of inspiration for the development of background&#8208;free MRI for various applications, including for multiplexed imaging, the inability to map very low concentrations of targets using 19F&#8208;MRI raises the need to further enhance this platform's capabilities. Here, we employ the principles of CEST&#8208;MRI in 19F&#8208;MRI to obtain a 900&#8208;fold signal amplification of a biocompatible fluorinated agent, which can be presented in a &#8220;multicolor&#8221; fashion. Capitalizing on the dynamic interactions in host&#8211;guest supramolecular assemblies in an approach termed GEST, we demonstrate that an inhalable fluorinated anesthetic can be used as a single 19F&#8208;probe for the concurrent detection of micromolar levels of two targets, with potential in vivo translatability. Further extending GEST with new designs could expand the applicability of 19F&#8208;MRI to the mapping of targets that have so&#8208;far remained non&#8208;detectable.

     alt="Single Fluorinated Agent for Multiplexed 19F-MRI with Micromolar Detectability Based on Dynamic Exchange"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on principles of supramolecular chemistry, this manuscript describes the design, characterization, and implementation of a method for the generation of artificial (non-luminescent) colors for MRI applications. The proposed approach, which is termed GEST, exploits the reversible binding of inhalable biocompatible fluorinated agent to macrocycle hosts for micromolar detectability of host&#8211;guest complexes using background-free &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-MRI.

         <title>The Cytochrome P450 Catalyzing C&#8722;S Bond Formation in S&#8208;Heterocyclization of Chuangxinmycin Biosynthesis</title>

Cytochrome P450 CxnD exhibited C&#8722;S bond forming activity in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis, generating the unique tricyclic indole&#8208;S&#8208;hetero scaffold from thiol intermediates. Structural characterization of CxnD with a substrate analogue proposed a radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group of the substrate.







Abstract
Microbial sulfur&#8208;containing secondary metabolites show various biological activities, but the C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming in their biosynthetic metabolism has not been thoroughly understood. Here, we present genetic, biochemical and structural characterization of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CxnD exhibiting C&#8722;S bond forming activity in S&#8208;heterocyclization of chuangxinmycin biosynthesis. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that CxnD generated an indole&#8208;fused dihydrothiopyran skeleton from a L&#8208;Trp&#8208;derived thiol intermediate. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray crystal structure of CxnD in complex with a substrate analogue and structure&#8208;based mutagenesis revealed intimate details of the substrate binding mode. A radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group of the substrate was proposed for CxnD, which provided valuable insights into the molecular basis for the intra&#8208;molecular C(sp2)&#8722;H thiolation by the P450 in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis.

         <title>The Role of Rotational Motion in Diffusion NMR Experiments on Supramolecular Assemblies: Application to Sup35NM Fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15445-15451, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusion of amyloid fibrils that contain disordered domains can be captured by pulsed&#8208;field&#8208;gradient NMR experiments. A new theory is presented that interprets the results of these measurements in terms of fibrils&#8217; translational and rotational motion. Application to Sup35NM fibrils demonstrates the feasibility of diffusion&#8208;based sorting in complex amyloidogenic samples.







Abstract
Pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG) NMR is an important tool for characterization of biomolecules and supramolecular assemblies. However, for micrometer&#8208;sized objects, such as amyloid fibrils, these experiments become difficult to interpret because in addition to translational diffusion they are also sensitive to rotational diffusion. We have constructed a mathematical theory describing the outcome of PFG NMR experiments on rod&#8208;like fibrils. To test its validity, we have studied the fibrils formed by Sup35NM segment of the prion protein Sup35. The interpretation of the PFG NMR data in this system is fully consistent with the evidence from electron microscopy. Contrary to some previously expressed views, the signals originating from disordered regions in the fibrils can be readily differentiated from the similar signals representing small soluble species (e.g. proteolytic fragments). This paves the way for diffusion&#8208;sorted NMR experiments on complex amyloidogenic samples.

A comprehensive understanding of the host&#8211;guest chemistry of MFM&#8208;520 at a molecular level rationalises the observed high selectivity towards olefins, and informs future designs of improved materials for challenging olefin/paraffin separations in industry.







Abstract
Industrial purification of propylene and ethylene requires cryogenic distillation and selective hydrogenation over palladium catalysts to remove propane, ethane and/or trace amounts of acetylene. Here, we report the excellent separation of equimolar mixtures of propylene/propane and ethylene/ethane, and of a 1/100 mixture of acetylene/ethylene by a highly robust microporous material, MFM&#8208;520, under dynamic conditions. In situ synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and analysis of adsorption thermodynamic parameters reveal that a series of synergistic host&#8211;guest interactions involving hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions underpin the cooperative binding of alkenes within the pore. Notably, the optimal pore geometry of the material enables selective accommodation of acetylene. The practical potential of this porous material has been demonstrated by fabricating mixed&#8208;matrix membranes comprising MFM&#8208;520, Matrimid and PIM&#8208;1, and these exhibit not only a high permeability for propylene (&#8776;1984 Barrer), but also a separation factor of 7.8 for an equimolar mixture of propylene/propane at 298&#8197;K.

A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes with arylboronic compounds has been developed to provide an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
The C&#8722;C bond formation reaction represents a fundamental and important transformation in synthetic chemistry, and exploring new types of C&#8722;C bond formation reactions is recognized as appealing, yet challenging. Herein, we disclose the first example of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes with arylboronic compounds, thereby providing an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemoselectivity. In this method, C(aryl)&#8722;C(alkenyl) and C(alkenyl)&#8722;C(alkenyl) bonds in various alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes can be cleaved via a hydrometalation and followed by &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination pathway for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions. Furthermore, a series of novel organic fluorescent molecules with excellent photophysical properties has been efficiently constructed with this protocol.

An azidosugar ZIF&#8208;8 carrier camouflaged with cancer cell membranes was devised to mimic cancer cell behaviors, and it accomplished cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective metabolic glycan labeling (MGL) in vivo. With abundant receptors, this biomimetic platform not only selectively targets homotypic cells but also realizes selective MGL for different breast cancer subtypes.







Abstract
Metabolic glycan labeling (MGL) followed by bioorthogonal chemistry provides a powerful tool for tumor imaging and therapy. However, selectively metabolic labeling of cells or tissues of interest remains a challenge. Particularly, owing to tumor heterogeneity including tumor subtypes and interpatient heterogeneity, it is far more difficult to realize tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;selective metabolic labeling for precise diagnosis. Inspired by nature, we designed azidosugar&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks camouflaged with cancer cell membranes to accomplish cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective MGL in vivo. With abundant receptors, this biomimetic platform not only selectively targets homotypic cells but also realizes different breast cancer subtype&#8208;selective MGL. Moreover, the endo/lysosomal&#8208;escaped ZIF&#8208;8 can make azidosugar escape from lysosomes and accelerate its metabolic incorporation. This strategy also takes advantage of cancer&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived cell membranes, which may have huge potential for personalized diagnosis and therapy.

A facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy is developed for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores, which exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol.







Abstract
Hybrid nanomaterials with controlled dimensions, intriguing components and ordered structures have attracted significant attention in nanoscience and technology. Herein, we report a facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores. By using various polyoxometallates such as ammonium phosphomolybdate, silicotungstic acid, and phosphotungstic acid, our approach can be generalized to synthesize ordered mesoporous hybrid nanostructures with diverse compositions and morphologies (nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical architectures, nanospheres, and nanorods). Moreover, the ordered mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical hybrids with molecularly dispersed POMs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol with the high isobutene selectivity (100&#8201;%) and long&#8208;term catalytic durability (80&#8197;h).

         <title>ZIF&#8208;Based Nanoparticles Combine X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Nitrosative Stress with Autophagy Management for Hypoxic Prostate Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15472-15481, July 5, 2021. </description>

X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered nitrite (NO2&#8722;) is used for hypoxic prostate cancer therapy by inhibiting protective autophagy and inducing lethal nitrosative stress based on ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP. After entering tumor cells, the released 2&#8208;nitroimidazole ligands capture low&#8208;energy electrons derived from X&#8208;rays to produce NO2&#8722;, and the Zn2+ inhibits the migration and invasion of tumor cells.







Abstract
Although reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor treatments are predominant in clinical applications, ROS&#8208;induced protective autophagy promotes cell survival, especially in hypoxic tumors. Herein, X&#8208;ray triggered nitrite (NO2&#8722;) is used for hypoxic prostate cancer therapy by inhibiting autophagy and inducing nitrosative stress based on an electrophilic zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP). After internalization of pH&#8208;responsive ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP nanoparticles, electrophilic ligands and Zn2+ are delivered into cancer cells. Electrophilic ligands can not only consume GSH under hypoxia but also capture low&#8208;energy electrons derived from X&#8208;rays to generate NO2&#8722;, which inhibits autophagy and further elevates lethal nitrosative stress levels. In addition, dissociated Zn2+ specifically limits the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through ion interference. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results indicate that ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP nanoparticles under X&#8208;ray irradiation can effectively promote the apoptosis of hypoxic prostate cancer cells. Overall, this nitrosative stress&#8208;mediated tumor therapy strategy provides a novel approach targeting hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Rational Design of a Highly Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe for Imaging Orthotopic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15418-15425, July 5, 2021. </description>

In this report, we show that a carbamate as recognition unit has an excellent selectivity for a hepatocellular carcinoma chemotherapy (HCC)&#8208;related biomarker (carboxylesterase, CE) without interference from other hydrolases. We developed a near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe with high selectivity and strong fluorescence signals towards CE activity, enabling it to successfully monitor CE activity for evaluating HCC chemotherapy in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Selective fluorescence imaging of biomarkers in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;situ for evaluating orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) chemotherapy remains a great challenge due to current imaging agents suffering from the potential interferences of other hydrolases. Herein, we observed that carbamate unit showed a high selectivity toward the HCC&#8208;related biomarker carboxylesterase (CE) for evaluation of treatment. A near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe was developed to not only specially image CE activity in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;situ but also target orthotopic liver tumor after systemic administration. The in&#8197;vivo signals of the probe correlate well with tumor apoptosis, making it possible to evaluate the status of treatment. The probe enables the imaging of CE activity in&#8197;situ with a high&#8208;resolution three&#8208;dimensional view for the first time. This study may promote advances in optical imaging approaches for precise imaging&#8208;guided diagnosis of HCC in&#8197;situ and its evaluation of treatment.

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry Uncovers Guest&#8208;Induced Distortions in a Supramolecular Organometallic Metallosquare</title>

We present an ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) study on the encapsulation characteristics of a shape&#8208;adaptable organometallic metallocage, and demonstrate that IM&#8208;MS in combination with DFT calculations constitutes a reliable approach to quantify distortions experienced by the host upon guest encapsulation.







Abstract
The encapsulation of the tetracationic palladium metallosquare with four pyrene&#8208;bis&#8208;imidazolylidene ligands [1]4+ with a series of organic molecules was studied by Electrospray ionization Travelling Wave Ion&#8208;Mobility Mass Spectrometry (ESI TWIM&#8208;MS). The method allowed to determine the Collision Cross Sections (CCSs), which were used to assess the size changes experienced by the host upon encapsulation of the guest molecules. When fullerenes were used as guests, the host is expanded &#916;CCS 13&#8197;&#197;2 and 23&#8197;&#197;2, for C60 or C70, respectively. The metallorectangle [1]4+ was also used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide (NTCDI), to form complexes of formula [(NTCDI)2(PAH)@1]4+. For these host:guest adducts, the ESI IM&#8208;MS studies revealed that [1]4+ is expanded by 47&#8211;49&#8197;&#197;2.. The energy&#8208;minimized structures of [1]4+, [C60@1]4+, [C70@1]4+, [(NTCDI)2(corannulene)@1]4+ in the gas phase were obtained by DFT calculations.Introduction

&lt;p&gt;The encapsulation of the tetracationic palladium metallosquare with four pyrene-bis-imidazolylidene ligands [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; with a series of organic molecules was studied by Electrospray ionization Travelling Wave Ion-Mobility Mass Spectrometry (ESI TWIM-MS). The method allowed to determine the Collision Cross Sections (CCSs), which were used to assess the size changes experienced by the host upon encapsulation of the guest molecules. When fullerenes were used as guests, the host is expanded &#916;CCS 13&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 23&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, for C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The metallorectangle [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; was also used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide (NTCDI), to form complexes of formula [(NTCDI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PAH)@&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. For these host:guest adducts, the ESI IM-MS studies revealed that [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; is expanded by 47&#8211;49&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.. The energy-minimized structures of [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, [C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, [C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, [(NTCDI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(corannulene)@&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; in the gas phase were obtained by DFT calculations.Introduction&lt;/p&gt;

A quenching&#8208;to&#8208;dequenching switch of fluorescence&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in biological environments is unveiled by Chun&#8208;Xia Zhao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;15426. With dye molecules in a solid state, the release and/or degradation of the dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in biological environments led to a several&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence intensity due to the state switch, which has significant implications in quantitative cell uptake and biodistribution studies.

Leucinostatins are fascinating natural substances, with high potency against many pathogens, but their acute toxicity has prevented therapeutic use. Michael Adams, Rainer Riedl, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate in the Research Article on page&#8197;15613 how these can be converted into synthetically more accessible and more selective antiprotozoal agents with broad efficacy and undetectable resistance.

Temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization explores the thermodynamics of hybrid quadruplex&#8211;duplex oligonucleotide assemblies comprising multiple domains and brings insight into mutual domain interaction. As described by Renato Zenobi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;15390, thermal denaturation experiments were conducted to reveal unfolding intermediates and changes in the thermodynamics of DNA complexes depending on the number of domains and their position in a single MS experiment.

After more than seven decades, Criegee intermediates (CIs) are back at the forefront of modern chemistry. They play an important role in the mechanisms of chemical reactions, total synthesis, pharmaceuticals, climate&#8208;controlling aerosol formation, as well as atmospheric chemistry. This Minireview summarizes key aspects of CIs, highlights recent progress in CI chemistry, and illustrates possibilities for further investigations.







Abstract
After more than 70&#8197;years since their discovery, Criegee intermediates (CIs) are back at the forefront of modern chemistry of short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates. They play an important role in the mechanistic context of chemical synthesis, total synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and, most importantly, climate&#8208;controlling aerosol formation as well as atmospheric chemistry. This Minireview summarizes key aspects of CIs (from the mechanism of formation, for example, by ozonolysis of alkenes and photolysis methods employing diiodo and diazo compounds, to their electronic structures and chemical reactivity), highlights the most recent findings and some landmark results of gas&#8208;phase kinetics, and detection/measurements. The recent progress in synthetic and mechanistic studies in the chemistry of CIs provides a guide to illustrate the possibilities for further investigations in this exciting field.

         <title>The Role of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks in Electronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15192-15212, July 5, 2021. </description>

Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that respond to physical and chemical stimuli are promising materials for electronic sensors owing to their outstanding sensing performance. In this Review, the functionality of MOFs as a mass&#8208;loaded layer, filtration layer, electronic function layer, and optically sensitive layer is discussed.







Abstract
MOFs have a highly ordered self&#8208;assembled nanostructure, high surface area, nanoporosity with tunable size and shape, reliable host&#8211;guest interactions, and responsiveness to physical and chemical stimuli which can be exploited to address critical issues in sensor applications. On the one hand, the nanoscale pore size of MOFs ranging from less than 1&#8197;nm to &#8776;&#8197;10&#8197;nm not only allows the diffusion of small molecules into the pores or through the MOF layer, but also excludes other larger molecules depending on the size, shape, and conformation of MOFs. On the other hand, MOFs with flexible structure exhibit a dynamic response to external stimuli, including guest molecules, temperature, pressure, pH, and light. Due to the unsaturated coordination metal sites and active functional groups, the interaction between certain analytes and active sites results in high selectivity. In this review, we summarize the latest studies on MOF&#8208;based electronic sensors in terms of the function of MOFs, discuss challenges, and suggest perspectives.

Metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, polymers, and composites are disruptive key technologies for gas separation membranes. This Minireview highlights the state of the art in materials and material development and their utilization in membrane applications in highly relevant processes such as carbon capture, energy&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient separations of basic chemicals, and quantum sieving.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been thoroughly investigated with regards to applications in gas separation membranes in the past years. More recently, new preparation methods for MOFs and COFs as particles and thin&#8208;film membranes, as well as for mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) have been developed. We will highlight novel processes and highly functional materials: Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) can be transformed into glasses and we will give an insight into their use for membranes. In addition, liquids with permanent porosity offer solution processability for the manufacture of extremely potent MMMs. Also, MOF materials influenced by external stimuli give new directions for the enhancement of performance by in situ techniques. Presently, COFs with their large pores are useful in quantum sieving applications, and by exploiting the stacking behavior also molecular sieving COF membranes are possible. Similarly, porous polymers can be constructed using MOF templates, which then find use in gas separation membranes.

This review summarizes the outer&#8208;surface interactions of cucurbit[n]urils (OSIQ) in various simple cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;based supramolecular frameworks (QSFs) and QSFs assembled via self&#8208;induced OSIQ, anion&#8208;induced OSIQs, and aromatic&#8208;induced OSIQs. The design and construction of QSFs with novel structures and specific functional properties establishes a new research direction in cucurbit[n]uril chemistry.







Abstract
Porous materials, especially metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and supramolecular organic frameworks, are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange. Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s) suitable building units for porous materials because they possess cavities with neutral electrostatic potential, portal carbonyls with negative electrostatic potential, and outer surfaces with positive electrostatic potential, which may result in the formation of Q[n]&#8208;based supramolecular frameworks (QSFs) assembled through the interaction of guests within Q[n]s, the coordination of Q[n]s with metal ions, and outer&#8208;surface interaction of Q[n]s (OSIQ). This review summarizes the various QSFs assembled via OSIQs. The QSFs can be classified as being assembled by 1)&#8197;self&#8208;induced OSIQ, 2)&#8197;anion&#8208;induced OSIQ, and 3)&#8197;aromatic&#8208;induced OSIQ. The design and construction of QSFs with novel structures and specific functional properties may establish a new research direction in Q[n] chemistry.

         <title>Reversible Supra&#8208;Folding of User&#8208;Programmed Functional DNA Nanostructures on Fuzzy Cationic Substrates</title>

User&#8208;defined DNA nanostructures (origamis, nanogrids) undergo an astonishing higher&#8208;order folding transition, referred to as supra&#8208;folding, when they adsorb on soft cationic polymeric surfaces. Upon addition of a competitive anionic polyelectrolyte, supra&#8208;folded origamis unfold back to their original shape with preserved structural features and site&#8208;specific functionality (tethered function or protein).







Abstract
We report that user&#8208;defined DNA nanostructures, such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) origamis and nanogrids, undergo a rapid higher&#8208;order folding transition, referred to as supra&#8208;folding, into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) compact structures (origamis) or well&#8208;defined &#956;m&#8208;long ribbons (nanogrids), when they adsorb on a soft cationic substrate prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition of polyelectrolytes. Once supra&#8208;folded, origamis can be switched back on the surface into their 2D original shape through addition of heparin, a highly charged anionic polyelectrolyte known as an efficient competitor of DNA&#8208;polyelectrolyte complexation. Orthogonal to DNA base&#8208;pairing principles, this reversible structural reconfiguration is also versatile; we show in particular that 1)&#8197;it is compatible with various origami shapes, 2)&#8197;it perfectly preserves fine structural details as well as site&#8208;specific functionality, and 3)&#8197;it can be applied to dynamically address the spatial distribution of origami&#8208;tethered proteins.

         <title>The Origin of Catalytic Benzylic C&#8722;H Oxidation over a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15243-15247, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H groups in a broad range of substrates under mild conditions has been achieved using a robust metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;170, incorporating redox&#8208;active [Cu2II(O2CR)4] paddlewheel nodes. EPR spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction have identified the critical role of the paddlewheel moiety in activating the oxidant tBuOOH (tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide) via partial reduction to [CuIICuI(O2CR)4] species.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H compounds to ketones is important for the production of a wide range of fine chemicals, and is often achieved using toxic or precious metal catalysts. Herein, we report the efficient oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H groups in a broad range of substrates under mild conditions over a robust metal&#8211;organic framework material, MFM&#8208;170, incorporating redox&#8208;active [Cu2II(O2CR)4] paddlewheel nodes. A comprehensive investigation employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction has identified the critical role of the paddlewheel moiety in activating the oxidant tBuOOH (tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide) via partial reduction to [CuIICuI(O2CR)4] species.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Magnesium&#8208;Air Battery Based on Dual&#8208;Layer Gel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15317-15322, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte was designed to simultaneously prevent the corrosion of Mg anode and production of the dense passive layer in a Mg&#8208;air battery. The resulting Mg&#8208;air battery exhibited a specific capacity of 2190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on total anodic weight and an energy density of 2282&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the total weight of anode and air electrode. It was further made into a fiber shape with high flexibility.







Abstract
Mg&#8208;air batteries are explored as the next&#8208;generation power systems for wearable and implantable electronics as they could work stably in neutral electrolytes and are also biocompatible. However, high corrosion rate and low utilization of Mg anode largely impair the performance of Mg&#8208;air battery with low discharge voltage, poor specific capacity and low energy density. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we first report a dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte to simultaneously solve the above two problems by preventing the corrosion of Mg anode and the production of dense passive layer, respectively. The resulting Mg&#8208;air batteries produced an average specific capacity of 2190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the total Mg anode (99.3&#8201;% utilization rate of Mg anode) and energy density of 2282&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the total anode and air electrode, both of which are the highest among the reported Mg&#8208;air batteries. Besides, our Mg&#8208;air batteries could be made into a fiber shape, and they were flexible to work stably under various deformations such as bending and twisting.

A machine&#8208;learning, ML, model based on vectors of transition&#8208;state interatomic contacts can predict face&#8208;selectivity of Michael additions or Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions more accurately than traditional ML schemes, energetic calculations, or seasoned organic chemists.







Abstract
This work describes a method to vectorize and Machine&#8208;Learn, ML, non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for scaffold&#8208;directed reactions important in synthetic chemistry. Models trained on this representation predict correct face of approach in ca. 90&#8201;% of Michael additions or Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions. These accuracies are significantly higher than those based on traditional ML descriptors, energetic calculations, or intuition of experienced synthetic chemists. Our results also emphasize the importance of ML models being provided with relevant mechanistic knowledge; without such knowledge, these models cannot easily &#8220;transfer&#8208;learn&#8221; and extrapolate to previously unseen reaction mechanisms.

A practical synthesis of SF5Cl from sulfur powder, dry KF, and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) in MeCN is described. The new synthetic utility of SF5Cl is well demonstrated by the chemoselective hydro(chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of diazo compounds.







Abstract
Pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl) is the most prevalent reagent for the incorporation of SF5 group into organic compounds. However, the preparation of SF5Cl often relies on hazardous reagents and specialized apparatus. Herein, we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solution of SF5Cl in n&#8208;hexane under gas&#8208;reagent&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic application of SF5Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro&#8208; and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K3PO4 or copper catalyst, respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various &#945;&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds of high value for potential applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) is the most prevalent reagent for the incorporation of SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; group into organic compounds. However, the preparation of SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl often relies on hazardous reagents and specialized apparatus. Herein, we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench-stable and easy-to-handle solution of SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl in &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane under gas-reagent-free conditions. The synthetic application of SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro- and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;-diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or copper catalyst, respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various &#945;-pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds of high value for potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Programming Fluorogenic DNA Probes for Rapid Detection of Steroids</title>

Aptamers based on forced intercalation (FIT) were developed to detect steroids such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in clinical human serum samples. These FIT&#8208;aptamers offer several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&lt;30&#8197;min), simple instrumentation (plate&#8208;reader), and low sample volumes (10&#8197;&#956;L).







Abstract
The ability of aptamers to recognize a variety of different molecules has fueled their emergence as recognition agents to probe complex media and cells. Many detection strategies require aptamer binding to its target to result in a dramatic change in structure, typically from an unfolded to a folded state. Here, we report a strategy based on forced intercalation (FIT) that increases the scope of aptamer recognition by transducing subtle changes in aptamer structures into fluorescent readouts. By screening a library of green&#8208;fluorescent FIT&#8208;aptamers whose design is guided by computational modeling, we could identify hits that sense steroids like dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) down to 1.3&#8197;&#956;M with no loss in binding affinity compared to the unmodified aptamer. This enabled us to study DHEAS in clinical serum samples with several advantages over gold standard methods, including rapid readout (&lt;30&#8197;min), simple instrumentation (plate&#8208;reader), and low sample volumes (10&#8197;&#956;L).

         <title>A Green Fluorescent Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Aromatic Belt Containing a [6]Cycloparaphenylene Skeleton</title>

The first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with a [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton ([6]CPP) was conveniently synthesized from calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt showed an enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and a deep cavity, and also exhibited strong green fluorescence and a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belts with conjugated structures still remain a challenge. Here, we report the first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with a [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton, which is conveniently synthesized from the easily available calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt has a rigid conjugated structure and deep cavity, and it can encapsulate one dichloromethane both in solution and in the solid state. Interestingly, the aromatic belt shows strong green fluorescence with a quantum yield of 0.39 and exhibits a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap of 2.02&#8197;eV. The belt&#8208;shaped conjugated structure composed of three carbazole subunits has specific optoelectronic properties that will promote wide applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science.

         <title>High&#8208;Spin Imido Cobalt Complexes with Imidyl Radical Character**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Syntheses and structures of rare trigonal, high&#8208;spin imido cobalt complexes are presented, which have very long Co&#8722;N bonds. Comprehensive spectroscopic studies reveal a radical imidyl character of the imide unit. Computational analyses corroborate these findings and show that the high&#8208;spin state is responsible for the imidyl radical character. The imido cobalt complexes are able to mediate intra&#8208; or intermolecular C&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of a variety of trigonal imido cobalt complexes [Co(NAryl)L2]&#8722;, (L=N(Dipp)SiMe3), Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) with very long Co&#8722;NAryl bonds of around 1.75&#8197;&#197;. Their electronic structure was interrogated using a variety of physical and spectroscopic methods such as EPR or X&#8208;Ray absorption spectroscopy which leads to their description as highly unusual imidyl cobalt complexes. Computational analyses corroborate these findings and further reveal that the high&#8208;spin state is responsible for the imidyl character. Exchange of the Dipp substituent on the imide by the smaller mesityl function (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) effectuates the unexpected Me3Si shift from the ancillary ligand set to the imidyl nitrogen, revealing a highly reactive, nucleophilic character of the imidyl unit.

The low&#8208;temperature performances of zinc&#8211;air batteries are systematically investigated from both theoretical and experimental aspects in terms of feasibility verification, bottleneck analysis, and promotion strategies.







Abstract
Efficient energy storage at low temperatures starves for competent battery techniques. Herein, inherent advantages of zinc&#8211;air batteries on low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage are discovered. The electrode reactions are resistive against low temperatures to render feasible working zinc&#8211;air batteries under sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The relatively reduced ionic conductivity of electrolyte is identified as the main limiting factor, which can be addressed by employing a CsOH&#8208;based electrolyte through regulating the solvation structures. Accordingly, 500&#8197;cycles with a stable voltage gap of 0.8&#8197;V at 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. This work reveals the promising potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries for low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage and inspires advanced battery systems under extreme working conditions.

         <title>Expedient Dual Co/Organophotoredox Catalyzed Stereoselective Synthesis of All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>

         <dc:description>
Co/organophotoredox dual catalysis allows the stereocontrolled synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diol products featuring quaternary carbon centers using vinyl cyclic carbonates and aldehydes as reaction partners. This streamlined method offers a wide scope of syn&#8208;configured products obtained under mild operating conditions, and control reactions suggest that diastereocontrol is exerted within a Zimmerman&#8211;Traxler type transition state.







Abstract
An efficient and attractive Co/organophotoredox dual catalysis protocol has been developed allowing the stereoselective access to a wide variety of syn&#8208;configured 1,3&#8208;diols featuring quaternary carbon centers. The synthesis of the target molecules is achieved under ambient reaction conditions using modular and accessible reagents, substituted vinyl cyclic carbonates and aldehydes, and in short reaction times. Mechanistic control experiments suggest that the stereoselectivity can be rationalized via a preferred Zimmerman&#8211;Traxler transition state comprising a Co(allyl) species and an activated aldehyde. This newly developed process thus expands the use of base metal catalysis in the construction of challenging quaternary carbon stereocenters.

This streamlined method offers a wide scope of &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-configured products obtained under mild operating conditions, and control reactions suggest that diastereocontrol is exerted within a Zimmerman&#8211;Traxler type transition state.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient and attractive Co/organophotoredox dual catalysis protocol has been developed allowing the stereoselective access to a wide variety of syn-configured 1,3-diols featuring quaternary carbon centers. The synthesis of the target molecules is achieved under ambient reaction conditions using modular and accessible reagents, substituted vinyl cyclic carbonates and aldehydes, and in short reaction times. Mechanistic control experiments suggest that the stereoselectivity can be rationalized via a preferred Zimmerman&#8211;Traxler transition state comprising a Co(allyl) species and an activated aldehyde. This newly developed process thus expands the use of base metal catalysis in the construction of challenging quaternary carbon stereocenters.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stabilization of an Enantiopure Sub&#8208;monolayer of Helicene Radical Cations on a Au(111) Surface through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15276-15280, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on noncovalent interactions has been developed to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chirality of the molecules being retained at the nanoscale.







Abstract
In the past few years, the chirality and magnetism of molecules have received notable interest for the development of novel molecular devices. Chiral helicenes combine both these properties, and thus their nanostructuration is the first step toward developing new multifunctional devices. Here, we present a novel strategy to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chemical structure of these molecules being maintained at the nanoscale, as demonstrated by in&#8208;house characterizations. Furthermore, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism confirmed that the handedness of the thia[4]helicene is preserved on the surface.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Pronged Pulmonary Gene Delivery Strategy: A Surface&#8208;Modified Fullerene Nanoparticle and a Hypotonic Vehicle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15225-15229, July 5, 2021. </description>

Tetra(piperazino)fullerene (TPFE)&#8208;based nanoparticles (NPs), surface&#8208;coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), were engineered. The PEGylation allows the NPs to avoid interactions with mucin glycoproteins and phagocytic uptake by macrophages. After the NPs access the target lung cells, a hypotonic vehicle solution enhances their endocytosis via the osmotically driven regulatory volume effect, thereby providing highly efficient transgene expression.







Abstract
Inhaled gene therapy poses a unique potential of curing chronic lung diseases, which are currently managed primarily by symptomatic treatments. However, it has been challenging to achieve therapeutically relevant gene transfer efficacy in the lung due to the presence of numerous biological delivery barriers. Here, we introduce a simple approach that overcomes both extracellular and cellular barriers to enhance gene transfer efficacy in the lung in&#8197;vivo. We endowed tetra(piperazino)fullerene epoxide (TPFE)&#8208;based nanoparticles with non&#8208;adhesive surface polyethylene glycol (PEG) coatings, thereby enabling the nanoparticles to cross the airway mucus gel layer and avoid phagocytic uptake by alveolar macrophages. In parallel, we utilized a hypotonic vehicle to facilitate endocytic uptake of the PEGylated nanoparticles by lung parenchymal cells via the osmotically driven regulatory volume decrease (RVD) mechanism. We demonstrate that this two&#8208;pronged delivery strategy provides safe, wide&#8208;spread and high&#8208;level transgene expression in the lungs of both healthy mice and mice with chronic lung diseases characterized by reinforced delivery barriers.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;In&#8208;Conjugation&#8208;Boosted Organic Semiconductor Gas Sensor Operating at High Temperature and Immune to Moisture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15328-15334, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust NO2 sensor device based on an ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation structure maintained its performance at high temperature, which counteracted the effects of humidity (see picture; NO2 blue/red, H2O green/yellow). Charge transfer between NO2 and the chemiresistor was more efficient at 100&#8201;&#176;C than at room temperature. The fabricated sensor had a parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) NO2 detection limit and showed the highest sensitivity of all reported NO2 chemiresistive sensors.







Abstract
Organic electrical gas sensors have been developed for many decades because of their high sensitivity and selectivity. However, their industrialization is severely hindered by their intrinsic humidity susceptibility and poor recovery. Conventional organic sensory materials can only operate at room temperature owing to their weak intermolecular interactions. Herein, we demonstrate using a croconate polymer (poly&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylcroconate) that the &#8220;ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation&#8221; concept enables organic gas sensors to operate at 100&#8201;&#176;C and 70&#8201;% relative humidity with almost complete recovery. The fabricated sensor had a parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) detection limit for NO2 and showed the highest sensitivity (2526&#8197;ppm&#8722;1 at 40&#8197;ppb) of all reported NO2 chemiresistive sensors. Furthermore, charge transfer increased with temperature. Theoretical calculations and in situ FTIR spectra confirmed the ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation&#8208;inspired hydrogen bond as key for excellent sensitivity. A NO2 alarm system was assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of this sensor.

         <title>Diethynyl Phosphinates for Cysteine&#8208;Selective Protein Labeling and Disulfide Rebridging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15359-15364, July 5, 2021. </description>

Diethynyl phosphonites were found to react specifically with two thiols in aqueous buffer to give constructs that are stable under physiological conditions. This enables the facile generation of protein (double)&#8208;conjugates. Moreover, these molecules can be used to rebridge the interchain disulfides of therapeutic IgG antibodies.







Abstract
Diethynyl phosphinates were developed as bisfunctional electrophiles for the site&#8208;selective modification of peptides, proteins and antibodies. One of their electron&#8208;deficient triple bonds reacts selectively with a thiol and positions an electrophilic moiety for a subsequent intra&#8208; or intermolecular reaction with another thiol. The obtained conjugates were found to be stable in human plasma and in the presence of small thiols. We further demonstrate that this method is suitable for the generation of functional protein conjugates for intracellular delivery. Finally, this reagent class was used to generate functional homogeneously rebridged antibodies that remain specific for their target. Their modular synthesis, thiol selectivity and conjugate stability make diethynyl phosphinates ideal candidates for protein conjugation for biological and pharmaceutical applications.

         <title>Cucurbituril&#8208;Encapsulating Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Mechanochemistry: Adsorbents with Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15365-15370, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry has been applied to achieve one&#8208;pot fabrication of monolithic decamethylcucurbit[5]uril (MC5)&#8208;encapsulating metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The designed MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid material with MC5 as active domains shows enhanced uptake, and selective capture of lead(II) cations at low concentrations. This work opens up the novel possibility of designing task&#8208;specific porous host&#8211;guest hybrid materials on a macroscopic scale.







Abstract
The first examples of monolithic crystalline host&#8211;guest hybrid materials are described. The reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and Fe(NO3)3&#8901;9&#8201;H2O in the presence of decamethylcucurbit[5]uril ammonium chloride (MC5&#8901;2&#8201;NH4Cl&#8901;4&#8201;H2O) directly affords MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid monoliths featuring hierarchical micro&#8208;, meso&#8208; and macropores. Particularly, this &#8220;bottle&#8208;around&#8208;ship&#8221; synthesis and one&#8208;pot shaping are facilitated by a newly discovered Fe&#8208;MC5 flowing gel formed by mechanochemistry. The designed MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid material with MC5 as active domains shows enhanced CH4 and lead(II) uptake performance, and selective capture of lead(II) cations at low concentrations. This shows that host&#8211;guest hybrid materials can exhibit synergic properties that out&#8208;perform materials based on individual components.

&lt;p&gt;Mechanochemistry has been applied to achieve one-pot fabrication of monolithic decamethylcucurbit[5]uril (MC5)-encapsulating metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The designed MC5@MIL-100(Fe) hybrid material with MC5 as active domains shows enhanced uptake, and selective capture of lead(II) cations at low concentrations. This work opens up the novel possibility of designing task-specific porous host&#8211;guest hybrid materials on a macroscopic scale.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrofluorescence Material Based on Pure Organic Phosphor Sensitization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15335-15339, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of electroluminescence films based on a purely organic phosphor sensitizing fluorescence emitter were developed. A series of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#8208;sensitized fluorescent materials with the capacity to break the limitation of 25&#8201;% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) for normal electrofluorescence devices was constructed.







Abstract
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are considered as potential candidates for replacing precious metal complexes to fabricate highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, applications of the reported RTP materials in OLEDs are seriously impeded by their low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) in a thin film state. To overcome these obstacles, we established a new strategy to construct highly efficient OLEDs based on a pure organic RTP material sensitized fluorescence emitter by selecting benzimidazole&#8208;triazine molecules (PIM&#8208;TRZ), 2,6&#8208;di(phenothiazinyl)naphthalene (&#946;&#8208;DPTZN), and 5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraphenylnaphthacene (rubrene) as host, phosphor sensitizer, and fluorescent emitter, respectively. The perfect combination of host, phosphorescent sensitizer, and fluorescent emitter in the emitting layer ensure the outstanding performance of the devices with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.7&#8201;%.

         <title>1,1,2&#8208;Ethenetriol: The Enol of Glycolic Acid, a High&#8208;Energy Prebiotic Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15313-15316, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple yet uncharacterized high energy tautomer of glycolic acid, namely 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol, an important molecule in the abiotic synthesis of sugar acids, has now been identified by IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. With these data now in hand, it now awaits its identification in space as another building block for prebiotic chemistry.







Abstract
As low&#8208;temperature conditions (e.g. in space) prohibit reactions requiring large activation energies, an alternative mechanism for follow&#8208;up transformations of highly stable molecules involves the reactions of higher energy isomers that were generated in a different environment. Hence, one working model for the formation of larger organic molecules is their generation from high&#8208;lying isomers of otherwise rather stable molecules. As an example, we present here the synthesis as well as IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic identification of the previously elusive 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol, the higher energy enol tautomer of glycolic acid, a rather stable and hence unreactive biological building block. The title compound was generated in the gas phase by flash vacuum pyrolysis of tartronic acid at 400&#8201;&#176;C and was subsequently trapped in argon matrices at 10&#8197;K. The spectral assignments are supported by B3LYP/6&#8211;311++G(2d,2p) computations. Upon photolysis at &#955;=180&#8211;254&#8197;nm, 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol rearranges to glycolic acid and ketene.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Cyclopropanation of 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl or Monocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15254-15259, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available and bench&#8208;stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds are shown to undergo Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecific deoxygenative cyclopropanation. This method has led to an array of valuable cyclopropanes in yields of up to 90&#8201;% and with exclusive regioselectivity. This strategy was further applied to the cyclopropanation of a simple monocarbonyl compound.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes by the decomposition of diazo compounds is a powerful and straightforward strategy to produce cyclopropanes, but is tempered by the potentially explosive nature of diazo substrates. Herein we report the Mo&#8208;catalyzed regiospecific deoxygenative cyclopropanation of readily available and bench&#8208;stable 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds, in which one of the two carbonyl groups acts as a carbene equivalent upon deoxygenation and engages in the subsequent cyclopropanation process. The use of a commercially available Mo catalyst afforded an array of valuable cyclopropanes with exclusive regioselectivity in up to 90&#8201;% yield. The synthetic utility of this method was further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and the cyclopropanation of a simple monocarbonyl compound. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that phosphine (or silane) acts as both a mild reductant and a good oxygen acceptor that efficiently regenerates the catalytically active Mo catalyst through reduction of the Mo&#8208;oxo complexes.

Appropriate and simultaneous activation of robust and easy to handle [Tol&#8208;BINAP]NiCl2 and aromatic aldehydes with TIPSOTf orchestrates a direct, asymmetric, and catalytic aldol reaction of a wide array of N&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazinane&#8208;2&#8208;thiones. This method enables the corresponding TIPS&#8208;protected anti aldol adducts to be obtained in a highly efficient and atom economical manner.







Abstract
A direct and asymmetric aldol reaction of N&#8208;acyl thiazinanethiones with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel(II) complexes is reported. The reaction gives the corresponding O&#8208;TIPS&#8208;protected anti&#8208;aldol adducts in high yields and with remarkable stereocontrol and atom economy. Furthermore, the straightforward removal of the achiral scaffold provides enantiomerically pure intermediates of synthetic interest, which involve precursors for anti&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dihydroxy carboxylic derivatives. Theoretical calculations explain the observed high stereocontrol.

         <title>Facilitating the Ferration of Aromatic Substrates through Intramolecular Sodium Mediation</title>

Combining iron with sodium in tris(amido) complexes has led to the selective ferration of non&#8208;activated arenes being accomplished. A new cooperative mechanism is disclosed, whereby the sodium performs the metal&#8208;H exchange and this is followed by a fast intramolecular trans&#8208;metal trapping of the aryl anion by the iron centre.







Abstract
Exploiting cooperative effects between Na and FeII centres present in tris(amide) ferrate complexes has led to the chemoselective ferration of pentafluorobenzene, benzene, toluene, anisole, and pyridine being realised at room temperature. The importance of this bimetallic partnership is demonstrated by neither the relevant sodium amide (NaHMDS or NaTMP) nor the FeII amide Fe(HMDS)2 efficiently metallating these substrates under the conditions of this study. By combining NMR studies with the isolation of key intermediates and DFT calculations, we offer a possible mechanism for how these reactions take place, uncovering a surprising reaction pathway in which the metals cooperate in a synchronised manner. Although the isolated products are formally the result of Fe&#8208;H exchange, theoretical calculations indicate that the aromatic substrates undergo Na&#8208;H exchange followed by fast intramolecular transmetallation to Fe, thus stabilizing the newly generated aryl fragment.

Silica scaffold with single&#8208;diamond&#8208;surface networks has been synthesized via self&#8208;assembly of the triblock terpolymer and inorganic source. The structural transition and the fluctuations of the Gaussian curvature are the key for the formation of the single&#8208;diamond structure.







Abstract
Biological scaffolds with hyperbolic surfaces, especially single gyroid and single&#8208;diamond structures, have sparked immense interest for creating novel materials due to their extraordinary physical properties. However, the ability of nature to create these unbalanced surfaces has not been achieved in either lyotropic liquid crystals or block copolymer phases due to their thermodynamical instability in these systems. Here, we report the synthesis of a porous silica scaffold with a single&#8208;diamond&#8208;surface structure fabricated by self&#8208;assembly of the poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) and silica precursors in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran and water. The single&#8208;diamond structure with tetrahedral interconnected frameworks was revealed by the electron crystallographic reconstruction. We assume that the formation of single networks is induced by the structural transition and related to the energetic change due to the fluctuations of the Gaussian curvature. This work may provide new insights into these biologically relevant surfaces and related self&#8208;assembly systems.

         <title>Deracemization of Carbohelicenes by a Chiral Perylene Bisimide Cyclophane Template Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15323-15327, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherently chiral perylene bisimide cyclophane has been synthesized that shows high binding affinities for carbohelicene guests in organic solvents. The perfect shape complementarity of the host&#8211;guest system was utilized for the deracemization of conformationally labile [4]&#8208; and [5]&#8208;helicenes.







Abstract
Deracemization describes the conversion of a racemic mixture of a chiral molecule into an enantioenriched mixture or an enantiopure compound without structural modifications. Herein, we report an inherently chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane whose chiral pocket is capable of transforming a racemic mixture of [5]&#8208;helicene into an enantioenriched mixture with an enantiomeric excess of 66&#8201;%. UV/Vis and fluorescence titration studies reveal this cyclophane host composed of two helically twisted PBI dyes has high binding affinities for the respective homochiral carbohelicene guests, with outstanding binding constants of up to 3.9&#215;1010&#8197;m&#8722;1 for [4]&#8208;helicene. 2D NMR studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis demonstrate that the observed strong and enantioselective binding of homochiral carbohelicenes and the successful template&#8208;catalyzed deracemization of [5]&#8208;helicene can be explained by the enzyme&#8208;like perfect shape complementarity of the macrocyclic supramolecular host.

         <title>Selectivity and Targeting of G&#8208;Quadruplex Binders Activated by Adaptive Binding and Controlled by Chemical Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15340-15343, July 5, 2021. </description>

A PtII compound was synthesized and adaptively bound G&#8208;quadruplex DNA through kinetic control. The solution structure of the complex was solved. It was further proved that the compound can target G&#8208;quadruplex in living cells, repress VEGF expression in cancer cells and inhibit blood vessels growth in zebrafish.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are prevalent in oncogenes and are potential antitumor drug targets. However, binding selectivity of compounds to G4s still faces challenges. Herein, we report a platinum(II) complex (Pt1), whose affinity to G4&#8208;DNA is activated by adaptive binding and selectivity controlled by binding kinetics. The resolved structure of Pt1/VEGF&#8208;G4 (a promoter G4) shows that Pt1 matches 3&#8242;&#8208;G&#8208;tetrad of VEGF&#8208;G4 through Cl&#8722;&#8208;dissociation and loop rearrangement of VEGF&#8208;G4. Binding rate constants are determined by coordination bond breakage/formation, correlating fully with affinities. The selective rate&#8208;determining binding step, Cl&#8722;&#8208;dissociation upon G4&#8208;binding, is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than dsDNA. Pt1 potently targets G4 in living cells, effectively represses VEGF expression, and inhibits vascular growth in zebrafish. We show adaptive G4&#8208;binding activation and controlled by kinetics, providing a complementary design principle for compounds targeting G4 or similar biomolecules.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Valence Compounds as Polarizing Agents for Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization in Solids**
</title>

Mixed&#8208;valence compounds were investigated as novel polarizing agents for DNP NMR. These compounds constitute a group of molecules in which molecular mobility persists even in solids. Consequently, they can be used to perform Overhauser&#8208;DNP NMR experiments in solid state, and they specifically show favorable properties for applications at ultra&#8208;high magnetic fields (DNP=dynamic nuclear polarization, NMR=nuclear magnetic resonance).

Mixed&#8208;valence compounds constitute a group of molecules in which molecular mobility persists even in solids.

         <title>Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ Sites for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>

Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella can break thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of CO2 reduction reaction and achieve the superior CO2 electroreduction performance.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts facilitate CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) to produce multi&#8208;carbon products. However, the roles of Cu0 and Cu+ and the mechanistic understanding remain elusive. This paper describes the controllable construction of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ sites derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide particles supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella to enhance CO2ER performance. 20&#8201;% Cu/CuSiO3 shows the superior CO2ER performance with 51.8&#8201;% C2H4 Faraday efficiency at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode during the 6&#8197;hour test. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism. The enhancement in CO2ER activity is mainly attributed to the synergism of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs: Cu0 activates CO2 and facilitates the following electron transfers; Cu+ strengthens *CO adsorption to further boost C&#8722;C coupling. We provide a strategy to rationally design Cu&#8208;based catalysts with viable valence states to boost CO2ER.

Unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere are directly observed.







Abstract
Direct conversion of bulk metal or nanoparticles into metal single atoms under thermal pyrolysis conditions is a highly efficient and promising strategy to fabricate single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Usually, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is used as the anchoring substrate to capture the migrating metal ion species at high temperatures, and stable isolated SACs with nitrogen coordination are formed during the process. Herein, we report unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, Ni&#8208;, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere at 750&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h. The atomic dispersion of metal single atoms and their coordinated structures were confirmed by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structures. In addition, the dynamic process of nanoparticles to atoms was directly observed by in&#8197;situ transmission electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Fe SAC exhibited high activity and superior selectivity for catalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with hydrogen peroxide.

         <title>Electrochemical Measurements Reveal Reactive Oxygen Species in Stress Granules**

Arsenite&#8208;induced stress granules isolated from both non&#8208;cancer and cancer cells contain reactive oxygen species as revealed by amperometric measurements with Pt or platinized carbon microelectrodes. This finding supports a role for SGs as signaling hubs and unveils a correlation between SG biology and pathogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases and some cancers.







Abstract
Stress granules (SGs) are membrane&#8208;less organelles that assemble in the cytoplasm to organize cellular contents and promote rapid adaptation during stress. To understand how SGs contribute to physiological functions, we used electrochemical measurements to detect electroactive species in SGs. With amperometry, we discovered that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are encapsulated inside arsenite&#8208;induced SGs, and H2O2 is the main species. The release kinetics of H2O2 from single SGs and the number of H2O2 molecules were quantified. The discovery that SGs contain ROS implicates them as communicators of the cellular stresses rather than a simple endpoint. This may explain how SGs regulate cellular metabolism and stress responses. This may also help better understand their cytoprotective functions in pathological conditions associated with SGs such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), cancers and viral infections.

Direct photogeneration of free charge carriers enabled by remarkably low exciton binding energies is demonstrated in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nonfullerene acceptor of Y6 by a joint experimental and theoretical study. This results in efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets in the high&#8208;efficiency nonfullerene organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets, leading to over 18&#8201;% efficiency for the single&#8208;junction devices based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NFA of Y6. Herein, to reveal the underlying charge generation mechanisms, we have investigated the exciton binding energy (Eb) in Y6 by a joint theoretical and experimental study. The results show that owing to strong charge polarization effects, Y6 has remarkable small Eb of &#8722;0.11&#8211;0.15&#8197;eV, which is even lower than perovskites in many cases. Moreover, it is peculiar that the photoluminescence is enhanced with temperature, and the energy barrier for separating excitons into charges is evidently lower than the thermal energy according to the temperature dependence of photoluminescence, manifesting direct photogeneration of charge carriers enabled by weak Eb in Y6. Thus, charge generation in NFA&#8208;based OSCs shows little dependence on interfacial driving forces.

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Transfer from HOO. to ortho&#8208;Quinones Explains the Antioxidant Activity of Polydopamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15220-15224, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine, a melanin analogue, is an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO., typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) only in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO.). Activation of the ortho&#8208;quinone moieties by HOO., and formation of exposed semiquinones are proposed as the reason of the peculiar antioxidant activity.







Abstract
Melanins are stable and non&#8208;toxic biomaterials with a great potential as chemopreventive agents for diseases connected with oxidative stress, but the mechanism of their antioxidant action is unclear.

     alt="Hydrogen Atom Transfer from HOO. to ortho-Quinones Explains the Antioxidant Activity of Polydopamine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polydopamine, a melanin analogue, is an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;, typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) only in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;). Activation of the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinone moieties by HOO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;, and formation of exposed semiquinones are proposed as the reason of the peculiar antioxidant activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanins are stable and non-toxic biomaterials with a great potential as chemopreventive agents for diseases connected with oxidative stress, but the mechanism of their antioxidant action is unclear. Herein, we show that polydopamine (&lt;b&gt;PDA&lt;/b&gt;), a well-known synthetic melanin, becomes an excellent trap for alkylperoxyl radicals (ROO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;, typically formed during autoxidation of lipid substrates) in the presence of hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;). The key reaction explaining this peculiar antioxidant activity is the reduction of the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinone moieties present in &lt;b&gt;PDA&lt;/b&gt; by the reaction with HOO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;. This reaction occurs via a H-atom transfer mechanism, as demonstrated by the large kinetic solvent effect of the reaction of a model quinone (3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone) with HOO&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;=1.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in PhCl and MeCN). The chemistry disclosed herein is an important step to rationalize the redox-mediated bioactivity of melanins and of quinones.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Manginoids&#8197;A and&#8197;C and Guignardones&#8197;A and&#8197;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 28, Page 15286-15290, July 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total syntheses of fungal meroterpenoids, manginoids&#8197;A and C, as well as guignardones&#8197;A and C, are accomplished. This divergent and bioinspired synthetic strategy involves a Csp3&#8722;Csp2 Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of vinyl bromide, silica&#8208;gel&#8208;promoted semipinacol rearrangement, and oxidative 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl radical&#8208;initiated cyclization.







Abstract
An enantioselective synthetic approach for preparing manginoids and guignardones, two types of biogenetically related meroterpenoids, is reported. This bioinspired and divergent synthesis employs an oxidative 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl radical&#8208;initiated cyclization and cyclodehydration of the common precursor to forge the central ring of the manginoids and guignardones, respectively, at a late stage. Key synthetic steps include silica&#8208;gel&#8208;promoted semipinacol rearrangement to form the 6&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton and the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction of vinyl bromide to achieve fragment coupling. This synthesis protocol enables the asymmetric syntheses of four fungal meroterpenoids from commercially available materials.

         <title>Hierarchical Two&#8208;Level Supramolecular Chirality of an Achiral Anthracene&#8208;Based Tetracationic Nanotube in Water</title>

Host&#8211;guest complexation with nucleoside triphosphates in water has led to an achiral anthracene&#8208;based tetracationic nanotube showing two levels of supramolecular chirality. This nanotube, which can adopt M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformations, exhibits adaptive chiral recognition with opposite CD spectra for ATP/GTP and CTP/UTP, and a strong excimer showing strong circularly polarized luminescence ((+)&#8208;CPL; glum&#8776;10&#8722;2) with ATP in water.







Abstract
Herein, we report an achiral anthracene&#8208;based tetracationic nanotube (1&#8901;4Cl&#8722;) that shows two levels of supramolecular chirality: namely, conformationally adaptive host&#8211;guest complexation with nucleoside triphosphates (e.g. ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) and twisted packing of the chiral host&#8211;guest complexes in water. Interestingly, achiral 1&#8901;4Cl&#8722; exhibits chiral recognition for ATP/GTP and CTP/UTP through structural transformation of its intramolecular M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformation as the first level of supramolecular chirality, which leads to adaptive chirality with opposite CD responses. Furthermore, the formation of chiral M&#8208;1&#8901;4Cl&#8722;&#8835;ATP can promote an intermolecular P&#8208;twisted dimeric packing of anthracene rings as the second level of supramolecular chirality to achieve assembled chirality with strong circularly polarized luminescence arising from the excimer ((+)&#8208;CPL, glum&#8776;10&#8722;2) in water.

         <title>Structural basis for isomerization reactions in fungal tetrahydroxanthone biosynthesis and diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The novel isomerase NsrQ, from&#160;  Aspergillus novofumigatus,  &#160;is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of fungal tetrahydroxanthones and responsible for the dearomatizing cyclization to provide the tetrahydroxanthone scaffold. NsrQ catalyzes a two step isomerization reaction, involving the isomerization of allylic alcohol and subsequent inversion of configuration at&#160;the methyl group. Here, we report the biochemical and structural characterizations of NsrQ and its homologue Dcr3, from&#160;  Diaporthe longicolla.&#160;  The crystal structures of NsrQ and Dcr3 revealed their similar overall structures, with a cone&#8208;shaped &#945;+&#946; barrel fold, to those of the NTF2&#8208;like superfamily enzymes. Furthermore, the structures of Dcr3 and NsrQ variants complexed with substrate analogues and the site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies identified the catalytic residues and the important hydrophobic residues in shaping the active site pocket for substrate binding. These enzymes thus utilize Glu and His residues as acid&#8208;base catalysts. Based on these observations, we proposed the detailed reaction mechanism of NsrQ&#8208;catalyzed isomerization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Thionitrite and Perthionitrite in NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity. HSNO and HSSNO with their conjugate bases  &#8208;SNO and  &#8208;SSNO form in the reaction of H2S with NO as well as  S&#8208;nitrosothiols (RSNO) and nitrite (NO2&#8208;) that serve as NO reservoirs. While the elusive nature of HSNO and HSSNO renders their study challenging, their conjugate bases form isolable zinc complexes  Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and  Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) supported by tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands. Reaction of Na(15&#8208;C&#8208;5)SSNO with  Ph,MeTpZn(ClO4) provides  Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) that undergoes S&#8208;atom removal by PEt  3  to give  Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and S=PEt3. Unexpectedly stable at room temperature, these Zn&#8208;SNO and Zn&#8208;SSNO complexes release NO upon heating.  Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and  Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) quickly react with acidic thiols such as C6F5SH to form N2O and NO, respectively. Increasing the thiol basicity in p&#8208;substituted aromatic thiols  4&#8208;XArSH in the reaction with  Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) turns on competing  S&#8208;nitrosation to form  Ph,MeTpZn&#8208;SH and RSNO, the latter a known precursor for NO.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analogy between single atom catalysts (SACs) and molecular catalysts predicts that the specific catalytic activity of these systems is constant. We provide evidence that this prediction is not necessarily true. As a case in point, we show that the specific activity over ceria&#8208;supported single Pd atoms linearly increases with metal atom density, originating from the cumulative enhancement of CeO  2  reducibility. The long&#8208;range electrostatic footprints (~1.5 nm) around each Pd site overlap with each other as surface Pd density increases, resulting in the observed deviation from constant specific activity. These cooperative effects exhaust previously active O atoms above a certain Pd density, leading to their permanent removal and consequent drop in reaction rate. The findings of our combined experimental and computational study show that the specific catalytic activity of reducible oxide&#8208;supported single atom catalysts can be tuned by varying the surface density of single metal atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding and Engineering the Stereoselectivity of Humulene Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;canonical terpene cyclase AsR6 is responsible for the formation of 2E,6E,9E&#8208;humulene during the biosynthesis of the tropolone sesquiterpenoid (TS) xenovulene A. The structures of unliganded AsR6 and of AsR6 in complex with an in crystallo cyclized reaction product and thiolodiphosphate reveal a new farnesyl diphosphate binding motif that comprises a unique binuclear Mg2+cluster and an essential K289 residue that is conserved in all humulene synthases involved in TS formation. Structure&#8208;based sitedirected mutagenesis of AsR6 and its homologue EupR3 identify a single residue, L285/M261, that controls the production of either 2E,6E,9E&#8208; or 2Z,6E,9E&#8208;humulene. A possible mechanism for the observed stereoselectivity was investigated using different isoprenoid precursors and results demonstrate that M261 has gatekeeping control over product formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic iron complex achieves TET enzyme reactivity**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The epigenetic marker 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine (5mdC) is the most prevalent modification to DNA. It is removed inter alia via an active demethylation pathway: oxidation by Ten&#8208;Eleven Translocation 5&#8208;methyl cytosine dioxygenase (TET) and subsequent removal via base excision repair or direct demodification. Recently, we have shown that the synthetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [FeIV(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ (1) can serve as a biomimetic model for TET by oxidizing the nucleobase 5&#8208;methyl cytosine (5mC) to its natural metabolites. In this work, we demonstrate that nucleosides and even short oligonucleotide strands can also serve as substrates, using a range of HPLC and MS techniques. We found that the 5&#8208;position of 5mC is oxidized preferably by 1, with side reactions occurring only at the strand ends of the used oligonucleotides. A detailed study of the reactivity of 1 towards nucleosides confirms our results; that oxidation of the anomeric center (1&#8217;) is the most common side reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Materials Engineering of Violin Soundboards by Stradivari and Guarneri</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ICP&#8208;MS is used to identify the unique mineral recipe used by Antonio Stradivari to treat his spruce wood, the material for the violin top plate. Chemical manipulation led to hemicellulose fragmentation and cellulose rearrangement. Incorporating engineered wood may contribute to the unique tonal qualities of these acclaimed instruments.







Abstract
We investigated the material properties of Cremonese soundboards using a wide range of spectroscopic, microscopic, and chemical techniques. We found similar types of spruce in Cremonese soundboards as in modern instruments, but Cremonese spruces exhibit unnatural elemental compositions and oxidation patterns that suggest artificial manipulation. Combining analytical data and historical information, we may deduce the minerals being added and their potential functions&#8212;borax and metal sulfates for fungal suppression, table salt for moisture control, alum for molecular crosslinking, and potash or quicklime for alkaline treatment. The overall purpose may have been wood preservation or acoustic tuning. Hemicellulose fragmentation and altered cellulose nanostructures are observed in heavily treated Stradivari specimens, which show diminished second&#8208;harmonic generation signals. Guarneri's practice of crosslinking wood fibers via aluminum coordination may also affect mechanical and acoustic properties. Our data suggest that old masters undertook materials engineering experiments to produce soundboards with unique properties.

         <title>On the Biology of Werner's Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Werner's Complex (WC) has hitherto unappreciated biological properties derived from its binding affinity to highly anionic biomolecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and nucleic acids. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle it displays &#956;m antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) with promising selectivity. Exploitation of non&#8208;covalent interactions has motivated the unprecedented discovery of the properties of this iconic compound.







Abstract
Werner's Complex, as a cationic coordination complex (CCC), has hitherto unappreciated biological properties derived from its binding affinity to highly anionic biomolecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and nucleic acids. Competitive inhibitor and spectroscopic assays confirm the high affinity to GAGs heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), and its pentasaccharide mimetic Fondaparinux (FPX). Functional consequences of this affinity include inhibition of FPX cleavage by bacterial heparinase and mammalian heparanase enzymes with inhibition of cellular invasion and migration. Werner's Complex is a very efficient condensing agent for DNA and tRNA. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for translational implications, it is demonstrated to display antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) at micromolar concentrations with promising selectivity. Exploitation of non&#8208;covalent hydrogen&#8208;bonding and electrostatic interactions has motivated the unprecedented discovery of these properties, opening new avenues of research for this iconic compound.

         <title>Synthetic Zippers as an Enabling Tool for Engineering of Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Re&#8208;engineering of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is challenging due to their protein size up to a few megadalton. The artificial splitting of NRPSs to produce building blocks with moderate size is achieved by the introduction of synthetic zippers, which can be recombined in a rapid and simple plug and play manner to form an in trans regulated synthetic type of NRPSs.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are the origin of a wide range of natural products, including many clinically used drugs. Efficient engineering of these often giant biosynthetic machineries to produce novel non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) is an ongoing challenge. Here we describe a cloning and co&#8208;expression strategy to functionally combine NRPS fragments of Gram&#8208;negative and &#8208;positive origin, synthesising novel peptides at titres up to 220&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1. Extending from the recently introduced definition of eXchange Units (XUs), we inserted synthetic zippers (SZs) to split single protein NRPSs into independently expressed and translated polypeptide chains. These synthetic type of NRPS (type S) enables easier access to engineering, overcomes cloning limitations, and provides a simple and rapid approach to building peptide libraries via the combination of different NRPS subunits.

         <title>Programmable RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Demethylation by a Cas13d&#8208;Directed Demethylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tool for targeted m1A demethylation of specific cellular RNA without changing the primary sequence, termed &#8220;REMOVER&#8221;, was developed via combining the RNA&#8208;targeting capability of dCasRx (the catalytically inactive RNA&#8208;targeting RfxCas13d enzyme) and the RNA m1A demethylation property of ALKBH3. REMOVER enabled m1A demethylation of the specific RNA without obvious off&#8208;target effects.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) is a prevalent and reversible RNA modification, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA fate and gene expression. However, the lack of tools to precisely manipulate m1A sites in specific transcripts has hindered efforts to clarify the association between a specific m1A&#8208;modified transcript and its phenotypic outcomes. Here we develop a CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d&#8208;based tool called reengineered m1A modification valid eraser (termed &#8220;REMOVER&#8221;) for targeted m1A demethylation of a specific transcript. The catalytically inactive RfxCas13d (dCasRx) is fused to the m1A demethylase ALKBH3, and the dCasRx&#8208;ALKBH3 fusion protein can mediate potent demethylation of m1A&#8208;modified RNAs. We further find that REMOVER can specifically demethylate m1A of MALAT1 and PRUNE1 RNAs, thereby significantly increasing their stability. Our study establishes REMOVER as a tool for targeted RNA demethylation of specific m1A&#8208;modified transcripts, which enables further elucidation of the relationship between m1A modification of specific transcripts and their phenotypic outcomes.

         <title>TADF&#8208;Type Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the spin&#8208;forbidden nature, it remains challenging to achieve room&#8208;temperature organic phosphorescence and afterglow materials with high quantum yields. We report a highly efficient dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow system enabled by TADF mechanism to realize afterglow quantum yields of 60&#8211;70&#8201;%, which features a moderate rate constant for reverse intersystem crossing to simultaneously improve afterglow quantum yields and maintain afterglow emission lifetime.







Abstract
We report a highly efficient dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow system enabled by TADF mechanism to realize afterglow quantum yields of 60&#8211;70&#8201;%, which features a moderate rate constant for reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC) to simultaneously improve afterglow quantum yields and maintain afterglow emission lifetime. Difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) compounds are designed with multiple electron&#8208;donating groups to possess moderate kRISC values and are selected as luminescent dopants. The matrices with carbonyl functional groups such as phenyl benzoate (PhB) have been found to interact with and perturb BF2bdk excited states by dipole&#8211;dipole interactions and thus enhance the intersystem crossing of BF2bdk excited states. Through dopant&#8208;matrix collaboration, the efficient TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials have been achieved to exhibit excellent processability into desired shapes and large&#8208;area films by melt casting, as well as aqueous afterglow dispersions for potential bioimaging applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization&#8208;Induced Nanoassemblies for Self&#8208;Augmented Cascade Chemotherapy and Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a one&#8208;pot supramolecular polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly approach to fabricate H2O2&#8208;responsive nanomedicine with highly controllable drug loading and rapid clearance for self&#8208;augmented synergistic chemo/chemodynamic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The clinical application of chemodynamic therapy is impeded by the insufficient intracellular H2O2 level in tumor tissues. Herein, we developed a supramolecular nanoparticle via a simple one&#8208;step supramolecular polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly process using platinum (IV) complex&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;ferrocene conjugates as supramolecular monomers. The supramolecular nanoparticles could dissociate rapidly upon exposure to endogenous H2O2 in the tumor and release hydroxyl radicals as well as platinum (IV) prodrugs in situ, which is reduced into cisplatin to significantly promote the generation of H2O2 in the tumor tissue. Thus, the supramolecular nanomedicine overcomes the limitation of conventional chemodynamic therapy via the self&#8208;augmented cascade radical generation and drug release. In addition, dissociated supramolecular nanoparticles could be readily excreted from the body via renal clearance to effectively avoid systemic toxicity and ensure long term biocompatibility of the nanomedicine. This work may provide new insights on the design and development of novel supramolecular nanoassemblies for cascade chemo/chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>Cobalt Phthalocyanine Derived Molecular Isolation Layer for Highly Stable Lithium Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The uneven consumption of anions during the lithium (Li) deposition process triggers a space charge effect that generates Li dendrites, seriously hindering the practical application of Li metal batteries. Herein, we report on a cobalt phthalocyanine electrolyte additive with a planar molecular structure, which can be tightly adsorbed on the Li anode surface to form a dense molecular layer. Such a planar molecular layer can not only complex with Li ions to reduce the space charge effect, but also suppress side reactions between the anode and the electrolyte, producing a stable solid electrolyte interphase composed of amorphous LiF and LiCO  3  as verified by X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy. As a result, the Li|Li symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability above 700 h under a high plating capacity of 3 mAh cm  &#8722;2  . Moreover, the assembled Li|LiFePO  4  full&#8208;cell can also deliver excellent cycling over 200 cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (3 &#181;L mg  &#8208;1  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Tailoring in Luzopeptin Biosynthesis Involves Cytochrome P450&#8208;Mediated Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Bond Desaturation for Hydrazone Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luzopeptins and related decadepsipeptides are bisintercalator nonribosomal peptides featuring rare acyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (Thp) subunits that are critical to their biological activities. Herein, we reconstitute the biosynthetic tailoring pathway in luzopeptin A biosynthesis through  in vivo  genetic and  in vitro  biochemical approaches. Significantly, we revealed a multitasking cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes four consecutive oxidations including the highly unusual carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond desaturation, forming the hydrazone&#8208;bearing 4&#8208;OH&#8208;Thp residues. Moreover, we identified a membrane&#8208;bound acyltransferase that likely mediates the subsequent  O  &#8208;acetylations extracellularly, as a potential self&#8208;protective strategy for the producer strain. Further genome mining of novel decadepsipeptides and an associated P450 enzyme have provided mechanistic insights into the P450&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;nitrogen bond desaturation. Our results not only reveal the molecular basis of pharmacophore formation in bisintercalator decadepsipeptides, but also expand the catalytic versatility of P450 family enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Hybrid of an Atomically Precise Silver Nanocluster and Polyoxometalates for H2 Cleavage into Protons and Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular hybrid of an atomically precise mixed&#8208;valent {Ag27}17+ nanocluster and polyoxometalate (POM) ligands exhibited unique reactivity, efficiently cleaving dihydrogen (H2) into protons and electrons. The protons and electrons generated are stored on the POM surface and the mixed&#8208;valent {Ag27}17+ nanoclusters, respectively.







Abstract
Atomically precise silver (Ag) nanoclusters are promising materials as catalysts, photocatalysts, and sensors because of their unique structures and mixed&#8208;valence states (Ag+/Ag0). However, their low stability hinders the in&#8208;depth study of their intrinsic reactivity and catalytic property accompanying their redox processes. Herein, we demonstrate that a molecular hybrid of an atomically precise {Ag27}17+ nanocluster and polyoxometalates (POMs) can efficiently cleave H2 into protons and electrons. The Ag nanocluster accommodates electrons through the redox reaction from {Ag27}17+ to {Ag27}13+, and the POM ligands play the following important roles: (i) a significant stabilization of the typically unstable Ag nanocluster to preserve its structure during the redox reaction with H2, (ii) formation of a unique interface between the Ag nanocluster and metal oxides for efficient H2 cleavage, and (iii) storage of the generated protons on the negatively charged basic surface.

         <dc:description>Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are DNA or RNA mimics where one phosphate oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom.&#160; They have been shown to enter mammalian cells much more efficiently than non&#8208;modified DNA.&#160; Thus, solving one of the key challenges with oligonucleotide technology, OPS became very useful in practice, with several FDA&#8208;approved drugs on the market or in late clinical trials.&#160; However, the mechanism accounting for this facile cellular uptake is unknown.&#160; Here, we show that OPS enter cells by thiol&#8208;mediated uptake.&#160; The transient adaptive network produced dynamic&#8208;covalent pseudo&#8208;disulfide exchange is characterized in action.&#160; Inhibitors with nanomolar efficiency are provided, together with activators that reduce endosomal capture for efficient delivery of OPS into the cytosol, the site of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) for Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Has Anti&#8208;Proliferative Activity in Lung Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is challenging, as it is involved in diseases via protein&#8208;protein interactions. Here, the first potent MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC MD13 is reported, which eliminates MIF from its protein&#8208;protein interaction network by inducing MIF degradation. MD13 suppresses the proliferation of A549 cells by reducing MIF protein levels and MIF&#8208;related signaling, demonstrating the potential of PROTACs in cancer therapy.







Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in protein&#8208;protein interactions that play key roles in inflammation and cancer. Current strategies to develop small molecule modulators of MIF functions are mainly restricted to the MIF tautomerase active site. Here, we use this site to develop proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) in order to eliminate MIF from its protein&#8208;protein interaction network. We report the first potent MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC, denoted MD13, which induced almost complete MIF degradation at low micromolar concentrations with a DC50 around 100&#8197;nM in A549 cells. MD13 suppresses the proliferation of A549 cells, which can be explained by deactivation of the MAPK pathway and subsequent induction of cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. MD13 also exhibits antiproliferative effect in a 3D tumor spheroid model. In conclusion, we describe the first MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC (MD13) as a research tool, which also demonstrates the potential of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Regulating Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Activity of a Metal Coordination Polymer via d&#8211;&#960; Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step strategy was proposed to optimize the ORR activity of TM&#8208;BTA (TM=Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu, BTA=1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetramine) analogs by screening preliminarily TM centers and subsequently substituent groups. Strong d&#8211;&#960; conjugation in TM&#8208;BTA is found to elevate the dxz/dyz, orbitals, which enhances the activity of TM centers, and also enlarges the impact of ligand functional groups on d orbitals of TM centers.







Abstract
Non&#8208;noble transition metal complexes have attracted growing interest as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while their activities still lack rational and effective regulation. Herein, we propose a d&#8211;&#960; conjugation strategy for rough and fine tuning of ORR activity of TM&#8208;BTA (TM=Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu, BTA=1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetramine) coordination polymers. By first&#8208;principle calculations, we elucidate that the strong d&#8211;&#960; conjugation elevates the dxz/dyz orbitals of TM centers to enhance intermediate adsorption and strengthens the electronic modulation effect from substitute groups on ligands. Based on this strategy, Co&#8208;TABQ (tetramino benzoquinone) is found to approach the top of ORR activity volcano. The synthesized Co&#8208;TABQ with atomically distributed Co on carbon nanotubes exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a specific current of 127&#8197;mA&#8201;mgmetal&#8722;1 at 0.8&#8197;V, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. The high activity, low peroxide yield, and considerable durability of Co&#8208;BTA and Co&#8208;TABQ promise their application in oxygen electrocatalysis. This study provides mechanistic insight into the rational design of transition metal complex catalysts.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Decarbonylative Iodination of Aryl Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Ligand&#8208;Assisted Halide Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and broadly applicable palladium&#8208;catalyzed iodination of inexpensive and abundant aryl and vinyl carboxylic acids via in situ activation to the acid chloride and formation of a phosphonium salt was developed. The use of 1&#8208;iodobutane as iodide source in combination with a base and a deoxychlorinating reagent gives access to a wide range of aryl and vinyl iodides under Pd/Xantphos catalysis.







Abstract
We report an efficient and broadly applicable palladium&#8208;catalyzed iodination of inexpensive and abundant aryl and vinyl carboxylic acids via in situ activation to the acid chloride and formation of a phosphonium salt. The use of 1&#8208;iodobutane as iodide source in combination with a base and a deoxychlorinating reagent gives access to a wide range of aryl and vinyl iodides under Pd/Xantphos catalysis, including complex drug&#8208;like scaffolds.

&lt;p&gt;We report an efficient and broadly applicable palladium-catalyzed iodination of inexpensive and abundant aryl and vinyl carboxylic acids via in situ activation to the acid chloride and formation of a phosphonium salt. The use of 1-iodobutane as iodide source in combination with a base and a deoxychlorinating reagent gives access to a wide range of aryl and vinyl iodides under Pd/Xantphos catalysis, including complex drug-like scaffolds. Stoichiometric experiments and kinetic analysis suggest a unique mechanism involving C&#8722;P reductive elimination to form the Xantphos phosphonium chloride, which subsequently initiates an unusual halogen exchange by outer sphere nucleophilic substitution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of a Chemically Stable Aza&#8208;Bridged Bis(phenanthroline) Macrocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D aza&#8208;bridged bis(phenanthroline)&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;linked conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed by periodically linking hexaaza&#8208;triphenylene units together using the linkage of the aza&#8208;bridged bis(phenanthroline) macrocycle in the absence of solvents and catalysts. The bulk insulating COF pellet became semiconducting after exposure to iodine vapor.







Abstract
Developing new linkage&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is one of the major topics in reticular chemistry. Electrically conductive COFs have enabled applications in energy storage and electrochemical catalysis, which are not feasible using insulating COFs. Despite significant advances, the construction of chemically stable conductive COFs by the formation of new linkages remains relatively unexplored and challenging. Here we report the solvent&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of a two&#8208;dimensional aza&#8208;bridged bis(phenanthroline) macrocycle&#8208;linked COF (ABBPM&#8208;COF) from the thermally induced poly&#8208;condensation of a tri&#8208;topic monomer and ammonia gas. The ABBPM&#8208;COF structure was elucidated using multiple techniques, including X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis combined with structural simulation, revealing its crystalline nature with an ABC stacking mode. Further experiments demonstrated its excellent chemical stability in acid/base solutions. Electrical&#8208;conductivity measurements showed that the insulating ABBPM&#8208;COF becomes a semiconducting material after exposure to iodine vapor.

         <title>Exploration of the Reactivity of Multivalent Electrophiles for Affinity Labeling: Sulfonyl Fluoride as a Highly Efficient and Selective Label</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical probes were prepared by multivalently presenting electrophilic groups and ligands on gold nanoparticles (NPs), and their reactivities as novel affinity labeling probes were explored. An arylsulfonyl fluoride probe at a nm concentration achieved an efficient and selective labeling of model proteins in cell lysate. The NP&#8208;immobilized arylsulfonyl fluoride groups can target multiple amino acid residues around the ligand binding site.







Abstract
Here we explored the reactivity of a set of multivalent electrophiles cofunctionalized with a carbohydrate ligand on gold nanoparticles to achieve efficient affinity labeling for target protein analysis. Evaluation of the reactivity and selectivity of the electrophiles against three different cognate binding proteins identified arylsulfonyl fluoride as the most efficient protein&#8208;reactive group in this study. We demonstrated that multivalent arylsulfonyl fluoride probe 4 at 50&#8197;nm concentration achieved selective affinity labeling and enrichment of a model protein PNA in cell lysate, which was more effective than photoaffinity probe 1 with arylazide group. Labeling site analysis by LC&#8211;MS/MS revealed that the nanoparticle&#8208;immobilized arylsulfonyl fluoride group can target multiple amino acid residues around the ligand binding site of the target proteins. Our study highlights the utility of arylsulfonyl fluoride as a highly effective multivalent affinity label suitable for covalently capturing unknown target proteins.

         <title>An Organic Host&#8211;Guest System Producing Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence at the Parts&#8208;Per&#8208;Billion Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fluorescent naphthalimides, which did not originally show observable phosphorescence, can now efficiently produce ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in phthalimide hosts. In particular, red RTP is realized by doping at a guest&#8208;to&#8208;host ratio at the 10&#8197;parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) level.







Abstract
Manipulation of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons in organic molecules is key to applications including next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, background&#8208;free bioimaging, information encryption, and photodynamic therapy. However, for organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), which stems from triplet excitons, it is still difficult to simultaneously achieve efficiency and lifetime enhancement on account of weak spin&#8211;orbit coupling and rapid nonradiative transitions, especially in the red and near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, we report that a series of fluorescent naphthalimides&#8212;which did not originally show observable phosphorescence in solution, as aggregates, in polymer films, or in any other tested host material, including heavy&#8208;atom matrices at cryogenic temperatures&#8212;can now efficiently produce ultralong RTP (&#981;=0.17, &#964;=243&#8197;ms) in phthalimide hosts. Notably, red RTP (&#955;RTP=628&#8197;nm) is realized at a molar ratio of less than 10&#8197;parts per billion, demonstrating an unprecedentedly low guest&#8208;to&#8208;host ratio where efficient RTP can take place in molecular solids.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Highly Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes via &#8220;&#224; la carte&#8221; Multifunctionalization of Borylated Dendralenes</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tetra&#8208;component reaction between a borylated dendralene, an organolithium reagent and two different electrophiles is reported. The method allows for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes with &#8220;&#224; la carte&#8221; introduction of diverse functionalities which serve as a versatile handle to access complex dienic structures.







Abstract
Despite the high relevance of 1,3&#8208;dienes, stereoselective methods to access tetrasubstituted conjugated dienes are still scarce. We here report an efficient and modular approach that provides access to multifunctional tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes with excellent levels of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. This methodology is based on a tetracomponent reaction between a borylated dendralene, an organolithium reagent and two different electrophiles. Mechanistic studies reveal that this transformation proceeds through a regio&#8208; and stereoselective carbolithiation/electrophilic trapping of an in situ formed dendralenic boron&#8208;ate complex, followed by a stereoretentive halodeborylation. The ease in which complex structural dienes can be accessed and their synthetic versatility highlight the importance and utility of this method.

         <title>Selective N&#8208;Arylation of p&#8208;Aminophenylalanine in Unprotected Peptides with Organometallic Palladium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;formed oxidative addition complexes (OACs) are utilized to selectively arylate p&#8208;aminophenylalanine (pAF) in the presence of native functional groups, except cysteine. In phosphate buffer pH&#8197;7.5, OACs derived from electron&#8208;poor arenes provide full conversion in as little as 2&#8197;hours at micromolar concentration. A complimentary procedure using the weak base 1,5&#8208;diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non&#8208;5&#8208;ene (DBN) is also presented enabling arylation with electron&#8208;rich substrates with up to 97&#8201;% conversion.







Abstract
The selective N&#8208;arylation of p&#8208;aminophenylalanine in polypeptides with pre&#8208;formed palladium oxidative addition complexes is described. The depressed pKa of the aniline NH2 group enables chemoselective C&#8722;N bond formation on peptides containing multiple other aliphatic amino groups at lysines or the N&#8208;terminus via Curtin&#8211;Hammett control under mild conditions. Using palladium complexes derived from electron&#8208;poor aryl halides, p&#8208;aminophenylalanine is fully arylated in aqueous buffer in as little as one hour at micromolar concentrations. A complementary protocol using the non&#8208;nucleophilic, organic base 1,5&#8208;diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non&#8208;5&#8208;ene (DBN), expands the substrate scope to tolerate electron&#8208;rich functional groups provides up to 97&#8201;% conversion. These procedures enable the chemoselective conjugation of functionally diverse small molecule pharmaceuticals to p&#8208;aminophenylalanine containing derivatives of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides.

&lt;p&gt;Pre-formed oxidative addition complexes (OACs) are utilized to selectively arylate &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-aminophenylalanine (pAF) in the presence of native functional groups, except cysteine. In phosphate buffer pH&#8197;7.5, OACs derived from electron-poor arenes provide full conversion in as little as 2&#8197;hours at micromolar concentration. A complimentary procedure using the weak base 1,5-diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non-5-ene (DBN) is also presented enabling arylation with electron-rich substrates with up to 97&#8201;% conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selective N-arylation of p-aminophenylalanine in polypeptides with pre-formed palladium oxidative addition complexes is described. The depressed pKa of the aniline NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group enables chemoselective C&#8722;N bond formation on peptides containing multiple other aliphatic amino groups at lysines or the N-terminus via Curtin&#8211;Hammett control under mild conditions. Using palladium complexes derived from electron-poor aryl halides, p-aminophenylalanine is fully arylated in aqueous buffer in as little as one hour at micromolar concentrations. A complementary protocol using the non-nucleophilic, organic base 1,5-diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non-5-ene (DBN), expands the substrate scope to tolerate electron-rich functional groups provides up to 97&#8201;% conversion. These procedures enable the chemoselective conjugation of functionally diverse small molecule pharmaceuticals to p-aminophenylalanine containing derivatives of cell-penetrating peptides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Au/Pt&#8208;Egg&#8208;in&#8208;Nest Nanomotor for Glucose&#8208;Powered Catalytic Motion and Enhanced Molecular Transport to Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow Au/Pt&#8208;based nanostructures, resembling an &#8220;egg&#8208;in&#8208;nest&#8221; morphology, have been synthesized by a dynamic&#8208;casting approach utilizing a silica yolk&#8208;shell cast. These nanosized motors can propel themselves in response to biocompatible glucose as fuel, via a catalytic cascade oxidation reaction. In response to autonomous motion, they can effectively internalize into living cells, and deliver the cargo anti&#8208;cancer drug molecules efficiently.







Abstract
Nanostructures converting chemical energy to mechanical work by using benign metabolic fuels, have huge implications in biomedical science. Here, we introduce Au/Pt&#8208;based Janus nanostructures, resembling to &#8220;egg&#8208;in&#8208;nest&#8221; morphology (Au/Pt&#8208;ENs), showing enhanced motion as a result of dual enzyme&#8208;relay&#8208;like catalytic cascade in physiological biomedia, and in turn showing molecular&#8208;laden transport to living cells. We developed dynamic&#8208;casting approach using silica yolk&#8208;shell nanoreactors: first, to install a large Au&#8208;seed fixing the silica&#8208;yolk aside while providing the anisotropically confined concave hollow nanospace to grow curved Pt&#8208;dendritic networks. Owing to the intimately interfaced Au and Pt catalytic sites integrated in a unique anisotropic nest&#8208;like morphology, Au/Pt&#8208;ENs exhibited high diffusion rates and displacements as the result of glucose&#8208;converted oxygen concentration gradient. High diffusiophoresis in cell culture media increased the nanomotor&#8208;membrane interaction events, in turn facilitated the cell internalization. In addition, the porous network of Au/Pt&#8208;ENs facilitated the drug&#8208;molecule cargo loading and delivery to the living cells.

         <title>Photoactivated In Situ Generation of Near Infrared Cyanines for Spatiotemporally Controlled Fluorescence Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photochemical one&#8208;pot synthesis of a Cy5 fluorophore via carbon radical&#8208;participating trimerization, was designed by virtue of the self&#8208;photocatalytic activity of 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indole derivatives. The in situ photochemical reaction was achieved selectively in lysosomes of living cells in an irradiation time&#8208;dependent manner, potentially applicable for spatiotemporally controlled fluorescence imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Photoactivated trimerization of 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;3H&#8208;indole derivatives created near infrared fluorophore Cy5. The synthetic method is air&#8208;tolerant, photosensitizer free, metal free, and condensation agent free. Living cells make Cy5 on a time scale of minutes under white light irradiation at a low power intensity, with the monomer as the only exogenous agent. The new method is promising to find applications in cell studies for in situ spatiotemporally controlled fluorescence imaging in living cells.

         <title>Cleavage of the N&#8801;N Triple Bond and Unpredicted Formation of the Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Diaza&#8208;2,4&#8208;Diborete (FB)2N2 from N2 and Fluoroborylene BF</title>

         <dc:description>
The four&#8208;membered heterocycle FB(&#956;&#8208;N)2BF is obtained from fluoroborylene, FB, and N2. It shows a complete cleavage of the N2 triple bond and a delocalized aromatic two&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;bond conjugated with the exo&#8208;cyclic fluorine &#960; lone pairs, indicating the importance of fluorine&#8208;specific interactions.







Abstract
A complete cleavage of the triple bond of N2 by fluoroborylene (:BF) was achieved in a low&#8208;temperature N2 matrix by the formation of the four&#8208;membered heterocycle FB(&#956;&#8208;N)2BF, which lacks a trans&#8208;annular N&#8722;N bond. Additionally, the linear complex FB=N&#8722;N=BF and cyclic FB(&#951;2&#8208;N2) were formed. These novel species were characterized by their matrix infrared spectra and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The puckered four&#8208;membered&#8208;ring B2N2 complex shows a delocalized aromatic two&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;system in conjugation with the exo&#8208;cyclic fluorine &#960; lone pairs. This work may contribute to a rational design of catalysts based on borylene for artificial dinitrogen activation.

         <title>Tissue Fluid Triggered Enzyme Polymerization for Ultrafast Gelation and Cartilage Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  in&#8208;situ  gelation of injectable precursors is desirable in the field of tissue regeneration, especially in the context of irregular defect filling. The current driving forces for fast gelation include the phase&#8208;transition of thermally sensitive copolymers, click chemical reactions with tissue components, and metal coordination effect. However, the rapid formation of tough hydrogels remains a challenge. Inspired by aerobic metabolism, we herein propose a tissue&#8208;fluid&#8208;triggered cascade enzymatic polymerization process catalyzed by glucose oxidase and ferrous glycinate for the ultrafast gelation of acryloylated chondroitin sulfates and acrylamides. The highly efficient production of carbon radicals and macromolecules contribute to auto&#8208;accelerated polymerization for soft tissue augmentation in bone defects. The copolymer hydrogel demonstrated the regeneration&#8208;promoting capacity of cartilage. As the first example of using artificial enzyme complexes for  in&#8208;situ  polymerization, this work offers a biomimetic approach to the design of strength&#8208;adjustable hydrogels for bio&#8208;implanting and bio&#8208;printing applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), a new concept of entropy stabilization, exhibit unique structures and fascinating properties, and are thus important class of materials with significant technological potential.&#160;However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques tend to afford micron&#8208;scale HEOs with low surface area, and the catalytic activity of available HEOs is still far from satisfactory because of their limited exposed active sites and poor intrinsic activity. Here, we report a low&#8208;temperature plasma strategy for preparing defect&#8208;rich HEOs nanosheets with high surface area, and for the first time employ them as electrocatalysts for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electrooxidation. Owing to the nanosheets structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, and high surface area, the quinary (FeCrCoNiCu)  3  O  4  &#160;HEOs nanosheets deliver improved electrocatalytic activity for HMF oxidation with lower onset potential and faster kinetics, outperforming that of HEOs prepared by high&#8208;temperature method. Our methodology could not only open new opportunities for investigating the properties of HEOs, but also be applicable for the discovery of nanostructured materials with great potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale chemical imaging of supported lipid monolayers using Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualizing the molecular organization of lipid membranes is essential to comprehend their biological functions. However, current analytical techniques fail to provide a non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free characterization of lipid films under ambient conditions at nanometer length scales. In this work, we demonstrate the capability of tip&#8209;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to probe the molecular organization of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111), prepared using the Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett (LB) technique. High&#8208;quality TERS spectra were obtained, that permitted a direct correlation of the topography of the lipid monolayer with its TERS image for the first time. Furthermore, hyperspectral TERS imaging revealed the presence of nanometer&#8209;sized holes within a continuous DPPC monolayer structure. This shows that a homogeneously transferred LB monolayer is heterogeneous at the nanoscale.&#160;&#160;Finally, the high sensitivity and spatial resolution down to 20 nm of TERS enabled reproducible, hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder in the DPPC monolayers, demonstrating that TERS is a promising nanoanalytical tool to investigate the molecular organization of lipid membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting photocatalytic water oxidation over bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting provides an economically feasible way for converting solar energy into hydrogen. Great efforts have been devoted to developing efficient photocatalysts; however, the surface catalytic reactions, especially for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), still remains as a big challenge, which limits the overall photocatalytic energy efficiency. Here, we design a kind of Rhn cluster cocatalyst, with bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites anchoring on the Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 model photocatalytic system. The resultant photocatalyst enables a super high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity of 7.11 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 29.37% at 420 nm. Besides, the turnover frequency (TOF) value of the excellent photocatalyst could achieve 416.73 h&#8208;1, which is 378 times higher than that of the photocatalyst only decorated with Rh3+ species. The experimental and theoretical results unambiguously demonstrate the existence of stable isolated Rhn cocatalyst with Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites, and the operando X&#8208;ray absorption characterization proves the OER process on the bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites. The density functional theoretical calculations further illustrate a bifunctional OER mechanism over the Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites, in which the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites with assistance of a hydrogen atom transfer to the Rh0 sites, thus breaking the scaling relationship of various oxygen intermediates. This work demonstrates the potential of bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites to circumvent the OER scaling relationship to construct high&#8208;performance photocatalysts or photoelectrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Copper Chaperone NosL forms a Heterometal Site for Cu Delivery to Nitrous Oxide Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The final step of denitrification is the reduction of nitrous oxide (N  2  O) to N  2  , mediated by Cu&#8208;dependent nitrous oxide reductase (N  2  OR). Its metal centers, Cu  A  and Cu  Z  , are assembled through sequential provision of twelve Cu(I) ions by a metallochaperone that forms part of a  nos  gene cluster encoding the enzyme and its accessory factors. The chaperone is the  nosL  gene product, an 18 kDa lipoprotein predicted to reside in the outer membrane of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. In order to better understand the assembly of N  2  OR, we have produced NosL from  Shewanella denitrificans  and determined the structure of the metal&#8208;loaded chaperone by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protein assembled a hetero&#173;di&#173;nuclear metal site consisting of Zn(II) and Cu(I), as evidenced by anomalous X&#8208;ray scattering. While only Cu(I) is delivered to the enzyme, the stabilizing presence of Zn(II) is essential for the functionality and structural integrity of the chaperone.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;based Conjugated Acetylenic Polymers with Dual Active Sites for Efficient Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;free Photoelectrochemical Water Reduction in Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although being attractive materials for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (PEC HER) under neutral or acidic conditions, conjugated polymers still show poor PEC HER performance in alkaline medium due to the lack of water dissociation sites. Herein, we demonstrate that tailoring the polymer skeleton from poly(diethynylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (pDET) to poly(2,6&#8208;diethynylbenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene (pBDT) and poly(diethynyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2',3'&#8208;d]thiophene) (pDTT) in conjugated acetylenic polymers (CAPs) introduces highly efficient active sites for water dissociation. As a result, pDTT and pBDT, grown on Cu substrate, demonstrate benchmark photocurrent densities of 170 &#181;A cm&#8208;2 and 120 &#181;A cm&#8208;2 (at 0.3 V vs. RHE; pH 13), which are 4.2 and 3 times higher than that of pDET, respectively. Moreover, by combining DFT calculations and electrochemical operando resonance Raman spectroscopy, we propose that the electron&#8208;enriched C&#946; of the outer thiophene rings of pDTT are the water dissociation active sites, while the &#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208; bonds function as the active sites for hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Alkenes Using a Nanostructured Ni&#8208;Core&#8211;Shell Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation and deuteration of olefins made easy: A core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;nanocatalyst (Ni&#8201;NPs@C) allows the selective hydrogenation and deuteration of alkenes under ambient conditions (1&#8197;bar H2/D2, room temperature).







Abstract
A general protocol for the selective hydrogenation and deuteration of a variety of alkenes is presented. Key to success for these reactions is the use of a specific nickel&#8208;graphitic shell&#8208;based core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured catalyst, which is conveniently prepared by impregnation and subsequent calcination of nickel nitrate on carbon at 450&#8201;&#176;C under argon. Applying this nanostructured catalyst, both terminal and internal alkenes, which are of industrial and commercial importance, were selectively hydrogenated and deuterated at ambient conditions (room temperature, using 1&#8197;bar hydrogen or 1&#8197;bar deuterium), giving access to the corresponding alkanes and deuterium&#8208;labeled alkanes in good to excellent yields. The synthetic utility and practicability of this Ni&#8208;based hydrogenation protocol is demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale reactions as well as efficient catalyst recycling experiments.

         <title>Anisotropic Synthetic Allomelanin Materials via Solid&#8208;State Polymerization of Self&#8208;Assembled 1,8&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method to achieve synthetic melanin materials with various well&#8208;defined architectures, ranging from spheres to anisotropic sheets and ellipsoidal platelets, is described. The specific shapes are obtained through pre&#8208;organizing the building blocks of melanins, followed by solid&#8208;state oxidative polymerization to render polymeric materials without changing the overall morphology.







Abstract
Melanosomes in nature have diverse morphologies, including spheres, rods, and platelets. By contrast, shapes of synthetic melanins have been almost entirely limited to spherical nanoparticles with few exceptions produced by complex templated synthetic methods. Here, we report a non&#8208;templated method to access synthetic melanins with a variety of architectures including spheres, sheets, and platelets. Three 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene dimers (4&#8208;4&#8242;, 2&#8208;4&#8242; and 2&#8208;2&#8242;) were used as self&#8208;assembling synthons. These dimers pack to form well&#8208;defined structures of varying morphologies depending on the isomer. Specifically, distinctive ellipsoidal platelets can be obtained using 4&#8208;4&#8242; dimers. Solid&#8208;state polymerization of the preorganized dimers generates polymeric synthetic melanins while maintaining the initial particle morphologies. This work provides a new route to anisotropic synthetic melanins, where the building blocks are preorganized into specific shapes, followed by solid&#8208;state polymerization.

&lt;p&gt;Melanosomes in nature have diverse morphologies, including spheres, rods, and platelets. By contrast, shapes of synthetic melanins have been almost entirely limited to spherical nanoparticles with few exceptions produced by complex templated synthetic methods. Here, we report a non-templated method to access synthetic melanins with a variety of architectures including spheres, sheets, and platelets. Three 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene dimers (4-4&#8242;, 2-4&#8242; and 2-2&#8242;) were used as self-assembling synthons. These dimers pack to form well-defined structures of varying morphologies depending on the isomer. Specifically, distinctive ellipsoidal platelets can be obtained using 4-4&#8242; dimers. Solid-state polymerization of the preorganized dimers generates polymeric synthetic melanins while maintaining the initial particle morphologies. This work provides a new route to anisotropic synthetic melanins, where the building blocks are preorganized into specific shapes, followed by solid-state polymerization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Ultralong Phosphorescence with Lifetime over 5 s for Reversible Water&#8208;Jet Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials responsive to water have been achieved, showing phosphorescent quantum yield of 16.1&#8201;% and lifetime of 5.08&#8197;s. Lifetime&#8208;encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns are jet&#8208;printed using water as ink on the water&#8208;responsive OURTP paper and erased by solvent fuming with high reversibility and cycling stability.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials with photophysical properties sensitive to external stimulus are highly attractive for advanced applications. However, most OURTP molecules are in crystal and OURTP materials with good practicability and stimulus&#8208;responsive character are hard to be achieved. Here, we report, for the first time, the highly efficient, ultralong&#8208;lived and deep&#8208;blue OURTP materials by simply doping boron phosphor into cyanuric acid host. Host&#8211;guest OURTP composites with abundant and tunable H&#8208;bond network are highly stable in air with ultralong lifetime of 5.08&#8197;s at room temperature. They are sensitive to water, which can strength the H&#8208;bond network to significantly enhance OURTP quantum yield from 16.1&#8201;% to 37.6&#8201;%. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting paper was easily prepared for water&#8208;jet printing; the jet&#8208;printed high&#8208;resolution OURTP patterns can be easily erased by solvent fuming for another printing/erasing cycle with high reversibility.

         <title>The Role of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on Cluster Formation: Pentamer, Hexamers and Heptamer of Difluoromethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size&#8208;limit of cluster investigation is pushed forward in this high&#8208;resolution gas phase rotational spectroscopy study. First detection of a pentamer, two hexamers and one heptamer of difluoromethane, through a synergic work of theoretical protocols and advanced experiments. This intricate balance of weak non&#8208;covalent interactions is analyzed in&#8208;depth.







Abstract
The role of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) has broadened with the inclusion of new types of interactions and a plethora of weak donor/acceptor partners. This work illustrates the potential of chirped&#8208;pulse Fourier transform microwave technique, which has revolutionized the field of rotational spectroscopy. In particular, it has been exploited to reveal the role of NCIs&#8217; in the molecular self&#8208;aggregation of difluoromethane where a pentamer, two hexamers and a heptamer were detected. The development of a new automated assignment program and a sophisticated computational screening protocol was essential for identifying the homoclusters in conditions of spectral congestion. The major role of dispersion forces leads to less directional interactions and more distorted structures than those found in polar clusters, although a detailed analysis demonstrates that the dominant interaction energy is the pairwise interaction. The tetramer cluster is identified as a structural unit in larger clusters, representing the maximum expression of bond between dimers.

         <title>Dual Emission: Classes, Mechanisms, and Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;emission (DE) materials have found widespread use in the materials and life sciences. This systematic, tutorial Review offers a clear presentation of the phenomenon and highlights misinterpretations as well as further literature with the aim of promoting the further targeted development of DE materials.







Abstract
There has been much interest in dual&#8208;emission materials in the past few years for materials and life science applications; however, a systematic overview of the underlying processes is so&#8208;far missing. We resolve this issue herein by classifying dual&#8208;emission (DE) phenomena as relying on one emitter with two emitting states (DE1), two independent emitters (DE2), or two correlated emitters (DE3). Relevant DE mechanisms for materials science are then briefly described together with the electronic and/or geometrical conditions under which they occur. For further reading, references are given that offer detailed insight into the complex mechanistic aspects of the various DE processes or provide overviews on materials families or their applications. By avoiding ambiguities and misinterpretations, this systematic, insightful Review might inspire future targeted designs of DE materials.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Cyanide and Isocyanides from CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactions of K[N(SiMe3)2] with 13CO affords K13CN and O(SiMe3)2 under mild conditions. DFT calculations affirmed this reaction proceeds via an isocyanide intermediate. This was confirmed experimentally as the alkali metal amides, M[N(SiR3)R&#8242;] (M=Li, K; R=Ph, Me; R&#8242;=alkyl, aryl) are shown to provide a facile route to the 19 13C labeled isocyanide RN13C and MOSiR3 generally in high yields.







Abstract
The reaction of K[N(SiMe3)2] with 13CO proceeds in C6D6 or THF affording K13CN and O(SiMe3)2 under mild conditions as confirmed by crystallographic characterization of K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)CN. Similarly reaction of the alkali metal amides, M[N(SiR3)R&#8242;] (M=Li, K; R=Ph, Me; R&#8242;=alkyl, aryl) provides the corresponding 13C labeled isocyanide RN13C and MOSiR3, generally in high yields. In some instances, the use of the sterically bulky Ph3Si&#8208;substituent is required to preclude 1,2&#8208;silyl migration affording the silylcarbamoyl salt M[Me3SiC(O)NR&#8242;]. These reactions have been used to obtain 19 examples of 13C labelled isocyanides, and several examples of gram scale reactions are reported. The mechanism of the reactions is probed via reliable DFT calculations.

         <title>Identification of a Pyrrole Intermediate Which Undergoes C&#8208;Glycosidation and Autoxidation to Yield the Final Product in Showdomycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8208;nucleoside biosynthesis: The biosynthetic pathway of the C&#8208;nucleoside showdomycin was reconstituted in vitro. Key steps include cyclization of l&#8208;glutamine to yield an oxygen&#8208;labile pyrrole intermediate that serves as the substrate for C&#8208;glycosidation catalyzed by SdmA. Autoxidative maturation of the pyrrole nucleobase to the maleimide moiety of showdomycin can then proceed non&#8208;enzymatically.







Abstract
Showdomycin is a C&#8208;nucleoside bearing an electrophilic maleimide base. Herein, the biosynthetic pathway of showdomycin is presented. The initial stages of the pathway involve non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mediated assembly of a 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid intermediate. This intermediate is prone to air oxidation whereupon it undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to yield an imine of maleimide, which in turn yields the maleimide upon acidification. It is also shown that this pyrrole intermediate serves as the substrate for the C&#8208;glycosidase SdmA in the pathway. After coupling with ribose 5&#8208;phosphate, the resulting C&#8208;nucleoside undergoes a similar sequence of oxidation, decarboxylation and deamination to afford showdomcyin after exposure to air. These results suggest that showdomycin could be an artifact due to aerobic isolation; however, the autoxidation may also serve to convert an otherwise inert product of the biosynthetic pathway to an electrophilic C&#8208;nucleotide thereby endowing showdomycin with its observed bioactivities.

Key steps include cyclization of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-glutamine to yield an oxygen-labile pyrrole intermediate that serves as the substrate for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosidation catalyzed by SdmA. Autoxidative maturation of the pyrrole nucleobase to the maleimide moiety of showdomycin can then proceed non-enzymatically.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showdomycin is a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-nucleoside bearing an electrophilic maleimide base. Herein, the biosynthetic pathway of showdomycin is presented. The initial stages of the pathway involve non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mediated assembly of a 2-amino-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrrole-5-carboxylic acid intermediate. This intermediate is prone to air oxidation whereupon it undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to yield an imine of maleimide, which in turn yields the maleimide upon acidification. It is also shown that this pyrrole intermediate serves as the substrate for the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosidase SdmA in the pathway. After coupling with ribose 5-phosphate, the resulting &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-nucleoside undergoes a similar sequence of oxidation, decarboxylation and deamination to afford showdomcyin after exposure to air. These results suggest that showdomycin could be an artifact due to aerobic isolation; however, the autoxidation may also serve to convert an otherwise inert product of the biosynthetic pathway to an electrophilic &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-nucleotide thereby endowing showdomycin with its observed bioactivities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Silica Jar&#8208;with&#8208;Lid as Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Compartment for Enantioselective Synthesis inside Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Round bottom jar&#8208;like silica nanostructure (SiJAR) fitted with a Mn&#8208;silicate lid was fabricated through the highly controlled thermal solid&#8208;state conversion of a MnO nanocrystal at the inside of hollow SiO2 shell. The lid aperture&#8208;opening created an open&#8208;mouth nanoreactor accommodating catalytic metal nanocrystals and enzymes, which performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity inside living cells.







Abstract
Nanodevices, harvesting the power of synthetic catalysts and enzymes to perform enantioselective synthesis inside cell, have never been reported. Here, we synthesized round bottom jar&#8208;like silica nanostructures (SiJARs) with a chemo&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;silicate lid. This was isolated as an intermediate structure during highly controlled solid&#8208;state nanocrystal&#8208;conversion at the arc&#8208;section of silica shell. Different catalytic noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ru) were selectively modified on the lid&#8208;section through galvanic reactions. And, lid aperture&#8208;opening was regulated by mild acidic conditions or intracellular environment which accommodated the metal nanocrystals and enzymes, and in turn created an open&#8208;mouth nanoreactor. Distinct from the free enzymes, SiJARs performed asymmetric aldol reactions with high activity and enantioselectivity (yield &gt;99&#8201;%, ee=95&#8201;%) and also functioned as the artificial catalytic organelles inside living cells. This work bridges the enormous potential of sophisticated nanocrystal&#8208;conversion chemistry and advanced platforms for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature catalysis.

         <title>Deformylation of 5&#8208;Formylcytidine in Different Cell Types</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of deformylation rates in different cell types and developmental states using a novel synthesis route towards 2&#8242;&#8208;F&#8208;fdC shows that deformylation is a wide spread process that is inversely correlated with cell division.







Abstract
Epigenetic programming of cells requires methylation of deoxycytidines (dC) to 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;dC (mdC) followed by oxidation to 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC), and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). Subsequent transformation of fdC and cadC back to dC by various pathways establishes a chemical intra&#8208;genetic control circle. One of the discussed pathways involves the Tdg&#8208;independent deformylation of fdC directly to dC. Here we report the synthesis of a fluorinated fdC feeding probe (F&#8208;fdC) to study direct deformylation to F&#8208;dC. The synthesis was performed along a novel pathway that circumvents any F&#8208;dC as a reaction intermediate to avoid contamination interference. Feeding of F&#8208;fdC and observation of F&#8208;dC formation in vivo allowed us to gain insights into the Tdg&#8208;independent removal process. While deformylation was shown to occur in stem cells, we here provide data that prove deformylation also in different somatic cell types. We also investigated active demethylation in a non&#8208;dividing neurogenin&#8208;inducible system of iPS cells that differentiate into bipolar neurons.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Conjugated Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of conjugated enynes has been realized for the synthesis of chiral propargylamines with high efficiency (up to 99.9&#8201;% ee and TON=2000). Mechanism studies indicate that the accompanying Zn2+ generated from zinc reduction of the CoII complex exhibits an activating effect for the initiation of the plausible CoI/CoIII catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation is one of the most powerful methods for the preparation of single enantiomer compounds. However, the chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of the relatively inert unsaturated group in substrates possessing multiple unsaturated bonds remains a challenge. We herein report a protocol for the highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of conjugated enynes while keeping the alkynyl bond intact. Mechanism studies indicate that the accompanying Zn2+ generated from zinc reduction of the CoII complex plays a critical role to initiate a plausible CoI/CoIII catalytic cycle. This approach allows for the highly efficient generation of chiral propargylamines (up to 99.9&#8201;% ee and 2000 S/C) and further useful chemical transformations.

         <title>Scholl Reaction of Perylene&#8208;Based Polyphenylene Precursors under Different Conditions: Formation of Hexagon or Octagon?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that Scholl reaction of a bis&#8208;perylene precursor gave either a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) or a negatively curved PAH embedded with octagons, which can be explained by a radical cation or an arenium ion mechanism under different reaction conditions. The formed molecules show non&#8208;aggregative feature and exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields.







Abstract
A planar dibenzo&#8208;peri&#8208;hexacene derivative (2) was synthesized via FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl reaction from a cyclopenta&#8208;fused perylene (CP) based polyphenylene precursor (1). However, an unexpected octagon&#8208;containing, negatively curved molecule (3) was obtained in nearly quantitative yield when 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) and methanesulfonic acid (MeSO3H) were used. Similar results were observed when two smaller&#8208;sized precursors containing one (4) or two CP units (5) were tested. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis also revealed that there is no close &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between neighboring &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons. DFT calculations suggest a radical cation mechanism in the presence of FeCl3 while an arenium ion pathway for the DDQ/MeSO3H mediated Scholl reaction, which can well explain the selective formation of hexagons and octagons under different conditions. The obtained compounds showed tunable optical and electrochemical properties.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Thiocarbonylation of Alkynes toward Linear and Branched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Thioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective thiocarbonylation of alkynes is reported. Various linear and branched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters are produced in a straightforward manner. This protocol is characterized by its ligand&#8208;controlled regioselectivity pattern, wide substrate scope, and unprecedented functional group compatibility. This is the first example on thiocarbonylation of internal alkynes.







Abstract
Thiocarbonylation of alkynes offers an ideal procedure for the synthesis of unsaturated thioesters. A robust ligand&#8208;controlled regioselective thiocarbonylation of alkynes is developed. Utilizing boronic acid and 5&#8208;chlorosalicylic acid as the acid additive to in situ form 5&#8208;chloroborosalicylic acid (5&#8208;Cl&#8208;BSA), and bis(2&#8208;diphenylphosphinophenyl)ether (DPEphos) as the ligand, linear &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters were produced in a straightforward manner.

&lt;p&gt;A ligand-controlled regioselective thiocarbonylation of alkynes is reported. Various linear and branched &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated thioesters are produced in a straightforward manner. This protocol is characterized by its ligand-controlled regioselectivity pattern, wide substrate scope, and unprecedented functional group compatibility. This is the first example on thiocarbonylation of internal alkynes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiocarbonylation of alkynes offers an ideal procedure for the synthesis of unsaturated thioesters. A robust ligand-controlled regioselective thiocarbonylation of alkynes is developed. Utilizing boronic acid and 5-chlorosalicylic acid as the acid additive to in situ form 5-chloroborosalicylic acid (5-Cl-BSA), and bis(2-diphenylphosphinophenyl)ether (DPEphos) as the ligand, linear &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated thioesters were produced in a straightforward manner. Switching the ligand to tri(2-furyl)phosphine can turn the reaction selectivity to give branched products. Remarkably, this approach also represents the first example on thiocarbonylation of internal alkynes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Development of a Borane&#8211;(Meth)acrylate Photo&#8208;Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene&#8211;borane complexes can lead to a photochemically triggered borane&#8211;acrylate click reaction, a new type of photo&#8208;click reaction. Because boranes have three substituents they can participate to cross&#8208;linking, unlike thiols in thiol&#8211;(meth)acrylate reactions. This generates materials with improved mechanical properties.







Abstract
In the development of 3D printing fuels, there is a need for new photoinitiating systems working under mild conditions and/or leading to polymers with new and/or enhanced properties. In this context, we introduce herein N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8211;borane complexes as reagents for a new type of photo&#8208;click reaction, the borane&#8211;(meth)acrylate click reaction. Remarkably, the higher bond number of boranes relative to thiols induced an increase of the network density associated with faster polymerization kinetics. Solid&#8208;state NMR evidenced the strong participation of the boron centers on the network properties, while DMA and AFM showed that the materials exhibit improved mechanical properties, as well as reduced solvent swelling.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Switchable Catalysis for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Cyclic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a switchable catalytic system that involves ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides/anhydrides/CO2 and photo&#8208;induced intramolecular radical addition has been demonstrated. It enabled the direct synthesis of well&#8208;defined cyclic polyesters and cyclic CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates from mixtures of monomers in an efficient process.







Abstract
A cobalt salen pentenoate complex [salen=(R,R)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutylsalicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine] is rationally designed as the catalyst for the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides/CO2. Via migratory insertion of carbon monoxide (CO) into the Co&#8722;O bonds, the ROCOP&#8208;active species &#945;&#8208;alkene&#8208;&#969;&#8208;O&#8208;CoIII(salen) can be rapidly and quantitatively transformed into &#945;&#8208;alkene&#8208;&#969;&#8208;O2C&#8208;CoIII(salen) telechelic linear precursors. Upon dilution of reaction mixtures, the homolytic cleavage of Co&#8722;C bonds induced by visible light generates &#945;&#8208;alkene acyl radicals that spontaneously undergo intramolecular radical addition to afford organocobalt&#8208;functionalized cyclic polyesters and CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates with excellent regioselectivity. The cyclic products can either react with radical scavengers to generate metal&#8208;free cyclic polymers or serve as photo&#8208;initiators for organometallic&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (OMRP) to produce tadpole&#8208;shaped copolymers.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Ionization Induced Stable White Organic Long Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic long persistent luminescence with afterglow lasting up to 20&#8211;40&#8197;minutes was achieved based on two&#8208;photon ionization mechanism at room temperature in a simple binary system. Through modulation of molecular structures and potential ISC channels between excited states, the afterglow profiles can be rationally tuned from cyan (0.19, 0.22), cold white (0.31, 0.35), standard white (0.33, 0.33) to warm white (0.31, 0.46).







Abstract
Organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials with afterglow duration in the scale of minutes or even hours are still rare. Most OLPL systems are based on exciplexes, which require complicated multi&#8208;component system in order to realize white afterglow but with slightly compromised duration and color stability. In this work, OLPLs lasting from 20 to 40 minutes are realized in a simple binary system based on two&#8208;photon ionization mechanism, which can simultaneously harvest excitons from both singlet and triplet excited states, making it potentially one of the most promising candidates to achieve stable white OLPL. Through modulation and optimization of dopant molecules in dibenzo[b,d]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yldiphenyl phosphine oxide host, the emission profiles of afterglow can be readily tuned from cyan (0.19, 0.22), cold white (0.31, 0.35), standard white (0.33, 0.33) to warm white (0.31, 0.46), with excellent color consistency.

         <title>Phenacyl Phenothiazinium Salt as a New Broad&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Absorbing Photoinitiator for Cationic and Free Radical Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new single component broad&#8208;band photoinitiator absorbing light at UV, Visible and Near&#8208;IR region for the initiation of free radical, cationic and hybrid polymerizations. This new photoinitiator may expand the curing application range of formulations of various pigmented systems.







Abstract
A novel broad&#8208;wavelength&#8208;absorbing photoinitiator based on phenacyl phenothiazinium hexafluroantimonate (P&#8208;PTh) possessing both phenacyl and phenothiazine chromophoric groups was reported. P&#8208;PTh absorbs light at UV, Visible and Near&#8208;IR region. Photophysical, photochemical, and computational investigations revealed that P&#8208;PTh in solution decomposes at all wavelengths by homolytic and heterolytic cleavages and generates cationic and radical species, which could efficiently initiate cationic and free radical polymerizations. It is anticipated that the photoinitiator with such wavelength flexibility may open up new pathways in curing applications of formulations of pigment systems.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity of Acid&#8208;Free Neutral Oxoborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane has been prepared via a serendipitous discovery, from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf in which the shortest B=O distance observed so far has been measured, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of an acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane of the type carboranyl&#8208;B(carbene)=O has been developed via a serendipitous discovery from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf. This represents a new type of oxoborane. The stabilization of this oxoborane may be attributed to 1)&#8197;kinetic stabilization provided by a bulky 3D carboranyl ligand and 2)&#8197;thermodynamic stabilization offered by a carbene ligand. Crystallographic analyses support the presence of the shortest terminal B=O double bond ever reported thus far. Its reactivity has also been examined.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient synthesis of an acid-free neutral oxoborane of the type carboranyl-B(carbene)=O has been developed via a serendipitous discovery from the reaction of 1,2-[BBr(carbene)]-o-carborane with AgOTf. This represents a new type of oxoborane. The stabilization of this oxoborane may be attributed to 1)&#8197;kinetic stabilization provided by a bulky 3D carboranyl ligand and 2)&#8197;thermodynamic stabilization offered by a carbene ligand. Crystallographic analyses support the presence of the shortest terminal B=O double bond ever reported thus far. Its reactivity has also been examined.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interfacial Microenvironment Modulation Boosting Electron Transfer between Metal Nanoparticles and MOFs for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt co&#8208;catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as PtPVP), Pt with partially removed PVP (PtrPVP), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), are encapsulated in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). Systemic investigations suggest that the PVP presents negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF, and the PVP removal greatly boosts photocatalysis.







Abstract
Interfacial electron transfer between cocatalyst and photosensitizer is key in heterogeneous photocatalysis, yet the underlying mechanism remains subtle and unclear. Surfactant coated on the metal cocatalysts, greatly modulating the microenvironment of catalytic sites, is largely ignored. Herein, a series of Pt co&#8208;catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as PtPVP), Pt with partially removed PVP (PtrPVP), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), were encapsulated into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, to afford PtPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, PtrPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, and Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, respectively, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The PVP appears to have a negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF. Compared with PtPVP@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the removal of interfacial PVP improves the sluggish kinetics of electron transfer, boosting photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis with Telluronium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonding results from non&#8208;covalent interaction occurring between electrodeficient chalcogen atoms and Lewis bases. Among the chalcogens, tellurium is the strongest Lewis acid but Te&#8208;based compounds are scarcely used as organocatalyst. For the first time, telluronium cations demonstrated impressive catalytic property at low loading in three benchmark reactions: the Friedel&#8208;Crafts bromination of anisole, the bromolactonization of &#969;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids and the aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder between Danishefsky&#8217;s diene and imines. The ability of telluronium cations to interact with a Lewis base through chalcogen bonding was demonstrated on the basis of multi&#8208;nuclear (  17  O,  31  P and  125  Te) NMR analysis and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemistry and Microstructure Perspective on Ion Conducting Membranes for Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with decoupled control over power and energy are known as one of the most promising grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies. However, the development of RFBs with high round&#8208;trip efficiency, high rate capability and long cycle life for practical applications is highly restricted by the lack of appropriate ion conducting membranes. Promising RFB membranes should separate positive and negative species completely and conduct balancing ions smoothly, and it is also critical to meet the additional requirements in specific systems, such as high chemical stability in corrosive electrolytes, good resistance to organic solvents in nonaqueous systems, and excellent mechanical strength and flexibility. These rigorous requirements put high demands on the membrane design, essentially the chemistry and microstructure associated with ion transport channels. In this review, we summarize the design rationale of recently reported RFB membranes at the molecular level, with the emphasis on the new chemistry, novel microstructure, and innovative fabrication strategy. Future challenges and potential research opportunities within this field are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Beam search for automated design and scoring of novel ROR ligands with machine intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical language models enable de novo drug design without the requirement for explicit molecular construction rules. While such models have been applied to generate novel compounds with desired bioactivity, the actual prioritization and selection of the most promising computational designs remains challenging. In this work, we leveraged the probabilities learnt by chemical language models with the beam search algorithm as a model&#8208;intrinsic technique for automated molecule design and scoring. Prospective application of this method yielded three novel inverse agonists of retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptors (RORs). Each design was synthesizable in three reaction steps and presented low&#8208;micromolar to nanomolar potency towards ROR&#947;. This model&#8208;intrinsic sampling technique eliminates the strict need for external compound scoring functions, thereby further extending the applicability of generative artificial intelligence to data&#8208;driven drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskitoid with Zwitterion Cysteamine Linker and Its Crystal&#8208;Crystal Transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate synthesis of a new low&#8208;D hybrid perovskitoid (a perovskite&#8208;like hybrid halide structure, yellow crystals, P21/n space group) using zwitterion cysteamine (2&#8208;aminoethanethiol) linker, and its remarkable molecular diffusion&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation to Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper phase (Red crystals, Pnma space group). Our stable intermediate perovskitoid distinctly differs from all previous reports by way of a unique staggered arrangement of holes in the puckered 2D configuration with a face&#8208;sharing connection between the corrugated&#8208;1D double chains. The PL intensity for the yellow phase is 5 orders higher as compared to the red phase and the corresponding average lifetime is also fairly long (143 ns). First principles DFT calculations conform very well with the experimental band gap data. We demonstrate applicability of the new perovskitoid yellow phase as an excellent active layer in a self&#8208;powered photodetector and for selective detection of Ni2+ via On&#8208;Off&#8208;On photoluminescence (PL) based on its composite with few layer black phosphorous.</dc:description>

         <title>"Repaired and Activated" DNAzyme Enables the Monitoring of DNA Alkylation Repair in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct measurement of DNA repair is critical for the annotation of their clinical relevance and the discovery of drugs for cancer therapy.  Here we reported a "repaired and activated" DNAzyme (RADzyme) by incorporating a single methyl lesion (O  6  MeG, 3MeC, or 1MeA) at designated positions through systematic screening  . We found that the catalytic activity of the RADzyme was remarkably suppressed and could be restored via enzyme&#8208;mediated DNA repair. Benefit from these findings, a fluorogenic RADzyme sensor was developed for the monitoring of MGMT&#8208;mediated repair of O  6  MeG lesion. Importantly, the sensor allowed the evaluation of MGMT repair activity in different cells and under drugs treatment. Furthermore, another RADzyme sensor was engineered for the monitoring of ALKBH2&#8208;mediated repair of 3MeC lesion. This strategy provides a simple and versatile tool for the study of the basic biology of DNA repair, clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;translational Formation of Aminomalonate by a Promiscuous Peptide&#8208;modifying Radical SAM Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminomalonate (Ama) is a widespread structural motif in Nature, whereas its biosynthetic route is only partially understood. In this study, we show that a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in cyclophane biosynthesis exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity. This enzyme, named three&#8208;residue cyclophane forming enzyme (3&#8208;CyFE), mainly produces cyclophane in vivo, whereas it produces formylglycine (FGly) as a major product and barely produce cyclophane in vitro. Importantly, the enzyme can further oxidize FGly to produce Ama. Bioinformatics study revealed that 3&#8208;CyFEs have evolved from a common ancestor with anaerobic sulfatase maturases (anSMEs), and possess a similar set of catalytic residues with anSMEs. Remarkably, the enzyme does not need leader peptide for activity and is fully active on a truncated peptide containing only 5 amino acids of the core sequence. Our work discloses the first ribosomal path towards Ama formation, providing a possible hint for the rich occurrence of Ama in Nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Electro&#8208;mediated PhotoRedox Catalysis for Selective C(sp3)&#8208;O Cleavages of Phosphinated Alcohols to Carbanions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel example of electro&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis (e&#8208;PRC) in the reductive cleavage of C(sp  3  )&#8208;O bonds of phosphinated alcohols to alkyl carbanions. As well as deoxygenations, olefinations are reported which are  E  &#8208;selective and can be made  Z  &#8208;selective in a tandem reduction/photosensitization process where both steps are photoelectrochemically promoted. Spectroscopy, computation and catalyst structural variations reveal that our new naphthalene monoimide&#8208;type catalyst allows for a more intimate dispersive precomplexation of its radical anion form with the phosphinate substrate, facilitating a reactivity&#8208;determining C(sp  3  )&#8208;O cleavage. Surprisingly and in contrast to previously reported photoexcited radical anion chemistries, our conditions i) tolerate aryl chlorides/bromides and ii) do not give rise to Birch&#8208;type reductions.</dc:description>

         <title>The hydrates of TEMPO: Water vibrations reveal radical microsolvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An organic radical monohydrate complex is detected in vacuum isolation at low temperature by FTIR supersonic jet spectroscopy for the first time. It is shown to exhibit a rich conformational and vibrational coupling dynamics, which can be drastically reduced by appropriate isotope substitution. Its detection with a new gas recycling infrared spectrometer demonstrates the thermal metastability of the gaseous TEMPO radical even under humid gas conditions. Compared to its almost isoelectronic and isostructural, closed shell ketone analog, the hydrogen bond of the solvating water is found to be less directional, but stronger and more strongly downshifting the bonded water OH stretch vibration. A second solvent water directs the first one into a metastable hydrogen bond position to solvate the nitrogen center and the first water at the same time.</dc:description>

         <title>From kinase inhibitors to multitarget ligands as powerful drug leads for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease using protein&#8208;templated synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) are arising as promising tools to tackle complex diseases. The main goal of this work is to create powerful modulating agents for neurodegenerative disorders. To achieve this aim, we have combined fragments that inhibit key protein kinases involved in the main pathomolecular pathways of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) such as tau aggregation, neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis, whilst looking for a third action in beta&#8208;secretase (BACE1), responsible of &#946;&#8208;amyloid production. We obtained well&#8208;balanced MTDLs with in vitro activity in three different relevant targets and efficacy in two cellular models of AD. Furthermore, computational studies confirmed how these compounds accommodate adequately into the long and rather narrow BACE1 catalytic site. Finally, we employed in situ click chemistry using BACE1 as protein template as a versatile synthetic tool that allowed us to obtain further MTDLs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Silver(I) Pentafluorooxosulphate Reagent for the Synthesis of OSF5&#8208;Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the straightforward preparation of silver(I) pentafluorooxosulphate from commercially available AgF and OSF4  . The compound is surprisingly stable in a MeCN&#8208;solution. Apart from that, AgOSF5  has been further stabilised by the addition of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine ligands. Starting from solutions of the unstabilised silver(I) salt, OSF5  &#8208;complexes with Ni(II), Cu(I) and Cu(II)&#8208;centres have been obtained. In addition, AgOSF5  has proven to be generally capable of mediating the transfer of OSF5  &#8208;groups to aryne&#8208;moieties, thus furnishing a new and safe method for the preparation of OSF5  &#8208;substituted arenes. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of selected transition metal OSF5  &#8208;compounds have revealed distorted octahedral [OSF5]&#8208;  anions which are extensively stabilised by hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling cysteine&#8208;free native chemical ligation at challenging junctions with a ligation auxiliary capable of base catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligation auxiliaries are used in chemical protein synthesis to extend the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond cysteine. However, auxiliary&#8208;mediated ligations at sterically demanding junctions have been difficult. Often the thioester intermediate formed in the thiol exchange step of NCL accumulates because the subsequent S&#8594;N acyl transfer is extremely slow. Here we introduce the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl (MPyE) group as the first auxiliary designed to aid the ligation reaction by catalysis. Notably, the MPyE auxiliary provides useful rates even for junctions containing proline or a &#946;&#8208;branched amino acid. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the pyridine nitrogen acts as an intramolecular base in a rate&#8208;determining proton transfer step. The auxiliary is prepared in two steps and conveniently introduced by reductive alkylation. Auxiliary cleavage is induced upon treatment with TCEP/morpholine in presence of a Mn(II) complex as radical starter. The synthesis of a de novo designed 99mer peptide and an 80 aa long MUC1 peptide demonstrates the usefulness of the MPyE auxiliary.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous 2D and 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Dimensionality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Activity in Promoting Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimensionality is a fundamental parameter to modulate the properties of solid materials by tuning electronic structures. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a prominent class of porous crystalline materials, but the study of dimensional dependence on their physicochemical properties is still lacking. Here we illustrate photocatalytic performances of  N  ,  N  &#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (  PN  )&#8208;based COFs are heavily dependent on the structural dimensionality. Six isostructural imine&#8208;bonded  2D&#8208;PN  COFs with slipped AA stacking and one  3D&#8208;PN  COF with a 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated pts topology were prepared. All seven COFs can be heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), which typically produces polymers possessing the combination of linear (  l  ) and cyclic (  c  ) repeat units, whereas the  2D&#8208;PN  COFs, especially  2D&#8208;PN&#8208;2&#8208;OMe  exhibited much higher catalytic activity than the  3D&#8208;PN  COF, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high  l  /  c  selectivity (up to 97%). The improved performance can be ascribed to that the 2D structure has a larger internal surface area, which can provide more catalytically active sites and promote the adsorption and concentration of reactants, higher photosensitizing ability and photoinduced electron transfer efficiency.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dimensionality is a fundamental parameter to modulate the properties of solid materials by tuning electronic structures. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a prominent class of porous crystalline materials, but the study of dimensional dependence on their physicochemical properties is still lacking. Here we illustrate photocatalytic performances of  N  ,  N  -diaryl dihydrophenazine (  PN  )-based COFs are heavily dependent on the structural dimensionality. Six isostructural imine-bonded  2D-PN  COFs with slipped AA stacking and one  3D-PN  COF with a 2-fold interpenetrated pts topology were prepared. All seven COFs can be heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring-opening polymerization of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), which typically produces polymers possessing the combination of linear (  l  ) and cyclic (  c  ) repeat units, whereas the  2D-PN  COFs, especially  2D-PN-2-OMe  exhibited much higher catalytic activity than the  3D-PN  COF, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high  l  /  c  selectivity (up to 97%). The improved performance can be ascribed to that the 2D structure has a larger internal surface area, which can provide more catalytically active sites and promote the adsorption and concentration of reactants, higher photosensitizing ability and photoinduced electron transfer efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable Chromism and Photoluminescence of Spiropyran&#8208;based Liquid Crystalline Polymer with Tunable Glass Transition Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiropyran&#8208;based materials (SPBMs) can give responses to the stimulations induced by the light, heat, force, or pH, which have been used as triggers for many smart materials. Here, a cross&#8208;linkable SPBM containing mesogenic&#8208;units is synthesized, which is pale&#8208;colored, non&#8208;photoluminescent and non&#8208;mesogenic at a spiro form, but dark&#8208;colored, photoluminescent, and mesogenic at a merocyanine form. Moreover, the dynamic interconversion behaviors of the form in the different chemical environments are distinct. Liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) containing the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via a Vis&#8208;light, own a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (  T  g  ) and retain the switchable property; however, the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via a UV&#8208;light will be locked at the MC state, because the molecular movement was frozen at the room temperature lower than the given  T  g  of the LCP. Thus, programmable chromism and photoluminescence based on the tunable  T  g  can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Partial Coordination&#8208;Perturbed Bi&#8208;Copper Sites for Selective Elec&#8208;troreduction of CO2 to Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR), finding out a stable, well&#8208;defined catalyst model system to survey carefully the influence of the synergistic effect between adjacent catalytical active sites on the selective generation of C  1  or C  2  products is highly important and challenging. In this work, we elaborately design and synthesize a stable crystalline single chain catalyst model system for electrochemical CO  2  RR, which involves four homomorphic one&#8208;dimensional chain&#8208;like compounds (  Cu&#8208;PzH  ,  Cu&#8208;PzCl  ,  Cu&#8208;PzBr  and  Cu&#8208;PzI  ). The main structural difference of these four chains is that the substituents of halogen atoms with different electronegativity on the Pz ligands coordinated by active Cu ions lead to its different coordination microenvironment. In these chains, the variations of coordination microenvironment induce the different synergistic effects, which refer to the different  D  Cu&#8208;Cu  (from 3.57 to 3.63 &#197;) and  &#946;  Cu&#8208;Cu  (from 74.48 to 70.87&#176;) between bi&#8208;copper centers, directly leading to regular FE  CH4  : FE  C2H4  changes from 1:6.5, 1: 2.3, 1:1.2 to 1:0.3. At &#8208;1.0 V (vs. RHE), the FE  C2H4  of  Cu&#8208;PzH  can reach up to 60%, which is the highest in Cu&#8208;based crystalline materials, while  Cu&#8208;PzI  exhibits the highest FE  CH4  of 52%. DFT calculations discovered that the selectivity difference of electrocatalytic products is attributed to the changes of the synergistic effect of bi&#8208;Cu centers and the upshift of d&#8208;band center after the coordination microenvironment variation. This work provides a simple and stable crystalline single chain model system for systematically studying the important influence of the coordination microenvironment variations of catalytic active centers on the activity and selectivity of C  1  or C  2  reduction products in CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing efficient electrocatalysts is pivotal for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to realize the selective production of valuable chemicals and fuels. Herein, we report an amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;organic framework for efficient CO2 reduction to formate. The immobilized surface amino groups strengthen the absorption and activation of CO2 and stabilize the active intermediates, which endow an enhanced catalytic conversion to formate despite the inevitable reduction and reconstruction of the functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst during electrocatalysis. The reconstructed amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst demonstrates a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4% and a partial current density of 108 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;1.1 V vs. RHE in a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, and also delivers an enhanced current density of ~800 mA cm&#8722;2 at 3.4 V for the formate production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell configuration. This work not only provides a molecular functionalization and assembling concept of hybrid electrocatalysts but also offers valuable understandings in electrocatalyst evolution and reactor optimization for CO2 electrocatalysis and beyond.</dc:description>

The reconstructed amino-functionalized indium-based catalyst demonstrates a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4% and a partial current density of 108 mA cm&#8722;2 at -1.1 V vs. RHE in a liquid-phase flow cell, and also delivers an enhanced current density of ~800 mA cm&#8722;2 at 3.4 V for the formate production in a gas-phase flow cell configuration.

         <title>Silicon Naphthalocyanine Tetraimides: Cathode Interlayer Materials for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naphthalocyanine derivatives (SiNcTI&#8208;N and SiNcTI&#8208;Br) were firstly used as excellent cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) in organic solar cells, via introducing four electron&#8208;withdrawing imide groups and two hydrophilic alkyls  . Both of them showed deep LUMO energy levels (below &#8208;3.90 eV), good thermal stability (T d  &gt; 210 &#176;C), and strong self&#8208;doping property. The SiNcTI&#8208;Br CIM displayed high conductivity (4.5 &#215; 10 &#8208;5  S cm &#8208;1  ) and electron mobility (7.81 &#215; 10 &#8208;5  cm 2  V &#8208;1  s &#8208;1  ), which could  boost the efficiencies of the PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs  over a wide range of CIM layer thicknesses (4 &#8208; 25 nm), with maximum efficiency of 16.71%.</dc:description>

         <title>A photoredox catalyst enabled para&#8208;selective trifluoromethylation of tert&#8208;butyl arylcarbamates.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct incorporation of a trifluoromethyl group on an aromatic ring using a radical pathway has been extensively investigated. However, the direct highly  para  &#8208;selective C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of a class of arenes has not been achieved. In this study, we report a light&#8208;promoted 4,5&#8208;dichlorofluorescein (DCFS)&#8208;enabled  para  &#8208;selective C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of arylcarbamates using Langlois reagent. The preliminary mechanistic study revealed that the activated organic photocatalyst coordinated with the arylcarbamate led to  para  &#8208;selective C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation. Ten&#8208;gram scale reaction performs well highlighting the synthetic importance of this new protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Ir(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Diarylation/Annulation of Benzoic Acids: Facile Access to Multi&#8208;Aryl Spirobifluorenes as Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts for High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein disclosed is the first example of diarylation/annulation of benzoic acids via an iridium catalyst system. This protocol provides a step&#8208;economic and highly efficient pathway to 1&#8208;aryl, 1,3&#8208;diaryl, 1,7&#8208;diaryl, and 1,3,7&#8208;triaryl spirobifluorenes from readily available starting materials. The applications of multi&#8208;aryl spirobifluorenes as pure hydrocarbon (PHC) hosts for red, green, and blue (RGB) phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) were explored. Due to high triplet energies, 1,3&#8208;diaryl spirobifluorenes exhibit the potential as the host material of blue PhOLEDs. 1,7&#8208;Diaryl spirobifluorene can serve as the host of green PhOLEDs. 1,3,7&#8208;Triaryl spirobifluorene is a high&#8208;performance host for red PhOLEDs, which exhibits a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 27.3%. This work not only exemplifies the great potential of multi&#8208;aryl spirobifluorenes as PHC hosts, but also offers a new approach for the synthesis of these PHC hosts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unified Catalytic Asymmetric (4+1) and (5+1) Annulation Strategy to Access Chiral Spirooxindole&#8208;Fused Oxacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unified catalytic asymmetric (N + 1) (N = 4, 5) annulation reaction of oxindoles with bifunctional peroxides has been achieved in the presence of a chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. This general strategy utilizes peroxides as unique bielectrophilic four&#8208; or five&#8208;atom synthons to participate in the C&#8722;C and the subsequent umpolung C&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming reactions with one&#8208;carbon unit nucleophiles, thus providing a distinct method to access the valuable chiral spirooxindole&#8208;tetrahydrofurans and &#8208;tetrahydropyrans with good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the origin of high enantioselectvity. The gram&#8208;scale syntheses and synthetic utility of the resultant products were also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the druggability of conserved RNA regulatory elements in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains a positive single&#8208;stranded RNA genome of approximately 30,000 nucleotides. Within this genome, 15 RNA elements were identified as conserved between SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we previously determined that these elements fold independently, in line with data from  in&#8208;vivo  and  ex&#8208;vivo  structural probing experiments. These elements contain non&#8208;base&#8208;paired regions that potentially harbour ligand&#8208;binding pockets. Here, we performed an NMR&#8208;based screening of a poised fragment library of 768 compounds for binding to these RNAs, employing three different  1  H&#8208;based 1D NMR binding assays. The screening identified common as well as RNA&#8208;element specific hits. The results allow selection of the most promising of the 15 RNA elements as putative drug targets. Based on the identified hits, we derive key functional units and groups in ligands for effective targeting of the RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>

The screening identified common as well as RNA-element specific hits. The results allow selection of the most promising of the 15 RNA elements as putative drug targets. Based on the identified hits, we derive key functional units and groups in ligands for effective targeting of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ru Nanoparticles Loaded Hollow Carbon Spheres as Nanoreactors for Hydrogenation of Levulinic Acid: Explicitly Recognizing the Void&#8208;Confinement Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a typical class of man&#8208;made nanoreactors, metal&#8208;loaded hollow carbon nanostructures (MHC nanoreactors) exhibit competitive potentials in the heterogeneous catalysis due to their tailorable microenvironment effects, in which the void&#8208;confinement effect is one of the most fundamental functions in boosting the catalytic performance. Herein this paper, Ru&#8208;loaded hollow carbon spheres are employed as nanoreactors with a crucial biomass hydrogenation process, levulinic acid (LA) hydrogenation into &#947;&#8208;valerolactone, as the probe reaction to further recognize the forming mechanism of this pivotal effect. We demonstrated that the void&#8208;confinement effect of the selected MHC nanoreactors is essentially driven by an integrating action of electronic metal&#8211;support interaction, reactant enrichment and diffusion, which are mainly ascribed to peculiar properties of hollow nanoreactors both in electronic and structural aspects, respectively. This work offers a distinct case for interpreting the catalytic behaviour of MHC nanoreactors, which could potentially promise broader insights into the microenvironment engineering strategies of hollow nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new stable donor/acceptor&#8208;supported Mn(I)&#8208;metallasilanone was synthesized. This silanone complex is highly strained because of its incorporation in a small cyclic structure formed by the intramolecular silanone&#8208;Mn(I) interaction. Thanks to the high ring strain, the interaction Si=O&#8208;&gt;Mn is labile, leading to an exceptionally high reactivity with various&#160;small molecules such as H  2  or ethylene gas in mild conditions</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene Ligands Enable Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Protoboration and Protosilylation of Terminal Alkynes: A Versatile Portal to Functionalized Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes represents a straightforward route to access alkenyl boronate and silane building blocks. In previously reported catalytic systems, high selectivity is achieved with a limited scope of substrates and/or reagents, with general solutions lacking. Herein, we describe a selective copper&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes that is facilitated by strongly donating cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands. Using this method, both alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted alkynes are coupled with a variety of boryl and silyl reagents with high &#945;&#8208;selectivity. The reaction is scalable, and the products are versatile intermediates that can participate in various downstream transformations. Preliminary mechanistic experiments shed light on the role of CAAC ligands in this process.</dc:description>
